	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, wheat and barley producers in western Canada 
should be given greater flexibility and more choices by amending the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act to include a special two year opting out provision for those farmers 
interested in developing niche export markets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, over the past two years, but more recently, 
I have followed up on my many discussions with farmers in my 
riding of Wild Rose. I questioned the farmers, asking what they 
wanted me to do. The result is this motion. The farmers are asking 
for the opportunity to opt out of the Canadian Wheat Board for a 
period of two years in order to see how marketing their niche 
produce goes.
<P>
	The question I put to the farmers was: ``Should farmers be 
allowed to opt out of the Canadian Wheat Board?'' and 835 said 
yes, 70 said no. That represents about 90 per cent of the returns. As 
well, I used information I picked up at different gatherings when I 
was talking to individual farmers at town halls. It was obvious to 
me that they desire this. They want the opportunity.
<P>
	As elected officials I believe we are obligated to give them that 
opportunity. As the representative for Wild Rose I put forward this 
motion with the idea that possibly they could have that opportunity.
<P>
	Let us make it perfectly clear right off the bat, before the 
Liberals send out any more documents from the Prime Minister's 
office, these 90 per cent or 835 farmers do not want to scrap the 
wheat board. Nor does the Reform Party of Canada want to scrap 
the wheat board. Let us make that perfectly clear before the 
Liberals send out any more of their dumb propaganda that tells the 
public what we are all about and it is not even close to the truth.
<P>
	Neither the Reform Party of Canada nor the farmers of Wild 
Rose want to see the wheat board scrapped. What they are asking 
for is freedom of choice. Freedom is something that a democratic 
society expects, something that producers across the land expect. 
Unless, of course, you are a western prairie farmer of wheat and 
barley. Then you must do as the government says or face the 
mighty, heavy hand of the law.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know what law I am talking about. It is the law 
that puts violent criminals into alternative measures programs, the 
law that allows bail for sex offenders the very same day they 
commit the offence, the law that allows bail for other violent 
crimes. It is the same law that puts a man behind bars without bail 
for selling his own product in violation of the law of the Canadian 
Wheat Board, literally throwing away the key, the heavy hand of 
the law.
<P>
	Clearly farmers across the prairies desire to have a choice in the 
way they market their grain. Clearly a plebiscite on the issue would 
be in order. The red book said there would be one. It has not 
happened though and most likely will not. After all, the results may 
turn out to be against what the agriculture minister believes. We 
could not have that now, could we? That is an obvious fact after the 
minister selected his hand-picked panel to study the issue of the 
wheat board. When some of its recommendations came back, if the 
minister did not agree with them, then that was that.
<P>
	It is well past time for this place and this government to start 
listening to the people of this land, the people whom we are 
supposed to serve and not dictate to. For nearly 30 years this place 
has continually ignored the wishes of the people and does what it 
wants. It uses dictatorial methods to continue to ram legislation 
down our throats. I am one Canadian who is getting tired of that 
kind of attitude. This place really needs an attitude adjustment. We 
need the kind of adjustment that would make things a little 
different.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	For example, if members listened to the Canadian people and 
paid attention to the petitions that land in this place, section 745 of 
the Criminal Code would disappear. But no, this place knows best, 
we always know best.
<P>
	Over the past 30 years things have been absolutely thrown into 
this House, debated and passed which have been dead against the 
wishes of the Canadian people. Think of the GST days. I could 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6338"> 6338 </A></B>
<P>
even go as far back as the  time the metric system was first brought 
in. Remember how the Canadian people felt about that? There are a 
number of measures I could mention. Rather than listening to the 
Canadian people and trying to implement legislation that is 
pleasing to them, we shove it down their throats.
<P>
	Many have said that those who support choice are young farmers 
who do not understand. Gordon Reed of Cremona, Alberta, Jack 
Morgan and Nels Eskenson of Sundre, Alberta along with scores of 
other long time farmers, those who began farming before there ever 
was a wheat board, are the very ones who tell me they want choice. 
They all stated that what was good in 1946 is not what is needed in 
1996, and they want some change.
<P>
	In 1993 when the open barley market was put in place, not only 
was there a tremendous upswing in the sales of barley by private 
entrepreneurs, but the board as well experienced an increase in 
sales and profits. Actually the competition was probably healthy 
for it. It got off its backside, went out and began to do a little 
selling, a little promoting, and it worked.
<P>
	Many niche producers are looking for buyers of their products 
and are finding markets for their specialty. One of these specialties 
is chemical free barley. These markets are not met by the buyers 
the board is aware of and have contact with. But these buyers do 
have a number of contacts with these niche producers and would 
very much like to purchase certified chemical free grains. Creating 
natural food for consumption would be their whole idea. There is a 
growing demand for that kind of product.
<P>
	No organic producer receives sales help from the wheat board so 
why should they not be allowed to search on their own? There are a 
number of good reasons why farmers as entrepreneurs should be 
able to seek out and sell to their own markets, and that is just one of 
them.
<P>
	When they go out, they work the land side by side with members 
of their families, and they try to produce something that they find is 
increasingly in demand. They try to meet the expectations of the 
buyers they have in mind who they were able to find on their own. 
Then they cannot sell them the product. It must go through the 
wheat board, and the best price they can expect from the wheat 
board are feed barley prices. It gets very discouraging. Many 
people who are out doing these very things are working for the 
livelihood of their families and are striving hard to save their farms 
from going under during tough times.
<P>
	It is time for the government to look at modern times, at the 
modern way of doing things. We would like to see the wheat board 
democratized. We have said that on many occasions and I will 
repeat it once again so there is no confusion on that side. We do not 
want to scrap the wheat board. No one in the Reform Party has ever 
said that, nor has it ever been part of our platform.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	We do need some changes. The wheat board needs to be more 
producer driven and more producer sensitive. We need to stop 
patronage appointments to those kinds of positions. An elected 
board is needed, one that is elected by the producers to serve the 
producers, to go out into the world to look for those new markets, 
not just the global market and whatever price is set by the global 
market, but to get out and do some work and search and find those 
kinds of markets that would benefit those people who are working 
so hard.
<P>
	We need a body of people who have open books and who are 
accountable to the people of Canada. I really find it strange that we 
can get no information whatsoever regarding revenues, costs, 
expenses and what is happening at the wheat board. It is an absolute 
closed society. If that is the norm of a democratic country, then we 
really need some changes.
<P>
	The Reform Party has tried in the past to make this kind of an 
item votable. There are criteria for what makes a private member's 
motion or bill a votable item. If the material that we submit 
regarding the motion or the bill follows the criteria right to the 
letter, follows it so that all 12 requirements to make it votable are in 
place, then it should be votable.
<P>
	There are members on both sides of the House who have 
introduced private member's bills and have come away wondering 
why their item has not been made a votable one. If the criteria and 
the regulations are in place and all the rules are followed, then it 
should be a votable item and we should be able to stand in this 
House to cast our votes on behalf of the people we represent.
<P>
	I have often wondered why that does not happen, that when these 
things do meet the criteria they still are not votable. There is only 
one conclusion we can come to. It is because of a few people sitting 
in the front row on that side of the House. If they decide something 
should or should not happen, then that is the way it is. That is 
democracy in this land.
<P>
	They will come into this place of debate, turn around and look at 
the 177 members on the benches behind them and tell them: ``This 
is the way you will vote. If you do not vote that way, we will kick 
you out of the party''. I am sure the Speaker knows what I am 
talking about. I also believe that when people are forced to do what 
they do not want to do with respect to the legislation that comes 
before this House, when they are not given an opportunity to have 
their say, that is not democracy.
<P>
	The agriculture minister has promised a plebiscite. Why has 
there not been one? Is it truly because the results will be 
unfavourable to what the government has already decided should 
happen?
<P>
	This place really needs an attitude adjustment. It is time we 
started listening to the people who pay us. It is  their money which 
brings us here. It is their money which lets us sit here to debate 
these issues. It is their money which helps us to decide what we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6339"> 6339 </A></B>
<P>
should do on their behalf. Consequently we come out of here 
making decisions daily on what we think is best and ignore their 
wishes completely. That has to change.
<P>
	I would like to give the members of this House an opportunity 
today to change that attitude, to give the people of Canada and the 
prairie farmers of western Canada the opportunity to truly be 
entrepreneurs so that they can sell their products in the market 
which is best for them and have the freedom to do it. We could do 
that by making this a votable motion and giving every member of 
this House an opportunity to truly represent what Canadians would 
like to see. It is with that thought in mind and with the consent of 
the House I would ask that this motion be made votable.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the member for Wild Rose 
has moved that this motion be votable. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent. 
Accordingly, we will resume debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the premise of 
this motion is that the Canadian Wheat Board and the legislation it 
supports lack flexibility and cannot serve the best interests of its 
clients. The record does not support that premise. It is a retread of a 
previous motion that was brought forward in June. The premise is 
flawed.
<P>
	The purpose of a two-year opting out provision contained in 
today's motion appears to be a return to the motion made in June by 
the hon. member and his colleagues. I would suggest that the letter 
of this motion does not match its spirit if, as the hon. member's 
motion suggests, this desire is an outcome that produces benefits 
for producers when what we are talking about is consensus and 
careful actions.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board has demonstrated a desire to expand 
its accountability to farmers. In return the board and the marketing 
system it maintains enjoy the support of a clear majority of our 
primary producers. This support is not unconditional. It reflects the 
commitment of the Canadian Wheat Board to improve service and 
organizational renewal. These efforts will be aided by the 
government.
<P>
	We are taking steps to ensure that the Canadian Wheat Board 
keeps pace with the needs of its clients. As set out by the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food in his October 7, 1996 policy 
statement, the government aims to renew and strengthen the wheat 
board.
<P>
	There will be changes to the management of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. A board of directors will be  appointed by the government in 
1997 and that group will have a majority of producer 
representatives. This interim body will give way to elected 
members in 1998 which will also have a producer majority.
<P>
	The necessary amendments to the legislation are expected to be 
tabled in the House before the Christmas break. With these changes 
the future mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board can be adjusted in 
a democratic fashion according to the preferences of prairie grain 
farmers. The way the board does business will also be improved 
with changes designed to make price systems more flexible, 
payment processes quicker, a change on the bottom line so to 
speak.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion also speaks of developing niche 
markets for grain. Talk of such niche markets must begin with the 
recognition that markets are inherently unpredictable, more so 
when there are no stable influences in those markets such as those 
provided by a single desk seller. We cannot discuss niches without 
reference to the large markets and the forces that shape those 
markets.
<P>
	The presence of the Canadian Wheat Board has meant price 
stability and security of markets. The potential of niches for 
individual producers nowadays is traceable in no small part to the 
work of the board on behalf of the wider community of producers.
<P>
	One might argue that the business environment in grain markets 
achieved through the Canadian Wheat Board has contributed to the 
potential of niche markets. It has also ironically led to the mistaken 
view taken by some of the board's harsher critics that the board is 
an obstacle. It certainly is not. The Canadian Wheat Board actually 
pursues many niche markets throughout the world.
<P>
	There is a real possibility that having both a single desk 
marketing system in the form of the Canadian Wheat Board and the 
arrangement envisioned by the proponents on the right to opt out of 
the system may actually deliver the worst of both worlds to our 
producers. We would have a wheat board with reduced leverage in 
the marketplace and thus greater exposure to producers to violate 
market forces that can drive down prices and drive down profits for 
all Canadian farmers.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The message from farmers themselves is clear: You may be able 
to opt out of the wheat board system but you will not be able to opt 
out of the consequences that could result in harsh action. What is to 
be done in the marketplace is not easily undone or turned about. 
Returning to the benefits of a proven marketing system is not 
assured once you have been given the problems that could exist 
with two marketing systems.
<P>
	Furthermore, the pursuit of opportunities by a few may reduce 
the opportunities of the many. That is plainly going to be a concern 
of those who make their livelihood  producing grain in Canada. In 
some ideal world we can wish for perfect win-win situations but we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6340"> 6340 </A></B>
<P>
do not live in such a world. If the pursuit of alternative marketing 
arrangements by the minority determines or diminishes the 
benefits of single desk selling for the majority, then it is not a 
win-win situation, it is a lose-lose situation.
<P>
	Long before the hon. member offered this motion for debate 
today, before he was even a member of this House, the Canadian 
Wheat Board took the initiative of evaluating itself and its 
operations, demonstrating a flexibility that we can applaud. 
Certainly the wheat board has always been committed to providing 
the best possible service for western Canadian grain farmers. In 
recent years that commitment has led to some very critical 
re-examination and re-evaluation.
<P>
	In recent years the board has reviewed its operation and 
management structures in order to improve its long term planning, 
budgeting, management and reporting systems. In addition it has 
also introduced a new system of performance evaluation. It would 
have been enough for some, had the wheat board stopped there, to 
say that the Canadian Wheat Board was neither complacent nor 
unwilling to meet the challenges of the changing times, but as the 
House knows, the wheat board undertook further measures.
<P>
	The board now conducts an ongoing department by department 
audit of its expenditures. It has expanded the information it 
provides to its producer clients. It has also emphasized direct 
contact between its staff and clients. The men and women on the 
prairies who produce wheat and barley are better informed today. 
At its most fundamental level, these people are the western 
Canadian grain farmers and the western Canadian grain industry 
itself.
<P>
	Over the past few years new services have been provided to these 
women and men on the prairies, new services such as pool return 
outlooks and price forecasting, new market development initiatives 
and business tools for enhanced risk management. The board has 
also strengthened its worldwide business information networks and 
opened a new office in the People's Republic of China.
<P>
	In summary, the Canadian Wheat Board has met the test of 
organized managing in tumultuous times. It has adapted, adopted 
and improved in order to provide the best possible service for its 
clients. The board and its management have made great strides in 
meeting the needs of its clients and the challenges of global 
markets in the late 20th century. All this has been accomplished 
within the existing legal framework of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Amending the act is necessary in certain ways to put the 
Canadian Wheat Board on an even better business footing and to 
meet the demands of the western Canadian grain farmers for more 
accountable management. This can easily be distinguished from 
the kind of amendment contained in the hon. member's motion 
which does not contribute to the modernization of the wheat board. 
This motion also fails to meet the test of proposing change that has 
broad base support among the western Canadian grain farmers and 
that can dramatically improve sales of wheat and barley to its 
customers.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	The motion put forth by the hon. member for Wild Rose does not 
recognize the flexibility and benefits of both the Canadian Wheat 
Board and the legislation underlying it. I do not share his 
presumption. I choose to support the farmers and the institutions 
and reject the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> I welcome this 
opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to speak on the motion put forward by 
the hon. member for the Reform Party, who persists in advocating a 
provision that would allow producers to opt out of the Canadian 
Wheat Board for two years.
<P>
	What baffles me, however, is the fact that my hon. colleague still 
does not understand plain common sense. I recall speaking on this 
issue in this House on June 19. The hon. member for the Reform 
Party was probably away on that day. And he obviously does not 
read <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	For the last time, I sincerely hope that the Reformers will realize 
that it is not a good idea to allow Canadian wheat and barley 
producers to opt out for a period of two years. This is not the first 
time that the Reformers have taken a stand against the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I talked about this on June 19. This is starting to look 
like sheer stubbornness.
<P>
	The Reformers are at such a loss for new issues to make political 
hay with that they are rehashing an old matter that has already been 
debated in this House. It was discussed last June. Why are they 
coming back with this two-year opting-out proposal or provision 
for western producers? I can understand that the Reformers feel 
that a general election is coming and realizing that they are not very 
popular. They are trying to make political hay with this clause.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is the institutional embodiment of a 
marketing system developed to help producers. The pooling of 
resources through the Canadian Wheat Board ensures that 
producers receive the same initial payments year round. As for the 
final payment, it is designed to reflect the value set by the market 
during a given crop year. This means that the pool price is 
representative of the price variations.
<P>
	There is a whole system in place to calculate prices depending on 
the grain category, thereby easing-fortunately for western 
produc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6341"> 6341 </A></B>
<P>
ers-fluctuations, some of which are linked to foreign competition. 
The hon. members of the third party have short memories. In the 
1980s, western grain producers definitely benefited from the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	After certain pools accumulated huge deficits, the federal 
government came to the rescue. Now some producers are smelling 
business opportunities. I realize that some want to market their 
products themselves, outside the board's jurisdiction, because they 
want to get more. However, when times become hard again, they 
will be happy to be part of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	In a way, Reformers want to eliminate a system which works 
relatively well, for the benefit of a small group of western 
producers. Producers that would elect to take advantage of this 
opting out provision would be allowed to leave the Canadian 
Wheat Board for a period of two years. However, after this 
two-year period, will producers be able to rejoin or, for that matter, 
will they have to rejoin the Canadian Wheat Board? Who will 
monitor the process and how? This new system would make it very 
difficult for the board to fulfill its mandate.
<P>
	The objective is to stabilize prices and set a median price, in 
spite of market cycles. Everyone is looking for stability, but the 
Reformers would turn the whole thing into a big mess. It would 
indeed be the case, should the Canadian Wheat Board disappear, 
because western producers would suffer major losses of income. 
They would no longer have any protection.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	As you know, no one can predict the future. Who can say what 
the supply and demand in a given region of the world will be? The 
proposal of the hon. member for Wild Rose would undermine the 
principles of price pooling and risk reduction, while creating a 
parallel marketing system.
<P>
	The Reform member and his colleagues will probably insist that 
they are following up on the producers' request. In my opinion, this 
is only a small group of producers who are either dissatisfied or 
who want to make more money. It is tempting for producers located 
along the Canada-U.S. border to sell their crops directly to the 
Americans and to get paid immediately.
<P>
	Indeed, it is very tempting and this is why some producers want 
to go it alone. However, the wind might turn. Economic conditions, 
fluctuations and many other factors can, at any time, change the 
whole situation. Going that route would be tantamount to playing 
Russian roulette, and the consequences could be just as tragic.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board must be maintained, because it is a 
good instrument for western producers. The board has already 
demonstrated its usefulness. It may not be perfect, but nothing 
keeps us from improving it. For example, producers could be 
granted more control over the board's operations, or the board 
could be given more room to maneuver.
<P>
	The proposal by the member for Wild Rose would undo many 
years of work by the industry towards maximizing profits from the 
sale of wheat. The introduction of a provision allowing producers 
to opt out of the marketing system for two years would seriously 
undermine the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The board has been in existence for 61 years. Over that period of 
time there have obviously been many changes and marketing has 
undergone a considerable transformation. However, the 
fundamental task continues to be one of selling a quality product 
and offering clients outstanding service, while maximizing profits 
for western producers. One thing remains unchanged, and that is 
that grain marketing is just as risky a venture today as it was in 
1935 when the Canadian Wheat Board was set up.
<P>
	Back then, producers had to contend with price fluctuations 
caused by World War II, while today's producers, like all their 
fellow producers, have no influence over world prices.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board continues to provide producers with 
a means of managing risk and a system for ensuring equity among 
grain producers. The approach is the same as that used in other 
agricultural sectors.
<P>
	Once again, the motion by the member for Wild Rose must be 
rejected, and I hope members of the Reform Party will change their 
minds.
<P>
	I think it would make more sense if we talked about creating 
jobs. Has any thought been given to the jobs that could be created 
with the money that would be saved by abolishing the Senate? I 
hope that my colleagues in this House are finally going to talk 
about the real problems, and about job creation. The dignity of 
thousands of the young and the not so young is at stake.
<P>
	Many of the inhabitants of my riding are looking for jobs. Many 
have looked in vain. As recently as yesterday, November 17, one of 
my constituents said that his unemployment insurance benefits had 
melted away like snow on a warm day, leaving him with little 
choice but to go on welfare, although he is in good health and wants 
to work.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	I am sure I am not the only member who hears from people 
looking for work. This is a situation affecting a good many 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	I trust that we will move on to the topic of jobs in this House in 
the very near future. In the meantime, I thank you for your 
attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be speaking today in support of the motion presented by 
the hon. member for Wild Rose:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6342"> 6342 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, wheat and barley producers in western Canada 
should be given greater flexibility and more choices by amending the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act to include a special two year opting out provision for those farmers 
interested in developing niche export markets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I thank the hon. member for bringing this up. I am not saying this 
is necessarily the only way we can deal with the end of the 
Canadian Wheat Board monopoly, which is what many farmers are 
asking for. But this certainly is one alternative that should be 
debated. Before I get into that debate I will comment on some of 
the comments by the hon. member from the Bloc who just spoke.
<P>
	He asked why we were not debating something important. I have 
barley in the bin and out in the filed to be sold right now. To me this 
issue is important. I have neighbours who have barley in the field 
and barley to be sold. To them this issue is very important. In fact, 
to thousands and thousands of western Canadian farmers this issue 
is very important.
<P>
	I have come to know the hon. member from the Bloc and I have 
gained some respect for him over the past three years, but I find it 
absolutely unbelievable that he would brush this issue off as an 
issue that is not important. It is important. It is important to many 
western Canadian farmers.
<P>
	Back to the motion at hand, I would like to ask some questions. 
For example, why is the minister of agriculture denying farmers a 
third option on the ballot that will give farmers a chance to speak in 
the plebiscite promised by the minister?
<P>
	In this plebiscite only two options are offered to farmers. I will 
read the questions and make clear what these two options are. Then 
I will talk about a third option which should be on the ballot. The 
first option is the open market option which is stated as follows: 
``Remove all barley, both feed and malting food, from the 
Canadian Wheat Board and place it entirely on the open market for 
all domestic and export sales''. That is the first option and that is 
the wording the minister will use to present this option.
<P>
	The second option is the single seller option: ``Maintain the 
Canadian Wheat Board as a single desk seller for all barley, both 
feed and malting food, with the continuing exception of feed barley 
sold domestically''.
<P>
	Those options are two out of the three options that should be on 
this ballot. Unfortunately the minister has denied western Canadian 
farmers the option that a vast majority of them would choose. I 
know this not only from polling I have done on my own, not only 
from the polling of other Reform members in their own 
constituencies, but from other polls that have been commissioned 
on this issue. Poll after poll has shown that a majority of Canadian 
farmers if given the choice would choose the dual marketing option 
or the voluntary board option, call it what you like.
<P>
	In a plebiscite held in Alberta about a year ago, when the 
question was put to western Canadian farmers, two-thirds of the 
farmers in Alberta chose the voluntary board or the dual marketing 
option.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	This issue has been decided in Alberta already. It should be put 
to plebiscite for the benefit of farmers in Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba. However, let us present the option that farmers would 
choose. What kind of nonsense is this, offering only two options 
which will split western Canadian farmers and pit family against 
family? Only asking the two questions will do that.
<P>
	How will farmers handle having only the two options presented? 
I cannot say for sure but I can make a pretty good guess. My guess 
is that farmers, on recognizing that the dual marketing option is not 
available, may choose the open market option. In that case the 
wheat board will no longer be handling barley sales at all. That is 
not what I want, that is not what other Reform MPs want and it is 
not what farmers across western Canada want. They want the 
freedom to choose to market their barley through the Canadian 
Wheat Board, through a pooling system, or to market it on their 
own or through a private grain company. That is the third option 
which is not on the ballot of the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	I am afraid, because that option is not on the ballot, that farmers 
in western Canada might be denied the pooling option, an option 
which I know some of them want. That is nonsense.
<P>
	Why did the minister not put this third option on the ballot? I 
cannot answer that question for sure but it concerns me greatly that 
he did not offer it. Would not the proper way to handle this issue be 
to present the three options? The reason the minister of agriculture 
gives for not putting that voluntary board or dual marketing option 
on the plebiscite is that it would not work. Would not the proper 
way to handle this issue be to put it on the ballot and to have a 
debate across western Canada? The minister, the wheat board and 
other people who argue that a dual marketing system would not 
work could debate that option. They could say: ``We do not think 
that option would work for these reasons''. That is a point of 
debate.
<P>
	On the other hand, I could argue that it would work and that is 
what I would do during the debate leading up to the plebiscite. I 
would argue that in fact the Canadian Wheat Board, when it was set 
up, was a voluntary board. The dual marketing system was in place 
from the time the board was first set up in the twenties and 
re-established in the thirties. The voluntary board or the dual 
marketing option was only taken away from farmers under the War 
Measures Act in 1943. That was done so the Canadian government 
could obtain for the war effort grain at the lowest price possible. 
Canadian farmers allowed that because they wanted to help with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6343"> 6343 </A></B>
<P>
the war.  They were promised compensation later which they never 
received.
<P>
	Why do we still have a monopoly situation today when it was 
only put in place under the War Measures Act? It is to get cheap 
grain. I would argue in the debate leading up to the plebiscite that 
the dual market system worked well before the monopoly was put 
in place and that it would work well now.
<P>
	I want to make it as clear as I can that I favour keeping the 
Canadian Wheat Board. It is very useful. However, I favour giving 
farmers a choice. Surely in country like this no one could argue 
seriously that farmers who put all of the money, the sweat and the 
work into producing their grain should not have the freedom to 
choose how to market that grain. Yet, that is what the government 
and the minister are arguing against all common sense. It makes no 
sense whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	I have so much that I want to say on this issue, but I see that my 
time is coming to a close. However, if I may, I would like to again 
make it clear what I am arguing for here.
<P>
	The hon. member for Wild Rose is asking that farmers be given 
the chance to opt out over a two-year period. It is one way of 
ending the wheat board monopoly. But there are other ways the 
monopoly could be ended and make it work effectively.
<P>
	One way would be to offer deferred delivery contracts such as 
that which grain companies now offer to farmers, unlike the 
Canadian Wheat Board contracts that are in place now which do not 
guarantee a price for the commodity and do not guarantee delivery 
by a certain date. It is a one-sided contract.
<P>
	The deferred delivery contract which farmers use for canola, 
peas, or other crops of choice, stipulates that farmers will deliver a 
certain number of bushels or tonnes of the commodity to a 
specified delivery point for such a price on such a date. The grain 
company promises to take delivery at the specified price, 
destination and date. That is another way to end the monopoly of 
the board.
<P>
	A third way is by offering contracts, committing a certain 
number of tonnes or bushels to the board so that the board would 
know exactly what it will be working with before the actual 
marketing. That commitment can be made some time in advance 
and staged in. That is another way to deal with the issue. Give 
farmers a choice. I cannot believe that the government in good 
conscience can continue to deny farmers the choice on how to 
market their grain.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to again thank the hon. member for Wild 
Rose for his motion and say that I support it as one way to deal with 
ending the monopoly of the wheat board. I also point out that there 
are other ways of  dealing with the situation. I say very clearly that 
a voluntary board has worked before, a dual marketing system has 
worked before, and it will work again. I ask the minister to examine 
this again.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the context of 
debating the motion before the House, it is worth remembering the 
consultation process that preceded the report of the western grain 
marketing panel.
<P>
	The report was presented to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food on July 2, 1996 after much direct consultation, 
independent research and careful deliberation. The panel produced 
a brochure that described the current grain marketing system and 
outlined some of the major related issues. This was distributed to 
over 200,000 farmers, organizations and industry representatives in 
December 1995. This information was only the first step in an 
extensive dialogue.
<P>
	The panel then provided a number of avenues for interested 
individuals and groups to review the grain marketing system and 
they were able able to put forward their views and offer suggestions 
for changes in the marketing system. Clearly the panel made good 
on its commitment to foster an atmosphere of fairness and 
impartiality in which people could meet to discuss the future of the 
grain marketing system.
<P>
	As part of the consultation exercise that was the most extensive 
in the history of the industry, a series of 15 town hall meetings was 
held across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. I attended two of 
those meetings in my home province of Manitoba, one in Brandon 
and one in my home town of Grandview which is in my riding of 
Dauphin-Swan River. It was in this kind of forum that farmers 
and other concerned people gave their perspective on both the 
current marketing system for western Canadian grain and 
alternative arrangements. The panel also held hearings in 
Winnipeg, Regina and Edmonton where individuals and 
organizations made formal presentations. In 12 days of hearings 
the panel heard 69 briefs. There were also 78 written submissions 
from individuals and organizations that did not appear before the 
panel during its hearings.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	As well, to help in its assessment of the grain marketing system, 
its institutions and the economic environment in which this 
important industry operates, the panel contracted consultants to 
produce six major reports.
<P>
	Clearly the western grain marketing panel made a valuable 
contribution in facilitating an important debate concerning the 
future of the Canadian Wheat Board and the grain marketing 
system. Key issues were explored and the panel's recommenda-
<P>

<B><A NAME="6344"> 6344 </A></B>
<P>
tions were added to the input  received by the government from 
producers and other interested parties. Taken together, this input 
has helped the government chart its course concerning the future of 
the board.
<P>
	The government supports the way the Canadian Wheat Board 
has evolved into a body where key decisions affecting farmers in 
this industry have been made by the farmers themselves and are 
based on a consensus which they themselves built. At the same 
time the government is proposing to the future modernization of 
the administrative structure of the board, to make its operations 
more flexible and effective and to put more power in the hands of 
primary producers.
<P>
	The policy statement issued by the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food on October 7, 1996 calls for a board of directors for the 
Canadian Wheat Board to be appointed by the government in 1997, 
a board with a farmer majority. By 1998 directors will be directly 
elected by farmers. This proposal reflects the common goal of both 
the western grain marketing panel and the government, providing 
western Canadian farmers with the best ways and means to achieve 
the maximum possible benefits for their industry.
<P>
	To help the board better serve its clients, new legislation to be 
introduced shortly will also enable the board to use its financial 
resources in a more business-like manner. This will permit the 
board and farmers more flexibility in financial dealings. 
Specifically, payments to farmers will be easier to make and 
quicker to deliver. This promotes a better business environment for 
the industry. Avoidable bottlenecks and other delays in doing 
business with and on behalf of farmers can be removed to 
everyone's benefit.
<P>
	Once the new governance structure is in place, the government 
will be able to look to the Canadian Wheat Board's board of 
directors for guidance on issues regarding the industry. In the 
meantime the government has committed itself to a producer vote 
on the subject of the marketing system for barley.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has clearly said that 
he has heard from farm groups on how to formulate the question 
and a voter eligibility list. The aim is to ask farmers a clear 
question on the marketing of barley. It will be an important choice 
because the future of the industry will be shaped in this process. 
Again, this follows the route of a broad consultation instead of 
pre-empting debate.
<P>
	During the western grain marketing panel consultations, farmers 
demonstrated a strong desire to shape their industry themselves. 
The motion before the House today proposes a different route, one 
that I believe should be rejected. It pre-empts a wider consultation 
on a very important issue and proposes to make an important 
choice over the heads of farmers.
<P>
	I strongly oppose this motion. It undercuts the strengths of the 
Canadian Wheat Board as well as the credibility of prairie grain
<P>
farmers. This motion clearly illustrates the extremist views of the 
third party of this House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As there are no other members rising to 
debate, the hon. member for Wild Rose is entitled to get up and 
resume the debate if he so wishes. May we call it twelve o'clock?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the evolving situation in the Great Lakes region of 
Africa and of Canada's leadership role in the international community's efforts to 
alleviate human suffering in the region.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the 
honourable Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Reform 
Party, the leader of the New Democratic Party and the leader of the 
Conservative Party for their co-operation during last week's 
discussions on the urgency of the situation in Zaire. This is 
certainly a great example of how the members of this Parliament 
work together to ensure a unified position with respect to the very 
serious crisis unfolding in that part of the world. We are certainly 
most interested in the debates that will be held in the coming days 
in order to determine the direction and the initiatives to be taken 
with respect to the missions to Zaire, and also to ensure that the 
voices of each party in this Parliament, which represents the 
Canadian people, are heard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of this is to bring before Parliament the resolution 
seeking support for the Canadian initiative in eastern Zaire and the 
surrounding regions.
<P>
	It was about eight days ago when the entire world, including all 
Canadians, recognized that we stood on the precipice of one of the 
most tragic human disasters the world has ever faced. Millions of 
people were sitting in eastern Zaire without any food, sustenance or 
support. There was enormous potential for the whole crisis to 
develop into a situation of huge significance, not just in the region 
but for everyone. The prospect of a humanitarian disaster shook us 
all.
<P>
	In the circumstances, a week ago Saturday the Prime Minister, 
consulting with a number of other world leaders, took an initiative 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6345"> 6345 </A></B>
<P>
in line with what we believe is the long Canadian tradition of 
involvement as a major peacekeeper to stop the stalemate, to 
change the inertia that was taking place at an international level. 
There was a need for political will to take place.
<P>
	We have learned, as we have gone through these new kinds of 
crises in the last several years, that the resources are there, the 
capacity is there and the institutions are there, but what is often 
missing is the political will. Last weekend the Prime Minister 
supplied that missing ingredient and took the initiative to begin 
mobilizing the world community.
<P>
	Since then, of course, events have taken place rapidly. We were 
able to bring together a coalition of a number of countries prepared 
to offer direct assistance for a multinational force which would 
provide a secure environment within eastern Zaire to ensure that 
any humanitarian aid could be effectively delivered and at the same 
time to support and facilitate the voluntary repatriation and 
movement of refugees back to their homes in Rwanda.
<P>
	In addition to that, political support had to be mobilized at the 
United Nations to get the right kind of resolution. Without going 
into the long history, although it was just a short time ago, Canada 
took the lead in this important international coalition building. 
Canada was able to garner the support of a number of countries 
which were prepared to commit and to mobilize political support at 
the United Nations. On the weekend just past we were able to 
obtain the full endorsement of the United Nations security council.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I want to give my vote of appreciation to the leaders of each of 
the respective other parties in the House. I spoke to them last week 
to explain the kind of urgency and the quick changing 
circumstances we faced. We received both their basic support and 
willingness to wait until the House returned on Monday to have a 
full debate which we are committed to. I want to thank them very 
much for signifying and expressing their own commitment during 
this very tumultuous period this past week.
<P>
	We now see that the situation has changed. We should take 
enormous satisfaction that one of the major objectives that was set 
out just a short week ago was to ensure that the large masses of 
refugees held in camps and who had been a part of that system for 
the last two years are now on the move. The dramatic pictures we 
see every night on television clearly demonstrate that one of the 
major objectives has already in large part been achieved.
<P>
	One of the contributing reasons, one of the factors that unlocked 
or triggered that movement was that in the past week our own 
country took on the responsibility of organizing the international 
community. The international community's presence that would 
soon be felt became a strong and compelling influence in terms of 
that massive movement that we now witness daily. In part we can 
take a certain amount of satisfaction that the job is already under 
way, but we should also recognize the job is not yet over.
<P>
	At last report there are still hundreds of thousands of refugees in 
eastern Zaire. We hope that they will be able to join the movement 
that was started on the weekend, but at this point in time there is no 
way of knowing. We are still trying to assess the information 
intelligence with regard to the refugees in the southern part of Zaire 
around the area of Bukavu. The objectives still remain and they 
have the UN security resolution force behind them to ensure that 
humanitarian assistance is given. At the same time we are able to 
support and facilitate the continual resettlement of refugees back 
into their home communes.
<P>
	In this case we still stay committed as the Canadian government 
on behalf of the Canadian people to do whatever is necessary to 
meet the current needs. We continue to support these developments 
and provide any resource necessary to not only ensure the 
application of humanitarian aid but to look at the broader question 
of peace building in the region so that we will not have a 
reoccurrence, that the same problems will not visit us again a year 
or two down the road and to begin working for longer term 
settlements of the root causes of the problems.
<P>
	We seek the support of Parliament today for the initiative of 
Canada as we seek to find the most effective and useful ways in 
which we can respond to the humanitarian crisis in Rwanda and 
Zaire.
<P>
	To put this into context and why I think this is particularly 
important as a juncture point in debate, we have witnessed since the 
ending of the cold war several years ago the emergence of not 
uniform global peace but a new kind of conflict, low intensity 
conflicts, often internal conflicts, but which have a nasty way of 
spilling over their boundaries, creating enormous repercussions in 
their own regions around the world at great cost to life and 
resources in those regions and for which we all bear the burden. It 
is the new kind of world we live in.
<P>
	As we begin to learn our lessons day by day, week by week, as 
we go through each of these conflicts, we now begin to apply those 
lessons in an effective way. If we do not do so we will see the 
continuing cycles of violence, the targeting of whole communities 
one against the another, the ugly words that appear in our 
vocabulary, ethnic cleansing and genocide, that have become all 
too common in our parlance.
<P>
	We have to continue to be cognizant of the enormous despair of 
hundreds of thousands of civilians who are the victims of these 
conflicts, the women and children who bear the brunt and who 
often are the most vulnerable and cannot protect themselves 
against these kinds of internal conflicts, faction fights and the 
enormous violence we have witnessed for so long.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6346"> 6346 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Clearly, traditional responses are not enough. The lessons we 
acquired in our diplomatic, political and military textbooks on the 
cold war do not apply to the new situations.
<P>
	One of the first lessons we learned is that these internal conflicts 
are ``not a family matter''. Given their effect on international 
security as a whole, given the widespread consequences brought 
about by these matters, as we have seen just in the past week, it is 
incumbent on and the responsibility of the international community 
to find the appropriate response.
<P>
	We cannot use narrow national interests as an excuse for inaction 
or delay. It is a matter for all common humanity. I believe that is 
the will of Canadians to serve as a steward in that cause of 
humanity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Prime Minister went to the core of the issue last week when 
he said that no one can remain indifferent to the suffering in eastern 
Zaire, no one can close his eyes to the consequences. If the world 
community does not act, more than a million lives will be at stake.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think that summarizes basically why we have taken the role and 
the leadership that we have.
<P>
	Third, we have learned that what is basically required is no 
longer the singular responses of just military force or political 
action. We now have to find an integrated, strategic, 
comprehensive way of melding political, military and 
humanitarian efforts so that there is a complete and total response, 
that we are able to be flexible and provide adaptations, that we can 
no longer simply go by the old guidebooks.
<P>
	We now must find notions of combining peacekeeping in its 
traditional form as established by Michael Pearson many years ago 
but also with a new concept of peace building, how we work into 
post-conflict situations to have stabilized communities.
<P>
	The medical community has a good word for it, triage. If you are 
a casualty in a traffic accident and you come to the hospital, they do 
not immediately perform the operation. They stabilize the vital 
signs. They make sure the blood is pumping. They make sure the 
body is warm and things are stabilized before they can start the 
treatment and the cure. One of the new lessons we have learned and 
the required lessons is to begin seeing how we can provide that 
triage in these new kinds of international conflicts.
<P>
	Specifically as it applies to Zaire, we face a situation that 
challenges all these lessons that we have learned in this new 
conflict situation, how to provide innovative responses to the new 
kinds of humanitarian crises. I think we have already shown one 
important lesson and that is to quickly and effectively use political 
will and mobilization to bring the international community toward 
finding a solution.
<P>
	I would recommend to all members, if they have the time, to 
read a dramatic report that was issued after the Rwanda conflict 
which stated that the missing link that led to the genocide was a 
lack of political will at the international level. That will was 
supplied over the past week. I am pleased to say that it was the 
Canadian Prime Minister who provided that basic sense of 
commitment and engagement to make it happen.
<P>
	As a result, the scope of the disaster has been substantially 
reduced. However, we now have to make adaptations. We are now 
seeing the vast movement of refugees coming across the border as 
a consequence of that galvanizing of the international area. 
However, there is still an urgent need for humanitarian assistance 
to sustainable solutions.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister for International Co-operation, will 
be addressing in more detail how on the humanitarian side we can 
begin to support work by the various international agencies and 
care groups that are involved in that region.
<P>
	We must be prepared to continue to do what we can to ensure 
that there is continued security. At the present moment we are 
gathering the information intelligence, working with our allies, 
working with the African states, the Europeans and the Americans 
to ensure that in eastern Zaire itself that as the problem begins to be 
resolved, we also do not see remaining pockets where there is still 
continued violence, insecurity or instability.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	We are beginning to look at how we can meet the objectives but 
perhaps use a different mix of tools. I hope members of Parliament 
will be prepared to work with us in developing that ongoing 
adaptation and adjustment as we move into new fields.
<P>
	I welcome the response of members of Parliament on the 
usefulness of setting up regular joint meetings of the defence and 
foreign affairs committees. Then we can constantly brief members 
of Parliament from all parties, get their responses and build them in 
as part of our ongoing policy making and our response mechanism. 
I put that proposal out and I hope the spokespersons for the 
opposition parties will indicate whether they would be prepared to 
engage in that kind of ongoing parliamentary dialogue.
<P>
	To make sure we have it, Canadian military personnel are now in 
Rwanda. General Baril will arrive there within hours to do the 
major reconnaissance. They will help to give us a much better 
understanding of the situation in the region and how that will affect 
our deployment plans.
<P>
	The consultations I talked about are intensifying. There will be a 
major planning session in Stuttgart within two days which will 
bring together all the donor nations. We are in constant contact and 
have been over the weekend with a number of the key players, with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6347"> 6347 </A></B>
<P>
those who are prepared to donate and contribute to the force and 
with those who represent the African states.
<P>
	I will be meeting with the ambassadors of the African states later 
today to engage them in the same kind of consultation and response 
so we can calibrate and tailor our responses to fit the needs, 
because that is our primary objective. We have also asked our 
Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa to visit Africa. She 
is on her way now to visit certain African capitals, to consult again 
with the key African states about what they think would be the 
appropriate response.
<P>
	It is a continuing involvement. We on behalf of Canadians want 
to ensure we have the capacity and are in the position to offer the 
leadership that was initiated last weekend by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	We must now recognize that a conversion is taking place. The 
movement of refugees in its own way is a source of enormous 
satisfaction. It is beginning to deal with one of the root causes of 
the problem, but there are still issues to face down the road. There 
is the longer term question of the resettlement of the refugees back 
into Rwanda. The millions of people now returning to their 
homelands have to be given basic support and sustenance.
<P>
	We have to ensure there is proper monitoring in that area so the 
communities can come together, so there can be reconciliation and 
development in those areas. That will also involve a continuing 
ongoing commitment of the international community. We will do 
our part and offer whatever leadership is required to help deal with 
those kinds of issues and develop responses.
<P>
	Last weekend in Paris during a meeting on Bosnia I engaged 
several of my counterparts as foreign ministers about how we can 
begin to think through those longer term responses and how we can 
begin to develop an effective international response to that 
changing condition.
<P>
	The United Nations Security Council has also recognized very 
clearly the need for a follow-up force. Planning is already under 
way for a second phase as to how we should maintain a system of 
stability to ensure the problems do not recur. There is a lesson out 
of the past situations in Rwanda, Somalia and other areas. If we 
simply say that the immediate crisis is over and that we can now 
walk away, then we are bound to face a recurrence of the problem 
within months or years.
<P>
	For that reason the United Nations has special envoy 
Ambassador Chrétien working in the region not only to deal with 
the immediate questions of negotiation about the humanitarian 
crisis but to make recommendations that will be used by the United 
Nations, ourselves and other countries to begin planning that 
longer term response. Again we can take some satisfaction in 
having  received a call from the United Nations with a request that 
Canada find a proper envoy. We all admire enormously the work of 
Ambassador Chrétien. There is no one better suited for the task in 
the work he is doing there to provide international leadership at this 
crucial time.
<P>
	In addition to those direct initiatives, I put forward another idea 
in a speech I gave about three weeks ago at York University. I am 
sure all members read it as soon as it came off the press.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The need for a peace building strategy by Canada was put 
forward. It is a need to begin to look differently at some of these 
kinds of problems; that within our own resources and our own 
political capacity, how we can provide support for countries 
emerging out of conflict; how we can provide the ability to help 
them stabilize so that the problems do not return with frequency.
<P>
	The issue of Zaire is a good example of how peace building, a 
rapid, integrated, multifaceted response on the civilian side is as 
important as the rapid multifaceted response on the military side. 
We now have to find a forum for the same kind of effectiveness by 
the civilian peacekeeping side, which we now call peace building, 
as we have had on the military side.
<P>
	This means providing assistance to re-establish the rule of law. It 
means supporting political reconciliation, including the issue of 
human rights, particularly minority rights. It means developing 
confidence building measures between the groups and factions that 
have been in conflict, designed to defuse tensions on the borders, 
across the borders and among people within those borders.
<P>
	It means securing an environment so that the continued 
humanitarian assistance and rebuilding can take place. People 
cannot go about rebuilding their lives if they are worried that they 
will be attacked at any moment. That is why one major 
commitment we have made in places like Haiti is to provide 
training and support for the establishment of national police forces 
using public accountability and a sense of transparency so that 
those countries can begin to acquire that sense of security.
<P>
	It means the massive problem of resettlement and reintegration 
of refugees and displaced persons and the reconstruction of a 
political and civil society in many of these countries. That is the 
new notion of peace building: how to use our own experiences as a 
country which has learned how to build bridges across boundaries; 
a country which has learned how to build a linkage between groups 
with different languages and different backgrounds; how to use the 
experiences we have gained internationally over the years to form 
these kinds of coalitions and alliances; how we begin to work with 
other like-minded countries so that we do not do it alone, but we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6348"> 6348 </A></B>
<P>
work within the UN context as a coalition of countries dedicated to 
the notion of peace building.
<P>
	That is very much the challenge which now faces us. That is the 
second track we must begin to follow. As we have begun to almost 
see a certain resolution of the humanitarian crisis, we must now 
make sure that a new crisis does not occur. Through the kinds of 
initiatives of peace building that I talked about, I think we can 
begin to help resolve those issues.
<P>
	I know it has been the question and concern which was clearly 
uppermost on the minds of members in terms of the briefing we 
held this morning. That is why I want to underline and emphasize 
the importance of being able to respond to these kinds of 
international difficulties not in a singular way, not in an inflexible 
way, not in a single dimension, but to provide a subtle, flexible 
broad based response in which we can bring to bear the best 
resources of this country to help solve the conflict.
<P>
	In conclusion, I again ask members of the House for their 
support in this initiative. It is not a support which is open ended. 
We will come back to Parliament on a regular basis through the 
committee system to ensure that it is constantly being referenced 
and constantly asking for a response. We have to work together.
<P>
	I believe this is in the vital interests of Canadians. Many out 
there are asking why we are involved in Rwanda which is so far 
away, why we are spending resources in a far off place. Every 
Canadian has a vital interest. If we do not solve the problems, if we 
do not help to make that kind of contribution, it will be on our 
doorstep in a matter of time.
<P>
	It is the underside of globalization. If we can gain from the 
benefits of a global system in terms of trade, investment, 
productivity and growth, we must also bear the responsibility of 
ensuring the global system is stable, orderly, safe and secure. That 
has been a long tradition of this country. It is in the tradition that 
will allow us to continue not only to provide security for other 
people but our own security as well, by making sure that the world 
is secure.
<P>
	I thank members of Parliament for their courtesy and 
indulgence. I look forward to the ensuing debate and to their 
continued support as Canada engages in a mission where we are 
showing leadership in the world in representing the best values and 
interests of the Canadian people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is very meaningful for me to speak today in this debate 
concerning a dramatic situation that is unfolding in the world. I will 
begin by making it clear that we are faced with a very difficult 
humanitarian situation on the international level.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	This current situation affects me personally, for there is a 
nongovernmental organization in my riding, the Institut de 
développement Nord-Sud, which ran a fairly extensive program in 
Rwanda for several years. Hutus, Tutsis, people from Rwanda and 
the region have come to my riding, and people from my riding have 
gone over there, all of this on the interpersonal level.
<P>
	In approaching a problem like this, I believe we must keep in 
mind that, when all is said and done, we are dealing with human 
beings, people, men and women, who have been experiencing very 
difficult situations for some years, and continue to do so. What is 
more, these situations are constantly changing.
<P>
	We are faced with a complex and alarming human situation. I 
think that it is worthwhile to point out, and very realistic as well, 
that it was high time that someone took the initiative on this. 
Canada, it must be noted, has been involved in the decision-making 
process in recent weeks to ensure that there is the will for 
international action to be carried out.
<P>
	We are faced with a situation that is evolving with blinding 
speed. This morning we had an information session on the situation 
in Zaire, and the people briefing us were receiving hourly, 
half-hourly updates on the changing situation. It is important that, 
in approaching this matter, the Canadian government and the 
international community keep in mind that the objectives are 
sacred, but the means to attain them may change.
<P>
	Last week, military intervention was really the main mission, 
and it will remain essential in the future, but, as the Minister said, 
there is more and more international action in quite distinct areas. 
There is a case for military action in one area and humanitarian 
action next door, while it is also necessary to project future 
developments.
<P>
	I think all these actions must be integrated. Experience is an 
excellent teacher and today's experience is particularly significant 
in that we have a living laboratory. We have a situation where 
human lives are at stake, so we must be prepared to accept that 
solutions that seemed relevant last week may have to be changed 
and adjusted as events unfold.
<P>
	In the end, in one or two or three or five years, we should be able 
to reach a point where we can say: ``This part of the world, after 
experiencing major upheavals, has been pacified. Its people are 
living in satisfactory conditions, and they are happy in the place 
where they live. They manage to deal with their problems and are 
taking a new, more positive approach.''
<P>
	Unfortunately, today the answer is not necessarily obvious. The 
situation is extremely complex. Zaire is a country surrounded by 11 
other African countries, with populations whose backgrounds vary 
widely and where the European presence has had an enormous 
impact. Even today, on the map of Africa, borders often are where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6349"> 6349 </A></B>
<P>
they are as result of European intervention. All this means that we 
have a situation where a country's borders do not necessarily 
coincide with tribal borders.
<P>
	So we have to consider all these factors. I would like to take this 
opportunity to mention a major contribution being made by 
Tanzania, a neighbouring country that has provided a buffer 
solution, as it were, for at least part of the refugees. I think this is an 
approach that could be a useful precedent. Other African countries 
would do well to follow this example so that, in the medium term, 
solutions will be increasingly African solutions, initiated by and 
for Africans.
<P>
	Today, in 72 hours, we have gone from a situation where we had 
more than one million refugees outside Rwanda to a situation 
where there are 400,000 or perhaps 500,000. It is hard to estimate 
the exact figures, but in the past 72 hours there has been a major 
population movement that has completely changed the situation.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Between 400,000 and 500,000 people have become a new and 
important challenge for the Government of Rwanda and the current 
situation. It will be necessary to absorb these people who left the 
country one or two years ago when the country went through a very 
difficult time. Now they must be reintegrated. Can this be done 
without strong international assistance, and I am thinking of shelter 
facilities and food aid corridors? And there are also the 
non-governmental organizations that are helping to feed and 
resettle these people. We will have to consider very carefully where 
the efforts the Government of Canada and of all the other countries 
that are part of the current international action should be focused.
<P>
	We must realize that although the situation has changed so 
dramatically, the answer is certainly not to stop everything 
tomorrow morning. Just because a lot of Rwandans are going back 
to Rwanda does not mean that the problem is solved. And above 
all, international public opinion must not be allowed to focus its 
attention on other problems while forgetting to deal with the very 
real problem that exists in this country.
<P>
	The difficult situation remains and it is not going to be resolved 
by the Rwandans' return home. It will be resolved once there is, 
within the African communities concerned, a balance, a way for the 
population to live in a democratic context and according to the 
rules that govern peoples who live together and are concerned 
about each other's growth and development.
<P>
	The people are not being judged; the issue is simply to ensure 
that long term solutions are put in place.
<P>
	Here is an example of some of the information that must be 
taken into consideration. We know that, at the moment, there may 
be enough food to feed some 1.5 million people for about 50 days. 
Therefore, in order to ensure that supplies reach the refugees in 
time, without crises or panic arising from logistics problems, we 
must ensure there is an infrastructure. I think the action the 
government has undertaken that has mobilized the international 
community must continue and will bring significant results in short 
order.
<P>
	I stress the aspect of continuing the action, because of all the 
reactions we see today in the news. People are saying: ``We do not 
know anymore whether the troops are really needed''. The 
Americans, for example, may have doubts.
<P>
	The movement of the refugees elicits a different response to the 
problem among the Africans involved. However, the problem 
remains. We have to look to the means and the types of action, but 
we must never give up on the problem itself.
<P>
	So, aid is still needed. It is hard to assess the impact of the 
multinational force. Over time, however, a link may be established 
between the point at which the international community decided to 
act and the subsequent population movements.
<P>
	This result alone is worth the effort of showing that action had to 
be taken and that it must continue to be accorded the importance it 
deserves.
<P>
	In addition to acting in the short term, we must take the right 
kind of action. There is a clear lesson for the international 
community here. The many warning signals that preceded the 
current crisis went unheeded. It was the resumption of an 
unfinished war, which led to the massacre of more than one million 
Rwandans in 1994.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	This situation, which has deteriorated over the years, should 
have been anticipated. Solutions had been suggested. The situation 
must be dealt with in the short term. For the long term, the French 
government has suggested that an international conference be held 
on the whole African great lakes issue, on this whole region of 
Africa. This suggestion has been on the table for some time now, 
and it was submitted to the Canadian foreign affairs minister by his 
French counterpart. I think that beyond the logistics of the current 
crisis, the international community should go one step further and 
recognize that the problem is indeed serious and deep-rooted, and 
that there should be an international conference on the subject.
<P>
	We could ask ourselves the following question: Would this not 
be the appropriate way to look for a permanent solution to the 
problems that were encountered? All players would have to sit 
around a table and develop comprehensive, long-term solutions to 
ensure this kind of crisis will never happen again.
<P>
	Action is said to be required. Why should it always be military 
action? Non-governmental organizations involved in providing 
humanitarian relief in the field feel that their work remains 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6350"> 6350 </A></B>
<P>
essential, that it is still important. I think we should trust their 
experience.
<P>
	Humanitarian organizations and the military should continue to 
co-operate in creating corridors. If all the refugees that fled their 
country return to Rwanda, there will be a significant increase in the 
number of Rwandans who were no longer part of the country's 
economy and now need to be integrated. This will involve 
combining civilian and military protection to deal with very real 
food supply problems. To achieve this goal, military supervision 
will still be required to ensure that all operations are conducted in 
relative safety.
<P>
	We are confronted to a complex situation where action is 
continuously needed. But we must ask ourselves what kind of 
action is required. In itself, the refugees' return is good news. It 
was one of the two objectives assigned to the international force. 
The announcement of an international mission helped trigger off 
the Rwandans' return. The decision made by Rwandese people to 
return home poses a major challenge for the international 
community.
<P>
	These people are experiencing very special conditions. For 
example, we know that trucks were put at their disposal to bring 
them back home. However, these people are animated by some 
kind of survival instinct and they want to walk back to their 
communities together, collectively. Some negative thoughts may 
be associated with the trucks. These people experienced genocide. 
These are human beings in motion who, collectively, decided to 
find a solution: to return to their villages and to try to rebuild the 
relationship that existed between them in each of the villages.
<P>
	We must help them do it by being present and by ensuring that 
this process takes place in an appropriate framework. We must also 
ensure that these people are properly looked after when they come 
back. We were told this morning that, when a family arrives in the 
village that it left two years earlier, they find their house occupied 
by someone else. There is a whole way of life to re-establish and 
redefine. This implies that some form of international assistance is 
provided. Otherwise, chaos could resurface, and we would not be 
able to resolve the new crisis.
<P>
	We must not bury our heads in the sand. We must not forget that 
the civil war has left open wounds. This is a country trying to get 
back on its feet. This is a developing country facing a major 
challenge. No one could have predicted, 72 hours ago, that some 
400,000 or 500,000 people would head back home.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Try to imagine, in Quebec or in Canada, a sudden movement of 
500,000 people within a 72-hour period. Think of the impact it 
could have on an economically developed country such as ours. 
Now imagine the same situation in a country ravaged by a civil 
war. This shows how international assistance is still needed.
<P>
	We may ponder whether, for example, it is still as vital to ensure 
the disarmament of the troops involved, and how this can be 
concretely achieved. When refugees were concentrated in camps, 
the logistics was easier to deal with. Now that refugees are 
returning home all over the country, will it be possible to use the 
same approach? Questions remain.
<P>
	Another big question mark is the six months initially anticipated. 
We have seen the situation, notably in Bosnia, where a mission was 
supposed to last a few months and ended up going on for a year and 
a half. Are we headed for the same sort of situation again? Could 
the movement of refugees not reduce the length of the mission? 
These are concerns that we will have to address.
<P>
	Earlier, the minister was telling us that there will be follow-up. 
He said that the situation will be referenced through the committee 
system and in the House of Commons. The official opposition will 
be watching closely to see, among other things, that our troops are 
treated properly. Lessons must be learned from the past.
<P>
	There was a recommendation to change the policy so that 
soldiers spend at least 12 months in Canada between international 
missions of this type. Will this policy apply in the present 
situation? This is one of the factors underlying the malaise found 
among troops on their return. When this interval is too short and 
there is inadequate acclimatization and preparation, it shows up in 
increased suicide rates, and personal and family problems. This is 
another important concern.
<P>
	Other questions must also be asked. In light of the unexpected 
return of over half a million refugees to Rwanda-and the number 
is increasing daily, if not hourly-will it be possible to meet the 
goal of ensuring satisfactory humanitarian services in the future?
<P>
	Another question is whether the Prime Minister intends to 
require the agreement of all parties present before going ahead, or 
does he plan to impose the multinational force? This is a good 
question.
<P>
	As of this morning, no confirmation has yet been received that 
the governments of Rwanda and Zaire are prepared to formally 
agree to the arrival of this force in their territory. Rwanda is 
wondering whether there is still a need for this international force 
in view of the changed situation.
<P>
	Canada is assuming command of this force, an incredible 
challenge for the armed forces. From the standpoint of political 
analysis, the challenge will be a major one. Lieutenant-General 
Baril, the commanding general, and all those assisting him must 
have access to an accurate analysis of what is going on, be able to 
react rapidly and have significant support from the Government of 
Canada. The support of the entire diplomatic machinery will also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6351"> 6351 </A></B>
<P>
be essential, because there  is no denying that there is also the risk 
of friction in an international force involving 15 or 16 countries.
<P>
	The support of the entire Canadian government, including the 
diplomatic network, will be required in order to ensure that the 
action taken is appropriate and responsible, and that it takes 
account of all the players in this situation.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The armed forces are facing a major challenge as a result of the 
Canadian government's decision to lead this mission. Canada is 
already doing its share to a significant extent by sending soldiers 
abroad on international missions. Consider Bosnia, for instance, 
where we have about 2,000 soldiers on the ground. Will we be able 
to continue our participation in missions abroad, and do so 
satisfactorily, while leading the operation in the African great lakes 
region?
<P>
	There is a major point we must consider. Even when we manage 
to bring in humanitarian aid and take care of the survivors, there is 
no strategy for preventing a recurrence of the conflict if no long 
term political solution is found. And this is where the concept of an 
international conference could be useful.
<P>
	Today, the initiatives taken by Canada are important to deal with 
the crisis on a short term basis, but similar initiatives will be 
necessary to provide a long term solution. Canada must look at the 
broader picture to find long term solutions.
<P>
	A concern was raised by families of soldiers who are part of 
these missions, and past experience can teach us a useful lesson. It 
is important to know exactly what instructions are given to soldiers 
who may encounter resistance in the field. What are the rules of 
engagement? Do those rules exist? Would it be possible to table 
them so we will know exactly how much leeway the army has?
<P>
	In addition to our short term strategy, we must have a long term 
strategy as well. The proposal for an international conference on 
the great lakes region sounds like an excellent idea. Perhaps we 
could also learn from our experience in Bosnia with humanitarian 
aid and the rebuilding of civilian institutions. If the military 
mission takes less time than expected, perhaps we could consider 
setting aside certain amounts for rebuilding civilian institutions 
and include this as part of Canadian and international aid. We think 
this is an important component of a long term solution.
<P>
	The governments concerned must have solid roots. They must 
have the requisite legitimacy and the right tools to build the 
country. I think the Government of Canada would do well to 
consider this.
<P>
	In concluding, in this debate the opposition believes it is 
important for the Canadian government to continue to take certain 
initiatives, to do so after reflecting on the situation and to continue 
to take the lead. We may make  minor mistakes, but we must ensure 
that Canada and the international community come out of this 
operation with their reputation enhanced and that solutions will be 
found to ensure that Rwanda has public institutions that work in the 
years to come, and that Rwandans will see that international aid 
provided on Canada's initiative has helped to restore the quality of 
their lives. The next few days will be crucial in this respect.
<P>
	We therefore urge the government to show good judgment and to 
seek the support of the opposition parties, so that our position can 
help the government make the best possible decisions, because in 
this particular case, we are still talking about protecting hundreds 
of thousands of human lives.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
talk about an issue that is of such great concern to all Canadians. I 
am sure I speak for my colleagues and most Canadians who are 
horrified by the humanitarian issues that we see on television on a 
daily basis. The humanitarian tragedy in Rwanda touches all of us.
<P>
	I cannot help thinking back to my visit to Rwanda. My wife and I 
spent a month there. We trekked through the very area we are now 
seeing pictures of. We stood beside Lac Kivu and took pictures of 
the sunset. We were told that Egyptian folklore said that if you saw 
a sunset over Lac Kivu you would live 10 years longer. In my office 
I have a large picture of the sun setting on Lac Kivu.
<P>
	I cannot help thinking of the people and the villages and the 
fertile land which represents Rwanda. Rwanda is truly the 
Switzerland of Africa. The valleys are full of tea. We were able to 
see the fantastic growth on the volcanic soil. That probably makes 
this issue even harder, to know the potential of that place and to see 
what those people have done to themselves.
<P>
	I cannot help thinking of my days as a university student reading 
``Heart of Darkness'' by Joseph Conrad and being impressed by the 
book and the way it presented the issue.
<P>
	We are talking today about what we should do for Rwanda, for 
Zaire and for the problems which are occurring in the area. To 
address the issue I want to look back at the record of peacekeeping 
and of the kinds of issues which we face today. Of course it all 
comes down to accountability, to making promises and to 
delivering on those promises.
<P>
	Canada's role in peacekeeping goes back as far as the Suez 
Canal. That was a different age. It was a different time. The world 
was much simpler than the world in which we live today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6352"> 6352 </A></B>
<P>
	We could talk about Cyprus and the six months that we were 
going to be there. Of course we know what that turned into.
<P>
	We could talk about Bosnia. In 1991 we committed to help there. 
The Liberals were extremely concerned by the Progressive 
Conservative decision to go to Bosnia without adequate 
information, without adequate consultation and certainly without 
the will of Parliament.
<P>
	I can remember this time last year standing in the foyer of the 
Parliament Buildings with Susan Harada, who was interviewing the 
then defence minister. He said that the situation in Bosnia was 
definitely under control and under the new NATO mission our 
troops would definitely not be there this time next year. He said we 
would not be there after December of 1996 and ``that is a promise 
and I stand by it''.
<P>
	We now know that IFOR II is being proposed. The Americans 
are committed for another 18 months. Canada is probably going to 
commit for another however many months.
<P>
	We can talk about Somalia. It was a U.S. mission. We all saw the 
photos of those dead marines being hauled through the streets. We 
know how quickly that mission disintegrated and how we returned 
with our tail between our legs.
<P>
	We could talk about the tragedy that has already occurred in 
Rwanda and the under-equipped and under-sized group of 
peacekeepers who were there, again led by Canada. The genocide 
continued. There was no hope for the peacekeepers. Of course there 
was no order and again we withdrew.
<P>
	We have known about this issue for a long time. Ten years ago 
when I was there the NGOs were talking about it. It did not happen 
last weekend, as the Prime Minister would like us to believe. The 
issue has been there for a long time. It was there during the 
colonization of this area when the Europeans treated these people 
so badly.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Then of course there is Haiti. Haiti has not moved a long way. 
There is no education system. Unemployment stands at 85 per cent. 
The quality of life has not really improved. This time last year this 
very foreign affairs minister in the Charles Lynch Room downstairs 
said that all would be in order by December 1996. Canada would 
not have to renew its commitment or its mission because all would 
be in order.
<P>
	When I had the privilege of being in Haiti in June and really 
seeing matters, it was obvious that promise would never be kept. 
Haiti needs a 20-year plan to really get it up and functioning.
<P>
	Now it is Zaire and we have a promise of four to six months. Is 
that an honest promise? Is that the reality that we are facing in this 
House today or is it more like so many examples we have had in the 
past?
<P>
	Then I would throw in the U.S. factor. The overriding concern of 
the world seems to be that the U.S. is the only remaining 
superpower and that we must do what the U.S. tells us. Of course, 
during the election campaign it was very easy for Mr. Clinton to 
say: ``We will be out of Haiti by end of February 1996'' and it was. 
But we went in for the Americans. It was easy for him to say in 
Bosnia: ``We will only be there until 1996'', but again the 
credibility of the whole political system is at question when the 
week after the election the Americans have now committed for 18 
months more in Bosnia. I question how much longer it will be until 
they are back in Haiti.
<P>
	We can talk about Iraq and the bombings that went on there 
which we just in a matter of minutes agreed to. We can talk about 
Somalia and what the inquiry is showing, how U.S. diplomats, U.S. 
intelligence agents, U.S. military personnel told our people what to 
do.
<P>
	The second in command in Zaire is going to be an American. 
Canada has a great reputation around the world. It is a reputation 
not tarnished by a colonial past, by aggressiveness to anyone. We 
have a reputation that we care about people. How long can we keep 
being the Joe boy for the U.S. and retain that neutral position that 
we so value as Canadians? All of us in this Parliament should ask 
that question.
<P>
	What is the pattern that develops? The pattern is that problems 
are identified by NGOs, by foreign affairs, by CNN. Occasionally 
they are identified by the UN. Then a propaganda campaign is 
started, never mentioning the real issues, never really talking about 
all of the problems. Our new defence minister has a big problem in 
that morale has slipped. He has a problem that the Somalia inquiry 
has gone on much too long. He has a problem that his Prime 
Minister is perceived in international affairs to simply be interested 
in trade and that, after all, has not been the Liberal way.
<P>
	The Liberals believe they have to get involved in something to 
raise the profile of the Prime Minister, the party and certainly the 
defence minister. Lo and behold an issue has come along. However, 
that issue was there two years ago. It was there 10 years ago but 
now it has become an urgent crisis.
<P>
	The next step is to get the UN to rubber stamp it. Of course with 
the U.S. superpower status that is not a problem.
<P>
	Then we have to think back to what the Liberals said about Mr. 
Mulroney being in the pocket of the Americans. With regard to Mr. 
Mulroney's being there, where is Mr. Chrétien?
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Then we have to ask about the taxpayers and the cost of these 
issues. It appears that we can never quite put our finger on what it is 
going to cost. In fact, we can cover the costs up in normal 
operation. In all the cases I have pointed out the protagonists 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6353"> 6353 </A></B>
<P>
simply wait until we tire of the mission and then they carry on from 
where they were before.
<P>
	What are the questions I believe Canadians and all members of 
this House deserve answers to? The mission is changing, the 
mandate is changing on an hourly basis. Is there still a need for the 
mission? Can NGOs carry out this mission? Do we need soldiers on 
the ground? We have to ask this question and it has to be displayed 
to us that it is necessary.
<P>
	We have to ask about the military capabilities, and my colleague 
will be talking about that in detail. I was at a briefing where I was 
told we could handle two missions but not three. The Canadian 
public needs to know which one we are getting out of. Are we 
going to stay in Bosnia where we are not part of decision making, 
where we have been there longer than anybody else, more 
committed than anybody else but have little say in what is going to 
happen? Can that be handed off to someone else?
<P>
	With respect to Haiti, it is in our hemisphere and we can hardly 
give that one up as we took a lead role. How can we give Zaire up? 
Our Prime Minister has said we are the world leaders, we want to 
raise our profile and this is how we are going to do it.
<P>
	We need to ask questions about what is happening and we need 
to get Canadians and this House to focus on what is the mandate of 
our military? For 20 years we have been cutting the military. It has 
been the scapegoat for lowering budgets. When are we going to say 
not only do we have the very best troops but we want to have the 
best equipment, the best training and we want to have the very best 
ability to do the jobs that we are going to be called on to do. What 
about the families of the military? These are all questions I have 
not heard addressed by anybody in this House.
<P>
	Do the local governments want us? That is a pretty big question. 
The prime minister of Rwanda has questions. Certainly Mr. 
Mobutu who has been propped up in Zaire for so many years wants 
to know more details about bringing in foreign troops. Are they 
going to be on his side or not?
<P>
	We need to find out what the exact mandate is. You do not go 
into something without knowing the details of the mandate and the 
risks you run. It is great if everything goes just fine and you come 
out being the very best, but what if it does not go fine? There are 
many potential dangers. It is a dangerous mission we are asking our 
men and women to go on and so we have to clarify that mandate. 
We have to know what it is like. that is jungle, after all, and I can 
testify to that on a very personal basis.
<P>
	We have to clarify the mandate. We have to know what the rules 
of engagement are. We have to know what happens if rebels start 
shooting at our troops. We have to know what happens if hostages 
are taken. We have to know the answers. Canadians have a right to 
know the  answers to those questions before we send these people 
off.
<P>
	Of course I cannot help but mention the cost. We need to know 
what the estimates are. After all, we have a $50 billion interest 
payment every year that is crippling us and putting us behind the 
rest of the world. We need to know where this money is coming 
from and how much it is before we leave.
<P>
	We need to know an exit strategy. I have given the examples of 
all the times we have heard in this place ``we are there for six 
months and I guarantee we will be out of there in six months''.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	I heard that out in the foyer, I heard that down in the news 
gallery. I have heard that over and over and we will hear it again. 
Four to six months, what kind of a guarantee? How are we going to 
measure how well we have done and how we are going to get out of 
this mission? We need to know that.
<P>
	We need to know how we get out of Haiti, out of Somalia, out of 
Bosnia. We need to know we are training somebody to take our 
place, and who better than the African forces themselves?
<P>
	We cannot be the Canadian foreign legion. We cannot go 
everywhere. We do have to pick and choose. We have to look at our 
role in the international community. We have to make this 
Parliament meaningful. This Parliament must be part of this. I 
could just as easily say what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said 
when he was in opposition, that Parliament has to be meaningful, 
Parliament must have a say when the lives of our men and women 
are at stake.
<P>
	What should we be doing? We should let Parliament have a say. 
We should make it a meaningful process. We should have briefings 
from all the people involved, from the military, from the NGO 
community, from foreign affairs, from all the people who know 
what is happening there, from those who have been there, who have 
spent years there. There are a lot of them. They could let this House 
know before our troops are sent. We should have an opportunity to 
question them, everybody on an equal basis. This should not be a 
partisan issue.
<P>
	We should have representative speakers of each party speak on 
the issues. Those people could express the views that would have 
been formulated with information obtained through questioning. 
Everybody would have an opportunity to do that.
<P>
	There should be a free vote in the House to make the decision on 
this. It does not have to be a last minute thing like it always is. 
None of these issues shows up overnight.
<P>
	We need to train people to take care of themselves. We need to 
be involved in the long term training of African countries to take 
care of their many issues. These problems for the most part were 
caused by colonization,  by the European and American influence 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6354"> 6354 </A></B>
<P>
in so many of these countries. We need a workable plan. Maybe it 
should be geographic.
<P>
	Perhaps we need a Euro force. There is one in the planning 
stages as part of the EU. It will handle European problems. We 
need an Afro force to handle African problems. We need an 
Americas force, an OAS force, to handle the Americas. Of course 
Asia should be able to take some responsibility for itself. The point 
is we will then create a solution, a hope for the future, a vision of 
how this world can maintain peace.
<P>
	We do care about the people. We want to help the people with all 
these humanitarian problems, but we cannot give a blank cheque. 
We must have these questions answered. Canadians want answers, 
we want answers, and I am sure I speak for many parliamentarians 
on all sides of this House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
be participating in this important debate. I want to thank my hon. 
colleagues for their participation to this point.
<P>
	As members of the House are well aware, the situation in the 
great lakes region of Africa remains extremely fluid. Indeed it 
continues to evolve as we speak. We face a major humanitarian 
crisis in eastern Zaire and in Rwanda.
<P>
	Last week approximately one and a half million refugees were 
either huddling in makeshift camps or fleeing from conflict. The 
plight of these men, women and children is absolutely desperate.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The efforts of international humanitarian agencies to reach those 
in need were being impeded by warring factions. Hundreds of 
thousands of lives are in jeopardy. Canada was not prepared to 
stand by and watch another African tragedy unfold. We decided to 
respond.
<P>
	Canada took the lead in organizing a multinational approach to 
ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance in the region. I 
am sure that all members of the House would agree with me that 
the Prime Minister's initiative over the last 10 days has succeeded 
beyond our wildest dreams because already the situation has 
changed dramatically and for the better.
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of refugees have taken to the roads to 
return to their communes in Rwanda. This exodus which all of us 
are witnessing will go a long way toward resolving the 
humanitarian crisis in eastern Zaire.
<P>
	Surely we can all agree that it is much too early to say that the 
crisis is over. For example, we believe there are still approximately 
500,000 refugees in Zaire. There are people still in need. Those 
who are the healthiest are the ones who were able to return to 
Rwanda first. Yet it is  impossible at this moment for anyone to 
determine the true extent of the crisis.
<P>
	So, faced with this uncertainty we continue to take the 
preliminary steps with our coalition partners that are necessary to 
mount a relief effort. We continue to examine every option as the 
situation in the region evolves. To that end Canadian forces 
continue to prepare for possible deployment. Over the coming days 
as we assess the situation we want to make sure that they are 
capable of acting if that is required.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That Canada should take a lead in this endeavour should come as 
no surprise. Canada has a long and proud tradition of promoting 
international stability and coming to the aid of those in need.
<P>
	The Canadian Forces have the capability to make a real 
difference. Canada has one of the most professional and respected 
military organizations in the world. Our armed forces have what it 
takes to lead a multinational relief effort.
<P>
	We have participated in almost every peacekeeping mission 
undertaken over the last 50 years, from traditional peacekeeping 
and observer missions to the more complex operations of the 
post-Cold War era, including humanitarian relief operations.
<P>
	Of course, we have extensive military experience in Central 
Africa itself. From the Congo operation of the early 1960s to more 
recent operations in Somalia and Rwanda, we know the challenges: 
inhospitable terrain, a harsh climate, armed and hostile rebel 
groups.
<P>
	We have already deployed an assessment team to the great lakes 
region. This team will help assist ongoing multinational planning. 
If necessary, we are prepared to contribute approximately 1,500 
military personnel to a humanitarian relief force.
<P>
	This contribution could include the core of a task force 
headquarters responsible for command, control and 
communications for a multinational force. We could also provide 
the core of the air component headquarters, which would help 
direct air operations for such a task force, as well as a DART 
disaster assistance response team for humanitarian assistance to 
refugees, including troops for protection. This team would include 
a field hospital and a transportation element, Hercules transport 
aircraft, and associated personnel to assist in the delivery of 
humanitarian aid, and a national support element.
<P>
	All of these elements could deploy quickly to staging bases in 
the region. DART is a specialized military unit of highly trained 
professionals. It includes medical personnel, engineers, a transport 
and communications unit, and an infantry platoon for security.
<P>
	DART can provide medical resources to treat up to 500 patients a 
day, as well as electrical power and drinking water for up to 10,000 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6355"> 6355 </A></B>
<P>
people per day. It can  also build temporary shelters and provide 
communications and logistics support.
<P>
	Some of the lead elements of DART are already in eastern Zaire.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	By the end of today, we will have almost 250 personnel in 
theatre, with 4 Hercules and 1 Airbus aircraft, as well as some 
DART equipment and vehicles. The balance of the DART 
equipment and personnel is assembled in Trenton and ready to go.
<P>
	Other augmentation personnel have been identified from across 
the Canadian Forces. In short, the Canadian Forces are poised to do 
what needs to be done. But any decision to participate in a 
humanitarian relief effort in eastern Zaire will be based on specific 
guidelines.
<P>
	To begin with, all regional governments must acquiesce to the 
presence of a multinational force.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition to the need to have the agreement of the governments 
in that region before we move, we also of course need a clear and 
achievable mandate. The security council mandate calls for the 
establishment for humanitarian purposes of a temporary 
multinational force to facilitate the immediate return of 
humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian 
relief organizations of humanitarian aid. It also calls for a force that 
will facilitate the voluntary orderly repatriation of refugees by the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the voluntary return of 
displaced persons.
<P>
	Additionally, any mission must be of limited duration. The UN 
Security Council resolution envisages a mission of four months, 
but recent events may well indicate that this may be longer than is 
necessary.
<P>
	The multinational force called for by the security council 
resolution would operate under chapter VII of the UN charter with 
robust rules of engagement. These rules of engagement would 
allow our troops for example to use deadly force to protect 
themselves, relief personnel, and in certain situations, refugees.
<P>
	We must have a clear and effective command and control 
structure in place. Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril, commander, 
land force command, will lead the force. General Baril is a perfect 
fit for such a command. He was a battalion commander in Cyprus 
and was special military adviser to the United Nations 
Secretary-General from 1992 to 1995.
<P>
	General Baril is now en route to the region and he will arrive 
there today. Following discussions with Ambassador Chrétien, 
representatives from various NGOs and local authorities, General 
Baril will provide the Government of Canada with his strategic 
assessment of the military situation. I am pleased to advise that 
there will be a meeting in Stuttgart, Germany on Thursday at which 
General Baril and representatives of the  contributing nations will 
make further decisions as to what type of force we should have in 
place and how the humanitarian relief operation should be 
conducted.
<P>
	I have been telling the House what this multinational relief force 
might do. Let me take a moment to tell the House what it will not 
do. It will not conduct forced entry operations. It will not be 
responsible for overall repatriation or integration of refugees. It 
will not intervene in factional or local conflicts. It will not deal 
with territorial disputes. It will not separate the intimidators from 
the refugees, nor will it disarm the intimidators. It will not secure 
the perimeter of refugee camps. It will not provide police functions 
within the camps.
<P>
	I am sure that all members in this House will agree that the 
parties in the region must find their own solutions to the political 
and social problems they face.
<P>
	There is no doubt that over the years we have built a reputation 
as a nation for being there when it counts. We believe it is critical 
that we not only contribute but lead a force that would help 
stabilize central Africa and save hundreds of thousands of lives.
<P>
	I want to thank the American government and the military 
leaders of the United States for their co-operation. Although we 
have the lead and the command of this operation, we obviously do 
not have all of the resources to be able to take on the logistics that 
are required if we were to continue down the path that we have 
chosen.
<P>
	I want to repeat, because I have heard it said over and over again, 
that we are monitoring the situation hour to hour, if not minute to 
minute. We understand the changes that have already taken place. 
Let me say that no one is enthusiastic about having to commit 
Canadian men and women to a situation that is extremely volatile 
and very complex. We are doing what we must do. We have moved 
to this position as a result of a great deal of consensus in the 
international community.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	I want to say to you, Mr. Speaker, and to the Canadian people, 
that I know that as I have complete confidence in the men and 
women of the Canadian forces, I have no doubt Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast share that confidence. The skill of the 
Canadian forces, their commitment, their experience, their 
leadership qualities are second to none. The Canadian forces once 
again are ready to do the job and I have every confidence they will 
do it well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this debate on the peacekeeping missions Canada 
has been involved in for many years, as the minister of defence has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6356"> 6356 </A></B>
<P>
just mentioned. For some 50 years now, Canada has taken  part in 
almost every peacekeeping mission it has been asked to join.
<P>
	As it has always done, the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
government's humanitarian aid initiative. We recognize the 
leadership shown by the current government in inviting the 
international community to help bring an end to the slaughter and 
resolve the current humanitarian problem at the border between 
Rwanda and Zaire.
<P>
	Debates have taken place in this House on earlier peacekeeping 
missions. Certain discrepancies led to questions and requests for 
clarification from the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition. Each 
time there was a mission-be it in Bosnia or Haiti-we expected 
Canada would go to the aid of countries facing problems, be they 
wars, famine or disease. When the government decided to send 
peacekeepers, we expected the role, mandate and length of the 
missions would be clearly indicated.
<P>
	The situation in Zaire is changing quickly. A couple of weeks 
ago, more than half a million people fled to Zaire and now they are 
returning to Rwanda. Obviously the planning and preparation of 
the international mission under Canada's leadership will have to 
change. Zaire has accepted and confirmed the presence of a 
Canadian led multinational force, but Rwanda has not. If all the 
refugees head to Rwanda, negotiations will be necessary.
<P>
	There has been significant involvement by armed rebels in the 
military conflict in Rwanda between the Tutsis and the Hutus, 
which has been spilling over into Zaire and Uganda. As the 
minister of defence has said, we want to send lightly armed 
peacekeepers, who will intervene not as a UN force, but as a 
multinational force approved by the UN with a more or less defined 
mission.
<P>
	Western countries like Canada, the United States and France 
should intervene in the event of humanitarian problems, such as the 
one in the great lakes region of Africa.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I cannot help but wonder, as some of my hon. colleagues 
probably wonder, how Canada will be able to cope with the various 
military forces over there, when the role of our peacekeepers 
remains to be defined.
<P>
	We will recall that, several months ago, in Bosnia, Canadian 
troops were taken hostage by Serbs. This incident held the 
international community in suspense for several days. It is obvious 
that the peacekeepers and UNPROFOR as a whole had neither the 
mandate nor the capacity to protect themselves under such 
circumstances.
<P>
	What will happen in Zaire and Rwanda with the rebels and 
armed militia? On what basis have the Canadian government, 
National Defence, Foreign Affairs planned how our military are to 
behave in various situations.
<P>
	Without bringing back too many bad memories, I think we must 
bear in mind that there were incidents  involving peacekeepers in 
Rwanda. Belgian troops under the command of a Canadian general 
were murdered in Rwanda. All too often, in peacekeeping missions 
such as those in Bosnia, Haiti and now Zaire, the Canadian 
government sends out Canadian troops with a humanitarian 
mission. Everyone agrees and realizes that Canada must act along 
those lines.
<P>
	In missions as important as these, where the political and 
military stakes are critically high, it is nevertheless fair enough, in 
my opinion, to say that preparation is critical. Every soldier and 
officer participating in such missions must know exactly what is 
expected of him or her, and they must also be able to protect 
themselves.
<P>
	In recent years, the practice has very often been to ignore to 
some extent the families left behind by deployed troops. The troops 
themselves know very little about the nature of the mission as they 
fly out of Canada to trouble spots or other areas where they are 
supposed to make a significant contribution. They are unsure of 
how long they will be gone, and have little information regarding 
the role they are expected to play in support of the local population 
and how they should behave.
<P>
	The defence and foreign affairs departments deserve to be 
criticized for the lack of information they provide. Because of the 
reputation and generosity of Canadians, they take it upon 
themselves to help communities clearly experiencing major 
problems. When it comes to missions of this type, the key players 
are the troops and the officers who take part in it, those who will be 
in the theatre of operations. Before they leave, military people 
often tell their families, their loved ones, and sometimes the media, 
that their mission is vague, that their role is not well defined. They 
do not know which weapons they can use if they are surrounded by 
militia troops or rebels out to capture them. They do not know if 
they are allowed to defend themselves or if they must once again 
put up with being humiliated? This is one of the problems 
experienced by Canadian troops who took part in recent 
peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	It shows that the government is once again improvising 
somewhat. The families of these troops feel it makes no sense to 
send a son, a husband, a father, a wife, or a sister to such theatres of 
operations, without knowing what is expected of them.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	There have been instances, but hopefully this will no longer be 
the case, where Canadian troops may have lost their lives because 
the instructions given to them were not clear. I am thinking of the 
death of Corporal Gunther and others who took part in such 
missions as proud members of our armed forces, proud Quebecers 
and proud Canadians. These people provided humanitarian assis-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6357"> 6357 </A></B>
<P>
tance, but their mission was not properly planned, which resulted in 
mixed success and, in some cases, in extending our troops' 
involvement.
<P>
	It must also be pointed out that Canada has contributed very 
large numbers of troops to international conflicts over the last three 
years. Only recently, in 1993-94, Canadian troops in Bosnia 
numbered almost 2,000. At that time, although Canada had a very 
large contingent, it did not even have a decision making role in 
diplomatic exchanges or peace negotiations. You will recall that 
Canada was not then a member of the contact group and that it had 
not taken part in the decisions surrounding negotiations to restore 
peace to Bosnia. There are now almost 750 soldiers in Haiti; there 
are still just over 1,000 in Bosnia, and the plan is to send another 
1,000 to Zaire.
<P>
	I have discussed this point with a number of soldiers and even 
with certain officers. The rotation of assignments to peacekeeping 
missions is leading to a certain fatigue among the troops. Far be it 
from me to turn the knife in the wound, but in the present context 
we are only too aware that the army has had its internal problems 
that, up to a point, can be linked to this accumulation of 
peacekeeping missions and to the fact that soldiers have always 
been sent back into the theatre of operations, very often with 
insufficient time to catch their psychological and even their 
physical breath. Some have experienced serious family, 
psychological and other problems.
<P>
	Once again, I do not think these soldiers are being allowed 
sufficient recovery time. Although there are almost 65,000 soldiers 
in the Canadian army, including all ranks and levels, with rare 
exceptions that portion of the Canadian army used in peacekeeping 
missions is generally and almost always limited to the ground 
forces. As for the navy and the air force, their participation in the 
various missions is much more restricted.
<P>
	So it is almost always the same land army personnel who are 
used to help out various nations in the world, one might say, for in 
the last ten years Canada has been to just about all of the theaters of 
international conflict on this planet.
<P>
	I feel that these individuals have reached a degree of overload, 
which might even explain the problems experienced by the 
army-more so than by the navy or the air force, although they too 
have been involved in these humanitarian operations or these 
conflicts-which are psychologically and physically stressful and 
demand virtually superhuman efforts, particularly when soldiers 
must do the same thing over and over again.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I know soldiers who were in Bosnia for six months, then back to 
Canada for a little less than a year, then back to Bosnia. They then 
returned to Canada for a little less than a year before being sent to 
Haiti. As for the Calgary regiment, they have been to Bosnia twice 
and now it will be Zaire.
<P>
	If, over a period of barely 36 months, soldiers have to spend, in 
six-month chunks, more than 12 months in a conflict situation 
away from their loved ones and from the security of their home 
environments, I imagine that what can happen is a sort of 
overloading, an inability to bounce back either psychologically or 
physically.
<P>
	I point this out because all Canadians, all Quebecers, and I think 
all parliamentarians here agree that Canada has a duty to take part 
in this type of mission and, for once, we salute Canadian leadership 
in the current situation in Zaire.
<P>
	We must be aware, however, that our human resources within the 
armed forces, as well as our financial resources, are in what I 
would call a precarious condition. Despite the good will and 
compassion of all parliamentarians, of all members here in this 
House and of the entire public, we must realize that considering its 
human and financial resources, Canada cannot afford to be the 911 
of the planet. Every time a conflict erupts somewhere, Canada is 
called and everything is taken care of. Canada is always ready to 
go.
<P>
	This is not the first time it was mentioned in debate that Canada 
should have an established and definitive policy. I even remember 
that, in a speech he gave at the UN in New York, former Minister of 
Foreign Affairs André Ouellet mentioned that in the not too distant 
future, the UN, and I think that is where we are now, should have a 
permanent force, staffed by various countries, that would intervene 
in certain conflicts in certain locations.
<P>
	This would make it possible for all countries, including Canada, 
to plan for the number of soldiers it could make available, while 
maintaining sufficient rotation so that individuals who take part in 
these missions are able to have a family life and engage in some 
psychological and physical recuperation. At the same time, it 
would also be possible to budget for this kind of mission.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in spite of all the good intentions and 
praiseworthy proposals, it became clear in recent budgets that the 
government was cutting back severely on humanitarian aid, 
including medical assistance, food and the like, and had increased 
the military component in various peacekeeping missions, which 
produces results.
<P>
	We may occasionally wonder whether these results are truly 
positive, but the fact remains that this money will occasionally be 
used preventively, as many representatives of NGOs providing 
humanitarian assistance have mentioned, instead of always putting 
out the fires of a conflict that in many cases will rekindle as soon as 
the peacekeepers leave the theatre of operations.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	In concluding, I must say that the government's initiative has 
been approved and is supported by all members here in this House, 
but nevertheless, various factors must be considered and there must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6358"> 6358 </A></B>
<P>
be a certain  degree of planning. The government must consider our 
human resources, meaning our military, who will need certain rest 
periods, etc. We must establish very strict guidelines on the amount 
of money we want to invest in these activities instead of budgeting 
piecemeal and often cutting somewhere else.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to point out that many people in Quebec and 
Canada find it hard understand why the government is deploying 
humanitarian aid when in a number of provinces, people have 
trouble keeping body and soul together.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for Charlesbourg for his remarks.
<P>
	A debate like this is a time when all members of the House of 
Commons can express our feelings about a very serious situation 
regardless of our party affiliations, whether we are on the 
government or the opposition benches.
<P>
	In reviewing the situation this past week I would like to draw the 
government's attention to the possibility that the Hutu refugees 
who are arriving on the Rwandan borders, hundreds of thousands 
right now, may be part of something that has been instigated by the 
Hutu militias themselves.
<P>
	I am afraid of this. Two years ago in 1994 during the genocide in 
Rwanda, the Hutus fled. When they fled they left their homes and 
villages empty. In the intervening two years a great number of 
exiled Tutsis have returned to those villages in Rwanda. There is a 
situation in Rwanda right now where hundreds of thousands of 
Hutus are returning to their homeland and there are Tutsis 
occupying many of those villages.
<P>
	I suggest this is the classic formula for additional conflict, for 
additional fighting among the local populations. I noticed that the 
Minister of National Defence made it very clear that in committing 
troops to Rwanda and Zaire they are being given the robust rules of 
engagement. That means they can defend themselves with deadly 
force or defend aid workers with deadly force. While one regrets 
that very possibility I still applaud the minister of defence for 
giving the troops that authorization.
<P>
	However, we must remember another spectre will present itself 
to our soldiers over there, or there is a very good chance of it. The 
Minister of National Defence also made it very clear that Canadian 
troops were not to intervene in local or factional fighting. And so 
we in this House, Canadians and possibly the world have to be 
prepared for the possibility that we will have troops and aid 
workers on the ground, that we will see surrounding them a 
resumption of the mindless killing we saw two years ago.
<P>
	I bring to the attention of the House and to all Canadians that 
while we do engage in a humanitarian effort which is absolutely 
vital, and I am very proud of Canada and my Prime Minister for 
initiating this, we as Canadians must be prepared to see on 
television in the days to come some very appalling scenes. We have 
to understand that we are faced with a very difficult situation, a 
very difficult matter of choices. I am afraid that we have to steel 
ourselves as Canadians and citizens of the world for the scenes we 
are going to see in the days to come.
<P>
	I would be very interested in the remarks of the member for 
Charlesbourg on this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the comments of my hon. 
colleague. Certainly no one can have anything against pride. It is 
easy for the government to decide that Canada will take part in a 
particular mission.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	What I wanted to point out was the number of servicemen in the 
army. While, as I mentioned, few servicemen in the air force and 
the navy take part in these activities, there are some 12,000 to 
15,000 servicemen in the army involved. Over the past eight or ten 
years, Canada has regularly been asked to be part of various 
humanitarian missions, and, as I said, there has often been little 
planning and even a certain amount of improvisation.
<P>
	We in Parliament do not give much thought to those who make 
up these resources. We say we are proud to send them, but we must 
have some feeling for those who take on the role and those who pay 
to send them. Everyone is agreed on taking part, but we do have to 
have a clearer policy, that is all.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the government, the Prime Minister, the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of National Defence for 
providing us with this opportunity to speak on this very important 
issue.
<P>
	This is the third or fourth debate we have had on such an 
important issue since the beginning of this Parliament almost three 
years ago. I also have to mention that this is probably the only 
Parliament in western civilization which provides an opportunity 
for its members of Parliament, the backbenchers and the critics 
from the opposition parties to speak individually on such issues of 
importance as this one.
<P>
	Over the past 30 or 40 years we have engaged in peacekeeping in 
maybe 2,000 locations. Each one has different characteristics, a 
different perspective and each one calls for a different mission. 
With respect to this mission the situation is changing every hour. 
The situation was different last week from the situation we  are now 
in and the situation tomorrow will probably be a different one 
again. Nobody knows. There is a massive migration of population 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6359"> 6359 </A></B>
<P>
from one country to another. We cannot stop it but we can be there 
to help them out to achieve that goal.
<P>
	On April 23, a few months ago, the House passed a motion 
recognizing the tragedy which fell upon the Armenian people in 
1915. At that time we adopted a motion that each year, April 22 to 
27 would be a week of remembrance regarding the inhumanity of 
people toward one another. This is a perfect occasion to use that 
motion to promote a common understanding among mankind and 
to make sure that what happened in the past does not repeat itself. 
We can do our best to prevent that situation and this is one such 
situation.
<P>
	The whole western civilization responded positively to the Prime 
Minister's message to help the people in Rwanda and Zaire to make 
sure they get back to their communities and villages so that they 
can start to live in peace and prosperity as they did many many 
years before.
<P>
	This morning, foreign affairs, CIDA and national defence 
provided us with a very important briefing at which members of the 
opposition party were also present. The Reform and the Bloc 
Quebecois representatives were there. In that briefing they 
discussed three situations: NGO aid to the people in the central 
African nation; the military operations that are taking place now to 
prepare for a continuation of the mission; and our own foreign aid 
to the region so we can help build the communities so people can 
live in peace and harmony.
<P>
	Last week I was in Germany with colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois and Reform. I discussed this issue with my Reform 
Party friend from Red Deer. He agrees basically with everybody 
else that this mission has to take place. He agrees also that we have 
to make sure we do our bit to help civilization overcome this 
difficulty.
<P>
	What we do not agree upon, and I respect his point view, is that 
we have to get ready, to prepare ourselves. How long do these 
people have to wait for Canada, for the United States, for Germany 
and for France to get ready? If they have to wait for us to get ready, 
there will be a long wait. I am sure my colleague agrees with me it 
would be a long and difficult wait. By then probably half the people 
would be dead and we would not be able to help them.
<P>
	Remember that in April 1995 we saw bodies floating in the river 
and the lake. We had to do something then. The mission was not 
complete. I am sorry it did not come to a satisfactory end.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	This is the opportunity for us to do the best we can. I am sure at 
the end of the day the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois will 
agree that this mission must go  forward. It may not be perfect but 
nothing and nobody is perfect. However, we cannot afford to wait 
any longer.
<P>
	Again I thank all members and especially the government for 
giving us the opportunity to speak on this issue. I hope that at the 
end of the day we are much wiser when we go forward with this 
mission to protect innocent human lives so they can build their 
lives in peace and harmony.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this morning my colleague mentioned the briefing we 
had with the three departments. It was a very interesting briefing.
<P>
	I believe it was Mr. Buckley from foreign affairs who mentioned 
that Canada has spent close to $50 million in help so far in that area 
of the African continent. Does my colleague think the $50 million 
was well spent? Does he think we should increase or decrease this 
amount? Where should this money go?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to hear during the 
briefing that after 1994 we saw on TV the Government of Canada 
responded generously with a $50 million contribution to the 
situation there. Of that, $27 million has already been spent mostly 
on NGOs and humanitarian institutions like the Red Cross, 
Canadian or international.
<P>
	We also spent quite a bit of money to provide them with a legal 
system so that those who commit genocide and crimes against 
humanity can be prosecuted. That is important. Those who commit 
crimes should know there are consequences to it. They cannot have 
a free lunch if they commit genocide or other crimes. That is a very 
important point and it is money very well spent. I am happy the 
government spent that kind of money for this purpose so we can 
prevent this from happening again in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made 
some reference to the fact that this is an emergency and that it is 
suddenly urgent that foreign troops be sent into central Africa. 
There have been massacres of great magnitude in that area since 
1959. There was one in 1959, another one in 1972, another one in 
1994 and the world essentially yawned and closed its eyes. 
Suddenly, it becomes urgent.
<P>
	Why is the current situation of greater importance to the hon. 
member than the previous massacres?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very interesting 
question.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member knows that the world ignored many 
genocides before, including the 1915 genocide of Armenians which 
I just mentioned. Just because we did not react then or in 1959, 
1965 or 1975, two wrongs do not make a right. It is time we took a 
stand.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6360"> 6360 </A></B>

	At that time of course the hon. member was not a member of 
Parliament and could not speak up. I was not a member of 
Parliament and could not speak up. It is good that both of us are 
here today so we can react to this situation and make sure that 
what happened in the past as a wrong does not occur again.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my fullest support to the decision 
made by the government to alleviate human suffering in the great 
lakes region of central Africa.
<P>
	It is right to do all we can to help fight disease, death and cruelty 
whenever we can. We owe it to ourselves and to our neighbours to 
recognize that our responsibilities extend beyond Canada's 
boundaries. As a CBC commentator suggested last week, referring 
to this issue: ``It is a noble deed to transcend our own personal 
concerns''.
<P>
	Canada has a longstanding commitment to the rest of the world. 
We have fought tyranny in both world wars. Canada was a founding 
member of the League of Nations and the United Nations, and since 
the end of the second world war, we have participated in many 
international ventures from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
to the Francophonie.
<P>
	We Canadians have such strong immigration, economic, cultural 
and personal ties with the international community that we 
instinctively realize that we must know the people out there in 
order to know ourselves.

<P>
	Forty years ago almost to the day, a Canadian was in the 
forefront of another global effort to restore stability to an 
apparently faraway region. The Suez crisis had erupted and the 
Middle East was in flames. Foreign affairs minister Lester Pearson, 
horrified by a conflict that threatened international peace and split 
even Canada's friends, hurried to New York and immediately set to 
work with his colleagues from the Department of External Affairs 
to find the solution.
<P>
	The answer lay in an innovative application of a relatively new 
concept, United Nations peacekeeping, an expedient which had 
been used since the end of the second world war to concoct small 
observer forces in the Middle East and on the India-Pakistan 
border.
<P>
	Mr. Pearson's cool and flexible diplomacy in 1956 led to the 
establishment against all odds of the United Nations emergency 
force in the Middle East, a large multinational UN team whose role 
was to police a ceasefire and interpose itself between the 
combatants.  The idea was a simple but powerful one, to create a 
breathing space so that there was a real opportunity for peace to be 
grasped if the parties wanted it sufficiently.

	The peacekeepers could not make peace. They had-

employment insurance legislation requires 26 weeks of insurable 
employment in the case of workers who did not claim benefits in 
the past two years. This is unfair.
<P>
	The construction industry, among others, has experienced 
particularly difficult years, and workers who were not able to 
qualify last year because they had not worked long enough will be 
even less able to do so this year, since they will be deemed to have 
been out of the workforce for two years. In other words, they will 
need 26 weeks of insurable employment in the past year.
<P>
	Their only option is to go on welfare. The situation is urgent. A 
solution must be found to avoid penalizing even more an industry 
which, in Quebec, has had more than its share of problems in recent

Aaron Nichols for identifying the weapon and bringing it to our

important to break the cycle and allow young Canadians the chance

respect its French speaking minority, that province cannot be a 
credible voice in the constitutional debate.
<P>
	Ontario still refuses to comply with section 23 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, thus denying the educational 
rights of its minority. Moreover, the Harris government made deep 
cuts in services to francophones. It reduced by 27 per cent the 
budget of the Office of Francophone Affairs. It also eliminated the 
Council for Franco-Ontarian Education and a number of other 
services provided in French.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Wednesday is national child day and there is no better gift 
to give children than literacy.
<P>
	Canada's children are among the most fortunate of the world and 
yet they may be facing an ever-increasingly complex world with a 
false sense of security. More than 40 per cent of Canada's current 
adult population do not have the literacy skills for today's 
information based economy and worse, many of these Canadians 
do not recognize that this is a problem. Young people are getting 
mixed messages on the home front about the value of education and 
may not understand that high level literacy skills can bring a 
personal joy as well as economic prosperity.
<P>
	Although it is a life-long process, literacy begins at birth and 
flourishes, we know, when reading is encouraged in the early years 
by parents in the home. It certainly does not help that the 
government is still forcing Canadian consumers to pay high GST 
on books for the family.
<P>
	We cannot change attitudes but we can change circumstances. 
Children are the key to this country's future and right now parents 
need to purchase books for their homes without punitive taxes. We 
can give the gift of literacy, the best tool for our future prosperity, a 
fresh start by helping parents read to their children.

	Today's report card shows that not only is the government not 
keeping to its commitment, it is making the situation worse. Since 
1989 the child poverty rate has increased by 46 per cent, bringing 
Canada's total of poverty-stricken children to 1.4 million, the 
second highest rate in the industrialized world.
<P>
	Clearly the Liberal government is not providing the solutions 
that Canadians need and want. Poor Canadians need jobs that pay a 
fair wage. They need universal child care and other resources to 
help them break free of the dependence cycle. Canadians need 
adequate and affordable housing and educational opportunities that 
are not biased against the poor.

	I urge the government to build on the experience of the first

	For example, the new one might deliberately set out to bring in 
private sector funds. Or it might be designed differently in different 
parts of the country to meet special regional needs. Or again, 
special priority could be given to projects which create jobs for 
young people. Yet again, a portion of the funds could be reserved

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is time for a 
fresh start for the next tiger on the Pacific rim, British Columbia. 
But predicted growth for B.C. this year is a sum total of zero. This 
can be directly attributed to the Liberals' high tax, high regulation 
and big government attitude toward one of Canada's most 
economically successful provinces.
<P>
	The government is choking one of the strongest regional 
economies in this country due to its unwillingness to listen and 
respond to the concerns of British Columbians. Generations of 
Liberals and Tories have sought to deny British Columbia its 
rightful status as an international trading power. They view B.C. as 
a hinterland which must fend for itself during the bad times and be 
exploited during the good times. Take from British Columbia and 
spend somewhere else.
<P>
	British Columbians know that electing Reformers to the House 
of Commons in the next election is in their best interests: people 
who are committed to delivering tax relief and who have a vision of 
British Columbia as Canada's economic tiger, the next tiger of the 
Pacific rim.

	According to the OECD, Canadian economic growth should rise

Crossley is the first carpet mill in Canada to receive this

only one of two carpet mills in all of North America to be

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the members of the board of directors of Canadian
<P>
Airlines resigned en masse on Friday, for fear of being held 
financially responsible in the event of a bankruptcy.
<P>
	The crisis at Canadian is blatant proof of the government's 
mistake in maintaining two international carriers in Canada with 
public funds. The Bloc Quebecois, it will be remembered, proposed 
the amalgamation of Air Canada and Canadian to ensure we would 
have a solid air carrier in Canada and to save as many jobs as 
possible.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister assure us today that his government is 
not intending to inject more money in Canadian, as his Minister of 
Transport has said on several occasions in recent weeks?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have nothing to add to what the Minister of Transport 
has said in the House. He is following the situation at the moment. 
The company, the union and other groups have held negotiations. 
The government is watching the situation, but I have nothing to add 
to what the Minister of Transport had to say ten days ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Transport had a bit more to say. I see that 
things are changing perhaps somewhat. The Minister of Transport 
told us that there was no question of more money being injected in 
the current situation. To my knowledge, the situation has worsened 
with the resignation of the board of directors.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> also pointed out on the weekend that the 
government was prepared to help Canadian if employees agreed to 
the company's restructuring plan, which included a salary cut of 10 
per cent.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister also assure us that his government is 
not getting ready to provide renewed assistance to Canadian should 
the employees agree to the restructuring plan?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker, the government has no 
intention of putting money into Canadian in this particular 
situation.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite spoke of the employees at Canadian. 
I think it is important for the House to know that the Minister of 
Transport had this to say to the Air Transportation Association of 
Canada in Montreal just a couple of hours ago. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I know it requires very difficult decisions from the employees-employees who 
have sacrificed much already. I have always been impressed by the dedication of 
Canadian Airlines employees, their commitment to quality, their commitment to 
service, and their belief in their airline. That dedication, and that spirit, will be just as 
crucial to Canadian's future as to its past.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Structural problems require structural solutions. The president of 
Canadian Airlines has brought them forward. We hope that Cana-
<P>
<HR>

<P>
dian Airlines is successful  and remains another one of our proud 
airlines in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have to assume that there is some slight problem, since 
the entire board of directors resigned. I would assume something is 
awry.
<P>
	The federal government has also, we think, made a mistake in 
allowing American Airlines to acquire a significant number of 
Canadian shares. This did not enable Canadian to become cost 
effective, as we have seen. On the contrary, this decision gives rise 
to concerns over American control of the air transportation 
industry.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister make a commitment to not change the 
legislation and the regulations in the air transportation sector, 
which would have the effect of allowing greater foreign, especially 
American, involvement in this sector?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadian Airlines has not come 
forward to this government with any proposal to increase foreign 
investment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In the event that Canadian, a major air carrier in Canada, goes 
bankrupt, the government would havet to decide on the 
redistribution of the international routes it currently holds.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister guarantee today that he will not allow 
foreign companies to get hold of these international routes and that 
he will preserve the Canadian character of this industry?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike the member opposite, this 
government is not going to practise the politics of division. We are 
going to hope that Canadian Airlines is successful. We do not want 
to look at the glass half empty, as the hon. member does so well.
<P>
	Canadian is doing the best job it can. Right now it is trying to 
restructure to ensure that it is a viable airline in this country, and 
that is what we are hoping for. We are not looking down the road at 
the failure that this hon. member hopes to see, obviously, in the 
way he has been questioning this government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, by not being forward looking to the future, this 
government is going to ensure that Canadian has no future 
whatsoever.
<P>
	Canadian's financial difficulties also directly affect the public 
purse, for the company has to repay loans from the federal 
government.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister commit to bring pressure to bear on 
Canadian as a debtor in order to encourage the only possible 
solution, namely amalgamation of Canadian and Air Canada, the 
only way to ensure the future of this industry and the only way to 
save thousands of jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadian Airlines, again we say, 
has brought forward a plan to restructure its airline. Let us have a 
look at the plan that President Kevin Benson has brought forward. 
Let us hope that the plan, in concert with the contributions that 
would be made by the employees of Canadian, would help to see 
this airline get back on its feet and be a viable competitor in the 
airline industry in this country.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHILDCARE">CHILD CARE</A></H3>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
national child day is on Wednesday, the government should take a 
look at a recent Angus Reid survey. It shows that 57 per cent of 
parents with young children work simply to make ends meet. A 
majority of those same people would like to have the freedom to 
have one parent stay at home with their kids if they could afford to 
do that.
<P>
	This government needs to make Canadian families a priority. It 
needs to lesson their tax burden and give parents back some choice 
in how they raise their own children.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Why will the government 
not convert the child care deduction into a tax credit and extend it 
to all parents with children 12 years or younger, including those 
parents who choose to raise their kids at home?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the reality of child poverty in 
this country, which is a rich country, is of course of major concern 
to the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Last week the Canadian Council on Social Development 
reported that most children in Canada are doing well. That is partly 
good news. However, we cannot ignore those children who actually 
live in poverty. This is why campaign 2000 recognized that the 
major reason for children not doing well is unemployment. For this  
reason, this government is insisting a great deal on improving the 
economic climate in this country. That is the way we will be able to 
do more.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6366"> 6366 </A></B>
<P>
	This government has already done quite a lot in the last few 
years. This government has doubled the working income 
supplement provided to low income families. The Canadian 
government spends more than $5 billion a year on child tax 
benefits that has been paid to three million Canadian families 
already.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the minister talks about campaign 2000, we have our own plan for 
that as well, and that is that every Canadian family would have a 
tax break of $2,000 by the year 2000. I think that would be far more 
practical.
<P>
	The Reform's fresh start platform makes Canadian families a 
priority. It will increase the spousal exemption by over $2,500 and 
extend child care deductions to all parents, including those who 
choose to raise their kids at home. That was my initial question and 
I did not hear anything like an answer for that, and so I will just ask 
it again.
<P>
	What sort of specific tax relief does the minister have to offer 
Canadian families?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	First, why will he not consider raising the spousal exemption, 
which would be a fairly simple thing to do, and second, to extend 
the child care deduction to all parents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member cares to take a look at the existing provisions for 
married families, as my colleague has said, first of all in the last 
budget we doubled the working income supplement for families 
with four children by $1,000. At the same time the married credit 
exists which reduces income taxes by as much as $1,500 a year. 
There is a special supplement out of the child tax benefit for 
parents who care for preschool children at home.
<P>
	The fact is if one takes a look at the vast range of policies 
introduced by this government and by previous Liberal 
governments, the hon. member will see that it is concern for 
children that has been upper most in the government's mind. If one 
would like to compare that to the vast majority of 
recommendations from the Reform Party, which would maintain 
the level of poverty as opposed to alleviating it, one would begin to 
understand that the line in the sand has been drawn and no amount 
of camouflage by the Reform Party will hide that.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
recommendation is that parents who choose to raise their kids at 
home up to age 12 should be celebrated, not just the preschool ones 
he talks about.
<P>
	The average Canadian family pays a staggering 46 per cent of its 
income in taxes. Children across the country  are living in families 
where both parents are stressed out from having to work nights and 
weekends to pay for this Liberal government's spending habits.
<P>
	Canadians have suffered a $3,000 pay cut since this government 
took office in 1993, and the finance minister knows that.
<P>
	Instead of being satisfied with the status quo of high taxes, why 
will the minister not simply balance the budget and then give 
Canadian families some much deserved, much needed tax relief?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
why does the hon. member not admit where she and her party are 
going to find the money to provide the tax cut for the rich? The first 
area in which they will find it is by abolishing the Canada pension 
plan which is very crucial for Canadian families. It is the principal 
source of support. Under the Reform Party the Canada pension plan 
will disappear.
<P>
	The second thing they will do is eliminate equalization for a 
number of provinces. Is she saying that people who live in 
Saskatchewan or Nova Scotia do not have families and are not 
entitled to the same level of public services as Canadians in other 
provinces?
<P>
	The Reform Party would eliminate the maternal benefits under 
the employment insurance program. Is the hon. member in the 
process of saying that people who are on employment insurance are 
not entitled to maternal benefits?
<P>
	Let us understand that what the Reform Party is suggesting is 
that in fact those programs which go to help low income families, 
families on welfare and middle income families would be gutted 
and eviscerated by the Reform Party in order to take care of the 
richer people in this country. This government will never accept 
that.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Before the House adjourned, probably looking for an excuse to 
extol the virtues of the employment insurance reform, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development stated, and I quote: ``Five 
hundred thousand Canadians who were not previously covered by 
unemployment insurance will now qualify''.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that, instead of more Canadian 
workers being covered, starting on January 1, 1997, some 500,000 
workers, mainly very low wage earners working fewer than 15 
hours per week, will start paying premiums they are not required to 
pay at present, while the vast majority of them will never receive 
benefits because they will not qualify?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6367"> 6367 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not a new issue. It has 
been raised time and time again. I must emphasize that the 
employment insurance reform promotes active measures, in 
contrast to the previous system, which was universally condemned 
as inefficient and encouraging people to stay at home.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	We now have a system ensuring that, by the year 2000 or 2001, 
the $800 million investment fund we are creating will be the sole 
source of funding. Those who work part time may of course pay 
premiums, but they will also be covered by the employment 
insurance system to the extent that they pay premiums.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has given workers earning between $39,000 and 
$42,500 and the businesses they work for a break on premium 
payments. The truth is that an additional 500,000 people will have 
to pay premiums.
<P>
	I would like the minister to tell me if he has read his 
department's paper on this and if he can confirm that only 45,000 
of these 500,000 new contributors, very low wage earners, will be 
eligible, as indicated in a paper released by his own department on 
January 23, 1996. Is that how the Liberals intend to fight poverty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will confirm this: Starting 
January 1, 1997, an additional 500,000 Canadians will be covered 
by unemployment insurance, while they were not previously, 
because they will now qualify for coverage under this system.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister often brags that Canadians are benefiting from lower 
interest rates. He claims that Canadians will buy more houses and 
more new cars, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars due to 
lower interest rates.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is what about those 
Canadians who cannot afford to buy a home or a new car and who 
work two or three jobs to feed their kids. What is the government 
going to do for those children who do without so much, including 
time with their parents who have to work so hard and so long to 
feed this hungry government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the fact is if the members of the Reform Party will take a look at 
what has happened over the course of the last three months in terms 
of the benefits of the reduction in interest rates, what they would 
see is that housing starts are up. They would see that the  
announcement came out today that manufacturing shipments are 
up. They would see that the basis of the economy is becoming 
stronger and stronger. And as a result of that, thousands of 
Canadians are going back to work and it is the families of those 
Canadians that are going to benefit.
<P>
	Over 700,000 new jobs have been created by the private sector; 
46,000 jobs were created last month alone by the private sector. 
The fact is these people who are going back to work will be able to 
provide for their families as a result of the economic conditions set 
in place by this government.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party, they who have no policy to 
increase employment, no economic philosophy designed to help 
the middle class in this country, should not stand up in the House 
and essentially say that we will live with the dual economy, that we 
will live with an economy that benefits the rich and ignores the 
poor.
<P>
	Canadians will not put up with it and neither will we.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it sad 
and unbelievable that this finance minister will stand up and brag 
about an unemployment rate of 10 per cent when the United States 
has an unemployment rate of 5 per cent.
<P>
	The Reform Party has brought forth a tax relief plan that will 
completely eliminate the tax burden of over 1 million Canadians. 
Our plan will leave more money in the pockets of these families to 
spend on groceries, rent and clothing.
<P>
	My question for the prime minister is specifically how and when 
will his government provide tax relief for Canadian families.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is quite the opposite. The Reform plan will not leave more money 
in the hands of average Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform plan will take away their pensions, it will take away 
their health care, it will take away welfare benefits for those who 
are at the lowest end. The fact is that what the Reform Party will do 
will gut the Canadian dream for the vast majority of those who 
depend on government for help.
<P>
	There is one other thing. The Reform Party ought to understand 
that what it is in fact advocating is a tax cut now and a massive tax 
increase for the next generation of Canadians. What it would do is 
impose on young Canadians a burden of deficit reduction, and we 
will not do that.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The minister, who is bent on implementing a new tariff structure, 
will release this week an impact study on the fee structure for 
services provided by the coast guard to commercial shipping. 
However, we have serious reservations about the credibility of this 
study, which we have with us, since it seems to have been drafted 
specifically to support the minister's intentions.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the study, which he commissioned, 
is nothing but a report to accommodate him, since it does not take 
into account several essential parameters, such as the increase in 
the price of oil in the east that will result from the new tariff 
structure, and the jobs that will be lost because of increased 
competition from American ports?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the committee that asked for the 
study, I am sure the hon. member is very much aware that the study 
is a very objective study. In fact, it is so objective that it has looked 
at seven of all the activities that impinge on ports and indeed the 
whole business of shipping.
<P>
	I will go a little further. This report looks at 1,200 critical 
movements of commodities in the Canadian shipping business and 
has examined a dozen or so of them in particular. It has consulted 
from coast to coast, many meetings in this country. I have met with 
the marine advisory board. I met with certain other sectors of the 
shipping industry to discuss the progress of this report.
<P>
	I have to tell the hon. member that despite his misgivings it is a 
very objective report carried out by a very credible third party with 
no connections to the government. It was done at the behest of the 
committee on which the hon. member serves. He will be apprised 
of the results when it is completed in the very near future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the 
minister accept a study which says the impact of its tariff structure 
will be negligible, considering that, for example, this new tax will 
reduce by 15 per cent the profits of iron ore companies on the north 
shore and will result in the closure of the Port-Cartier mine two or 
three years earlier than expected, thus worsening the 
unemployment situation in a region that is already hard hit?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps I will say it in another manner. The hon.
<P>
member is aware of the objectivity of this study. It has examined 
seven aspects that impact on the marine transportation business in 
this country and on the commodities. In fact, the 1,200 runs I talked 
about cover almost 90 per cent of all the commodity runs by 
shipping in this country.
<P>
	I see the hon. member smiling. I do not know where he is getting 
his figures with respect to Port Cartier and its closing down, but it 
is impossible to measure every single aspect. I remind him that the 
study that was done was done at the request, in fact at the 
insistence, of the committee on which he serves.
<P>
	We are responding to the request of the committee, of which he 
is a member. The results are objective and the study will show that 
there are some conclusions that he will be able to study in the very

competitive industry, I do question why the minister did this 
without first levelling the playing field on federal fuel taxes.
<P>

American competitors have significantly lower fuel taxes and that 
fuel costs are a major component of an airline's operating expense, 
will the minister take immediate steps to lower the tax on aviation

	The member also spoke of the open skies agreement that has 
taken place between Canada and the U.S. Let us look at what it has 
done. It has created 100 new scheduled transborder routes, 24 new 
routes by Canadian air carriers, 33 Canadian air carrier flights 
which are now scheduled flights, 54 new U.S.-
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="6369"> 6369 </A></B>
<P>
	It has created 54 new U.S. destinations non-stop from nine 
Canadian cities. For Air Canada there are 1,000 new jobs. For 
Canadian Airlines there are 700 new jobs. It is a good news 
scenario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very interesting that the parliamentary secretary talks 
about 700 new jobs at Canadian when 16,000 are in jeopardy 
through its policies.
<P>
	This government supported free trade with the U.S.A. and open 
skies with American airline companies, both of which have 
increased competition against Canadian companies. Airport and air 
navigation service deficits are now nearing full elimination.
<P>
	Given the government's agenda to open the borders to American 
competition and the removal of many aviation oriented expenses to 
the government, can the minister advise this House why he 
continues to allow aviation companies to be charged an unfair level 
of special taxes, taxes that are destroying Canadian Airlines and 
putting 16,000 jobs at risk?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is asking a 
question that deals with two subject matters.
<P>
	Quite frankly, when he talks about 16,000 jobs being at risk, this 
has to do with an airline called Canadian that is trying to restructure 
its organization, trying to make a viable airline of itself.
<P>
	I am surprised by the remarks from the Reform Party because it 
is the Reform Party itself, the member for Calgary Centre who said 
that there is no viability in making cash flow from the government 
to Canadian Airlines. That is not what Canadian Airlines is asking 
for. It is not asking for anything more than the time it needs to 
restructure its organization in order to save those 16,500 jobs.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my

<P>
	Last November 13, Marcel Audet, an RCMP informant, revealed 
that he had arranged, on behalf of the RCMP, to buy cases of 
machine guns, explosives, grenades and even rocket launchers with 
arms traffickers associated with the Akwesasne reserve.
<P>
	Since it is worrisome, to say the least, to know that an individual 
can purchase rocket launchers in Canada, can the minister confirm 
whether the Akwesasne reserve is still an important point of entry 
for arms traffic and can he tell us what his services have done to 
stop these illegal activities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada,  Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I am unable to give such a confirmation. The problem is not 
confined to one location, but police forces, both federal and 
provincial, are working jointly to tackle this situation. They are 
making extraordinary efforts to limit this situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a supplementary.
<P>
	Still according to Marcel Audet, ``senior officials'' in the RCMP

dangerous traffickers when it was possible to do so?

	Today we will be signing a free trade agreement with Chile in

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

Prime Minister signed a protocol on a free trade agreement that 
will bring about tremendous new momentum in terms of trade and 
investment between our two countries. That will lead to jobs and 
economic growth for both Chile and Canada.
<P>
	Immediately, Canadian exporters will no longer face an 11 per 
cent duty when their goods and services go over the border. This 
will give them a considerable cost advantage. More secure 
investment can now be obtained in Chile for Canadians.
<P>
	All of this will be in advance of when Chile comes into the 
NAFTA, giving Canada a head start on our friends in the United 
States who hopefully will now come to the table to bring Chile into 
the NAFTA and complete the arrangement the Prime Minister was 
a part of just four years ago. This will lead to hemispheric free

<P>
	The hon. member ought to be aware the decision was reached not

information would not be forthcoming. That goes back well before 
we became part of this particular government.

	If the hon. member has a specific question on a specific point in

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Last week we learned that the government has once again 
refused to provide documents vital to the needs of the Krever 
inquiry. These documents, which date back to 1984, could provide 
details to the commissioners on the circumstances underlying the 
crisis.
<P>
	Would the minister tell us why the government is refusing to 
provide the Krever commission with the documents requested of 
it?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I think we ought to be clear here. This government has provided 
literally hundreds and hundreds of documents to the Krever 
inquiry. Numerous individuals from various departments have 
provided testimony under oath to the Krever inquiry.
<P>
	I believe the documents in question go back to 1984-85. If there 
are specific concerns or requests that the hon. member has, as I 
indicated in my previous answer, the clerk of the Privy Council, 
where the decision has been made-it was not by the Minister of 
Health-will provide the necessary information to the hon. 
member.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would

provide him with what he has asked for?

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I certainly disagree with the premise of the hon. member's

<P>
	First and foremost, the Government of Canada has provided a 
great deal of information. All of the information that I have within 
my purview I believe has been provided. However, if there is a 
specific request, the decision has been made by the clerk of the 
Privy Council and that is where the question should be posed. That 
is where the written question should be posed. I am sure the clerk 
will provide the information to the hon. member.

is very clear that underlying the hon. member's question is a deep 
feeling of resentment that Atlantic Canada is getting its act 
together.
<P>
	What is very clear is that the hon. member simply cannot stand 
to see those provincial governments on behalf of their populations 
in co-operation with the federal government providing a base for 
sound taxation and competitiveness of their small and medium size

	I would have thought that the hon. member, in support of

those provincial governments because what they are doing is 
saying they do not want dependence. What they really want to do 
is to be able to govern for the benefit of their own populations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
a lot of resentment out there but it comes from all the other 
provinces that are footing the bill for the billion dollar payoff to 
Atlantic Canada, especially to the premiers.
<P>
	The Halifax chamber of commerce is also resentful. So is the 
Retail Council of Canada and the Canadian Real Estate 
Association. They all have grave concerns with this deal. It is 
complicated, confusing and a killer of jobs.
<P>
	Even those groups who before were supportive of the 
harmonization deal now have grave reservations about this 
particular brand of snake oil. Will the minister scrap it and go back 
to the drawing board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member ought to know, the fact is that we have told the 
retail council that we will sit down and work out any administrative 
glitches. In fact, we are in the process of doing that.
<P>
	That again is not what the hon. member is really driving at. What 
he stood up and said was why should Atlantic Canada be able to 
benefit when the rest of the country does not in this particular deal. 
The fact is that Atlantic Canadians did not stand up and complain 
when the minister of energy dealt with the tarsands in Alberta. 
Atlantic Canada did not stand up and complain when Ontario was 
provided with stabilization payments.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

unemployment rate at 10 per cent is too high, but I think we should 
remember that since we have come into office we have helped to 
create about 700,000 jobs. The unemployment rate has decreased 
from 11.4 per cent to the present 10 per cent.
<P>
	The best way in which a government can help to decrease that 
unemployment rate is obviously by helping to decrease interest 
rates. We now have the lowest  interest rates in 30 years which of 
course helps investment and creates jobs.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has created jobs, probably more than 
110,000. We are still in the process of considering the pros and

	During the meeting of the Asia-Pacific group, I will certainly be 
meeting on a number of occasions with other ministers of foreign 
affairs to discuss human rights issues in that region of the

there is nothing Canada can do about it.

However, I have in my hand an internal DFO document written by 
the minister's own bureaucrat responsible for counting fish in 
Newfoundland. It reads: ``I know of no subsequent scientific 
analysis that has updated the assessment of 2J-3KL stocks. I was 
therefore quite dismayed that a recreational food fishery will be 
allowed''.
<P>
	Now that we know that no scientific evidence exists to justify the

different pieces of advice. I have to tell the hon. member that this 
particular memo which I have not read because it was not 
addressed to me was addressed internally.
<P>
	I went ahead with the food fishery on the basis of the advice 
from my senior scientist. The advice was that a closely controlled 
food fishery like the one which was implemented and executed 
with lots of surveillance would not impede recovery of the cod 
stock. That came from my senior scientist and it was on that basis 
that I went ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister said 
that the food fishery was opened up based on scientific evidence 
and analysis. The conclusion of this letter is: ``I am disappointed 
and disheartened that important decisions are being made that 
disregard the scientific advice from this region''.

more forcefully that the advice I got from my scientist was that a

impede the recovery of the cod stocks.

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to a great Canadian, a former provincial 
premier, an eminent jurist and a dear friend.
<P>
	Joe Ghiz was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island in 
January 1945. He was educated at Dalhousie University where he 
obtained degrees in commerce and law, and thereafter obtained a 
master's law from Harvard University in Boston.
<P>
	Each of us will hold a different memory of Joe Ghiz. We might 
recall his passion for this country and his devotion to keeping it 
united and strong. We will think of how a premier from Canada's 
smallest province contributed in such a way, a significant way if 
you will, to the public policy process of the country.
<P>
	We might recall how his father was a shopkeeper, an immigrant 
from Lebanon. We might also think of his passion for 
constitutional reform and how he pursued that goal so fervently; 
how his love for his country characterized both his private and, yes, 
his public life.
<P>
	Or we might think of the islanders he represented as premier, 
constituents who knew that when Premier Ghiz went to Ottawa he 
was there to fight on their behalf.
<P>
	Our individual memories of this remarkable man reflect the 
depth of this contributions to our country. His ability to balance 
regional interests with the good of the country was not only 
remarkable, it was refreshing.
<P>
	At 51 years of age the contributions of Joseph Ghiz far 
outstripped his years. We cannot help but pause and regret that he 
has passed at such a young age.
<P>
	As a friend he was generous with his kindnesses and generous 
with his time.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	He was acclaimed as one of Canada's greatest orators but he was 
also a great listener. He was a serious man who believed very 
strongly in his views. He never took himself seriously. His sense of 
humour was engaging and it was genuine. He has left with us a 
marker for our identity as a nation, the duality of interest that pulls 
a British Columbian out of B.C., a Manitoban out of Manitoba, a 
Quebecer out of Quebec and, yes, an islander out of Prince Edward 
Island.
<P>
	Joseph Ghiz will always be remembered as an islander, but it is 
for his contribution to Canada and to the unity of our country that 
we stand in tribute for him today.
<P>
	On behalf of the Government of Canada, I wish to join with 
many Canadians and members in this House in offering my deepest 
condolences to his wife Rose Ellen, his daughter Joanne and his son 
Robert, and to assure them that he will be remembered and be 
remembered with great affection.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, speaking on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I want to pay 
tribute to Joe Ghiz, Premier of Prince Edward Island from 1986 to 
1992, who passed away recently.
<P>
	Born in 1945 to parents of modest means, he was the eldest of 
five children. He was a law student at Dalhousie University, where 
he graduated with top honours.
<P>
	This Premier was particularly well-known for his work on 
constitutional matters and his defence of the rights of francophones 
when he improved the francophone school system in his province. 
He had also hoped to conclude a treaty of reconciliation with the 
native people. Under his government, the smallest province in 
Confederation enjoyed exceptional visibility.
<P>
	More than anyone else in English Canada, he defended special 
status for Quebec. In January 1995 at McGill University, at a 
seminar on the future of Canada, he said that since the quiet 
revolution, English Canada had not understood the legitimacy of 
the aspirations of the people and the government of Quebec, hence 
the failure of Meech and Charlottetown. People criticized Quebec's 
veto, although the accord granted the same privilege to Prince 
Edward Island. People criticized the concept of Quebec as a 
distinct society but there was no objection to his province having 
special status regarding the number of members of Parliament it 
could elect, irrespective of its population. When Quebec got 
something from the federal government, it made the headlines in 
English Canada, but there were no headlines in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
when the federal government moved 2,000 jobs from Ottawa to 
Summerside and Charlottetown.
<P>
	Mr. Ghiz understood Quebec. Unfortunately, his premature 
decease has bereft English Canada of a voice for moderation, of a 
man who understood the Quebec people and their political 
aspirations.
<P>
	Speaking on behalf of my colleagues in the official opposition, I 
wish to extend my sincere condolences to the family and relatives 
of Mr. Ghiz.

mentioned some of Mr. Ghiz's political aspects and aspects of his 
legal career. What I would like to do is just make a few personal 
comments in terms of my association with Mr. Ghiz on more than 
one occasion.
<P>
	I had the opportunity work with Mr. Ghiz specifically during the 
Meech Lake negotiations in 1990. I found that in the formal and 
informal associations that we had and  the conversations at that 
time I came to understand his political objectives, his concern for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6374"> 6374 </A></B>
<P>
Canada and certainly his own personal story which was often 
brought into a variety of situations and discussions at a time when 
we were negotiating the future of Canada.
<P>
	I remember that one day after a lot of meetings and discussion, 
some of us were together to talk informally and sat together to 
unwind. In that conversation I remember Mr. Ghiz in an informal, 
interesting and entertaining way telling of his father's corner 
grocery store and how the son of a Lebanese immigrant could grow 
up, receive a law degree and become premier in this country of ours 
that he so lovingly and compassionately called Canada.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	For Mr. Ghiz, Joe, Canada was a land of freedom and 
opportunity where everybody had a chance to achieve their own 
personal dreams just like he was able to during his short period of 
time on this earth.
<P>
	I know many people, and in our personal conversations I found 
him to be a warm, considerate, down to earth person who genuinely 
cared about other people's families, their communities and 
certainly their personal concerns. In his own humble way he 
wanted to build a nation and find a place in that nation for Prince 
Edward Island.
<P>
	Today we offer the sympathies and prayers of all of us in Canada 
to his wife and children at his home. He will be long remembered, 
and his contribution will be remembered specifically by those in 
Prince Edward Island, but all other Canadians who associated with 
him will never forget Mr. Joe Ghiz.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I permit myself a few words on your 
behalf. I too knew Joe Ghiz personally. When you are in opposition 
and you travel around the country, it is not always that a premier 
receives you in his office. But he did that for me on a visit to his 
island.
<P>
	Reference has been made by other parliamentarians to the fact 
that he came from Prince Edward Island, undoubtedly the smallest 
province in Canada. But on your behalf I note that not only did he 
come from our smallest province but our smallest province gave us 
one of our biggest Canadians.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THELATETOMBELL">THE LATE TOM BELL</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
my colleague, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, and the 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada I would like to extend 
our sincere condolences to the family of the late Tom Bell. His 
passing is a great loss for New Brunswickers and all Canadians. He 
suffered for a long time with his debilitating disease and he is now 
at rest.
<P>
	Tom Bell was a quiet, gentle, caring man who touched the lives 
of all those who knew him. He left an indelible mark on the hearts 
of many of us. He was a personal friend. Tom always had a smile 
on his face. Tom left us with his distinguished record of service and 
many fond memories of the times we shared with him. The judge 
with the big heart will not easily be forgotten.
<P>
	Tom's career began in my home city of Saint John where he was 
born in 1923. He grew up in the city, married his wife Patricia, and 
attended the University of New Brunswick. During the second 
world war Tom served in the merchant navy and always remained 
deeply committed to the welfare of our veterans. The merchant 
navy men had an honour guard for him at his funeral which I had 
the honour to attend. He was a long time member of the Royal 
Canadian Legion as well.
<P>
	Tom was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1951 and began his 
law practice in Saint John. In 1953 his career took a turn and he 
decided to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, who had 
represented Saint John in Parliament for 10 years, from 1925 to 
1935.
<P>
	Tom ran for the Progressive Conservative nomination in 1953 in 
the federal riding of Saint John-Albert, as it was known then. He 
was elected to the House of Commons in 1953 and was re-elected 
seven times, in 1957, 1958, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1968 and 1972. 
During his distinguished 20 year parliamentary career he served as 
parliamentary assistant to the minister of trade and commerce, 
parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, opposition House 
leader and party whip.
<P>
	From 1956 to 1958 Tom was president of the Young Progressive 
Conservatives. His parliamentary career lasted through the terms 
of four Prime Minister, Louis St-Laurent, John Diefenbaker, Lester 
Pearson and Pierre Trudeau.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	I remember a conversation I had with a senior Liberal senator 
last year who talked about Tom Bell. He said: ``Politics is not like it 
used to be during our time, Elsie''. The senator said that he and 
Tom would stand in the House, point fingers and debate, but at the 
end of the day they would sit down over coffee and discuss together 
how they could help their people in the region.
<P>
	In 1974 Tom Bell left federal politics. He was appointed to the 
provincial court where he presided over the family, youth and 
traffic courts for 20 years. The people of Saint John lost a great 
member of Parliament, but gained an honest and fair judge. Despite 
his career change, he remained as deeply committed to his 
constituents and to his community as the day he was first elected.
<P>
	He was a member of the Carleton and York Club and an active 
member of the Trinity Anglican Church. He was a former member 
of the Kiwanis Club, the Byng Boys Club of Saint John, the 26th 
Battalion Overseas Association and chairman of the board of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6375"> 6375 </A></B>
<P>
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island division of the Canadian 
Corps of Commissioners.
<P>
	The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was honoured to 
be represented by such a great man. Tom Bell set an example not 
just for our party, but for all politicians, personally and 
professionally. He was a man of integrity.
<P>
	Our thoughts and prayers go out to Tom's family, his wife 
Patricia, his sons Michael, Andrew and James, his daughter 
Melanie, his brothers Robert and Lawrence and his many nieces, 
nephews and cousins.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week, like all Canadians, I was deeply saddened to learn that Judge 
Tom Bell, a fellow New Brunswicker, had passed away.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to express my condolences 
and the condolences of the Liberal Party and of all of our Liberal 
colleagues to his wife Patricia and to their four children, Michael, 
Andrew, James and Melanie, whom I have known for many years 
and have had the pleasure to teach, and to his brothers, Robert and 
Lawrence.
<P>
	Tom Bell was elected in 1953 to represent the riding of Saint 
John-Albert, which is now part of my riding of Fundy-Royal, 
where, as my hon. colleague from Saint John has just said, he went 
on to serve seven consecutive terms as the member of Parliament, 
spanning more than 20 years.
<P>
	During his political career he served in numerous positions. He 
was the opposition House leader, the party whip and the 
parliamentary secretary to the ministers of industry and justice.
<P>
	We younger members of Parliament are sometimes told that 
things were different in the old days. We are told that, even when 
debate in the Chamber became heated, outside it was civility and 
courtesy that prevailed. Often when we are told this, we are told 
that the reason for this was that there were leading members like 
Tom Bell.
<P>
	Tom Bell was that kind of member who could be vigorous with 
his advocates, vigorous on behalf of his constituency and vigorous 
on behalf of his region and his party in this House. Harsh things 
could be said in debate, but afterward they were not only fully 
prepared to relax and talk things over with colleagues and 
adversaries alike, if they were like Tom Bell they sought out their 
fellow members, regardless of their political affiliation.
<P>
	It was for that reason that Tom Bell had only friends here. A 
tough partisan in the House, outside he was a convivial and wise 
friend and counsellor to all.
<P>
	On leaving politics he was appointed a provincial court judge, 
where he served the people of Saint John for 20 or more years, 
presiding over family, youth and traffic courts, as well as carrying 
out general provincial court work.
<P>
	He is remembered as the gentle judge, as someone who always 
maintained a positive demeanour and who took an avid interest in 
those who came before him. Many will remember him fondly for 
his humour, his wit, his enthusiasm and his positive outlook.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Judge Bell had strong ties to his community. He was a lifelong 
member of branch 14 of the Royal Canadian Legion. He belonged 
to the Carleton and York Club and he was a former member of the 
Kiwanis Club. He was the former chairman of the 26th Battalion 
Overseas Association, president of the Byng Boys Club of Saint 
John and chairman of the board of the New Brunswick and Prince 
Edward Island division of the Canadian Corps of Commissionaires.
<P>
	I first became interested in politics in my early teens and it was 
Tom Bell, his stature and his integrity, that inspired me to look on 
politics as an honourable profession. I know that even members of 
my family supported Tom Bell, the man, in spite of political 
affiliation.
<P>
	I knew Tom Bell and of his commitment to his family, his God 
and his country which is unrivalled and unsurpassed in Saint John. 
I am proud and honoured to have known him and our community is 
richer for his life which lives on in a better New Brunswick.
<P>
	Perhaps Dennis Boyle, a Saint John lawyer, summed it up best 
when he said that the community will be a poor place because of 
this loss, but it will be a better place because he was in it. With his 
passing last week, our country has lost a great public servant and 
we will all miss him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
my colleagues of the Reform Party and all parliamentarians, I 
would like to join in the tribute to Thomas Miller Bell.
<P>
	Mr. Bell passed away after a long illness on Tuesday, November 
12, 1996 at the age of 73. Thomas Bell was born in Saint John, New 
Brunswick on January 11, 1923. He served in the merchant navy in 
World War II, sailing in the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean and 
in the Far East. After the war, he played an active role in the 
welfare of veterans and was a long-time member of the Royal 
Canadian Legion, branch No. 14. He received his law degree from 
the University of New Brunswick at Saint John in 1951 and worked 
as a barrister at law for several years.
<P>
	Tom Bell had a long and distinguished career in this House. He 
was first elected in 1953 in the riding of Saint John-Albert. He 
was re-elected seven times. He was appointed to several positions 
both in opposition and the  government such as the parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of trade and commerce in August 1957 
and parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice in 1959. He 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6376"> 6376 </A></B>
<P>
also served as the opposition whip from 1968 to 1973 and as the 
opposition House leader from 1973 to 1974.
<P>
	After his service in this House, he was appointed to the bench in 
1974 where he was known as the gentle judge. He presided over 
family, youth and traffic courts as well as general provincial court 
work.
<P>
	Everyone who knew Tom Bell has fond memories of this 
outstanding individual. He was best known for his sense of humour 
and his unwavering commitment to the community.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament, he modestly and quietly supported 
his constituents, whether it was representing them here in Ottawa 
or meeting with them in his riding.
<P>
	As a judge, he upheld the spirit of the law, never losing sight of 
what was best for the individual or the community. He was known 
for saying: ``Do what is proper and people will acknowledge it''. I 
am certain that those who knew him have acknowledged all that he 
did for the people he served.
<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues in the Reform Party, I would like to 
extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Patricia, his sons 
Michael, Andrew and James, his daughter Melanie, his brothers 
Robert and Lawrence and other members of his family. His 
presence will be sadly missed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I inadvertently did not see one of our 
colleagues who wanted to pay tribute to Joe Ghiz. Would you give 
me permission to re-open tributes to Mr. Ghiz?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of my colleague, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, and 
the Progressive Conservative Party to pay tribute to the late Joe 
Ghiz.
<P>
	We wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Ghiz's wife 
Rose Ellen, his mother Marguerite and his children Robert and 
Joanne.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	The nation shares in their grief. Canadians strongly admired Mr. 
Ghiz's commitment to the people of Prince Edward Island and the 
people of Canada. Canada has lost one of our strongest defenders.
<P>
	Mr. Ghiz became leader of the official opposition in 1982 and 
premier from 1986 to 1993. Following his departure from public 
politics, he was appointed as a provincial supreme court judge.
<P>
	He will be remembered in Prince Edward Island as the man who 
signed the deal that built a bridge from the island to the mainland. 
It was one of Mr. Ghiz's dreams but he built many bridges in our 
Canada of today.
<P>
	Across Canada he will be remembered for his tireless support of 
the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords and his support of a 
united Canada. The failure of both accords was a severe blow to 
him. Yet despite these setbacks he was always viewed by islanders 
and Canadians from coast to coast as a winner.
<P>
	It is always tragic when someone leaves us so young. This 
country has lost a great Canadian too soon.
<P>
	Members of the Progressive Conservative Party extend their 
prayers to the family of Joe Ghiz. He was a great man and he will 
be greatly missed.

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official languages, 
the second report of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
entitled ``Streamlining Environmental Regulation for Mining: 
Final Report'', an interim report having been tabled in December 
1995.
<P>
	The report reiterates the government's commitment to protection 
of the environment and suggests a number of initiatives to 
encourage mining investment through greater regulatory clarity, 
certainty and efficiency.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, the committee requests that the 
government table a comprehensive response thereto within 150 
days.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="USERFEEACT">USER FEE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-349, an act to provide for parliamentary scrutiny 
and approval of user fees set by federal authority and to require 
public disclosure of the amount collected as user fees.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to introduce 
my private member's bill, the user fee act. In the last 10 years user 
fees have doubled in the amount the government collects.
<P>
	Many people are concerned that in the last several years as the 
public service has come under increased scrutiny, many 
government agencies are using their abilities to increase user fees 
to become profit centres for the government. In doing that they 
avoid being chopped. This is a big concern of many people and 
myself.
<P>
	In the 1993 auditor general's report it is stated: ``We are 
concerned that Parliament cannot readily scrutinize the user fees 
established by contracts and other non-regulatory means. There 
does not exist a government-wide summary of the fees being 
charged, the revenues raised and the authorities under which they 
are established''.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Probably the best example of how user pay without user say has 
gone awry is the case of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency. 
Its budget has gone from $14.2 million in 1994 to $34 million in 
1996, chiefly because there has not been parliamentary scrutiny of 
what is going on in bodies like this.
<P>
	I would urge my fellow colleagues to read the legislation and if 
they have questions to contact me and hopefully they will 
ultimately support it.

<P>
	The first is from Saint John, New Brunswick. The petitioners 
would like to draw to the attention of the House that police and 
firefighters place their lives at risk on a daily basis as they serve the 
emergency needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	They also state that in many cases the families are left without 
sufficient financial means to meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and 
bequests for the benefit of families of police officers and 
firefighters who are killed in the line of duty.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from Oshawa, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to assist families that choose to provide care in the home

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
final petition comes from Mount Albert, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health 
problems or impair one's ability, and specifically, that fetal alcohol 
syndrome or other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

	There are 4,028 signatures here for a total of 5,528 signatures of 
petitioners from my riding. That represents 10 per cent of the

petition signed by more than 1,700 citizens of Peterborough 
county, mainly residents of the townships of Belmont-Methuen and 
Asphodel and the villages of Havelock and Norwood.
<P>
	These are quite isolated communities which tend to fall between 
the cracks in terms of police and telephone services. A pedophile 
was recently released into one of these communities.
<P>
	The petitions ask that the legislation be changed so that repeat 
sex offenders are never released from any correctional facility. 
Changing the legislation would prevent a repeat offender from 
moving into any neighbourhood.

urge all levels of government to demonstrate their support of 
education and literacy by eliminating the sales tax from reading 
materials. That is from petitioners in British Columbia.

<P>
Question No. 72-<B>Mr. Morrison:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Regarding the results based reporting using CIDA's program priorities: (<I>a</I>) what 
methodology is used in reporting the results by program priority of CIDA's bilateral 
disbursements in the 1996-97 main estimates part III, (<I>b</I>) how does CIDA decide 
how much to allocate to each priority, (<I>c</I>) how will the results from last year's 
expenditures affect next year's disbursements, (<I>d</I>) how can the 21.4 per cent of 
bilateral disbursements that went to meeting basic human needs, according to the 
estimates, be traced back to the actual contributions, service contracts, et cetera in 
order to utilize lessons learned over the years, and (<I>e</I>) why are CIDA's program 
priorities not applied in the countries in transition program?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> a) CIDA has 
set up a system to track disbursements for the six program 
priorities identified in the government's 1995 policy statement, 
``Canada in the World.'' CIDA officers code projects according to 
these priorities; if a project addresses more than one, percentages 
of the project according disbursements are allocated to each of the 
priorities it addresses. At the end of each year, this weighting is 
used to measure disbursements for each priority. In sum, CIDA is 
collecting data on the disbursement of aid by priority, at both the 
branch and agency levels.
<P>
	A bilateral project performance review system is also being 
established to assist managers and staff with managing for results, 
learning from experience and reporting on achievements. Two

components of this new  system are a framework of results and key 
success factors, which will be used to assess project performance, 
and a set of assessment tools. This new system will also allow 
CIDA to report on the results of its bilateral activities by program 
priority.
<P>
	b) The government has set a target of 25 per cent of official 
development assistance, ODA, to be channelled to basic human 
needs. CIDA programming is being monitored to ensure that we 
continue to make progress toward meeting this target. Allocation 
targets have not been set for the remaining priorities. Rather, funds 
are allocated on a geographic basis, with increasing emphasis on 
selected low income countries. Country and regional programs are 
being designed or modified in view of CIDA's six program 
priorities, with consideration to the development needs and 
priorities of the country or countries involved.
<P>
	c) Most projects are implemented over a three to five year 
period. In the shorter term, however, project audits, evaluations, 
and ongoing monitoring provide feedback which is used to adjust 
projects where necessary.
<P>
	d) CIDA codes its projects according to its six program 
priorities. Monitoring, audits and evaluations are carried out on 
projects to identify lessons which are related to these priorities. 
CIDA has also begun a performance review of its programming in 
basic human needs which will bring together lessons from a wide 
range of projects and programs.
<P>
	e) The six program priorities set out in ``Canada in the World'' 
apply to the ODA program. ODA is defined by the development 
assistance committee of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, OECD, as funding transferred ``to 
developing countries and multilateral institutions provided by 
official (government) agencies-which meets the following tests: 
(i) it is administered with the promotion of the economic 
development and welfare of developing countries as its main 
objective; and (ii) it is concessional in character and conveys a 
grant element of at least 25 per cent.
<P>
	Most of the assistance provided to the countries of central and 
eastern Europe-countries in transition-is not ODA. Only a few 
countries in the former Soviet bloc are classified as ``developing''. 
It is therefore not subject to the six ODA priorities established by 
``Canada in the World.'' Nevertheless, the program integrates 
many of CIDA's priorities, including governance, human rights and 
democratic development, the environment and women in 
development.
<P>
	It should be noted, that, although responsibility for delivering 
the program for central and eastern Europe was transferred to 
CIDA by ``Canada in the World'', the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade continues to be responsible for its 
overall policy direction.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I request leave for an 
emergency debate on the future of Canadian Airlines International.
<P>
	As you probably know, this company is facing a major crisis. 
Last Friday, November 15, the board of directors announced that 
they were all resigning, because they feared they might be held 
financially responsible in case of a bankruptcy.
<P>
	These last few years, significant efforts have been made by 
employees, governments and investors to try and save the 
company. In 1992, a major $1.6 billion restructuring plan was 
implemented, which included the conversion of $800 million in 
debt into capital stock, a $246 million investment from American 
Airlines, a $200 million contribution by the employees, $120 
million in government loans, the buy-back of three Airbus planes 
by the federal government for some $150 million when their 
market value was less than half that amount, a $40 million service 
contract for these three planes, the federal government's 
commitment to protect Canadian Airlines' monopoly over the most 
profitable routes in Asia, et cetera.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6380"> 6380 </A></B>
<P>
	However, we have to acknowledge that the company still 
continues to be buried under huge debts, and financial assistance 
from the federal government will not help the airlines out of this 
fix. Despite all the favours granted and efforts made by the 
government, profits still seem out of Canadian Airlines' reach.
<P>
	The federal government cannot witness this disaster and do 
nothing. Bankruptcy would mean the loss of more than 16,400 jobs 
throughout Canada and the transfer of thousands of jobs from 
Canada to the United States, for instance.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	So, consideration of the future of Canadian Airlines 
International is urgently required. Such an emergency debate 
would emphasize the opportunities provided to both Canadian and 
Quebec parliamentarians and make public the government 
guidelines in order to avoid a major upheaval in the Canadian air 
transport industry.
<P>
	I therefore ask, Mr. Speaker, that you consider favourably my 
request for an emergency debate.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I did receive the notice you 
sent me earlier today. Although this is a very important matter, I do 
not think it meets the requirements for the House to hold an 
emergency debate for the time being.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to report to you and the House the remarkable 
events of the last week and the reasons that Canada decided to take 
the lead in putting together a mission to bring aid to the starving 
masses of refugees in central Africa.
<P>
	As everyone knows, the situation on the ground has improved 
dramatically since our initiative was launched last week. Refugees 
in the hundreds of thousands have crossed the border back to 
Rwanda. This change is due in large part to the resolve shown by 
the international community under the leadership of Canada.
<P>
	Much has been written and said about the actions of our 
government, about our decision to try to break the logjam at the 
United Nations, to galvanize the international community into 
action and to offer Canadian leadership for a dangerous but 
essential international mission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But when all is said and done, the basic fact is that Canada acted 
because it was the decent, human thing to do. We acted because two 
world wars and forty years of peace keeping have taught us that the 
world cannot turn its back on turmoil and disaster.
<P>
	We acted because deeply ingrained in our very being as 
Canadians is a very clear and basic understanding that we are 
citizens of the world, that we take that citizenship very seriously, 
and that when it is time to stand up and be counted, Canada is there.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the way it was through two world wars and 40 years of 
peacekeeping. As the most privileged of nations we have 
understood and valued the responsibility of world citizenship.
<P>
	There is no mystery to this impulse, no calculation, no posturing. 
The government felt it. The leaders of the four opposition parties, 
whom we consulted, felt it. The men and women of our armed 
forces, who without hesitation stood ready to take the lead, felt it. 
Our diplomats in posts around the world and public servants in 
foreign affairs, national defence and CIDA, who helped plan and 
organize this initiative, felt it. People across the country felt it.
<P>
	Therefore, the government decision to act, to appeal to the 
international community, was not a difficult one. It was not taken 
lightly. Committing men and women to dangerous situations, even 
as part of a large international force, can never be taken lightly. It 
was the natural thing to do. It was arrived at without fanfare, 
without drama and breast beating, but in the typical, understated, 
matter of fact Canadian way. There was a job to be done and we 
were ready to do it.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So in itself, our decision was not remarkable. What was 
remarkable was the reaction of the international community. I wish 
every Canadian could have listened into the telephone 
conversations I had last week with the leaders of other nations.
<P>
	From the leaders of the wealthiest, most powerful countries to 
the leaders of small, developing nations, including United Nations 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the reaction was 
consistent and powerful: Canada's identity as a peacekeeper, as an 
honest broker, as a force for decency and humanity around the 
world-again and again this is what the world's leaders told me.
<P>
	Sometimes it is useful to raise our heads, clear our minds, and 
see ourselves as the world sees us. Last week, in our appeals to the 
nations of the world, in our presence at the United Nations, in the 
quick and responsive moves of General Baril and his colleagues, 
the  world saw a voice for reason and compassion. A new world 
nation, without the burdens of history that weigh so many nations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6381"> 6381 </A></B>
<P>
down. A diverse, bilingual country that knows the importance of 
accommodation and understanding.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They saw a country that had no self-interest in its call for action, 
that had a proven record in peacekeeping and sensitive military 
operations, that had the credibility to pull together an international 
effort and the ability to execute it.
<P>
	They understand that our history, our experience, our reality 
made us uniquely suited to this urgent task, a country without 
colonial past in Africa, a bilingual country with links to and an 
ability to operate in this French speaking corner of the world, an 
international player that is at once a G-7 nation and a middle power.
<P>
	These are the reasons we launched our initiative last week and 
why we succeeded in convincing the international community to 
join us. However, it is only a prologue to the actual humanitarian 
operation. Canadians deserve to know what we are getting into and 
what we can reasonably expect.
<P>
	As I speak, more than 400,000 refugees have crossed back into 
Rwanda and the Goma area. Another 150,000 are expected to cross 
over in the next few days. These developments are all very good 
news, but let us not forget that fighting continues in the region and 
the situation is very fluid.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know the changes on the ground will affect the mission. Let 
me tell you what is being done to address this changing situation. 
Yesterday, we announced new humanitarian aid to respond to 
changing needs on the ground. And we dispatched General Baril to 
assess the situation in the region.
<P>
	Canada and all nations involved in this humanitarian effort are in 
close contact. We will be meeting with other countries in Stuttgart 
on Thursday to discuss the impact of these events on the proposed 
military mission. The Secretary of State for Africa will be on that 
continent later this week, consulting with governments there. And 
in the coming days, Canada will be convening a meeting of aid 
donors to mobilize support for the resettlement of those returning.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	But the international community must continue its effort to 
facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid by civilian relief 
organizations to alleviate the immediate suffering we have all seen 
in our homes on our televisions every night and to facilitate the 
return to their homes in Rwanda of those refugees who want to 
return.
<P>
	Canada will continue to take the lead in working with the 
international community. We are all committed to ending the 
suffering.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For Canada, the last week has been a special moment, a moment 
of which we can all be proud. We do not know now exactly what 
the coming days and weeks will bring. And in those difficult 
moments we must remember what this mission is all about. In a 
century ravaged by war and aggression, we have called for a 
commitment that has nothing to do with conquest or glory.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are not entering into combat with an enemy. Our only enemy 
is human suffering. Our only foe is hunger and disease. Our only 
adversary is pain and misery.
<P>
	We have already won an early battle against moral blindness and 
self-interest by galvanizing the world community into action. Let 
us now do what is required to complete the work.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>It seems that, before the Prime Minister

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to speak to the motion before 
the House today, this take note debate we have before us on 
Canada's current and future commitments in Zaire.
<P>
	Canada has apparently agreed to take command of the mission in 
Zaire. The intentions of the government are noble. However, it has 
proceeded carelessly and without clear goals. For this reason the 
Reform Party cannot yet support the mission to Zaire.
<P>
	My colleague from Red Deer, the Reform Party critic for foreign 
affairs, outlined the Reform's position with a particular focus on 
the foreign affairs perspective. Now I will provide a military 
assessment of the mission.
<P>
	To me and other members of the House this take note debate is 
purely smoke and mirrors. Although we would like to see pure 
consultation with members of the House of Commons, we recog-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6382"> 6382 </A></B>
<P>
nize that there will be no vote  with respect to this information that 
comes out of this debate today.
<P>
	For more than a week now the media has been reporting that the 
government has decided to commit troops to Zaire. Senior defence 
officials have advised the cabinet that we have the capability to 
participate in this force. Military preparations have been under way 
for some time now.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not yet have sufficient information to 
support the government's decision to lead the mission to Zaire. 
Canadians recognize the importance of stability in Zaire, Rwanda, 
Burundi and the area, repatriating the refugees to their countries of 
origin and relieving the malnourished and starving. This mission 
will be extremely dangerous and Canadians should be fully aware 
of that fact.
<P>
	It is dangerous and this is not a peacekeeping mission. Combat 
capable troops are required for this mission to Zaire. We will not be 
monitoring opposing armies but playing a role in providing 
humanitarian aid to refugees in the area and providing them with a 
safe corridor through which they can move to their countries of 
origin.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Only three days prior to announcing this mission I sat in a 
briefing by senior military officials and they confirmed for me then 
and there that Canada was not capable of supporting three large 
scale missions at the same time. We are already in Haiti, we are 
already in Bosnia, and Zaire will make our third large scale 
mission.
<P>
	Only three days after defence officials confirmed we cannot 
handle three missions we hear from the Prime Minister that indeed 
we can. We wish we could support this mission but the government 
has not proven that it can complete the mission, although not 
through any fault of the troops or the military itself. They are 
among the best in the world when they are allowed to be, when they 
have the equipment that will allow them to be the best. We often 
hear when cabinet ministers talk about missions like this ``I talked 
to the troops and the troops say they are ready to go and they are 
capable of going''.
<P>
	I was in the Canadian Armed Forces and in 1974 when my ship, 
the HMCS <I>Gatineau</I>, was asked to go to Vietnam to participate in 
the withdrawal of American troops I was ready, willing and able. I 
wanted to go. Unfortunately I was on training in Halifax at the time 
in fleet school. The commandant called me into the office and said: 
``Hart, would you like to go on this mission with your ship? It 
would mean you would have to come off training prior to 
completion of your course''. I said: ``Sir, I am ready, willing and 
able and I want to be on that mission''. Unfortunately the decision 
was made that I would stay back and stay on training and I did not 
proceed with my ship to patrol the coast of Vietnam.
<P>
	That is the response that we will get from every man and woman 
in the Canadian Armed Forces. Of course  they are ready, willing 
and able and they want to participate in the missions because that is 
what they are trained to do. That has nothing to do with the 
responsibility of this government, to make sure that they are 
properly equipped to do the job and that there are enough people to 
make sure they can complete their missions.
<P>
	The Reform Party is concerned about the government's handling 
of Canada's defence policy. One of the most important tasks of any 
national government is to support the existence of sufficient 
combat troops, capable armed forces, to match the nation's defence 
policy. This is not something that is only desirable, this is a 
responsibility and a requirement of any sound national 
government. It would be an abdication of the government's 
responsibility to fail in this regard.
<P>
	Not long ago the Liberal government changed 50 years of 
Canadian defence policy by saying that Canada does not have nor 
does it need to maintain combat capable land forces. In fact, it was 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs who told Canadians that he does not 
believe Canada has combat capable forces. Now he is sending that 
same military, the one he said is not combat capable, into the line 
of fire.
<P>
	The former chief of defence staff told Canadians that land forces 
are unfit to fight a serious war. These are his words: ``If the 
government asked me to go into a high intensity theatre with the 
equipment I have today I would have to say I can't do it''. This is a 
quote from the last chief of defence staff, one who has never lost 
the support of this government. Its former hand picked chief of 
defence staff does not think that we can handle this mission.
<P>
	The former minister of national defence, contradicting his own 
white paper, said that General Boyle's comments were pretty fair. 
He added that General Boyle's comments reflected the 1994 white 
paper on defence.
<P>
	Then the Minister of Foreign Affairs went even further in 
reversing the defence policy of the government: ``A lot of the 
defence purchases have been geared toward the peacekeeping 
effort because that is the changing nature of the world. The notion 
that we might re-engage in a major conflict like the second world 
war does not seem to be there''.
<P>
	Our armed forces personnel must be first and foremost combat 
capable professionals which then and only then enables them to be 
finest peacekeepers or humanitarian aid providers in the world. If 
the Minister of National Defence or anyone in the cabinet would 
listen today I would tell the government to do four things.
<P>
	The first is stabilize the size of the Canadian Armed Forces. I 
would urge them to review the work of the special joint 
commission, which said that the size of 60,000 troops, which we 
are now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6383"> 6383 </A></B>
<P>
headed toward, is too small given the international commitments 
that we have facing us today.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Second, ensure that our land, sea and air troops are combat 
capable. Third, provide the adequate equipment and training. 
Fourth, I would ask the government to clearly establish a fixed 
number of troops which can be utilized on international 
peacekeeping missions, and also to establish how many missions 
can be supported at any one time. I will tell the House why this is 
important.
<P>
	For each mission of 1,000 troops we have committed to a foreign 
country, that ties up 3,000 troops because there will also be 1,000 
who will be training for the mission, waiting for their next rotation. 
There are the 1,000 in theatre and there are also 1,000 who have 
also come out of theatre and are waiting for 18 months before they 
can be put into service in an international peacekeeping role again.
<P>
	It can be seen that 1,000 troops commits 3,000 troops in actual 
numbers to an international commitment. Therefore with Bosnia, 
with Haiti and now with Zaire we will have some 3,300 troops in 
international theatre. That ties up almost 10,000 of our land forces 
of an army of approximately 24,000. That is putting an 
unprecedented amount of stress on our Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	However, there has been no move by the government or the 
defence minister to look at the things I have mentioned. We are still 
waiting to hear about the purchase of submarines for the navy to 
make sure that our navy is combat capable. We are still waiting for 
word on the replacement of the Sea King helicopters. In fact, 
another Sea King crashed last Thursday.
<P>
	We keep hearing from the government how great everything is 
but in the meantime our Sea Kings are falling out of the sky. Our 
engineers, pilots and our maintenance crews can keep them flying 
with gun tape, chewing gum and baler twine for only so long. It is a 
testimonial to our Canadian ingenuity and skill that our men and 
women were able to win the William Tell competition and become 
top guns.
<P>
	The government should live up to the combat capability to which 
was committed an entire chapter in the 1994 white paper. It is fine 
and dandy for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to commit our armed 
forces to Liberal government foreign policy objectives. However, 
they must not be trained only for peacekeeping. They must remain 
combat capable professionals. That is how our Canadian troops 
earned their well deserved reputation in the first and second world 
wars, the Korean war, the Gulf war and peacekeeping missions 
over the last 50 years. They must be given the proper tools. They 
must be given the proper  mandate and the rules of engagement so 
that they can get the job done properly with minimal risk to 
themselves.
<P>
	We have two primary concerns, saving lives in Zaire and keeping 
our own Canadian Armed Forces troops alive. The Liberals can use 
these vain ploys to garner peacenik votes but they must remember 
that the lives of Canadian troops are at stake. Our men and women 
are not going out on a picnic in Zaire. They will be going into one 
of the most ruthless war ravaged areas in the world where hundreds 
of thousands if not millions of people are very desperate. This is a 
very dangerous situation and we should not be going into it lightly.
<P>
	There is always a human price that will be paid and it will not be 
paid by these fat cat Liberal ministers who sit back and suck 
cappuccinos while our men and women put their lives on the line 
for the Liberals' half baked political decisions.
<P>
	How many members of the House know the actual human toll for 
our mission in Bosnia? Forget for a moment the suicides, the 
broken families, post traumatic stress disorder. Do the Liberals 
actually know how many Canadian casualties there were for 
Bosnia? I bet few of them know. There were 120 Canadian 
casualties, including 12 deaths. I do not know about anyone else in 
the House, but when it comes to senior military personnel's telling 
members of the House of Commons that we cannot support three 
major international contributions at one time and when the former 
chief of defence staff and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have 
questioned the combat capability of our military, I must doubt our 
abilities to support this third large scale engagement.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	With all this information, I am not as quick as my Liberal friends 
to send our men and women to Zaire. Let me be perfectly clear. I 
believe that in principle we should be able to go to Zaire. However, 
to ensure that Zaire is a success and to take some stress off our 
troops possibly we should look at pulling out of Bosnia.
<P>
	It is time to completely turn over all peacekeeping 
responsibilities in Bosnia to the European countries. Let me say 
that again. The Reform Party supports in principle taking command 
of the multinational mission in Zaire. However, from the 
perspective of military and human resources we may have to leave 
Bosnia and the IFOR mission to do so. There is nothing wrong with 
admitting that we cannot do all things for all people.
<P>
	We must establish clear priorities. We are faced with Bosnia, 
Haiti and now Zaire. Canadians would like to know from this 
government are these missions in Canada's national interest and, in 
particular, if they are how do we deal with these missions with our 
small army and our limited resources.
<P>
	Canada has performed yeoman service in the former Yugoslavia 
and it is time to pass the baton to other countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6384"> 6384 </A></B>
<P>
	The defence minister says the mission to Zaire will last only six 
months. I think this is grossly naive. Income tax, as we all 
remember, was meant to be a temporary measure, and look where 
that got us. We were told in 1991 that Bosnia would be short term. 
We have been there for five years. The mission in Haiti goes on and 
on. Just last week the UN was asked to extend its mandate for 
another nine months, until the end of July 1997.
<P>
	On the topic of mission extensions, when the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs was asked how long our stay would be in Zaire he 
stated the Liberal line four to six months. However, he has already 
intimated that he expects there will be a need for a force to stay on 
for a new phase after the first six month deployment expires.
<P>
	The government intends for our troops to remain there for 
possibly years. It just will not admit it at this point to Canadians. It 
refuses to be honest with Canadians about what it is really 
committing to. How long does it really plan to stay in Zaire? If the 
first six months are projected to cost $100 million, how much will 
the extended complete mission cost?
<P>
	The defence minister said he can find the $100 million in his 
budget. Liberal math never ceases to amaze me. The minister has a 
budget for which money has been allocated. I do not remember 
seeing any line items in estimates or the budget for a mission in 
Zaire or for a $100 million peacekeeping slush fund. So where is 
the money coming from? I am not saying do not go, I just want to 
know specifically where the money is coming from.
<P>
	I know the budget accounted for acquisitions of submarines and 
it also accounted for helicopters, replacements for the Sea King 
helicopters, but are they going to be the cost of the mission to 
Zaire? It is most unfortunate that this Liberal government would 
steal money from a much needed procurement to pay for this 
mission.
<P>
	The new defence minister says he wants to institute a morale 
building attitude. I will congratulate the new minister on his 
issuing of the Somalia medals, which was long overdue, and also 
on the purchase of flak jackets and helmets, which in a small way 
goes toward building morale as well. However, robbing from the 
submarine program or the helicopter procurement program is not 
going to help morale. It is going to hurt morale in the Canadian 
Armed Forces.
<P>
	The minister has a responsibility to properly equip our troops. 
That includes giving the navy its submarines and the air force its 
helicopters. He should not abdicate his responsibility because his 
buddy in foreign affairs wants to use the military to help in a 
Liberal leadership race.
<P>
	Canadians are confident in the ability of our armed forces. 
However, Canadians are not as confident in the Liberal 
government's ability to lead a military. Canadians call on the 
government to stop abdicating responsibility. We have reached the 
critical mass where further cuts and reductions to our armed forces 
will make them an impotent marching band.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Events over the weekend have dramatically overtaken the 
mandate of the mission and this Liberal government. The initial 
mission was to establish a safe corridor and to provide 
humanitarian relief to refugees in the camps. The refugees are now 
on the move. They are going home. Now the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs wants our troops to wander through Zaire for some 700,000 
other refugees wandering the countryside. The Liberals are 
struggling to find a reason to be there and they cannot find one.
<P>
	Even the host countries do not want us there. In fact, Canadian 
troops were required to deplane without their weapons because 
Rwanda does not want them there. Is this the kind of situation our 
people can expect?
<P>
	The defence minister promised robust rules of engagement. Do 
these robust rules include sending our troops in without their 
weapons?
<P>
	This mission is falling apart. The government should just admit 
it and keep our people out of harm's way until we can clearly define 
a mission for them to accomplish.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers served for a quarter of a century in Cyprus. 
Today, only a few years after their departure, Greek and Turkish 
Cypriots are again killing each other.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to quote the past president of the 
Dominion Command of the Royal Canadian Legion: ``The army 
cannot field a properly equipped division or even a full 
independent brigade. It would be difficult to man and supply. Still 
our loyal men and women of the forces continue to serve, many 
under more extreme conditions short of war than one can imagine. 
With a targeted military of 60,000 we have less fighting personnel 
to defend our interests than the number of lawyers in this country''.
<P>
	We want our troops to know we support their collaborative 
efforts in any regard wherever they are in the world. Whatever 
mission this government sends them on, the Reform Party will 
always press the government to ensure there are the proper 
numbers, to ensure they are properly equipped and to ensure that 
they are properly supported.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to applaud the government's decision to take the 
initiative in the matter before us today because on eight occasions 
over the past three weeks the official opposition had asked the 
government to take a leadership role in this matter. We thought it 
was essential for Canadians to work together and make a contribu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6385"> 6385 </A></B>
<P>
tion to help improve the situation in that part of the world, which, 
obviously, is experiencing great difficulties at the present time.
<P>
	We are happy with the leadership shown by Canada and that is 
why, on behalf of my party, I was pleased to tell the foreign affairs 
minister that we are supporting this initiative.
<P>
	Things are moving fast. As the Prime Minister said, the situation 
is evolving hourly in that part of the world. Let us not forget that, at 
the beginning, there were 1.2 million refugees stuck in Zaire. All of 
sudden, to everybody's surprise, 400,000 of them went back to 
Rwanda; apparently 100,000 more are on the way at this very 
moment, and these figures are changing constantly as the situation 
evolves; it also appears that 100,000 refugees are fleeing to the 
western part of Zaire because of the fighting and that 500,000 to 
600,000 people are still stuck in refugee camps.
<P>
	If there are situations where political parties have to show 
altruism and to set aside the daily interests of the House of 
Commons to take joint action, this is definitely one of them.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister should shortly receive a report by 
Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril who left yesterday on a 
reconnaissance mission.
<P>
	This whole situation has led to a number of conclusions. First, 
we all know that Canada cannot act alone. This is clear both to the 
government and to the opposition. We do not have the physical 
means to act alone in an effective manner.
<P>
	But Canada has an essential role to play in the sense that we can 
use our international prestige to convince the international 
community. It is important that Canada plays a leadership role to 
maintain dialogue and facilitate a consensus on the best way to put 
an end to the tragic situation faced by these people.
<P>
	We can convince the governments concerned to accept the 
presence of multinational troops on their territory. Some work is 
being done on the diplomatic front. We are involved. We want all 
solutions to be found and agreements to be reached so that the 
situation can evolve as it must. It is important, as the Prime 
Minister said, that Thursday, in Stuttgart, Canada show leadership 
so that a consensus can be reached on the adjustments to be made to 
the UN mandate and so that things are clear. We need a crystal clear 
mandate.
<P>
	However, I would like to give some advice to the government. 
The official opposition would like the government to follow some 
advice that we will give from now on.
<P>
	For the people who have returned to Rwanda, the people who 
have already decided to go back home, our  troops must ensure 
their safety. These people must be able to go back without 
apprehensiveness. A massacre must be avoided, and the mandate of 
the Canadian troops will surely be to ensure the safety of those who 
have returned to Rwanda.
<P>
	Canada must also give absolute priority, and I believe the Prime 
Minister was of the same opinion, to providing humanitarian 
assistance all along the way home for those who are unfortunately 
still on the road. In the case of those who are back home, and who 
will certainly go through days of anguish, it must also ensure that 
water, food and medication can be provided to everyone. Above all, 
Canada must ensure that there is no repeat of the tragic events we 
witnessed before in that part of the world.
<P>
	For the large number of people still stuck in Zaire, and there are 
700,000 of them, it is important that Canada help create 
humanitarian corridors so that help can be provided to them. I think 
each and everyone of us, in this House but also in this country, was 
deeply moved by the terrible plight of these people, particularly the 
thousands of children. We cannot remain insensitive to their 
situation and the support of our armed forces, our peacekeepers is 
essential to help create these corridors to send water, food and 
medication.
<P>
	Finally, the Canadian army will be able to step in, to work to 
ensure the safe return of these people, even though their return is a 
voluntarily one. It goes without saying that our troops will be 
extremely useful.
<P>
	However, the rules of engagement of Canadian troops must be 
very clear. They must be defined, because, unless I am mistaken, 
the mandate was given under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	This chapter allows the use of force and weapons, should the 
situation require it. It is extremely important that our government 
clearly define the rules governing the use of such force or weapons. 
We will have to make sure our troops are prepared for this mission, 
which means they will have to receive very clear instructions.
<P>
	There is no margin for error in that region, where the situation is 
explosive. Of course, our troops did not have time to get prepared. 
This is an urgent mission and an extremely important one. 
Consequently, they must get their orders as directly as possible, 
and their instructions must be clear, so as to avoid anything 
untoward.
<P>
	Canadians soldiers must understand the social and political 
implications of their involvement. They are in a region where, once 
again, everything is fragile and they will have to show a lot of tact, 
diplomacy and understanding for their mission to be successful.
<P>
	Our soldiers, and their leaders of course, will then have to ensure 
that the conditions for a durable solution to the conflict can be put 
in place. We will have to act as advisors while we are there. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6386"> 6386 </A></B>
<P>
Canada's advice will be most important to everyone. That is why 
we will humbly submit certain ideas to the government.
<P>
	We have already suggested that an international conference on 
the African great lakes region be held as soon as possible. It is 
important for global partners to discuss the volatile political 
situation in that region. In the longer term, we must also ensure that 
all refugees can go back to their country, to the place they came 
from. I think this is essential if we want to resolve this conflict.
<P>
	We will have to find ways to disarm the warring factions and to 
eliminate the causes of war in the area. The international 
community will have to take action, to do whatever it can to bring 
about a change of mentality. We can no longer accept situations 
like the one we saw some time ago and the one we are seeing now. 
We have to neutralize those who played a leading role in the 1994 
genocide. We really have to be on the alert to prevent such 
barbarities from reoccurring.
<P>
	Finally, we can negotiate and encourage peaceful relations 
between the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority in Rwanda and in 
Burundi. There is much to do. This is an extremely serious matter 
for our soldiers, but we are proud to see that Canada will be making 
its contribution in this part of the world.
<P>
	We will have done everything possible, as human beings, to end 
the atrocities that have been brought to our attention and the misery 
we saw, and I am certain that the intervention of Canadian soldiers 
will help save thousands of lives. That is why we are proud to 
contribute to this operation.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to remind members very briefly that 
1,500 soldiers will be sent to Zaire ultimately. These are the figures 
we have. We have asked much of our troops since 1992. There are 
still 1,000 soldiers in Bosnia, 750 in Haiti, 187 in the Golan 
Heights, 28 in the Sinai, in addition to a number elsewhere. A total 
of 2,059 Canadian soldiers are or will be on tour of duty in the 
coming days. This is extremely important. They have our 
confidence.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	We know that despite certain mistakes that may have been made 
in certain places in the past, the great majority of Canadian soldiers 
are able to make an appropriate and significant contribution to the 
world peace process. And it is in this spirit that I would like to join 
with all members of my party, and all members in this House, I am 
sure, in thanking Canadian soldiers for the work they are doing all 
around the world, in thanking the Canadian soldiers who are going 
to intervene in a situation that is extremely delicate but that does 
require intervention. We are behind them all the way. We also thank 
their families for the enormous sacrifice they are making in letting 
one of their own leave them so that we can play this role in the 
great lakes region of Africa.
<P>
	I would also like to thank the government for giving us the 
opportunity to discuss this issue here in the House. It is important 
that these things be said. Once again, I would like to reiterate our 
wholehearted support for this operation. It was necessary for us to 
show leadership. As the official opposition, we were certain that we 
could play such a role, and we have full confidence in those who 
will be called upon over there to carry out these extraordinary 
duties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the United Nations emergency force inaugurated the 
era of modern peacekeeping. Canada has been in the forefront with 
its patient explorations, its practical ideas, and its pragmatic 
compromises.
<P>
	This has been Canada's trademark, and this same power of 
persuasion and tenacity which has always characterized Canada, 
sometimes under difficult circumstances, has been manifested in 
recent days and recent hours, while the government was dealing 
with this current crisis.
<P>
	The Canadian forces have provided the United Nations 
emergency force with the logistical support that is the backbone of 
any military undertaking. Over the years, this service has become 
Canada's specialty, a known quantity, a support on which our 
international friends have been able to depend to insure the 
necessary stability and continuity of other peacekeeping missions, 
for other missions were not long in coming.
<P>
	In the ten years that followed, two other important peacekeeping 
missions took place, the United Nations operation in the Congo 
between 1960 and 1964, and the United Nations peacekeeping 
mission in Cyprus starting in 1964.
<P>
	The operation in the Congo, now Zaire, was particularly difficult 
and somewhat controversial. Many lives were lost and much 
money was poured into it. As well, we had to resort to force and to 
interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo. This led eventually to 
deep divisions between the member states, which threatened the 
future of the United Nations. There was great danger, and 
Canadians were responsible for a number of acts of bravery. Two 
hundred and thirty-four members of the United Nations force lost 
their lives during this operation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians again had special skills to bring to bear. Our primary 
contribution was in the area of signals and communications. It also 
helped enormously that so many members of the Canadian forces 
could speak the common Congolese language of French. There was 
a humanitarian aspect to the mission to which Canadians 
contributed foodstuffs.
<P>
	Canada was in the lead in Cyprus, with Secretary of State for 
External Affairs Paul Martin Senior providing the crucial diplo-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6387"> 6387 </A></B>
<P>
matic impetus to get UN members  behind the idea of a 
peacekeeping force. Canadian troops were on the island 24 hours 
after the force was authorized. ``You will never know what this may 
have prevented'', American President Lyndon Johnson told Mr. 
Pearson, then our Prime Minister.
<P>
	There have been moments of discouragement as peacekeeping 
evolved, warts and all, but as this House's Standing Committee on 
External Affairs and National Defence reminded Canadians in 
1970: ``For Canadians now to lose heart and reduce its interest in 
peacekeeping would be an abdication of responsibility. No other 
country could fill the gap thus opened-and the development of 
effective peacekeeping would be set back with incalculable but 
certainly disastrous effect''. The committee added: ``The work of 
peacekeeping is not glamorous. It is frustrating. It does not inspire 
gratitude. It does not directly assist narrow Canadian interests. But 
it is an essential service-and one for which Canada has special 
qualifications because of her reputation for fairness and because of 
her technical skills''.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians listened to that advice. Canada's commitment toward 
peace keeping has never faltered. By the end of the Cold War, 
80,000 Canadian soldiers had taken part in peacekeeping and it was 
hard to name a peacekeeping mission under UN or other auspices 
in which Canada had not played a lead role.
<P>
	We were the leading world peace keepers, well intentioned, well 
equipped, well trained. Empirical studies, however, indicate that 
the funds allocated to peacekeeping were only a tiny fraction of 
total defence budgets.
<P>
	At the end of the cold war, peacekeeping expanded and changed 
dramatically, if we consider the type, form and general nature of 
these operations. Both Conservatives and Liberals sent 20,000 
peacekeepers to the borders of Iraq, to the UN Commission in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, to Mozambique, Namibia, Angola, the 
Western Sahara, to Rwanda and Somalia, to Salvador and Haiti, to 
Cambodia and the Balkans.
<P>
	At one point in the early 90s, more than 4,000 Canadian 
peacekeepers were deployed in various parts of the world.
<P>
	During those years, mandates remained vague. The risks were 
greater. Inevitably, the risk of controversy, error and abuse had 
increased, compared with the time when missions were 
straightforward peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	But the challenges were also more numerous. Humanitarian aid 
and the defence of human rights were very likely to be a major 
factor in these new operations which, in turn, could act as a catalyst 
for putting in place democratic institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the former Yugoslavia under General Lewis MacKenzie, 
Canadians got aid to the besieged capital of Sarajevo and 
elsewhere. They repaired schools, hospitals, roads and they 
provided medical care. They gave of their own time to the aged and 
to the young.
<P>
	In an even more desperate situation in Rwanda, under Generals 
Roméo Dallaire and Guy Tousignant the Canadian forces cleared 
mines, delivered aid, purified water and brought critical medical 
assistance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We cannot ignore the assistance so many other Canadians have 
provided and continue to provide daily to those who need it 
throughout the world. I am referring to the NGOs and Canadian 
religious orders in Rwanda who were the first to draw our attention 
to the crisis which had developed in that country.
<P>
	General Dallaire said one day he had seen too many bodies, too 
many tears, too much human suffering and too much destruction in 
Rwanda to let us, the international community, go about our 
business without a care in the world.
<P>
	We clearly need mechanisms in order to be able to react quickly 
and effectively to international disasters. Examples of typically 
Canadian initiatives intended to help deal with international crises 
are the rapid reaction force proposed by the government, which 
made its way at the UN, and the Disaster Assistance Relief Team, 
also known as DART.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the last few minutes I have attempted to sketch the context 
in which the government motion under consideration by this House 
is set: a Canadian peacekeeping and humanitarian experience, 
expertise and excellence built up over many years and tested in a 
wide variety of circumstances; a longstanding Canadian 
commitment to international co-operation which is very much in 
our interests and deeply embedded in our tradition; a Canadian 
leadership role in the international community which is more usual 
than unusual.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And so we come to the obvious conclusion that the world is too 
small for us to turn our backs on the African continent and all its 
problems.
<P>
	I fully support the leadership role assumed by Canada within the 
international community, as it seeks ways to deal directly and 
fearlessly with the crisis in Africa.
<P>
	I would also ask that we intervene in a way that leaves no doubt 
as to the generosity and firm resolve of this House.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
events have unfolded rapidly in central Africa in recent days. Even 
before our troops touched central African soil, their positive impact 
was being felt. Fear of the extremist militias, a fear which had held 
more than one million refugees in squalid camps in Zaire for two 
years, was suddenly lifted. I am convinced that this happened at 
least in part because of the imminent arrival of the international 
force put together under the leadership of our Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's decision to offer Canadian leadership for 
this mission is in keeping with an honourable Canadian tradition, a 
tradition of unparalleled expertise in peacekeeping and of 
dedicated humanitarian assistance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must credit the activism of the Prime Minister, who reacted 
vigorously out of frustration with the international community's 
lack of action. As it was never a colonial power, Canada is in a 
good position to head the multinational force.
<P>
	As a member country in the francophonie, which is my 
responsibility in cabinet, Canada has long had close ties with the 
countries in that region. In taking the initiative of heading the 
multinational intervention, the Prime Minister mobilized the 
international community.
<P>
	The hope created by the imminent arrival of thousands of troops 
on a humanitarian mission, one of peace and aid, gave pause for 
thought to the extremists and hope to the victims, most of whom, 
need I add, are women and children. Since Friday morning, and 
therefore over the weekend, a flood of people have crossed the 
border.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must not lose the momentum prompted by the sudden mass 
movement of people back to Rwanda. Some have suggested that 
because the terror in which the Interhamwe militias held the 
refugees has now been broken, there is no need for international 
intervention. According to them the problem is solved; of course, 
we know that this is not the case.
<P>
	Let us not forget that only four weeks ago all aid agencies had 
pulled their personnel out of Zaire. There was no help, no food and 
no medicine. Yes, we have all seen the thousands of people 
flooding across the border, but let us not forget the hundreds of 
thousands of victims still in Zaire. We need to find these people. 
We need to bring them food and water and to give them shelter. We 
also need to support their voluntary return to Rwanda. Over 60 per 
cent of the refugees are women and children. They need immediate 
relief.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is vital that we continue to provide aid to the refugees. Their 
need for food and medicine is urgent as they leave transit camps to 
return to their communities. Once we have looked after these 
needs, we must help them resettle quickly and safely in their 
respective communities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The situation is urgent and the needs are great. This is why the 
Prime Minister announced that the Canadian International 
Development Agency, for which I am responsible, is setting aside 
some $15 million for new emergency humanitarian aid for the 
victims of the conflict, those coming back to Rwanda and of course 
those remaining in Zaire.
<P>
	This morning I held a press conference to outline the details of 
the aid package. I was accompanied by representatives of the 
Canadian Red Cross and CARE Canada. With CIDA's support, 
these two organizations are mobilizing teams of highly skilled 
Canadians who will go to the region as soon as possible to bring 
much needed help. They are doctors, nurses, logistics experts and 
engineers. They will help fulfil the basic needs of the victims, 
particularly with respect to clean water and medical help.
<P>
	Canadian NGOs have a long history and much experience in 
central Africa. They have faced danger to bring help to others. 
Their actions and commitments are a source of pride to all of us. I 
want to take this opportunity to congratulate them for all their 
work, past, present and future.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to draw your attention to the hard work done in 
Africa by the Red Cross and UN agencies such as the high 
commissioner for refugees and the world food program. The 
thousands of tonnes of food, medical and material aid collected in 
the region show how seriously they take their role. They are 
prepared to respond to the vital needs of over a million people. 
Canadian NGOs I have talked to on three occasions in recent days 
have expressed support for Canada's leadership in this 
humanitarian mission. In their view, deploying an international 
force is the only way emergency relief can be provided to 
vulnerable populations.
<P>
	Since 1994, Canadian NGOs have joined forces with the 
Canadian International Development Agency to mitigate the 
effects of genocide. Our program in Rwanda is twofold. First, to 
provide humanitarian assistance to alleviate in the short term the 
suffering of the Rwandan population. This assistance will consist in 
providing medical care, shelters, a clean water supply, food, and 
means of transport through international organizations  and 
Canadian NGOs. The critical situation of children has been the 
primary focus of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6389"> 6389 </A></B>
<P>
CIDA, which directed a large part of its humanitarian assistance to 
children.
<P>
	Second, Canada wanted to help Rwanda find a long term 
solution. To this end, we support the work of the International 
Criminal Tribunal, as well as the establishment of a criminal 
justice system, the training of judges and the protection of human 
rights. At the same time, we are in favour of reuniting children with 
their families and communities. We have also provided assistance 
to the Rwandan women who, following the genocide, found 
themselves in charge of large families. We are helping them 
support themselves through housing, low-level credit financing and 
job creation projects.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our efforts to deal with the long term effects of central Africa's 
conflicts cannot be limited to Rwanda. For this reason I am calling 
a high level meeting of the heads of national aid agencies and 
international aid organizations to help mobilize the donor 
community to ensure the safe and peaceful reintegration of 
returnees to their communities.
<P>
	We must deal most urgently with the problems of Rwanda but we 
must also address the special needs of Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania. 
We need to work together as donors to help develop carefully 
measured responses to the situation in central Africa while we keep 
in mind the complexity of relationships among the region's 
governments, refugees and rebel groups.
<P>
	This meeting will be held as soon as possible, hopefully as soon 
as this weekend. It is intended to mobilize international and 
bilateral donors to provide assistance to the region's repatriated 
refugees in a quick and co-operative fashion. It is not intended to 
replace the co-ordinating mechanisms that already exist on the 
ground but to reinforce them.
<P>
	We want to reassure Rwandans as they return to their communes 
that they will have the support they need to reintegrate peacefully 
into their society. At the same time we must reassure current 
residents of Rwanda's villages that we support the needs of 
communities as a whole. Our goal needs to be to find a lasting 
solution to the problems of that region and to help the refugees in 
their plight in the immediate days ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be dividing my time 
with the member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	I have lost track of the number of times in the last three decades 
that tribalism or ethnic nationalism, whatever we want to call it, 
has led to widespread violence and suffering on the African 
continent. This is one of the most unhappy legacies of colonialism 
on the continent when Africa was artificially divided up into 
countries in a way which had no bearing whatsoever  upon their 
ethnic make-up. Within the borders of those colonies the 
colonizing powers practised the policy of divide and rule. Some 
tribes would be favoured to the detriment of others, thus 
accentuating pre-existing ethnic divisions.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The Belgians in Rwanda and Burundi were especially good at 
this. They set up an administration completely staffed by the 
minority Tutsi tribe and these people, in turn, lorded it over their 
Hutu majority and they have subsequently paid a very high price.
<P>
	Most politicians in Africa publicly deplore tribalism but to 
consolidate their power almost all of them continue to pander to it. 
Civil services, armies and educational institutions have all been 
essentially staffed by members of whatever tribe happens to be 
ascendant in a given country at a given time.
<P>
	It is said that the current Government of Rwanda is making an 
honest attempt to break this pattern in the interests of national 
reconciliation. We shall see.
<P>
	In any event, the outside world will not settle the problems of 
Central Africa with a four to six month military mission. This 
mission may offer a bit of breathing space, but the underlying 
problems can be solved only by Africans themselves.
<P>
	The Tutsis originally arrived in Central Africa in the 17th 
century, migrating in from somewhere in the area of Ethiopia. 
Nobody knows exactly where they came from. They subjugated the 
indigenous Hutus and they set up a feudal system with a Tutsi 
aristocracy. This arrangement was continued with, as I have said, 
the official sanction of the governments during the colonial era. It 
led to the first massacres in Rwanda, which actually took place in 
1959, prior to the end of colonial rule. The Hutus rose up, 
overthrew their Tutsi masters and killed about 100,000 people. 
Nobody seems to remember this anymore.
<P>
	Pogroms of the Tutsi minority continued until 1964, two years 
after independence. Hundreds of thousands of Tutsis fled the 
country, many of them into Uganda. All this was 30 years ago.
<P>
	Taking a lesson from the events in Rwanda, the ruling Tutsi 
minority in neighbouring Burundi launched a pre-emptive strike 
against the Hutus. Any Hutu who was well educated, who had 
acquired any degree of wealth was summarily executed. About 
200,000 people were killed in 1972.
<P>
	The world, including Canada, yawned and looked the other way. 
The conscience of the world was finally aroused by the largest 
massacre of all, the slaughter of the Rwandan Tutsis in 1994, but 
nobody except the NGOs actually tried to do anything until the 
Tutsi rebellion in eastern Zaire brought violence to the refugee 
camps there.

<P>
	All of a sudden somebody dialled 911 and Canada, as usual, 
said ``ready, aye ready''. As the hon. member for Don Valley 
North has already stated, there is indeed a certain urgency to the 
present situation but surely it pales compared to the situation in 
1994 and the one in Burundi in 1972 when the world just closed 
its eyes until the killing was nearly over.
<P>
	I smell a very large political rat in the government's anxiety to 
get troops into Zaire and Rwanda right now. Sometimes 
governments do the right thing for opportunistic motives.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	I support this humanitarian initiative but with grave misgivings. 
I do wonder how this government, having continued the 20 year 
process of eviscerating our armed forces, proposes to support three 
simultaneous peacekeeping efforts. This is a government which 
likes to have its cake while continuing to eat it in great gobs. It 
makes public brownie points by cutting the defence budget and 
then makes more points by calling on our undermanned, poorly 
equipped forces to polish the Prime Minister's image in Canada's 
perpetual role of policemen for the world.
<P>
	We have these take note debates time after time. Sometimes I 
wonder why when the decisions have already been made. However, 
I guess we are on course. The Hercules are already landing in 
Kigali. I only hope that our troops are not going to be put to any 
large degree into harm's way in order to give a bit of political 
polish to the government across the way.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Cumberland-Colchester, land mines; the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake, endangered species.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
thank you for recognizing me and for the opportunity to speak for a 
few moments perhaps on a little different angle on this take note 
debate on the desperate situation in Rwanda and Zaire. I would just 
like to raise a few issues here in the time allotted to me.
<P>
	Our common humanity or our love of humanity requires us in 
one way to go to Africa, whether we want to or not. We see the 
pictures and the problems and we want to help. That is a common 
Canadian response and it is something that on one level is to be 
respected.
<P>
	However, our own safety and our own cognizance of the 
difficulties also requires us to be wise about the form that this 
assistance should take in this difficult area. I do not question the 
principle of helping nations and I do not question the need to help 
the helpless and especially the poorest of the poor and so on. They 
are good phrases. They sound good over here where we are well 
fed, safe and warm. On the broader level I accept that.
<P>
	However, I do have many questions about how we decide who to 
help and where we should go. Two years ago, in the wake of the 
holocaust in Rwanda, while sitting on the foreign affairs committee 
I called publicly for some sort of a rapid reaction force to make 
sure we had some capacity to respond in a more effective way; not 
a UN rapid reaction force but some sort of team in Canada so we 
could say ``we need to send some help, we have the facilities and 
we have it in place''.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that this spring the government set up DART, 
the disaster assistance response team, which has improved our 
capacity to respond quickly to difficult situations.
<P>
	In 1995 the House of Commons voted on my bill, the 
peacekeeping bill, in which I argued that Parliament should have 
the right to pass a resolution and have a debate such as this on each 
and every peacekeeping mission. My bill would not have stopped 
the Prime Minister from sending a reconnaissance team to the area 
in advance of any parliamentary approval, since the bill made 
allocations for a short term intervention such as this to take place 
without calling Parliament together just for that reason.
<P>
	The resolution that I think should have come before the House 
would have laid out the parameters of the mission beforehand, the 
size, the cost and duration of the mission and the rules of 
engagement. The criteria for peacekeeping missions are important. 
For instance, on the rules of engagement, think back two short 
years ago. United Nations troops had to stand by and we all saw 
pictures of it on TV where they had to stand by and watch people 
being butchered with machetes because the terms of engagement 
were not to intervene.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	I can think of nothing worse than to be told to stand back and not 
intervene when women and children are being slaughtered in front 
of you. That must have been a horrible thing for those troops. The 
question still arises for me. Will the same thing happen again?
<P>
	There are problems too with the overall priorities of the 
government. I note that today in Bosnia NATO announced that it 
needs 30,000 troops to keep the peace in Bosnia. Our current 
commitment is 1,000 troops in Bosnia right now. I am not sure 
what the request will be of Canada in the days ahead. It may be 
more than 1,000. It may be 2,000 or maybe none. We are not sure 
because there is no organized overall effort to know where we 
should send our troops and where the priorities should be.
<P>
	There are other peacekeeping missions ongoing at the moment. 
We are stretched thin in Bosnia, in Haiti, in the Golan, the Sinai, 
Mozambique, Angola and Cambodia. We are here, there and 
everywhere.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6391"> 6391 </A></B>
<P>
	As for priorities there are other crises in the world as well. 
There are refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq. The problems in 
the entire Sudan are enormous. They are tragic and they are 
longstanding.
<P>
	Why do we decide now to help Rwanda? Why is Rwanda and the 
crisis there, a crisis which appears to be thankfully abating 
somewhat, suddenly at the top of the list? I am not sure of the 
answer but I will let people read into it what they will.
<P>
	I am here to make a case for a more orderly approach to 
important overseas commitments on behalf of Canada. On the 
weekend we saw the situation change drastically. The Rwandan 
government says it no longer wants help, it no longer wants the 
intervention of Canadians on its soil.
<P>
	Of course, the job of feeding people and saving lives, giving 
medical assistance in the area continues to haunt us, so we want to 
participate. Again though, the question is do we participate best 
with troops. Is the $100 million that it will cost us in troops 
allocation the best $100 million or could it be best channelled 
through NGOs or other agencies? I hope those other options are 
still being investigated even at this late hour.
<P>
	I would like to suggest a few principles by which we should 
conduct ourselves in Africa. This is where I would like to take a 
little different tact perhaps. The hon. member from Maple Creek 
went through some of the longstanding problems, but in the 
solutions to Africa the first principle should be that we need a long 
term solution. Four to six months is not going to fix anything in 
Africa, I do not believe. The solution must be long term.
<P>
	All other problems pale in the shadow of the great problem that 
still exists in Africa. The genocide that occurred in Rwanda and 
which still threatens millions today in the sub-Saharan area is as a 
result of a much deeper problem. In a sense Africa is still the dark 
continent today when it comes to this deep problem of tribalism. In 
Rwanda, the crisis we are talking about today, one's loyalty is 
primarily to one's own tribe or ethnic group. The loyalty to the 
principles of truth, love, justice or any of the things that we have 
come to accept as due course in Canada, there is not that loyalty 
there.
<P>
	I believe we cannot solve this problem in Rwanda with military 
force. After we go in with the guns, and after we go in with the 
protective unit of whatever kind, the moral problem will still exist. 
It will be the same thing all over again. It has been going on, as my 
hon. colleague mentioned, for 300 years. It bubbled up two years 
ago. It is still there. It will still be there two, three, four or five 
years down the road. Perhaps two months after we leave it will still 
be there unless the people in Rwanda have a change of heart. It is 
deeper than a military problem. It is actually a moral problem.
<P>
	I do not want to pick exclusively on the Rwandans but they need 
more than just military intervention. They need a change of heart 
and a change of mind.
<P>
	If it is a military mission alone that we are embarking on, 
military intervention alone is doomed to failure. So why should 
Canada be involved at all? We are involved because of our own 
commitment to those principles that I mentioned earlier.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	Our belief in the principles of justice, of love, of esteeming your 
neighbour as yourself are principles that we gloss over in the 
House. We take it for granted that tonight when we go home we 
give vehicles that have the right of way the right of way. We hold 
the door for others. We understand that someone's home is to be 
respected and we do not intrude. We understand that someone's 
choice for an occupation or political party to belong to are choices 
that we respect.
<P>
	We have a need to be involved because we take those principles 
without forcing any cultural principles, any cultural nuances on the 
Rwanda people. We need to try to somehow impart to them the 
need for these principles of love, justice, understanding and 
esteeming your neighbour as yourself. You do not have to get into 
the religious side of that to know that is the principle on which 
democracy rides. If we do not impart that somehow in our journeys 
in Rwanda, it will not be a lasting peace and we will be back. It will 
be another tragedy.
<P>
	The second principle is to find a solution that involves justice in 
the whole sub-Saharan part of Africa. The renewal strategy in 
Rwanda must reflect Canada's own commitment to justice. If there 
is ever to be lasting peace in Rwanda, or Zaire, or the Sudan or any 
area that is undergoing these tragic ethnic wars, the world 
community must one day come to grips with the idea that there are 
murderers in Rwanda, there are people who practice genocide and 
ethnic cleansing and one day they must be brought to justice.
<P>
	It is not enough just to feed people in a camp or even when they 
return to their villages. One day justice must be served and it must 
be seen to be served. To this day we are still trying to bring justice 
to those people who were involved in the holocaust. Fifty years 
after the war, we understand it is so important that justice be served 
and be seen to be served that if a murderer or someone involved in 
genocide is found, we as an international community and as a 
nation do not tolerate it.
<P>
	If this short term intervention in Rwanda is just that and no 
justice is served then I fear in two, three, four or ten years from 
now it will erupt again in another holocaust. That is why justice 
must be served.
<P>
	Over the last couple of years no one wanted to get involved. The 
groups who are involved in the refugee camps are known. It is 
known that they use the refugees  as shelter and as a human shield. 
We all know it is happening. I am not saying it is an easy solution 
but unless justice is done one day that cancer will come back and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6392"> 6392 </A></B>
<P>
there will be another holocaust. You can count on it and 300 years 
of history show that to be true.
<P>
	The third principle is that although we are there and the world is 
going there in some pretty good healthy numbers, well armed men 
and women are going to go over to Africa to help deliver aid. It 
must be a made in Africa solution to this made in Africa problem. 
The four to six month intervention is to give breathing room. That 
is a good idea. It has some value. Obviously we cannot allow 
another holocaust so we are trying to do our bit. However, in the 
long run it has to be a made in Africa solution.
<P>
	In some ways I fear that we still have a bit of ``this is the white 
man's burden'' in Africa attitude. We are going over there and 
teach these guys how to do it. In the long term it will not work. We 
have to do more than that.
<P>
	I think of the example of South Africa. I heard an interesting 
speaker a couple of weeks ago and I believe, Mr. Speaker, you did 
as well, talk about some of the principles that brought about the 
peaceful change from apartheid to a democratic, one person, one 
vote rule in South Africa.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	The national committee for reconciliation was formed. That is a 
South African phrase which means that we have to come together 
and find a solution together because we have to live together. An 
all-party committee came together to write a new constitution. All 
parties, all ethnics, all colours, all groups came together to solve 
the problems in South Africa.
<P>
	If I could encourage one last thing it would be a just and peaceful 
Rwanda. It would be a society where all ethnicities, all races are 
accepted in peaceful co-existence. But that must come from the 
Rwandan people themselves. While we are there I hope we work to 
bring about a national reconciliation or whatever name they want to 
call it so they too can experience what South Africa has, which is a 
modern day miracle. It is a peaceful solution to a seemingly 
impossible situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Rosedale.
<P>
	I am honoured to speak in this special parliamentary debate on 
the Zaire mission, and Canada's strong guidance and direction at 
the United Nations through the compassionate leadership of the 
Prime Minister. Along with other members of Parliament, I support 
our efforts 100 per cent and I am pleased that the foreign affairs 
minister and the Minister of National Defence with the cabinet are 
leading the way.
<P>
	I quote from the a November 14 Chatham <I>Daily News</I> editorial: 
``Canada's willingness to come to the aid of starving refugees in 
Zaire once again demonstrates the outstanding leadership our 
nation enjoys in international affairs''.
<P>
	While the rest of the world responded slowly to the crisis, 
Canada took a moral leadership role in generating international 
military support for the refugees. By authorizing a mission to send 
as many as 1,600 Canadian troops into what even United Nations' 
officials have called a no man's land, Canada is spearheading this 
multinational effort.
<P>
	As members will agree, this is no exercise in public relations. In 
addition to the formidable geographical problems, the interior of 
Africa is quite possibly the most politically unstable place on earth.
<P>
	Canada has a long and distinguished history as the world's 
foremost peacekeeper. If our troops are effective in Zaire, it will 
restore some of that respect we remembered and honoured during 
last week's Remembrance Day ceremonies across the country. We 
must remember this mission is different from most of Canada's 
previous peacekeeping operations. Our soldiers' job will be 
ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid.
<P>
	There still remain more than 600,000 Hutu refugees in Zaire and 
another 700,000 in Tanzania. I am pleased that the government is 
identifying this as a humanitarian crisis, as it puts its hopes into 
deeds. We cannot remain comfortable in the face of hunger and 
injustice. I am proud of Canada's leading role in peacekeeping and 
the fact that Chatham and Kent county in southwestern Ontario, the 
real bread basket of our nation, are leading the way in this 
humanitarian mission.
<P>
	As Heather Bondy told me, maybe the only way we can come 
close to understanding the suffering is to actively hope, then put 
our hope into action and actually do something. Heather has been 
involved in nearly a dozen third world projects, for example, 
building bridges in the Dominican Republic and she started the first 
food bank in the city of Chatham.
<P>
	More than 22 tonnes of food has been committed to the effort in 
Chatham. Eight area nurses and doctors are getting immunized in 
preparation for the work overseas. Those donations are in addition 
to 10 tonnes of wheat committed last week by W.G. Thompson &amp; 
Sons of Blenheim, one of the largest grain facilities in Canada. It 
will be milled into flour by Dover Flour Mills of Chatham. The 
company will donate soybean meal that can be mixed with canola 
oil to make a protein rich nutritious meal. The canola oil has 
already been donated by western Canada.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Among other gifts committed to the group from Kent are 
enormous beer tent style canopies that can serve as a shelter for a 
medical mission; a tentative promise of enough grain to fill several 
rail cars; small farm implements and seeds for planting quick 
harvest grain; medical supplies from the Chatham hospitals and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6393"> 6393 </A></B>
<P>
medical community and suitcase sized water purifiers from the 
MIOX Corporation of New Mexico.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's announcement yesterday about sending 
Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril to Kigali is welcomed news 
indeed. The $15 million in emergency aid to the refugees will also 
help. The humanitarian aid financed by the Canadian International 
Development Agency includes support for Canadian doctors, 
nurses, water sanitation engineers and logistic experts organized by 
the Canadian Red Cross, CARE Canada and Canadian Lutheran 
World Relief. Canadian aid channelled through these and other 
agencies as well as the United Nations will help immensely.
<P>
	The Kent county group is hoping for a plane to carry its 
equipment and supplies to Zaire. The Chatham airport has been 
approved for landing by the city officials. Ten local citizens are 
waiting to hear from the military on the ground and are ready to 
move in as part of the national humanitarian effort.
<P>
	I have contacted the Minister of National Defence and his 
parliamentary secretary to inquire about the availability of a plane 
for the huge number of items destined for Africa.
<P>
	Those involved with the group in my riding include Dr. Eric 
Williams of Lethbridge, Alberta who has lived in Tanzania for 
many years and speaks several languages; nurse Candice Barlow, 
currently the AIDS spokesperson for Kent county and head of the 
public health department; nurse Kathy Van Basler a 
medical-surgical nurse who has lived in the Middle East for several 
years; nurse Joanne Gamble, wife of Dr. Brian Gamble, chief of 
staff at the Chatham-Kent Health Alliance; health care worker John 
Canna, a former U.S. marine; Marie-France Wilkinson, a French 
teacher for 25 years. Her talents are crucial in this francophone 
area.
<P>
	Also involved is Steve Bradley, president and general manager 
of the Best Western Wheel's Inn, who has been a board member of 
the Chatham Food Bank and brings a farming background to help 
in the sowing of seeds; Andy Morrissey, writer/reporter for the 
Chatham <I>Daily News</I>. He has been asked to be the Canadian 
correspondent and is young and willing to do what is needed to 
help; Father Matthew George of Our Lady of Help Christian 
Church in Wallaceburg. The priest has been collecting donations of 
money and goods through the London Catholic Diocese. Since 
Zaire and Rwanda are 90 per cent Catholic, he will offer much hope 
to the people he will meet.
<P>
	As well, Barry Fraser, the Kent county representative for the 
Ontario ministry of agriculture has researched what seeds will be 
appropriate in the troubled region.
<P>
	Right now in Chatham a local businessman has donated the use 
of an empty store for people to drop off donated items. A church in 
Windsor has put the local  group on the Internet so that they can 
quickly access what information and items will be further needed.
<P>
	I hope that a plane can land in Chatham to transport these caring 
people and their supplies to help the multinational mission. We 
know that more than one million refugees, of whom 60 per cent are 
women and children, have been caught between warring parties.
<P>
	Starting last week, large numbers have been crossing the boarder 
from Zaire into Rwanda and urgently need food, medicine and 
shelter. I support and applaud the efforts of my constituents and 
those of all Canadians in this effort. Heather Bondy and I agree that 
as Canadians we are a people that believe life is either a daring 
adventure of hope or it is nothing.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	I strongly urge the Minister of National Defence and military 
officials to work with the Kent County group to transport supplies 
to the war torn region. They are ready. They are working hard. 
They care.
<P>
	Donations from churches, business and area residents have been 
pouring in from the city of Chatham, as well as Sarnia, London, 
Watforth, Petrolia and other areas. People are responding to the 
terrible ordeal being experienced by the people in Zaire.
<P>
	In conclusion, my constituents and I salute Heather Bondy and 
her team for bringing this humanitarian effort together in my 
riding. I also salute our troops and their leaders, who will help to 
stabilize the ground so that aid efforts can begin successfully. I also 
praise the work of our Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, the Minister of National Defence, indeed the cabinet and 
our caucus for leading the way in the world once again. Together 
we can make it happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to support the government's 
initiative to enter into the Rwanda crisis and the Zaire crisis in such 
a positive and constructive manner.
<P>
	We heard the Prime Minister's statement in the House today. 
From that we clearly understood the background to the taking of 
this initiative. We also understood that this initiative is being taken 
in circumstances of the utmost responsibility and of the utmost 
gravity, both with respect to the nature of the situation and the 
remedies that are being called upon to address it.
<P>
	We are told that this will be a multilateral force commanded by 
Canadians. We are told that it is supported by a United Nations 
resolution. We are told that it falls under article 7 of the United 
Nations charter, which gives the largest possible mandate to those 
forces intervening in Rwanda to act in a way which will ensure the 
success of their mission.
<P>
	We are told that there are clear rules of engagement and clear 
rules of command. Even the Americans, who  are often hesitant to 
be involved in this type of situation, have accepted that this is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6394"> 6394 </A></B>
<P>
type of situation in which they must participate, and participate in 
collaboration with our Canadian forces.
<P>
	We are told that there will be no action without the security of 
understanding the reaction of the countries involved on the ground.
<P>
	It seems to me, therefore, when we consider the situation in the 
House today that the questions we must ask ourselves are is it in 
Canada's interest to undertake this mission? Has the changed 
situation on the ground made the whole idea irrelevant? Do we 
have the resources, both human and materiel, to accomplish this 
undertaking?
<P>
	In speaking of Canada's interest, or our interest in Canadians 
undertaking this mission, I first would like to dwell on the Prime 
Minister's comments about the humanitarian background for this 
mission. It seems to me that we, as Canadians, who are fortunate 
enough to live in this country, recognize the nature of the 
interdependent world in which we live. We owe it to ourselves to 
recognize the need to act in circumstances which require a 
humanitarian response to tragedies of the magnitude and of the 
type which we are facing.
<P>
	I can remember some time ago in my riding of Rosedale 
speaking to some young Rwandan refugees who had come to 
Canada. They were living in Montreal but they had come down to 
speak to some disadvantaged youths in Rosedale. We were working 
together on a common project. We had young people working 
together under a group called the Environmental Video Exchange. 
These youths were putting together a very interesting international 
community response to a lot of our international problems. The 
interaction of these youth from Rwanda with our own young men 
and women in Rosedale was very instructive. It was very clear 
from talking to them that if they were here in the House today they 
would be reacting much like the majority of the members of the 
House. That is to say, they would be supporting the government in 
this initiative.
<P>
	Canadians at every level, in every walk of life, I believe 
sincerely want to be of constructive help in circumstances where 
they are able to do so.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	I strongly believe, from having listened to the Prime Minister 
today and the minister's statements and having had an opportunity 
to review with some of the officials the circumstances of this 
mission, that this is an appropriate time to do exactly what the 
immediate initial response of the Canadians would be, which 
would be to stand up and say ``let us take this, let us run with it and 
let us make it count in the world''.
<P>
	I listened with great pride to what the Prime Minister said about 
the reaction of the international community and the reaction he 
received from around the world, from small nations, great nations 
and the United Nations.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to travel to Europe last week with a group 
of other members of Parliament from all parties. We happened to 
be in Germany and had breakfast with a group of German 
parliamentarians, members of their defence committee. They told 
us: ``Do you know what our television is telling us here in 
Germany? Canada is doing what we in Europe should be doing. 
Canada is taking the lead in a way that we should be taking the lead 
and are not able to take the lead''. Perhaps it is for the reason the 
Prime Minister mentioned in his speech that there were problems 
with the Europeans because of a colonial past or otherwise.
<P>
	However, the fact of the matter is people in other countries are 
seeing that this country is willing to take the lead in a humanitarian 
response but also in another manner that is very important to us in 
terms of our vital strategic interest in this country. We are taking a 
lead in supporting and reinforcing the effectiveness of the United 
Nations as an instrument to ensure that problems like this cannot 
develop in the future.
<P>
	We have often debated both in the foreign affairs committee and 
in the defence committee the need for this country to be a strong 
supporter of the United Nations system not just because of a 
humanitarian interest but because of the vital interest of ourselves 
as Canadians to have a strong, international, multilateral capacity 
to respond to problems of this nature. Unfortunately they are not 
becoming less frequent in the world but in today's world for 
reasons which relate to the end of the cold war and shifting 
alliances and, in some ways, to the insecurity that is building in 
various parts of the world they risk becoming more frequent.
<P>
	The need for a strong multilateral United Nations system which 
can respond to this type of situation is more important than ever 
before. What this initiative by the government is doing today is 
strengthening that system and sending a signal to the world that 
yes, the UN can work, yes there are countries that are willing to 
work within the UN system and make it work. That is a very 
important matter in the interests of all Canadians. I think we have 
to recognize the need for that.
<P>
	I would like to point out that in so doing we are addressing the 
problems of a changing situation. We recognize that this situation 
is changing but it is very clear from the consultations with our 
authorities that General Baril will be able to deal with that and 
recognize that this is a new situation that has to be addressed hour 
by hour, but that it is not the time now, merely because there is a 
change in the situation, to back down.
<P>
	When we are considering this matter in the House as members of 
Parliament, we obviously have to take the responsibility of asking 
whether we have the resources to  enable us to do the job. As 
members of Parliament, we have consulted and have been informed 
by officials of the defence department and the foreign affairs 
department that we do have the necessary resources and that this is 
not some mission that we are undertaking in any irresponsible 
manner. On the contrary, it is something which we have the

<P>
capacity to do, the ability to deliver and we will ensure that we are 
able to do the job.
<P>
	Those are the conditions which, united, make me believe that it 
is important for us to participate in this mission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say something which has no direct 
impact on this mission but which, I believe, has to do with its 
importance. This is the third time we are debating the idea of a 
similar mission in this House. We have troops in Bosnia, we have 
troops in Haiti, and now we will have troops in Rwanda. Why are 
we there?
<P>
	The Prime Minister referred to the reason in his speech before 
the House this afternoon. One of the reasons we are there is that we 
are a bilingual country.
<P>
	We are a country of diversity with a tradition of tolerance, with a 
tradition in the world which, based on our own Canadian 
experience, makes ours a country particularly suited to undertaking 
this kind of mission.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I think that we can be proud, as members of Parliament, of the 
fact that our government has decided to undertake this mission. I 
think that we can be proud, as Canadian citizens, of the fact that our 
society allows us to undertake such a mission.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think that, when the history of the development 
of international co-operation is told, this mission will be an 
example of the beginning of new form of international 
co-operation, and Canada will be the country that will have set the 
example of this new form of co-operation.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member for Rosedale a question after this brief 
commentary.
<P>
	He indicates he would support UN participation and he supports 
this peacekeeping mission to Zaire. I commend him for that and I 
have no problem with that. My question is related to the armed 
forces we have, the role they play and how it just seems to be 
always a shifting and moving target. It is almost like how the 
finance minister talks about his deficit elimination tactics.
<P>
	If we are to support peacekeeping efforts, if we are to support a 
military, why did the Liberal government, of which he is a member, 
reduce the defence budget and continue to support peacekeeping 
missions around the world? As my colleague from Red Deer said in 
the first  speech on this issue today, every foreign affairs minister in 
the House of Commons says this is for a set period of time and we 
will have that problem solved. Why was the budget cut? What 
criterion does the member from Rosedale feel the government 
should set out for itself to define the role of this humanitarian 
mission? Under what terms and conditions will this member then 
feel it has been a success or a failure? If we do not know as 
members of Parliament what the terms are, how do we know if it is 
a success or not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question and I would like to go back to the point that the hon. 
member for Red Deer often makes about the requirement for a set 
period of time for these missions. I have heard the member refer to 
that in our committee and I respect the member's opinion on these 
issues a great deal.
<P>
	The hon. member also made a very valid point in saying these 
are shifting times. One of the things you have to have in these 
circumstances is a certain amount of flexibility, as we have seen in 
the United States. In Bosnia we set a time for a certain period of 
time and we are willing to stay for another year. One does not say 
we are willing to stay for a longer period of time because the 
mission is a total failure. One is staying because the mission is a 
success and it is important that we give the flexibility to be able to 
stay.
<P>
	I think where this mission will be different from other missions 
is that there will be a clear ability to say when this mission has been 
successful when in fact the majority of the population has been able 
to move out of Zaire back into Rwanda, and in circumstances 
where it can be settled in Rwanda and the militia in Zaire is not able 
to harass the population or prevent it from returning to its homes. 
That is a very much more settled form of a framework it seems to 
me of a problem, and one which can reasonably be dealt with in a 
short period of time than the much more complicated case of 
re-establishing a civil society in a country like the former 
Yugoslavia. But that is not to say that the establishment of a civil 
society in Rwanda will not be an important issue for ensuring that 
this type of situation does not repeat itself in the future.
<P>
	In that area I would suggest that there is where we again as 
Canadians have very responsible programs in place. We have the 
Canadian International Development Agency. One of the things we 
are doing in Rwanda is financing a reinvigoration of its justice 
system. We are trying to give its people and help them develop 
themselves the basis of a civil society. It is clearly not something 
which we can do for them. That would be another form of new 
colonialism. It is something that we have to enable them to do 
through help in education, by providing to them judicial instruction 
and other instruments that Canadian society values and enabling 
them to choose for themselves and apply it. I personally  am not 
one of those who believes that after the end of this mission there 
will be the possibility of an eruption of civil violence in the 
communities of Rwanda. There is a civil authority in Rwanda. It 
needs beefing up. It can be made better and we can help them in 
doing that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6396"> 6396 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	That will not require troops. That will not require the 
continuation of this mission. It will require continued Canadian 
aid. I am glad to hear from the government that it intends to do that.
<P>
	Third, let me say that the member points out the reduction in the 
defence budget. I will not dwell long on the seeming inconsistency 
in his position on this, given the fact that his party has strongly 
advocated greater reductions in government expenditures.
<P>
	It is true we have had to reduce the defence budget. We have 
reduced the aid budget. We have reduced the budgets of every 
department in the country. I believe we are reducing them 
responsibly. We have reduced them in a way that enables our 
military to come to us and say: ``Yes, we can do this mission. Yes, 
we have the capacity to do it properly''. That is why I am willing to 
support it today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to tell you first that I will share my time with the member for 
Verchères. It is a pleasure for me to take part in this debate on the 
deployment of a UN multinational force. As my colleagues who 
spoke before me told the House, the Bloc Quebecois supports and 
welcomes this Canadian initiative.
<P>
	My colleague from Rosedale told us that it is the third or fourth 
time we hold such a debate. Every time there is a debate about 
sending Canadian troops to hot spots, we are always confronted to 
the same question: Are Canadians and Quebecers in favour of 
sending these Canadian troops abroad?
<P>
	In our ridings, opinions are divided. Some people are radically 
opposed, most often for financial reasons, while others strongly 
defend the idea, usually on humanitarian grounds.
<P>
	In the February 1995 budget, the Canadian government cut all 
subsidies to non-governmental organizations specifically set up to 
show Canadians and Quebecers how important international 
co-operation is. I think that, in doing so, the government has made 
things much harder to understand. People see that the government 
is making decisions it should explain, but that it has stopped 
providing information.
<P>
	I think it is essential that Canada be present in these disaster 
areas, for they are indeed disaster areas. Everybody agrees that the 
fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the USSR have changed 
the world. It is one thing to recognize that the world has changed, 
but it is  another to realize that the notion of security contains 
elements we had been previously unaware of.
<P>
	Nowadays, when we talk about security, our security, the 
security of Quebecers and Canadians, is at stake every time some 
disaster occurs. I will list a few, such as population migrations 
caused by all kinds of situations.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	It is estimated that 50 million men, women and children are 
displaced, have left their home, their homeland, their town or city 
due to tensions, wars, etc.
<P>
	At the recent FAO summit on food, it was said that 800 million 
people are undernourished. The summit made the long term 
commitment of reducing world hunger by half within 20 years.
<P>
	Underdevelopment, ethnic wars, overpopulation are issues of 
concern to us. Is the planet going to be able to sustain continuing 
demographic growth? I say that all these issues concern us because 
now and again our constituents ask us: ``Do you not think that too 
many immigrants and refugees are allowed into Canada?''
<P>
	If we refuse to do something about these problems, if Canada 
does not intervene in disaster areas, Canadians and Quebecers will 
not be able to use the same logic and say: ``We should not let 
refugees in''. Refugees are the immediate product of these events 
and we are all concerned.
<P>
	We are so concerned that increasingly, within the international 
community, it is recognized that ethnic wars, civil wars within a 
country's boundaries, give rise to an obligation to interfere. Ten or 
fifteen years ago, this would have been unthinkable. Now 
international law is starting to say that whenever there are civil 
wars where the most fundamental rights of people are denied, it is 
the duty, not only the right, but the duty of the international 
community to take action.
<P>
	Let us go back to the situation in Rwanda. How did the 
international community address this problem? As early as 1992 or 
1993, following some missions in the great lakes region, the 
International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic 
Development, based in Montreal, had warned the secretary general 
of the United Nations that something was brewing that had all the 
characteristics of a genocide.
<P>
	The international community did nothing. It waited for the crisis 
to explode in 1994. What happened of course is that between 
500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Naturally, what 
followed was the exodus of refugees, and bordering countries, like 
Zaire and Burundi, suffered the consequences.
<P>
	Two years after the end of the genocide, we now realize that the 
international community was not very active in implementing 
solutions. The refugee situation in Zaire had to become explosive 
before the international community started to wonder if it should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6397"> 6397 </A></B>
<P>
act, and I want  to commend the Canadian initiative, which finally 
stirred the international community to action.
<P>
	However, we are always putting out fires. Instead of preventing, 
instead of making sure the developing countries get out of their 
underdevelopment, instead of investing in durable human 
development, education, health, democratisation, democratic 
governments, human rights and civilian societies, the international 
community continues to invest billions of dollars in defense 
budgets and merely tosses crumbs to help developing countries.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Let us take Canada, for example, because it is the same as in the 
other countries. Canada allocates about $2 billion to its official 
development assistance and a budget of about $10 billion to 
defence, as if nothing had happened in the early 1990s, as if the 
concept of security had remained the same and was only related to 
a military aspect.
<P>
	So, the international community must get out of its torpor. 
Permanent mechanisms must be put in place, not to impose peace, 
but to ensure that, in countries where these tensions exist, people 
can gradually regain hope and can develop in a framework that 
respects them. At that time, we will stop putting out fires, because 
we will have put a stop, perhaps, to underdevelopment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
since this aspect will not be covered in any great depth in my 
speech, allow me to commend the expertise of my hon. colleague 
from Louis-Hébert in international affairs.
<P>
	I completely agree with the last part of his remarks, which I 
caught and which dealt with prevention. The image was quite 
forceful. When $2 billion is spent on international assistance, while 
national defence is funded to the tune of $10 billion, this clearly 
indicates that, in this area as in many others, a more curative than 
preventive approach is being favoured. In the end, the cost is 
higher, and, in this case, we are not talking about money, but 
human lives.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about this multinational force 
Canada will be leading and which will be deployed. In Zaire, it has 
already started providing assistance to refugees, many of whom are 
now returning to Rwanda, which is a major development that has 
taken place since the creation of a multinational force was 
announced.
<P>
	The Bloc's position, as stated earlier by our leader, is clear: We 
support this mission designed to allow refugees to safely return 
from Zaire and ensure that assistance will be provided to these 
people. Over the weekend, some very poignant images were 
broadcast. Some I saw myself, but one in particular was described 
to me; I did not actually see it. Just imagining the scene makes us 
realize how terrible a tragedy this is. Following an attack, a portion 
of the slaughter was shown, and there was this  little child looking 
around him, but all he could see was dead bodies. There were not 
many people on hand to provide assistance to the child, who was 
apparently rescued later. Such pictures cannot leave us indifferent.
<P>
	At some point, someone had to take the initiative so that 
something could be done in Zaire, because everyone was leaving it 
up to the others. Everyone was waiting for everyone, including 
France and the United States. No intervention was being made and 
we were faced with a situation that could still get worse, because 
even the presence of a multinational force will not eliminate the 
causes of the conflict. Far from it. This is a potentially explosive 
situation and there could be a great deal of damage.
<P>
	One only needs to remember what happened in Rwanda not too 
long ago to realize that the situation is very complex and is far from 
being resolved as regards the cohabitation of the Tutsis and Hutus.
<P>
	So, we congratulate Canada for taking the initiative regarding 
this issue by getting together a multinational force and sending it 
with a UN supported mandate. Of course, some adjustment will 
have to be made. It will be made on Thursday, at an important 
meeting, because the population that was living further north in 
Zaire is now in motion. It is believed that 400,000 Hutus are 
already back in Rwanda and that another 100,000 will have made it 
to that country over the next few hours.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	However, according to estimates made by NGO observers over 
there, some 700,000 refugees are still scattered, including more 
than 100,000 who are headed to western Zaire, who may have to 
quickly go to Rwanda. These people often find themselves in zones 
that are much less safe. A humanitarian corridor will have to be 
provided for them also. The mandate provides for the creation of a 
safety corridor for these people, and for bringing them the basics, 
such as food and medication.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that 500,000 people are about to go back to 
Rwanda, the mandate remains. The intervention is still justified. 
Even though it is difficult to negotiate with the authorities of Zaire 
and Rwanda, as it is always complex, there will nevertheless be 
observers on the ground, especially NGOs that are there to help the 
people who still need help. Those observers know how to deal with 
the real situation and can make very specific observations.
<P>
	Of course, there will be complex things to settle to ensure rapid 
intervention. In spite of Canada's commitment to send a force, 
there are still a few obstacles to overcome that will need to be dealt 
with at an important meeting on Thursday.
<P>
	Whereas we can deplore somewhat how slow the process is, 
things do not always move as fast as we would like them to in this 
kind of intervention. A further step has already been made at least, 
since observers are  already on site. More specifically, General 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6398"> 6398 </A></B>
<P>
Baril is there with a team that will grow in the days and weeks to 
come.
<P>
	There is no ambiguity about our support. It is there, even though 
we, as well as the government, might have questions on the 
duration of the operations. There is some question about a more 
permanent solution, because obviously nobody expects the 
political problem there to be settled in four months. We know that 
we are getting involved in a very complex mission that might 
certainly last longer than the four months contemplated. The 
United Nations could then take over. We will see.
<P>
	Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already stated that there will be a 
report. It has been agreed that a report will be submitted in early 
January. We will see what comes out of it.
<P>
	I want to mention it, because it deals with a question often asked 
by some of our constituents. True, this type of mission costs 
money. However, as citizens of a relatively rich country, living in a 
very different context, we have the duty to show solidarity with the 
people who are living in utterly unacceptable conditions and facing 
a human drama which is really out of the ordinary, compared to 
what we see in our everyday lives.
<P>
	The $100 million contribution that was mentioned comes to a 
mere $4 a year per capita. On a daily basis, it does not represent 
such a huge contribution, such a huge sacrifice to make in order to 
help those people and to take part in this operation, which will 
hopefully, because of the troops we are sending over there, make 
for an international perspective a lot closer to the real situation.
<P>
	I think everybody, including the Government of Canada, wishes 
for an international conference on the situation in the great lakes 
region of Africa. Such a conference could be another step in the 
right direction. Meanwhile, in the sort term, there are some needs 
to be met, especially in terms of humanitarian aid. Safe corridors 
have to be established for the people returning back home.
<P>
	There is one more thing I want to mention. I want to salute our 
people and our soldiers sent over there. When people enlist in the 
armed forces, they expect one day to be called to take part in such a 
mission. Today, in the case of Canada, it is well known that when 
you enlist in the armed forces, you will probably take part in 
peacekeeping missions because, to our great fortune, we are not 
directly involved in domestic or foreign conflicts.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	This means that our interventions are primarily civilian in nature 
or part of UN operations or other types of intervention by a 
multinational force led by Canada. We pay tribute to those who 
take part in such missions. It will be difficult for them and for their 
families, but such is reality. This is a choice they have made.
<P>
	We pay tribute to their courage and hope that this operation will 
allow the Canadian armed forces to restore their reputation, which 
was tarnished by events, however isolated, in Somalia. I think that 
this will be an opportunity to point up the fact that the very great 
majority of our soldiers are doing extraordinary work and that they 
are deserving of greater attention.
<P>
	This will provide an opportunity to realize that they are making a 
contribution that they will remember all their lives, just as those 
they help will remember it. We support them and we wish them the 
best of luck.
<P>
	I repeat that we support this mission. Certain questions have 
been raised by colleagues during debate, but I do not think that this 
level of detail is appropriate when operations on this scale are 
involved. We wish our troops the best of luck and we hope that the 
government will keep us informed of developments, should there 
be any change of mandate. I am certain that the ministers involved 
and the government will do so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to inform you that I will be sharing my time with 
the hon. member for Ottawa West.
<P>
	I want to speak in favour of the mission to Rwanda, Zaire and the 
rest of central Africa. The world is watching the situation on the 
African continent. In the last number of days over 400,000 refugees 
have crossed back into Rwanda in the Goma area. In the next few 
days over 150,000 will return to Rwanda.
<P>
	Fighting, starvation, dehydration and disease are running 
rampant. The situation must be addressed. Canada has taken the 
position that it must step forward to help in a humanitarian fashion. 
Our history in peacekeeping puts us in a good position to be the 
leader, with the world showing its confidence in Canada to lead the 
way.
<P>
	We must remember what this mission encompasses. As the 
Prime Minister indicated earlier, the enemies are suffering, pain, 
disease and hunger. We need to offer aid.
<P>
	The sub-Saharan region is in great need of help on a long term 
basis. There are some non-government agencies in my riding of 
Victoria-Haliburton similar to a small group of Christians who 
run HAVE, which stands for Help A Village Effort, that operate out 
of the county of Haliburton.
<P>
	This group sends money and people every year to help people to 
obtain clean water by drilling wells. They supply clean drinking 
water and all that goes with it: sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and a 
different way of life. They teach how to treat sickness and how to 
avoid disease. They teach people to read the instructions on a 
simple water pump. This is a major problem in an area with little or 
no educational system. These people will continue to try to help in 
the sub-Sahara region.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6399"> 6399 </A></B>
<P>
	I had the honour to attend a conference in 1996 in Washington. 
It was called ``A 2020 Vision for Food, Agriculture, and the 
Environment''. The major sponsor was the National Geographic 
Society. This conference, ironically enough, pinpointed the exact 
problem we are dealing with today.
<P>
	The most successful missions to the sub-Sahara are small and 
include, first, a banking system that lends small amounts to farmers 
in Africa. The majority are women by the way. They have a huge 
success rate, with a 99 per cent payback record.
<P>
	Second is a seed program for farmers, with training by the 
Canadian agricultural community, to help the African communities 
obtain knowledge in modern agricultural techniques.
<P>
	Third is programs in education on basic reading for instructions 
in order to read labels and symbols, or language training for 
sanitation and attending to basic human needs.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	We must take this opportunity to step in and lead the way. The 
world is not only watching with hope, it is counting on Canada to 
show the United Nations' countries that our intervention is for the 
long term building of a self-sustaining country in Africa.
<P>
	There are many reasons to send aid to the sub-Sahara. There is 
only one, fear of the unknown, that holds other people back. Some 
countries, because of their colonial history, are unable to help. 
Canada is able to help.
<P>
	In conclusion, I wish to offer my support to this mission and 
hope it is the first step in helping the sub-Sahara and all of Africa to 
become self-sustaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I know 
why the hon. member supports this mission and I accept that. 
However, I would like to know how it is that our peacekeeping 
forces can be sent all around the world, ad infinitum, without a 
finite end to these efforts? I am talking about the bigger picture.
<P>
	I suggest that our troops are only able, by their own admission, 
to take on two peacekeeping ventures at a time. This is a third one. 
They have two other commitments in Haiti and Bosnia. Are we not 
stretching these troops out too much? Are we not imposing a 
greater burden on them than we should be? How sensitive are we to 
their needs? We were told by the military that it only has the 
capacity, the money, the troops and the equipment to handle two 
peacekeeping missions at a time.
<P>
	How does the member balance the military's admission of that 
fact with his support for this humanitarian effort? It will have to be 
measured on what criterion we think is just to make sure that the 
refugees are safe, have food and the basic necessities and that the 
rebels will not fire on them? How does the member rationalize us  
supporting this in light of the fact that our troops are being 
stretched to the limit right now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for Calgary 
Centre on his intervention. He has allowed me to speak a little 
longer about the strength that I have and feel as a member of the 
defence committee. I know that the Canadian troops are the best 
trained in the world, have the best attitude and have the highest 
degree of commitment to anything that they are assigned to do.
<P>
	I believe our troops can handle this as they have handled other 
missions and as they continue to handle missions in places like 
Haiti, an area where bilingualism is a great asset. Our peacekeepers 
are well trained and well equipped. They are able to handle the 
missions that they are assigned. They handle them with the honour 
and dignity that comes with the strong history of the Canadian 
peacekeeping force.
<P>
	The Canadian peacekeeping forces are known worldwide for 
their generosity, their support and their humanitarian ways. I think 
they will continue to do that. I would like to think that there is 
money in the defence budget to be able to handle that. I put my 
trust in the minister of defence that we have the capacity to do that. 
I put my confidence in the fact that the military has indicated to me 
that it is able to handle this mission. It has the money, the 
resources, the know-how and the ability. It is very anxious to treat 
this problem where it is. It does not want to let it spread to other 
areas.
<P>
	The members of the armed forces do not want only to be 
peacekeepers, they want to teach people how to live a better life 
and how to sustain themselves for the long term. That in kind helps 
Canada sustain itself by not having these people on the shores of 
other nations in boat loads and so forth. I think that is very 
important. I believe our peacekeepers are able to handle this and 
that there is a budget available or we would not be sending them.
<P>
	However, it is necessary, even if we have to scrape and scrounge 
somewhere, to ensure that this mission is carried out to the 
betterment of the whole world.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to pursue this a little 
further. We were told when troops were sent to Haiti that they 
would be there for six months. An extension would be asked for.
<P>
	We do not know how long the troops are going on this 
humanitarian effort. So when I say ad infinitum, I want to know 
why parliamentarians are not given more information and why the 
government or the minister of defence does not establish what our 
role is in terms of the military and defence. Are we peacekeepers or 
are we more than that? Let us tool ourselves up for that.
<P>
	It is very frustrating in my opinion to see us committing and 
stretching ourselves out and not really  getting the recognition and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6400"> 6400 </A></B>
<P>
the credit that we could still be getting even though we do have the 
best troops in Canada.
<P>
	How long will this be for now? Why are the troops not out of 
Haiti?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member has 30 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Madam Speaker, I obviously cannot answer the 
question in 30 seconds because I would have to go into such detail. 
No one plans a war. No one plans to have 400,000 people cross a 
border in one day. Nobody plans on training people and how long 
that will take. That is something we react to.
<P>
	I am sure the member for Calgary Centre was very supportive of 
our rapid deployment capabilities, as he supports this mission 
which he has indicated. He knows that no conflict can have a time 
limit. It depends on the need of the people at the time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is with some trepidation that I rise to speak on this motion. No 
matter how many times we are confronted with the armed conflicts 
of the world, the decision to send Canadian forces into the dangers 
of civil strife is a most difficult one to make.
<P>
	Many Canadians are rightfully concerned about the risks of 
peacekeeping in this particular situation. But I believe that as 
Canadians we must remember how fortunate we are to live in the 
country we do, that the majority of citizens of this planet are not so 
fortunate. The decisions we make today affect our constituents, our 
fellow Canadians as well as people beyond our borders around the 
world.
<P>
	The age old question is am I my brother's keeper? I am very 
proud of my country, that we have decided yes we are. 
Globalization is much more than a question of using the resources 
of developing countries, the poorest areas of the world, and seeing 
them as customers for our trade.
<P>
	Globalization also recognizes that the deprivation of the 
majority of the world's population is not only their problem but our 
problem. Causes of strife like starvation, lack of basic health care, 
lack of the ability to grow, produce, consume and distribute your 
own food are problems for the entire world and not only for the 
people who suffer from them.
<P>
	We know that around the world at any time there are a million 
people who want to come to Canada. One of our biggest obligations 
in the world is to help make it possible for people to live safely 
with some basic standard of living in their own country as well.
<P>
	The question we are debating today goes to the very heart of 
whether a country like Canada, which has been chosen several 
times by the United Nations as the best country in the world in 
which to live, should have set an example for the world to follow or 
should have turned its back.
<P>
	As in the past, we have to decide whether to act to stop the 
suffering in the great lakes region of Africa or to ignore the cry for 
help. I am immensely proud that we decided not to walk away and 
that our Prime Minister and our government recognized the unique 
leadership role that Canada could play in this. I am extremely 
proud that we played that role very well. Generations of Canadians 
have worked to build in this part of the world a prosperous and just 
society based on fundamental democratic principles. We also have 
built a reputation as being one of the foremost promoters of these 
values around the world. And the way that we have responded to 
this crisis I believe has sent a clear message to the world about the 
kind of country Canada is and why we are looked up to as an 
example of a responsible international country.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In so doing, we will be showing the refugees in the great lakes 
region of Africa that we are concerned about what happens to them. 
We will reaffirm Canada's lead role as an intermediary, and will be 
maintaining our country's reputation as a negotiator and 
peacemaker.
<P>
	Given the region's history, clear and prompt action by the 
international community is necessary, if we are to avoid the 
situation in the great lakes deteriorating into a repeat of the bloody 
massacres in Rwanda two years ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In recent years Canada has called on the international 
community to work together to deploy peacekeeping forces more 
rapidly. A couple of weeks ago the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
spoke of the need for increased peace building and reconciliation in 
the relations between countries.
<P>
	Canada's leading an active role in this mission will ensure that 
the plea for help from the displaced people of this region will not 
go unanswered.
<P>
	Our involvement will open critical lifelines of food and 
medicine to the refugees and the injured civilians. It will help 
people return to their homes and settle in some measure of safety 
and security.
<P>
	Our mission is clear. It is to ensure that much needed aid reaches 
the afflicted civilians of the region and to provide safe passage to 
those refugees returning to their communities.
<P>
	In taking the leadership in both the establishment and the 
mandate of the multinational troops, Canada will once again set an 
example to the world that as a nation we will not shirk from our 
duty in this world. We will help restore peace to a region that has 
suffered for too long and we will continue to fight for the dignity 
and safety of the less fortunate citizens of our world.
<P>

<P>
	This is an evolving situation. None of us can predict exactly 
how it will evolve. But I am confident that we have sent troops 
who are trained, capable and who will for the first time be able 
to use their specialized training for this kind of situation.
<P>
	The member for Calgary spoke about how often we do this 
without getting recognition or credit. That is one strengths of our 
country, to do what is right and to do it in the most difficult of 
situations. We have demonstrated time and time again that for a 
country of our size, with our resources, we are able to make a 
global contribution far beyond what could reasonably be expected 
of us.
<P>
	I say again I am very proud of what the government and the 
Prime Minister have done. I know we all wish those troops being 
sent to this very troubled part of the world our best wishes for a 
successful and safe mission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member a question which arose today when I 
spoke to a group of over 100 university students in the West Block. 
They were here viewing Parliament and how it works. In the 
question and answer session one asked me: ``How come we are 
spending so much money in other countries when we have such a 
high level of child poverty here in Canada and when we have our 
own problems here in Canada? Yet it seems we send more money 
elsewhere and do not look after our own here in Canada''. I gave 
my answer and I would like to know how the member would have 
answered that question.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, my answer to that frankly is 
that tonight in Canada there are not hundreds of thousands of 
children in danger of dying. That is what is happening in the great 
lakes region of Africa. We are dealing with poverty of children at 
home. It is a desperate situation in our country and it is getting 
worse, not better.
<P>
	I think the meeting which our minister is going to have with 
provincial ministers in the very near future is going to bear results 
along those lines.
<P>
	However, there is no such thing as problems that belong to only 
one country anymore. A problem of this magnitude, of this 
severity, affects Canada and affects the developed and rich 
countries of the world. That is why we have an obligation to be 
there and to prevent the kind of suffering and death that would 
happen without our being there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, does the hon. member know what 
the exact mandate is in Zaire? Does the member know how long the 
troops are going to be there? Does the member know what the 
ultimate costs are going to be? Under what terms and conditions 
will she consider this mission to be a success?
<P>
	I understand the humanitarian aspect of it, but now there seems 
to be a lot of controversy over whether we should even be going. 
This was a Canadian initiative by the Canadian government, by the 
Prime Minister himself, and all of a sudden the borders were 
opened and a lot of the prisoners were let go. Now they are on hold 
and there was the big debate on Thursday.
<P>
	It is nice and wonderful to be saying that we care and we want to 
help, which we do, but on what basis will the member consider this 
a success and still in light of the problems we have here at home, 
why do we not address some of those?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I could read the member a long 
list if I had several hours of what we are accomplishing here at 
home. Those university students the member spoke to earlier today 
are a very good example of how well we are managing to educate 
our young people. It is just one small example.
<P>
	Obviously the situation in the great lakes region is evolving by 
the hour. That is why it is so important that we have people there on 
the ground who can keep us apprised of the changing situation. 
Even when the Prime Minister took his initiative last week I do not 
think any of us could have predicted the massive movement of 
refugees that has happened since then.
<P>
	Has that return of people to their homes out of the refugee 
camps, has the break-up of the domination and terrorization of 
those refugees by forces ended as a result of Canada's initiative? I 
hope so. I would love to take credit for it.
<P>
	I do not think any of us know how that situation is going to 
evolve in the next 24 hours, much less in the next week. If the 
member from Calgary wants a guarantee every time he takes a step 
out of his front door on what is going to happen to him on that day, 
I think he is living in the wrong world.
<P>
	We are there to do something extremely important, to adapt with 
our allies as the situation develops and to make the best possible 
use of our resources without undue risk to our personnel.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, 	I am pleased to speak today in the House in the debate on the motion presented by the Liberal government. It is vitally important, given the situation that exists in the great lakes region of 
<P>
	The situation in eastern Zaire and on the border with Rwanda 
changes hourly and it is now important to act with great speed in 
order to save lives, while ensuring that our soldiers will be able to 
work within the safest framework possible.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6402"> 6402 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	At this point, I would like to state that it was normal for us to 
decide to become involved. I feel somewhat the same as the United 
Nations special envoy to the region, Raymond Chrétien. We could 
not have remained insensitive, inactive, watching all of this 
barbarity without taking action, without losing part of our souls in 
the process.
<P>
	Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois applauds the motion finally 
presented to us today. The media has been giving us daily reports 
on the deterioration of the situation in eastern Zaire. Since then, the 
Bloc Quebecois has asked many questions of the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs in order to encourage him to take the initiative at 
the international level, but all of the responses came back to the 
idea that Canada was prepared to offer its assistance, but refused 
further involvement.
<P>
	It may be that the internal situation currently prevailing in 
Quebec and in Canada, in which the Liberal government is actually 
already fully launched into its pre-election campaign, could 
explain why, finally, the government has decided to go ahead on 
this.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois would like to believe that current initiatives 
are being taken for humanitarian reasons and to promote 
international peace, not for the kind of petty political motives that 
we have come to expect from the federal Liberals.
<P>
	We must point out that Canada did not acquire its reputation on 
the international scene by simply engaging in trade, as the Liberal 
government keeps suggesting.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs suggested earlier that the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade be 
given daily progress reports on the situation. How can we believe 
him, since this is the same minister who took advantage of the fact 
that members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade were away on a mission in Europe to sneak 
legislation through the House, Bill C-61 which implements a free 
trade agreement between Canada and Israel?
<P>
	How can we believe the minister, since the Government of 
Canada took this initiative regarding Zaire without even taking the 
trouble to reach members of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade abroad? And now the government 
would have us believe it is interested in their views and in 
providing information for committee members. This is outright 
hypocrisy. In its famous red book, the Liberal Party said, however, 
that: ``A Liberal government will also expand the rights of 
Parliament to debate major Canadian foreign policy initiatives, 
such as the deployment of peacekeeping forces, and the rights of 
Canadians to regular and serious consultations on foreign policy 
issues''.
<P>
	To some extent, the debate we are having today in this House is a 
farce, since obviously one cannot disagree with this kind of 
initiative or mission.
<P>
	In fact, is the government really concerned about the opinion of 
this Parliament? Unlike what happens in Europe, the government is 
under no obligation to take into consideration the views of 
parliamentarians. And even if it were, considering the British 
parliamentary system, it is clear that the government is formed by 
the majority in Parliament, which means that consulting Parliament 
to give some democratic legitimacy to these international 
initiatives is just window dressing.
<P>
	The Minister for Foreign Affairs also said that Canada had 
shown political initiative by mobilizing the international 
community around the problem in the great lakes region.
<P>
	I would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be a little more 
modest, because the initiative did not come from the Canadian 
government, as he claims, but from France, which for many days 
had tried to pressure the international community to set up this 
intervention force. However, France was disqualified from the start 
by its colonial past, and that is when the Canadian government took 
the initiative to lead the current mission to Zaire.
<P>
	And this is par for the course. We warned the government in 
recent months that the situation was deteriorating in Burundi. And 
the government replied: ``Of course we take note of your comments 
and we are very concerned, but we want the community of African 
countries to deal with the situation that is now developing in 
Burundi'', with predictable results, which means it is always more 
costly to intervene after the fact than to take preventive action.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	But the government did not understand that. It waited until the 
situation deteriorated to take the ``initiative'', as the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs said this morning. It is too late. Many people have 
already died in the region of the African great lakes, a situation 
which we could probably have prevented if we had acted earlier, as 
the Bloc Quebecois has already been suggesting for several 
months.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois believes it was high time the 
Canadian government finally took the decision to adopt France's 
position and unite the international community so that it would not 
ignore the situation in central Africa. Let us not forget that since 
the assassination, in 1994, of the presidents of Rwanda and 
Burundi, we have witnessed, dumbfounded, petrified, helpless and 
paralysed, the massacres of civilian populations so huge that it 
defies the imagination.
<P>
	In the last two years, the international community has not really 
done anything to find a durable solution to the situation which now 
prevails in central Africa. Yet, the massacres were only the 
beginning of the plight of those  civilian populations who had to 
flee to neighbouring countries and were crammed into refugee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6403"> 6403 </A></B>
<P>
camps, some of which held hundreds of thousands of people. 
Mugunga, the largest refugee camp in the world, had more than 
400,000 refugees.
<P>
	A representative of the Department of National Defence told us 
this morning that the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that 500,000 refugees 
are headed back to Rwanda. You will certainly admit that this 
situation is very alarming and precarious. If you add to this number 
the 12,000 to 15,000 people who have been entering Rwanda every 
hour for the last several days, it is obvious that we must help 
Rwanda to absorb and receive this flood of people.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that the current crisis in the Great Lakes 
regions is essentially a political one. Many dictators, like Mobutu 
Sese Seko, who is now estimated to be worth more than $10 billion, 
contributed nothing to the development and stabilization of their 
country and area in general.
<P>
	When you look at events in this region, perhaps the most 
deplorable is the fact that these dictators have often had the support 
of western countries, which, in the pursuit of their own interests, 
have allowed them to do whatever they liked. Now the leaders of 
the various factions within the central African countries of 
Rwanda, Zaire, Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania have to try to set 
aside their claims and particular interests in favour of humanitarian 
considerations.
<P>
	We have already heard the statements of the main leaders in the 
area. The leader of the Zairian rebels, Laurent Désiré Kabila, has 
already said that there is no justification for this international 
intervention. Zaire has denied landing rights to Canadian planes.
<P>
	Rwanda has tried to restrict the movements of the Canadian 
troops that arrived in Kigali yesterday. The President of Rwanda, 
Pastor Bizimungu, has said he did not consider this operation 
relevant.
<P>
	With the latest developments in the region, some countries 
taking part in the mission, including the United States and Great 
Britain, are now having doubts about its relevance. As we can see, 
General Baril, who will be leading the international force, will have 
no easy task of bringing all those involved together, especially 
since events are moving very quickly.
<P>
	Most of the refugees have already moved from eastern Zaire to 
Rwanda. The international force will therefore have to refocus its 
mission in order to adapt to the continually changing situation, to 
the point where some members of the coalition question its 
relevance.
<P>
	I see you are smiling, Madam Speaker, and I wonder why, 
because the current situation is serious, and there is no reason to 
smile at the events unfolding.
<P>
	One important point: the mission is to end no later than March 
31, 1997, in four and one half months, approximately. This short 
time frame will severely limit medium and long term approaches to 
lessening the suffering of the people and stabilizing the situation 
throughout the region.
<P>
	The new minister of defence expects this operation to cost about 
$100 million.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	As regards this significant amount of money, allow me, Madam 
Speaker, and I hope you are not smiling at this again, to make a 
suggestion. Since-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I hope the hon. 
member will stop attacking the Chair in his comments to the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> May I continue, Madam Speaker? Since this 
humanitarian mission comes under the responsibility of the 
department of defence, would it not make sense for all the amounts 
necessary for this mission in the great lakes region of Africa to 
come out of that department's budget?
<P>
	Given that the Canadian International Development Agency is 
already operating with a very modest budget, because of the 
successive cuts it has suffered at the hands of the Liberal 
government in recent years, surely it would be appropriate for the 
department of defence, which, let it not be forgotten, has an annual 
budget of $10 billion, to defray the total cost of the operation.
<P>
	With respect to what needs to be done, short term measures are 
already clearly laid out in the resolution. Soldiers in the 
multinational force already have a very clear mandate. They are to 
facilitate the return of humanitarian organizations, assist with the 
distribution of food and help refugees return to their homes.
<P>
	How will Canada contribute to the implementation of a lasting 
peace after March 31, 1997? Will action be taken to help these 
people return to normal life? The Canadian command in place 
should seize the opportunity to try to rally all parties involved in 
order to try to find possible solutions to the problems that will 
arise, and there will be problems.
<P>
	Let us not forget that there is a very strong likelihood of conflict 
when refugees who left their country months ago try to recover 
their land and homes. There is a risk of violence in the villages, and 
the manner in which refugees return to their villages must be 
monitored.
<P>
	At first, the role of the multinational force will be to find and 
distribute food and drinking water. But for the time being, one of 
the priorities will be to help local men and women farm land they 
have been away from for more than two years. Communications, 
roads, airports and transportation systems will have to be restored. 
This means that, in all likelihood, the civilian population will need 
the support of the international community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6404"> 6404 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, financial means remain limited, but the international 
force's action could focus exclusively on implementing these 
specific projects. We know that the Liberal government is already 
on the campaign trail across Canada. We hope that the proposals 
before us are not merely smoke and mirrors directed at voters in 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	At a time when our armed forces need to regain confidence and 
prove their effectiveness, we must be careful not to make the same 
mistakes as in 1994. We are greatly concerned that this operation 
might be a ploy to make us forget the flop in Somalia.
<P>
	Major-General Dallaire did a great job there but, unfortunately, 
he did not have the necessary resources. This time, the situation is 
totally different and we are convinced that our troops will do an 
excellent job.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois supports the men and women who will have 
to work in conditions that could be extremely difficult. It goes 
without saying that it also supports this mission, even though some 
questions remain, and we pointed them out.
<P>
	In conclusion, and given that the holiday season is just around 
the corner, we should congratulate and thank the men and women 
who will leave their homes to help the needy populations in 
Africa's great lakes region.

advantage of this situation to make a personal attack on the Chair 
which was not called for.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member. This morning at ten 
o'clock in Room 209 of the West Block a briefing was held. The 
member was not there. If he had been there he would have known 
the kind of support we are providing to the army, how many aircraft 
we are shipping there and what kind of aircraft we are shipping. He 
would have received all the information he asked for in his 
questions today when he was addressing the issue.
<P>
	The member mentioned the red book commitment to consult 
Parliament. We have been doing that. I believe this is the fourth 
time we have consulted Parliament on important issues, 
specifically on human rights and peacekeeping issues.
<P>
	Can he name any other institution in the world in any country 
which provides a peacekeeping force where they consult the 
opposition members before they send in the troops? I urge him to 
elaborate on that so we can be informed of his point of view and 
can carry on the discussion of this issue in a similar fashion.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LANDMINES">LAND MINES</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, land mines are an inexpensive, easy way to 
terrorize enemies, as they cost less than $3 each and can be dropped 
by the millions from helicopters.
<P>
	There are more than 110 million land mines scattered throughout 
some 69 countries and about as many in stockpiles around the 
world. In addition, another five million are sold each year.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	It is an estimated 25,000 people who are maimed or killed by 
land mines each year. Nearly one-third of these people lose one or 
two legs in the accidents. Land mines have also turned huge areas 
of agricultural land into no man's land in Cambodia, Angola, 
Mozambique, Bosnia, Croatia and many other countries throughout 
the globe.
<P>
	International Red Cross officials also point out that land mines 
increase the cost of delivering food and medical aid by hundreds of 
thousands of dollars than ordinarily would be necessary.
<P>
	We had parliamentarians from South Africa in this House 
visiting this government a few weeks ago. Those parliamentarians 
told us that in the little country of Mozambique alone at least one 
child every day is maimed or killed by a land mine while they are 
walking to school. The cost to the health care system and the cost to 
children is abhorrent.
<P>
	Our Minister for Foreign Affairs held a summit in this country a 
few weeks ago. What did that summit conclude that Canada and the 
whole world could do to eliminate this human tragedy of killing 
children inadvertently?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for her question.
<P>
	The Ottawa conference brought together 50 states and numerous 
international organizations and non-governmental organizations. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6406"> 6406 </A></B>
<P>
They were willing to meet in Ottawa because they shared the 
common  objective of achieving a global ban on anti-personnel 
mines.
<P>
	The Ottawa conference was highly successful and will have a 
concrete impact. The aim of the conference was to develop a 
strategy to achieve a global ban on anti-personnel mines. We now 
have such a strategy in place in the form of an action plan which 
outlines numerous concrete activities which states, international 
organizations and NGOs are willing to undertake to build the 
necessary political will to achieve a ban.
<P>
	We were also successful in achieving an agreement on a 
conference declaration which represents the views of 50 countries 
on how best to work toward an international ban. One of the most 
important elements of this declaration was the obligation it placed 
on state participants to seek the earliest possible conclusion of a 
legally binding agreement to ban these mines.
<P>
	In his closing speech to the conference, the foreign affairs 
minister invited the international community to return to Canada to 
sign such an agreement by the end of 1997. The timeframe will 
ensure that the unprecedented international momentum behind the 
movement to ban mines will be maintained and effectively focused 
on building the political will necessary to sign such a treaty.
<P>
	The minister's initiative to achieve such a treaty by the end of 
1997 enjoys the support of numerous states and international 
organizations as well as the secretary general of the United Nations 
and the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
<P>
	Our initiative is also fully supported by a wide number of NGOs, 
including the international campaign to ban land mines and Mines 
Action Canada.
<P>
	I would like to point out that Canada is leading by example. Last 
week the Minister of National Defence announced that we now 
have in place a plan for the complete elimination of our stockpiles 
of anti-personnel mines beginning with the immediate destruction 
of two-thirds of our stocks, the remaining one-third to be 
eliminated in the context of international negotiations which, as the 
minister has stated, will conclude by the end of 1997.
<P>
	We believe that establishing the end of 1997 as a deadline for 
such an agreement is realistic and necessary, particularly given the 
horrible social and economic costs associated with inaction on the 
part of the international community.
<P>
	Canada is willing to work with each and every other like minded 
country to move the process forward.
<P>
	Every week over 500 people are killed or maimed by land mines 
around the world. Canada has taken the lead in calling upon the 
world to stop the carnage caused by anti-personnel mines.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ENDANGEREDSPECIES">ENDANGERED SPECIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the Minister of the Environment has tabled 
legislation which puts in front of all Canadians this government's 
plan to protect endangered species and habitat in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	To his credit, the minister has made some significant changes to 
the proposals which were circulated for discussion last year. I have 
to thank all the groups, organizations and individuals who 
responded to those proposals. Without their input the legislation in 
front of us now would have been laughable.
<P>
	But the bottom line today is that while no longer laughable, the 
legislation is still inadequate. For me the trouble lies in the simple 
fact that for effectiveness the federal government will continue to 
rely on the willingness of the provinces to co-operate.
<P>
	When I asked the minister a question relating to this on October 
31, he chose to ignore the specifics and instead concentrated on the 
generalities. Therefore I am trying once again to secure a more 
specific answer. Today I am looking for a hint that the Liberals are 
even considering the subject matter of my question in two parts.
<P>
	The first part of the question dealt with the idea of a habitat 
inventory for species currently on the list. I acknowledge that 
habitat protection is the most critical part of the legislation. We 
have a list of species considered endangered at this moment but we 
do not have a specific list of their habitats.
<P>
	There is a legitimate fear out there expressed by workers in 
resource companies, by farmers and ranchers and by people living 
and working in rural communities that this legislation is one day 
going to jump up and steal away their incomes. We can best deal 
with protecting critical habitat as well as these fears by doing an 
inventory of the habitat specific to the species on the endangered 
list. We can best devise and structure recovery and management 
plans if we have an inventory. I want to know if the minister is 
giving any consideration to this matter.
<P>
	I am also concerned that without an inventory the only way we 
will know that habitat protection needs to be undertaken is if an 
environmental assessment on some project tells us that something 
needs to be done. We should not need to be always reacting to 
project proposals in these matters. We should be acting in advance 
of proposals being considered and an inventory will aid in this 
process.
<P>
	The second part of my question dealt with the effectiveness of 
enforcement mechanisms. As I have already said, the legislation 
recognizes the national accord for the protection of species at risk 
signed by the provinces in which each of the provinces agrees to  
establish complementary legislation and programs that provide for 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6407"> 6407 </A></B>
<P>
its effective protection of species at risk and for the protection of 
their habitat.
<P>
	However, there is no clear understanding of what happens should 
one or more provinces fail to provide adequate protection. If this 
were health care and the federal government truly cared about 
health, the Canada Health Act provides for penalties when the 
provinces do not live up to the standards set at the national level. 
Those penalties are financial penalties but on environmental 
matters, in particular the protection of endangered species, there is 
no similar penalty. There does not appear to be even the threat of a 
penalty that the federal government can make.
<P>
	My question was for the minister to tell us what enforcement 
powers he has at his disposal to ensure the provinces establish 
adequate companion protection.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
point out to the constituents of the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake that he works very hard on 
environmental initiatives in this House. In responding to his 
questions I would like to say that Bill C-65, the Canadian 
Endangered Species Protection Act, is the first ever federal 
legislation to protect endangered species in Canada.
<P>
	The purpose of this act is to prevent Canadian wildlife species 
from becoming extinct as a result of human activity and to secure 
their recovery. This act along with provincial and territorial 
co-operation in ensuring complementary legislation and programs 
will afford protection to endangered species across the country.
<P>
	The provinces and the territories have agreed to a national 
accord for the protection of species at risk. Under the terms of the 
accord the provinces and the territories are co-operating with the 
federal government to ensure that complementary legislation and 
programs are put into place.
<P>
	The act formalizes the existing process by which we identify 
those species that are endangered. The committee on the status of 
endangered wildlife in Canada, COSEWIC, comprises a group of 
independent scientific experts who review and report on the status 
of wildlife species in Canada.
<P>
	The bill now provides a legal basis for the committee and 
formalizes its work under Canadian law. This bill recognizes that 
habitat is fundamental to the protection of species. On the official 
listing of an endangered species, activities causing damage or 
destruction to its residence, such as its den, nest or burrow, will be 
prohibited. We also recognize that we need to go beyond the 
immediate residence of a given species in order to protect its 
critical habitat.
<P>
	The mandatory recovery plans will address the threats to the 
survival of the species, including threats to critical  habitat as 
defined by the scientific experts. As far as federal lands are 
concerned, the minister and his colleagues will be made aware of 
species listed annually by COSEWIC.
<P>
	This bill gives the federal government the authority to create 
regulations needed to regulate or prohibit activities that will 
adversely affect the species or its critical habitat. The act also 
enables regulations prohibiting activities that wilfully harm species 
at risk that cross Canada's international boundaries in the absence 
of equivalent action by the provinces.
<P>
	It also provides for emergency orders in the event that immediate 
action is required for the protection of a species. Where loss of 
habitat is identified as an imminent threat, emergency orders will 
include measures for its protection.
<P>
	Under the national accord with the provinces and territories, all 
jurisdictions are publicly accountable for their actions and 
decisions. If a province chooses not to provide species protection, 
that decision will be on the public record. Further, the accord 
provides for a mechanism to address any such disputes that may 
arise.
<P>
	Governments have a duty and a responsibility to work in 
partnership with one another, and with concerned citizens across 
the country and around the world, to prevent species from 
becoming extinct.
<P>
	This act, along with complementary provincial and territorial 
legislation and programs, does just that by putting the needs of 
nature first.
<P>
