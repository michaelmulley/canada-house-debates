</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to present to parliament the solicitor general's 
annual statement on national security, having tabled today the 
1997 public report of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public report provides parliamentarians and the public with 
a review of the global and domestic security environment. 
Canadians value safety and security. Whether it is defined from 
the health care, environmental, consumer protection or law 
enforcement perspective, Canadians see public safety as a key 
component on how we define ourselves as Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public safety is my mission; it is the mission of the Department 
of the Solicitor General. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it be pursuing the goal of more effective corrections, 
fighting organized crime or maintaining national security, CSIS, 
the RCMP, the correctional service and the National Parole Board 
are dedicated to public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to focus on the efforts the government is making to 
protect Canada's interests and to safeguard our citizens from 
threats to their safety and security.  As the CSIS public report 
underlines, the 1990s have been a decade of great change 
dominated by increased instability worldwide and the escalating 
use of violence for political and ideological purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Terrorism, including state sponsored terrorism, is an all too 
frequent occurrence.  CSIS has a mandate to forewarn and advise 
the government on such activities, providing threat assessments 
and helping to ensure effective consultation and information 
sharing with appropriate agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSIS, the RCMP and other federal departments work together to 
investigate and monitor the threat of international terrorist 
activity in a common mission to protect Canadians and Canada's 
interests here and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can expect to see a range of tough measures against 
those who abuse our democratic system and our institutions to 
further their deadly aims.  I will outline some of the measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a signatory to the United Nations convention on the 
suppression of terrorist bombing offences and the convention on 
the safety of UN and associated personnel.  The government plans 
to introduce legislation to ratify these conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make it much more difficult for terrorist groups to 
raise funds in Canada.  This is a global as well as domestic 
problem and we are working with other G-8 countries to help 
develop approaches to handle this problem while not impinging 
upon legitimate humanitarian fundraising activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to make it much more difficult for terrorists to 
enter Canada and to abuse our immigration process to avoid 
justified removal from the country.  The Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration is developing proposals on these issues as part 
of her broader reform.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the Minister of Justice, has announced that she 
will bring major amendments to our laws on extradition to help us 
better meet our international commitments and to ensure that 
Canada is not a safe haven for criminals around the world who 
want to avoid justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate the commitment I made in this House last November to 
introduce legislation that would help the RCMP and other law 
enforcement agencies to combat money laundering. While these 
mechanisms are designed to counter organized crime, we anticipate 
there could also be benefits for counterterrorism efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP and CSIS play key roles in national security. These two 
agencies of my portfolio are marshalling all the resources in a 
co-operative and integrated fight against threats to our national 
security.  CSIS has a key role to play in exchanging information 
with other countries and providing relevant criminal information 
and strategic analysis to Canadian law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several countries are active in trying to steal leading edge 
technology from Canada. CSIS has a mandate and a responsibility 
to investigate these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a world driven by economic advantage we do not expect to see 
such activities diminish and CSIS will continue to develop 
co-operative arrangements with other security and intelligence 
services in pursuit of our security objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is studying the issue of creating modern 
legislation to replace the badly outdated and overbroad official 
secrets act to address the threats Canada faces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity as well to brief the recently created 
special committee of the other place that will be examining our 
counterterrorism arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this brief canvass of national security I have emphasized 
that the global situation is unsettled, often dangerous and hence 
has important implications for Canadian public safety. We are 
working hard on both the domestic and international fronts. 
Canada will be front and centre at the Birmingham summit of the 
G-8 next month to deal with threats to Canada's national security 
and our national interests. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the comments by the hon. Solicitor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the four or five minutes I have I would like to touch on a 
number of issues.  It is reported that we have a huge number of 
modern day war criminals in this country. The greatest threat to 
any nation is always the problems within a nation.  The threats 
from outside our nation when they become part of our nation are 
the greatest threats, whether criminal activity, harbouring those 
who are wanted for acts of genocide or other heinous crimes in 
their home countries and who are now living in our society, or 
whether it is those who are here because they want to steal the 
secrets we have, whether military, economic or industrial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we strengthen our institutions we have designed through a 
democratic manner over the years to ward off these threats we are 
just speaking idle words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the words of the hon. solicitor general but we must 
back those up by strengthening CSIS not only in numbers but also 
wherever it is practical and possible to give it greater 
legislative powers. We must strengthen the RCMP and not continue 
to whittle away at its budget.  We are under strengthed.  We must 
reinforce that.  We must also stop allowing our military to rust 
out in the manner that has occurred over the last 10 or 15 years 
or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must strengthen those institutions that protect national 
security, our economic security and our societal security from 
those external forces that once they become internal forces pose 
the most dire threat to the stability of this country in all 
these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government had better be prepared to reinforce the budgets 
of these institutions that we rely on to protect our security, 
the security of our industries and the high tech development 
occurring, to protect those secrets from encroachment and 
incursion by forces outside of our country that have almost an 
open door to move across our borders into our country and set up 
their espionage organizations to take these secrets from our very 
high tech society in this country and use them against us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the comments of the solicitor general.  Let us see 
some action behind those words.  He can rest assured that he will 
receive support from the Reform Party caucus of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak today in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In tabling the 1997 public report of CSIS and delivering his 
annual statement on global and domestic security, the minister 
reflects the government's desire to remain transparent and 
accountable regarding the management of security intelligence 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because all procedures used by CSIS cannot be disclosed, we 
should hope that security intelligence is gathered in a 
legitimate fashion. Of course, the minister stands up for his 
department, but troubling facts are regularly reported by the 
press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, how can the minister reconcile the statement he just 
made with the following facts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 4, based on the contents of a 24-page SIRC document 
dated July 18, 1997, the <I>Toronto Star</I> reported that CSIS had 
abused and endangered a vulnerable refugee claimant by promising 
him asylum if he spied on fellow Tamils. While he had not yet 
gone through the regular immigration process, CSIS held up the 
possibility of his being admitted to Canada in exchange for his 
co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this SIRC report follows up on the fact that, in 
1996, a person by the name of Thalaya Singam Sivakumar went 
public with his story. Mr. Sivakumar claimed that he worked for 
CSIS for five years because the agency promised he would be 
allowed to stay in Canada. But in 1994, CSIS broke off its 
relationship with Sivakumar and it now claims it never promised 
him anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same SIRC report indicates that CSIS had intervened in the 
immigration process in other cases in order to recruit 
informants.  A former high ranking member of CSIS, Ian Macewen, 
who headed the counterterrorist section for seven years said 
that CSIS tried to help its better informants.  He added that, 
on four occasions during his years of service, CSIS intervened 
in the immigration process to obtain immigrant status for such 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Toronto Star</I>, once again, reported on April 15 that another 
refugee claimant had accused CSIS of trying to force him into 
spying.  The individual in question, Mr. Singh, comes from 
India, and more specifically the state of Punjab.  His story is 
dangerously like the preceding one.  He made a formal complaint 
against CSIS last month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of these facts, we are forced to condemn this 
practice of CSIS and request that these matters be studied 
thoroughly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister announced earlier that a special Senate committee 
would review Canada's antiterrorist mechanisms. I would remind 
him that senators are appointed and do not represent the public. 
As they are accountable to no one, I question their ability to 
properly represent the concerns of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister to replace the special Senate committee 
he wants to set up with a committee of the House of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too am pleased to rise to speak on behalf of the New Democratic 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the minister's statement on national security.  I 
think he will recognize and agree with me that this is of 
importance to every single Canadian in every community of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we are left with the impression that terrorism and 
organized crime are problems that affect only the major urban 
centres in this country, and particularly those on the coasts 
where the importation of narcotics by certain groups is of real 
concern.  In Montreal the existence of biker gangs that engage in 
warfare are of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the root causes of crime and the issues that cause 
people to be concerned about safety in their communities can be 
traced back to the influence of organized crime.  It is something 
that every Canadian, whether they live in Ingonish, a rural 
community in my riding, or Winnipeg where there are concerns 
about gangs, or Vancouver where there are concerns about the 
ports, ought to take an interest in.  I am sure they will watch 
the movements of the minister on the issue of organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue that requires national attention.  In the last 
year, as I have indicated, we have realized the biker gangs and 
the organized crime which is present at Canada's ports.  I have 
raised these issues in the House on many occasions.  There are 
allegations of infiltration and involvement in the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canada has been placed on the United States list of 
nations about which they are most concerned in terms of money 
laundering.  This is something that this country ought to take 
seriously.  I welcome the solicitor general looking into that 
because it is something that we have to be very careful of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increased globalization, the increased freedom of capital to 
flow from one nation to another, with limited checks and 
balances, has opened the door for organized crime to infiltrate 
this country.  The opening of the ports, the reduction of tariffs 
and the cutbacks of police agencies that can properly monitor 
what happens in this country and what goods come in have given 
more power to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the initiative.  We need to allow our police agencies 
to become technologically advanced and ensure that they have the 
proper and the necessary tools to fight organized crime which is 
becoming increasingly technologically advanced in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the comment that the Minister of Justice will bring in 
laws on extradition.  I will not hold my breath, but I look 
forward to hearing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic Party I welcome the initiative. 
We are concerned about organized crime in this country, as are 
most citizens.  We look forward to the dialogue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada in response to the solicitor 
general's statement on national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased that this forum is being utilized by the 
government and that we had the opportunity to hear a ministerial 
statement on such an important area.  It is a very timely 
appearance by the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned by previous members, there has been a 
great deal of talk in this area.  The solicitor general has 
repeated his pledge from last summer and again last fall to 
introduce new legislation on money laundering and cross-border 
currency controls.  The fact remains that to date we have not 
seen that.  There has been a great deal of consultation, which 
again I believe is a very important part of the process, but I 
would encourage the solicitor general to act on these 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about justice and security issues. They 
require more than just rhetoric.  They require concrete action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great deal about the intention to crack down on 
money laundering and cross-border currency controls since 
September of this year.  To the government's credit it did pass 
anti-organized crime legislation in the spring of 1997.  However, 
like many of these initiatives, I would suggest it was not a full 
effort.  There continue to be huge loopholes in the federal 
legislation, particularly when we look at what Canada has done 
compared to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example I would cite the U.S. State Department's report, 
“International Narcotics Control Strategy”, which singled out 
Canada as an easy target for drug related and other types of 
money laundering.  The report goes on to compare Canada to 
countries like Columbia, Brazil and the Cayman Islands as 
countries which are open to money laundering and places to hide 
illegal money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That report identified the fact that Canada's international 
position is not glowing.  Lack of federal legislation leaves our 
country open to this type of illegal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, in light of some of the other developments that have 
happened in this country, in particular the government's 
decision to disband the ports police, causes grave concern for 
opposition members as well as the Canadian public at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem remains.  In the 10 months since the solicitor 
general has taken this post there have been many promises made, 
but we have yet to see the delivery of those promises.  Canada 
continues to be open for business as far as organized crime is 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general did assure Canadians on Monday that he was 
on the job with respect to organized crime. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also told us that he was going to bring biker gangs to their 
knees and eradicate organized crime.  This is again a lot of 
tough talk, but we are waiting patiently and encouraging the 
solicitor general to act on these initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also put before the House the opinion of Scott Newark, 
the executive director of the Canadian Police Association.  He 
offered this statement very recently to the solicitor general: 
“Anyone can talk tough.  Let's see some action.  Here is a guy 
who has some power, but I have not seen him exercise it yet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be concerned when members of the policing community 
say those things.  Mr. Newark went on to say “We are not 
interested in what the government says any more.  We have had 
some very constructive and doable things that have run into a 
wall of indifference”.  I am very concerned about the confidence 
in the policing community when those sorts of comments are being 
made publicly by a gentleman like Mr. Newark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general outlined specifically some of the positive 
measures of his department and the initiatives to improve 
national security that would result in changes to our Immigration 
Act, the Extradition Act and the Official Secrets Act, among 
other statutes.  I would certainly hope that these measures do 
not have a long shelf life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the solicitor general for identifying the priority 
area of CSIS.  When this organization began a decade ago many 
assumed that the end of the cold war would result in a decrease 
in the need for international security.  Sadly, this has not been 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in Canada we have seen a rise in the area of organized 
crime.  This perhaps poses one of the biggest threats to national 
security at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 9 of the 1997 CSIS public report states:  “There are many 
activities in addition to the traditional threat activities which 
cause or have the potential to cause threats to the public safety 
of Canadians and the national security of Canada”.  Therefore, 
our focus may have to shift on the internal threats posed by 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I applaud the engagements of the solicitor 
general on behalf of CSIS to form intelligence activities, to 
enhance the protection of computer infrastructure, to review our 
counter-terrorism strategies and to apprise the government of 
foreign and domestic activities which may compromise public 
security.  However, with that said, I am still concerned about 
the lack of resources to effectively implement these very 
laudable plans.  Since the government took office in 1993 there 
have been more than 700 employees cut from CSIS, more than 
one-quarter of the total workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the solicitor general to engage his cabinet, in 
particular the finance minister, to see that this is not just 
talk and that these plans are going to be implemented.  Like my 
colleagues, I look forward to working on the justice committee 
with the solicitor general.

be answering Question No. 13 today. 
.[Text] 
<Question No. 13—<B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government leave out key recommendations contained 
in the draft report of the Review of Section 14 of the Patent Act 
Amendment 1992 (Chapter 2, Statutes of Canada 1993) submitted to 
the Ministries of Health and Industry by the Standing Committee 
on Industry in April 1997 and why, in particular, was 
recommendation N concerning the repeal of the linkage regulations 
left out? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> The government was 
not involved in finalizing the report of the Standing Committee 
on Industry, which completed its review of section 14 of the 
Patent Act Amendment Act, 1992 and presented its report to the 
House of Commons in April 1997.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  Yesterday in the House 
I asked the parliamentary secretary again when he expects to 
provide an answer to Question No. 21 which was asked on October 
2, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is bordering on lunacy.  It is bordering I suspect on a 
breach of parliamentary privilege when a person has to get up in 
the House and ask 10 times when the answer is going to come.  Not 
only are we not getting the answer, we are not even being 
provided a timeframe as to when that answer might come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the high regard I hold for the parliamentary 
secretary, I do want to put him on notice that this issue is not 
going to go away.  The case is not closed. I would like to have 
some idea when we might expect an answer to Question No. 21.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
</H3><P align=left>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEPATITIS C 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Today I received a letter from the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois requesting an emergency debate.  I give him the 
floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 52, I wish to request that the House 
hold an emergency debate regarding federal government 
compensation for all contaminated blood victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial governments signed an agreement on 
March 27, 1998 to compensate all those who contracted the 
hepatitis C virus through contaminated blood between January 1, 
1986 and July 1, 1990. 
Under this agreement, those who contracted the hepatitis C virus 
through contaminated blood before or after the dates mentioned 
in the agreement are not eligible for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite repeated requests from all opposition parties, the 
federal government still refuses to compensate victims excluded 
from the agreement with the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As justification, the federal government invoked the agreement 
signed with the provinces.  Government members suggested, 
however, that the government might re-examine its position if the 
provinces were prepared to propose extending the compensation 
program to all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, one of the parties to the agreement took a stand 
against the federal government's position. 
The Quebec National Assembly unanimously passed the following 
motion introduced by the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, and 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the National Assembly, subsequent to the motion passed 
unanimously on December 2, 1997, declare its support, on 
humanitarian grounds, for extending the existing compensation 
program to all contaminated blood victims not covered by the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the costs of extending this program be funded by 
the federal government, since the Government of Quebec is 
already covering the costs of all care and services provided to 
these individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Government of Quebec urge the 
federal government to follow up on this resolution and encourage 
the other provinces to make a similar request of the federal 
government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the Quebec National Assembly's unanimous vote, it is 
our view that the House of Commons should immediately and on an 
urgent basis consider its request.  Members will understand 
that, for humanitarian reasons, we cannot allow those who 
contracted the hepatitis C virus from contaminated blood and who 
are ineligible for compensation to remain in uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask you, Mr. Speaker, to make it possible for the 
House to truly play its role, and for all parliamentarians to be 
able to express their views freely, unfettered by party 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to give favourable consideration to my 
request for an emergency debate on humanitarian grounds. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

House that, under Standing Order 52.(4), to which the hon. 
member just referred— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Tell that to those who are dying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we have the right to rise on a 
point of order, we should also have the right to see that the 
Standing Orders are complied with. Standing Order 52.(4) reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker shall decide, without any debate, whether or not the 
matter is proper to be discussed. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When requesting leave to propose such a motion, the Member shall 
rise in his or her place and present without argument the 
statement referred to in section (2) of this Standing Order. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future I would certainly hope that the rule being invoked 
by members be at least followed by the same members invoking it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in view 
of what happened at the National Assembly in Quebec last night, 
fundamental changes have taken place in the circumstances 
surrounding this issue.  There certainly should be an emergency 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Today I did perhaps give a little extra 
time.  I accept responsibility for that.  The hon. government 
House leader is correct.  I and other members are well aware of 
the regulation he is referring to. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received the letter earlier this morning. I read it and I gave 
it careful consideration. I also paid close attention to the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SHIPPING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK35">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-15, an act to 
amend the Canada Shipping Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee. 
<A NAME="LINK36">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for the Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When shall the bill be read the third 
time, by leave now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<A NAME="LINK38">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for the Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> 
moved that the bill be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as always, I consider it a 
privilege to speak about Bill C-15 on the third reading debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I discuss the bill, the Minister of Transport and I would 
like to acknowledge the important role that has been played by 
the members of this House and the Standing Committee on Transport 
who have undertaken an examination on the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members will recall, this bill is the product of the 
first phase of a two track reform to overhaul the Canada Shipping 
Act, an act that is in serious need of major reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 will bring about change for the shipping industry, 
change that is recognized as necessary and highly anticipated. It 
is a modern statute that can only benefit the marine sector and I 
am pleased to see the process of the overhaul proceeding so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the bill enters third reading debate, I am happy to report 
that provisions of the bill have been favourably accepted. 
Concerns have been addressed by the standing committee and minor 
amendments proposed to the legislation have since been included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to Bill C-15 would not have been possible without the 
dedicated efforts and review of the bill by industry.  Industry 
involvement resulted in government amendments which have improved 
the wording of the statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Key amendments to Bill C-15 include the removal of the section 
of the bill which updated the regulation-making authority for the 
licensing of small vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previously stressed, this government is sensitive to the 
concerns raised by my colleagues in this place. I am pleased to 
say that the committee was able to have a thorough discussion on 
the issue of small craft licensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results are that the proposed section that caused concern 
has now been removed, while leaving the existing provisions of 
the act unchanged to permit continuous operation of Canada's 
licensing system which enables law enforcement agencies and 
rescue groups to locate and identify vessels. This change will 
provide the Department of Fisheries and Oceans with sufficient 
opportunity to review the regulation-making authority for the 
licensing of small vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, industry requested an amendment to clarify the 
government's intent regarding regulations for the control and 
management of ballast water in order to ensure that all ballast 
water was not treated as pollutant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statutory power to manage ballast water and to reduce 
harmful organisms being introduced into Canadian waters will now 
be available for all Canadian waters, including the Arctic. This 
will further strengthen environmental protection and enforcement 
mechanisms and will reduce the threat of harmful aquatic 
organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very pleased to see this progress.  It further 
supports the desire to continue with the overhaul of the Canada 
Shipping Act to produce new legislation that is modern and which 
will help industry operate safely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recap, this proposed legislation consists of a new addition 
to the act that outlines the objectives and framework of the act 
where this previously did not exist.  This will provide focus and 
direction for the entire statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the modernization of the ship registration and 
ownership provisions coupled with the other urgent amendments 
included from former Bill C-73 truly helped set the government's 
direction. 
We will achieve our goals of simplified legislation that is up to 
date, consistent with federal regulatory policies and able to 
successfully contribute to the economic performance of the marine 
industry. Industry stands behind us as we move toward a new 
statute and the government stands behind its commitment to 
deliver.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As efforts are made by Transport Canada to modernize the 
national transportation system it is recognized that modern 
shipping legislation is vital to meet the demands of a global 
marketplace and to prepare Canada for the upcoming century.  We 
are mindful of the need for Canada to remain competitive 
internationally as this is the very essence of a successful 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the process of consulting and subsequent drafting of 
this legislation officials from the Department of Transport have 
spoken at great length with industry, including shipowners, ship 
operators, seafarers, unions and the marine legal community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to thank these industry groups for their 
participation in this reform and their ongoing contribution and 
support for the new legislation. I am thoroughly convinced and I 
am sure every member of this House will agree that this new 
legislation represents an important step toward modernizing 
Canadian marine legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all my fellow colleagues, all members of parliament, to 
lend their support in order to pass this bill so it can also pass 
through the Senate in a timely fashion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. parliamentary secretary mentioned, Bill C-15 
did not receive much attention in committee from stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general consensus among the people in the marine industry 
seems to be they would like this legislation passed in order to 
get it out of the way and do away with any regulatory 
uncertainty.  I do not believe there is any debate on this side 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some non-commercial ramifications, however, to the 
marine act. As the hon. parliamentary secretary mentioned, in 
committee we did try to address the very well founded concerns of 
the millions of citizens who own small boats subject to 
regulation by DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A section was removed from the bill during the clause by clause 
examination.  This would have permitted the governor in council 
to require the registration of small boats for a fee.  I am very 
grateful this section is no longer included but under our system 
almost anything is possible under orders in council, and 
unamended section 108 of the existing marine act could still be 
used to achieve that same purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 108 has been in place since 1936 and it has not been 
abused, but this government, unlike any other government in my 
memory, loves to make regulations, loves registering things and 
loves to collect fees.  It is a disease.  It likes to collect 
fees on firearms, pleasure boats and, who knows, perhaps electric 
toothbrushes. In any event, we can only maintain an attitude of 
watchful caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent DFO publication entitled “Your Safety Comes First” is 
a classic example of what I am referring to about bureaucracy 
running amok, the busy work of desk sailors with nothing useful 
to do.  I have had many expressions of concern from people who 
feel the coast guard has lost its compass and is totally at sea 
with its intrusive, impractical lists of not dos and don'ts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my sincere apologies to my 
hon. colleague.  Fellow parliamentarians should have the 
opportunity to hear his words, but given that I do not see a 
quorum in the House at the moment, I think we should give this 
gentleman the opportunity to have his speech heard properly.

resume his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will read into the 
record a couple of samples from “Your Safety Comes First”. 
These are some of the requirements for vessels up to six metres 
in length.  This would include canoes: a buoyant heaving line of 
at least 15 metres or an approved throwable floating device; 
distress signals; a watertight flashlight and a heliograph or six 
Canadian approved flares, of which at least three must be of 
either type A, B or C and at least two of type D; navigation 
equipment; a sound signalling device and, if the vessel is 
operated between sunset and sunrise or in periods of restricted 
visibility, navigation lights that comply with the collision 
regulations. If the vessel is not power driven, navigation lights 
could be replaced by a watertight flashlight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gee, thanks.  And of course all canoes must now be equipped with 
tow lines.  The people who wrote this little guide did have some 
compassion, though.  They said that if a boat does not have a 
motor it does not require fire extinguishers. It amazes me that 
they realize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand this little bureaucratic effort was partially 
prompted by concerns over the proliferation of jet skis and of 
overpowered nuisance craft in recreational areas.  These are 
genuine concerns but these problems could be easily addressed by 
rigorously enforced local ordinances prohibiting their use in 
certain venues. Do not let them run the Sea Doos through the 
swimmers.  This is why we have local law enforcement. The dead 
hand of federal authority is hardly necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are merely cautionary remarks since they deal with 
something that is possible within existing legislative 
constraints.  We can only be vigilant and ready to respond to the 
wave of complaints that will inundate us when the decision is 
made to put licence plates on all canoes, if big nanny does 
everything she would like to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the new registration and regulation regime for 
commercial vessels is concerned, the Reform Party has no 
objections and we will support the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-15. My comments will be 
brief, if I am not interrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary and member for Hamilton West 
rightly pointed out, the purpose of this bill, which has the 
unanimous support of the Canadian and Quebec marine communities, 
is first and foremost to modernize an act which, if I am not 
mistaken, dates back to the beginning of the century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is always the case at report stage, the government can be 
assured of our party's co-operation and participation to ensure 
that this legislation is passed quickly and referred to the 
Senate which, unfortunately, is a totally useless institution. 
If we had only one House, as is the case in a number of 
democracies, we would not have to solicit the approval of a 
group of non-elected people rewarded for their political loyalty 
with patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we are in favour of this bill being passed quickly. As I 
said, there is unanimous support from the marine community, and 
there is a need to modernize the existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next few minutes, I would like to insist on a specific 
issue. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport 
was right to express his appreciation of the co-operation of the 
members of this House in the steps leading up to where we are 
today.  I will return the compliment by pointing out that he has 
made changes at the request of the Bloc Quebecois and others by 
withdrawing the clauses on mandatory registration as well as the 
charges for small vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out to him, both in private and in committee meetings, 
that, if the government followed through with its plans, I could 
guarantee that there would be widespread protests and 
demonstrations, since many small boat owners feel that the 
bill's intention to charge small vessels and require their 
registration is totally ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking here about motor boats on Lac Des Deux 
Montagnes, but the requirement to register pedal boats, 
rowboats, sailboards, canoes and kayaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Life preservers will be next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> The government has shown it could be 
reasonable by agreeing to delete those clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the owners of vessels of this type, including pedal 
boats, rowboats, sailboards, canoes and kayaks, to watch out, 
because in the past the government has shown some open-mindedness 
and withdrawn some clauses, but then sneaked them back into an 
omnibus bill on a Friday evening when there are fewer MPs in the 
House, since we are working hard in our ridings.  This would not 
be the first time the government has pulled such a sneaky trick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore call upon the owners of these vessels, the people 
who live in the Gaspé, Lower St. Lawrence, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, 
Lanaudière and Charlevoix regions, where there is a lot of 
recreational boating, hunting and fishing and where people like 
to go out for a relaxing paddle and a little fishing after 
supper with their dogs and children, to be very vigilant.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the regions should watch out because the government 
may be tempted to bring these proposals back again. The 44 
members of the Bloc Quebecois have been warned and they too will 
be vigilant in looking after the interests of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pointed this out to my colleague, the hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières, who is the Bloc Quebecois critic for the coast 
guard, as well as to the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who is our critic for 
fisheries. He will monitor legislation from Fisheries and 
Oceans, because the government might try to sneak something back 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the government and commend the fact it took advantage of 
Bill C-15 to correct an aberration and an unacceptable situation 
with respect to the Lower St. Lawrence pilots' pension plan. I 
thank the government for ensuring that the corporation in 
question will not be sued or suffer the inconvenience of 
possible lawsuits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the government for updating the provisions relating to 
the Lower St. Lawrence pilots' pension plan. The pilots' minds 
must be on what they are doing, which is first and foremost 
marine safety and environmental protection in our waters, and on 
the St. Lawrence river in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their minds must also be free to withstand the attacks of St. 
Lawrence ship owners who keep asking, every 18, 24, 30 or 36 
months, that compulsory pilotage be abolished in Canada. We know 
that the ship owners' lobby is very powerful because of the 
contributions it makes to the Liberal campaign fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, our party will support this bill at third reading. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak against Bill C-15, an act to amend the Canada 
Shipping Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, 
brought forward by the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party agree it is time to bring some 
clarification and we have heard that the Canada Shipping Act is 
second only in size and complexity to the Income Tax Act and 
could use some updating, as could the Income Tax Act. The New 
Democrats believe it is time to reform the Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 intends to do just that by adding a preamble to 
clarify its objectives, definitions and interpretations and to 
lay out the roles and responsibilities of the Minister of 
Transport and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans .  Currently 
there is no introductory part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my party has concerns with the bill.  I will not go 
into as much detail as I did at second reading but I do want to 
take the opportunity to say that it is somewhat annoying as to 
how we have dealt with Bill C-15.  Sometimes it is difficult for 
MPs to find that a bill is up one day and then not, then up again 
and then we wait for months.  For organizations and persons 
outside government it can be a strenuous task to follow the 
process of a bill, as with Bill C-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is being presented as just a housekeeping bill and we 
should not worry too much about it.  For the people in the 
maritime sector some of the changes are worrisome and critical, 
and these are some of the concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is common knowledge that sailors' human rights are often 
violated on foreign vessels.  We cannot accept in Canada to lower 
the working conditions of sailors.  We do not want a system in 
some countries of the third world where sailors have no rights 
aboard a ship, where they are at the mercy of the company they 
are working for.  Press articles have indicated that federal 
fisheries observers are afraid some foreign ships they are 
assigned to are in such poor shape they could break apart and 
sink.  We cannot expect it is only fishing vessels that are in 
bad shape.  This was certainly verified by presentations at the 
port state control meetings in Vancouver last month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worrying to think that the minister will hand over the 
inspections of the ships from Transport Canada inspectors.  Even 
if the inspections were to be handed over to classification 
societies there is still cause for concern.  It is no wonder that 
each year statistically 10 bulk carriers sink without a trace, 
usually taking a 25 person crew with them.  Yet the crews are 
mostly from third world countries we have never heard of.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very obvious when classification societies are allowed to 
operate without government supervision, the market sets the 
standards for safety with the job always going to the cheapest, 
usually least safe operator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we ready to accept such a system in Canada?  We suffer from 
the cuts to airports.  We suffer from the privatization of port 
police.  Are we now going to have to suffer because ship safety 
goes down?  We cannot put our safety or the environment in 
jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated at second reading, I strongly oppose the 
government's authorizing any person, classification society or 
other organizations to conduct the inspections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section is contrary to the stated objectives of the new 
act.  Privatization of inspection will not encourage viable, 
effective and economic marine transportation.  What it will do is 
increase bottom line pressures to cut corners and do things the 
cheapest way rather than the safe way.  It is very worrying to 
think that the minister will hand over the inspections of these 
ships from Transport Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were this amendment to pass into law, the job of inspecting oil 
tankers and chemical tankers operating in Canadian waters could 
become patronage appointments.  The classification societies 
include disclaimers of responsibility in all their documents and 
several court cases over the years have shown them immune from 
being sued, even where there is evidence of negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further point of concern is in section 317(1), inspections by 
others.  The revenues generated by Transport Canada ship 
inspections will now be handed over to the private sector.  A 
figure of $12 million per annum has been stated.  Canada must 
compete with the United States.  We are at a competitive 
disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard concerns that ships under 15 tonnes will be exempt 
from mandatory registration under the act. Their registration 
will be optional under section 17.  The department's logic is 
that the registration of the large number of small vessels is 
neither practical nor necessary.  However, tow boats under 15 
tonnes tow equipment and fuel barges as well as log tows 
competing with vessels which are registered and required to meet 
Transport Canada's vessel standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unregistered vehicles not only undercut vessels which meet 
standards, they are doing work which is hazardous to the 
environment and to marine traffic.  Often their equipment does 
not meet the standards and their operators are not certified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the major objectives in the Canada Shipping Act are to 
protect the health and well-being of individuals, including the 
crews of ships, promote safety in the maritime transportation 
system and protect the marine environment from damage due to 
navigation and shipping activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the act is intended to provide a level playing field, then 
all vessels engaged in commercial activities should be registered 
and inspected regardless of tonnage.  As well, the act should 
require risk assessment in standards of equipment and 
certification.  Registration should be required for all vessels 
towing fuel barges or other hazardous goods.  It is important for 
the safety of our waterways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been brought to my attention that with the downturn 
of the fishery on the east and west coasts, many fishermen have 
turned toward tourism as an alternative source of income.  This 
has led to an increasing number of tour boats.  These boats may 
be under 15 tonnes.  Are we going to put our tourists at risk on 
boats that are not duly inspected because they are less than 15 
tonnes?  Let there be no misunderstanding.  I am not suggesting 
that small pleasure craft need be inspected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of concern is the regulation respecting the control 
of ballast water.  In a move to protect Canadian waterways from 
outside pollutants, ballast water must be exchanged while at sea. 
There was concern that by referring to products brought in by 
ballast water as pollutants, this would be subject to more 
stringent enforcement.  To me that was a good thing.  I have been 
to the Vancouver port and heard the praises of the 
representatives with regard to their clean water which they noted 
in conjunction with the exchange of ballast water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope the changes in this section do not decrease 
Canadian standards and do not increase pollutants into Canadian 
waters, whether it be oil or outside water species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, Bill C-15 is an improvement over the previous act. 
But there are still many areas of concern.  As a result my party 
will not be supporting the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today on behalf of my colleague, the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester, to say a few words on Bill C-15, an act 
to amend the Canada Shipping Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act, as we are all aware, is one of the 
oldest pieces of legislation still in effect in Canada.  It was 
enacted in 1936.  It is the primary legislation today for 
governing Canadian ships in Canada's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the reorganization of both the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the Department of Transport, new emphasis and a 
clearer outline of ministerial responsibilities of both these 
departments is now needed.  The merger of the Canadian Coast 
Guard with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans was completed 
with the responsibility for coast guard functions being 
transferred to DFO with the exception of harbours, ports, ship 
safety, pilotage and crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada now has the prime responsibility for overseeing 
the reform of the Canada Shipping Act.  However, some sections of 
the act will fall within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 
specifically those relating to pleasure craft, search and rescue, 
wrecks, and pollution preparedness and response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform that is currently under way will help simplify the 
regulatory framework and make the shipping act more consistent 
with current regulatory policy.  In the end, reforms should help 
contribute to a better economic performance in the marine 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has chosen to carry out these reforms in a two 
step approach.  The first step takes place with Bill C-15.  Under 
Bill C-15 there will be a new general part that will be added to 
the beginning of the act followed by a revision of the existing 
part one that will deal with ship registration, ownership and 
mortgages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part two of the reform to the act will deal with the remaining 
parts of the shipping act, specifically areas of safety, 
certification, conditions of work, accident investigation, 
navigation, wrecks and salvage and economic and environmental 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time it is my understanding that part two of the reform 
is estimated to be ready next year in 1999.  We anxiously await 
these reforms.  We look forward to reviewing and debating the 
issues that will emerge at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 will enable Transport Canada to assume complete 
responsibility for ship registration and related activities. The 
Minister of Transport will be permitted through this act to 
appoint a chief registrar who will be responsible for the 
registration of ships. The registrar will deal with specific 
information such as the name and description of the Canadian 
ship, the official number and its registered tonnage, the name 
and address of its owner and details of all mortgages registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gives Transport Canada the responsibility for ship 
registration currently performed by Revenue Canada, customs and 
excise division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will require that every ship that exceeds 15 
tonnes gross tonnage is owned only by qualified people and that 
those not registered in a foreign country would have to be 
registered. Also proposed in the bill for the first time certain 
foreign ships will be allowed to register in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this party are in favour of many of the reforms included 
in this bill.  It is important to point out that Bill C-15 was 
introduced in October 1997.  However, it is essentially the same 
bill as Bill C-73 introduced in December 1996. Unfortunately, 
because of the election, the bill died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reforming the outdated shipping act is important and it can 
provide significant benefits for Canada such as more employment 
and business opportunities for Canadians, a rejuvenated marine 
infrastructure and better service for Canadian exporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under sections 35 and 36, the minister 
can appoint persons to be known as tonnage measurers who 
calculate a ship's tonnage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tonnage measurer may withhold the tonnage certificate until 
the person requesting it pays the tonnage measurer's fees and 
travel expenses.  The minister may set limits on the fees and 
expenses charged.  Although tonnage measuring is obviously 
important, we hope that fees and expenses remain reasonable so we 
may limit possible additional costs being passed on to shippers. 
This is something to consider and watch for in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Part I of the act will be replaced with a new Part I 
that would modernize the registration of ships. Certificate of 
registry will now have an expiry date.  The subject of expiration 
is understandable in the context of the transitional period 
updating the registration of ships from the old act to 
registration under the new act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, section 48 outlines many sweeping changes that cabinet 
may make.  One area of concern under this section is the issuance 
and renewal of certificates of registry.  Although it is 
important to have updated registration information about all 
ships, we hope that future changes that may be made will not mean 
more bureaucracy or excessive costs associated with too frequent 
registration requirements.  We have to be very careful of that. 
It was a concern of the member for Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will be 
provided with greater authority to regulate pleasure craft.  In 
this regard we are somewhat concerned that the government not go 
too far in the regulation of pleasure craft.  If there is a 
safety risk we are certainly in favour of it, but let us not have 
regulation for regulation's sake.  We would encourage caution 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased with certain aspects of the bill.  Clauses 
pertaining to definitions are important.  Passenger safety will 
be enhanced by eliminating the specific reference to owner or a 
charterer in the current definition of passenger, which in the 
past possibly permitted some charterers to get around meeting 
specific safety regulations.  Therefore we think it is a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cumberland—Colchester wishes to bring the issue 
of small vessels to the attention of the House.  This legislation 
deals mostly with large vessels.  It has not taken into account 
that small vessels are very often built by manufacturers or 
individual owners that may have fallen outside of regulations 
that apply to larger vessels.  It is important that these 
manufacturers comply with construction and manufacturing 
standards just as manufacturers of larger vessels do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this bill.  It is long overdue.  It is unfortunate 
the legislation was not passed when it was in the form of Bill 
C-73.  However, it is here now and we support it, especially 
since it has gone through the committee process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one of my colleagues addressed this bill at second reading 
he expressed concern that the bill would apply to pleasure craft 
as if they were larger commercial ships.  Given the millions of 
pleasure craft in Canada this would, at best, be a bureaucratic 
nightmare.  At worst it would be a huge tax grab on behalf of the 
federal government.  I am told that our point of view prevailed 
at committee, so the bill's application to pleasure craft will be 
amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we would do well to be vigilant as we have heard 
rumblings that DFO will try to do this through existing 
regulatory power.  We will be watching this matter with some 
concern as the future unfolds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this initiative and we look forward to phase two of 
the reform which is slated for next year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I always do, I sat in my 
place and listened to all the members opposite give their 
representations.  Therefore, I will take this opportunity to make 
a comment rather than to ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to respond to the hon. member who just spoke and, as an 
aside, respond to members opposite, especially the member of the 
New Democratic Party who addressed the issue of delegation of 
ship inspections to a classification society.  I want to respond 
to her concerns and the concerns of her party, even though the 
NDP is the only party in this place which will oppose the bill. 
The hon. member had an opportunity both in committee and here 
today to bring forward a constructive amendment, but there was no 
amendment.  However, the NDP is still going to oppose the bill. 
It is rather confusing, but I guess they can oppose for 
opposition's sake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear to the hon. member and her party that 
the objectives of the Canada Shipping Act make it clear that the 
Minister of Transport is responsible for all matters relating to 
marine safety involving commercial ships.  In order to achieve 
these objectives the minister is authorized to enter into 
agreements respecting the administration of any provision of the 
Canada Shipping Act or the regulations.  The minister can 
authorize any person with whom an agreement or arrangement is 
entered into to exercise and perform such powers and duties under 
the act as are specified in the agreement or the arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed provisions in the bill are consistent with this 
authority and in no way—and I speak directly to the NDP member—undermine 
the overall safety of the marine community.  Given that 
the minister is delegating this authority to organizations such 
as classification societies which will conduct inspections on 
behalf of the minister, the minister must be satisfied that the 
delegated party is qualified to perform the assigned duties.  The 
minister will only delegate responsibilities to qualified 
organizations or persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Classification societies are international, not for profit 
organizations that provide ship survey expertise around the world 
and, as such, Transport Canada will enter into a memorandum of 
understanding with every delegated organization to establish 
reporting mechanisms and to establish the qualifications required 
for personnel carrying out the delegated responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure adherence to agreements and memoranda, any delegation 
of authority will be subjected to Transport Canada audit and 
quality assurance.  These organizations or persons will be 
audited by Transport Canada inspectors through spot checks and 
documented audits.  The department will also conduct inspections 
on any shipowners suspected of contravening marine safety 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to thank the hon. member from 
the NDP for her interjection.  It is unfortunate that while every 
party in the House is prepared to support the bill only members 
of the NDP are not.  I hope this latest interjection by myself 
will maybe change their minds at the end of the day. If it does 
not and there are no amendments forthcoming, it is rather 
puzzling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try in the 13 minutes at my disposal to 
continue my remarks and instruct the members opposite on a 
potential management philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> There aren't any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> There may not be many of them, but I am sure 
we can rouse them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To carry on where I left off, I mentioned yesterday to them 
that, according to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans, which tabled a unanimous report, a consensus had to be 
reached on the fish stocks problem in Canada.  The five parties 
in the House were unanimous in describing the problem as poor 
federal government management. 
This is not me speaking, it is what the House standing committee 
report said, unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, once we agree on the problem, we can start looking for 
solutions.  The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, 
again unanimously, said an independent committee should look at 
the management methods of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
and the methods used to determine acceptable catches, that is, 
just how much fishers can catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to this point the recipe is fine.  We can see the approach. 
First, we agree on a definition of the problem and, second, on 
how to find a solution. An independent committee is not 
something that works along party lines. But why go that route? 
This is where it gets interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee is not the only one to say that the 
public has lost confidence. So does the advisory committee on 
fishery resources.  I am told that it too raised the matter of 
the fishers' and the general public's loss of confidence in the 
management of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a really big question in mind: Who will administer Bill 
C-27 and who will sign the United Nations Fisheries Agreement? 
The same gang that is responsible for depletion of the stocks. 
That makes no sense whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are being offered an opportunity to get that confidence 
back.  First of all, the public and the fishers must be 
consulted, and agreement reached with them on acceptable means 
of management and on total catches, as well as how these will be 
determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, the same recipe that was used in the past is the one 
being used for the UNFA, and the same gang is still in charge. 
They need to put their house in order.  Confidence must be 
restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another approach to suggest to the minister.  The 
Constitution of Canada says that the federal government is 
responsible for fish catches.  When the minister is questioned 
closely, he says he is responsible for conservation.  But what 
is he saving, the resource, or his people's jobs?  This is where 
it gets a bit disconcerting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody is mad at them, even the staunchest federalists are 
saying that this no longer makes any sense.  If the minister 
really wants to think about conservation, let him do so. But 
what I want to see, as proof of his desire to do so, is 
fisheries plans, which are one way of preserving the resource, 
and agreement with the fishers.  When we refer to a fisheries 
plan, we mean one relating to conservation measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the crab fishing plan for zone 12 of the Gulf not been 
released yet?  Have the biologists not given their opinion? 
Yes, they have.  Have the fishers and the departmental staff not 
reached agreement on the Panel on Ice?  Yes.  What is left in 
connection with conservation that needs to be studied?  Is it 
not rather the economic questions that are not settled?  If it 
is economic questions that need to be looked at before releasing 
the fisheries plan, is this not exceeding the mandate?  That is 
another good question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he really wants to solve economic problems, I can mention a 
few that come under his responsibility, TAGS for instance.  It 
is also part of his jurisdiction to solve the AFS problem and to 
have an overall vision of fisheries.  But this has not been 
resolved yet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee agreed unanimously on its 
recommendations, including Recommendation No. 10.  He was asked 
to extend TAGS with all those who were participating in it from 
the beginning until the moratoriums are lifted, or as long as no 
management decision has been taken regarding the size of the 
industry and its future direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to decide what this direction should be, the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development should talk with the provinces.  If rationalization 
is what they are hoping for, how are they going to persuade the 
provinces to go along with rationalizing their plant workers 
unless this is tied in with the catch? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one approach would be to offer historic quotas.  That 
would be one way of reassuring the provinces about the 
rationalization plan that they will have to come up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the minister's constant answer to our questions is that 
his job is protection, all he has to do is sit tight here in 
Ottawa and say “My job is to ensure that the number of fish 
taken is not greater than the number I have authorized”. 
However, in that case, he should let the provinces, with the 
quota they are given, share the resource and reach an agreement 
with workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what should be done, particularly as there have been 
some changes since my arrival in Ottawa in 1993.  The Minister 
of Human Resources Development knows very well that, as a result 
of constructive criticism, there are manpower training 
agreements with the provinces. 
Why would the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans not delegate 
quotas to his provincial counterparts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development could then say to a 
province “You will decide how many people you need and we will 
give you money to retrain the rest.  But you will do it as you 
see fit, in terms of what you have to offer”.  Everybody knows 
that Canada is a big country, but the problems in the Gaspé are 
not necessarily the same as those in St. John's or Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is 1998.  I understood this a long time ago, and I would 
like them to understand it as well.  So I am making this 
suggestion. I would like the minister to tell me how he could do 
otherwise, and to try to answer the question as to how the 
provinces can agree to rationalize their fishers if the resource 
is not tied to the number of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go a little further to give the minister and Canadians a 
chance to solve the issue, other management tools must be put in 
place. Once the provinces have their quotas and their 
traditional share, they should set up unloading facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? This is always of interest to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans. As we know, there are fewer fish than there used to be, 
at least in the case of cod, redfish and turbot. But there are 
other species of fish. Why are we not able to find a market for 
the so-called underused species? It is precisely because they are 
not numerous enough or because we are not used to them. We 
should get consumers interested in these other species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you the example of a fisher who arrived at the port 
with 8,000 to 10,000 pounds of turbot, which was its main catch, 
6,000 pounds of redfish and, because I put him in contact with 
other markets, 1,000 pounds of monkfish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The turbot brought in between $6,000 and $7,000, since fishers 
try to make a trip that will bring in about $10,000. The 5,000 
to 6,000 pounds of redfish at 20 cents per pound were worth 
$1,000. However, the 1,000 pounds of monkfish, which used to be 
thrown back into the water because no one knew this species in 
the Gaspe Peninsula at the time, found a market at $1 per pound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fisher realized that his 5,000 to 6,000 pounds of redfish 
was taking a lot of room on his boat and was not worth more than 
the 1,000 pounds of monkfish, which he could handle individually 
when lifting his nets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can concentrate on these 1,000-pound catches of monkfish, 
skate and other species whose names I do not know or I forget, 
it will allow us to develop a distribution network that will 
ensure the survival of our fisheries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could a province or region of Canada establish such 
mechanisms if they do not have the tools?  I urge the minister 
to be very careful to stick to the existing formula.  Everyone 
in the Gaspé, Newfoundland and New Brunswick knows that the 
resource is migratory, and it does not reach our shores at the 
same time and in the same quantities.  These are things that 
must be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is in a better position to take a decision and direct 
fishers and markets in the morning, than the person closest to 
the dock, who is in contact with them, someone in Newfoundland 
who will say “Okay, boys, in the morning I can give you such and 
such a contract. 
Everyone who finds that in their nets should bring it in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishers are well aware that it will be a matter of luck, but the 
20% or 25% of fish in their holds will perhaps give them their 
profit margin in the end.  In the Canadian context, this is 
difficult to do because people always want wall-to-wall clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like there to be discussion with the provinces.  If I 
take the example of Newfoundland—and I am sure that my colleague 
will say the same thing in a few minutes—when Newfoundland 
entered Confederation, one of the conditions was that their 
fishing rights would be protected.  In talking with 
representatives from Newfoundland this week, I was surprised to 
learn that they are not kept informed by the minister. 
The people in Ottawa know more about the future of the fishery 
than the public in their own riding, when those are the people 
who can see the dock from their window. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes are in order.  I see my time is running out, but at 
least I was able to suggest a few solutions that are instructive 
for the members opposite, that let the public know solutions are 
possible.  We must address this whole problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that the Bloc Quebecois will be voting for Bill C-27, 
but with reservations.  As it now stands, all the bill does is 
let the minister sidestep the issue.  He is merely giving the 
illusion that he is doing something about the fisheries and that 
he will try to find an answer to the problem, when he could have 
gone to Washington to sign the UN fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should start by going down to the docks and trying to sort 
out the fishing plans with fishers.  People are waiting.  Next 
week will be the fourth week the crab fishery has sat idle, and 
the minister is still rooted to the spot.  It is time he took 
action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express the support of the New Democratic Party for Bill C-27, 
which amends the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada 
Shipping Act in order to implement the Agreement for the 
Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the conservation 
and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory 
fish stocks, which straddle the 200-mile zone, and are also known 
as straddling fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends Canadian legislation to enable Canada to ratify 
the United Nations agreement on the conservation and management 
of stocks of straddling fish and highly migratory fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement was adopted by consensus on August 5, 1995 at the 
UN conference in New York. 
It is important because it will help to limit overfishing on the 
Grand Banks of Newfoundland and allow the signatories to 
formulate new provisions for control on the high seas.  It will 
also enable authorities to monitor the signatories' intervention 
with foreign vessels outside their coastal zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Straddling fish are found on both sides of national fishing 
limits.  They also cross them as they migrate, in the case of 
flounder and turbot.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highly migratory fish, such as tuna and swordfish, also 
travel in the high seas and sometimes move through the exclusive 
economic zone of coastal states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is important because it will help protect both types 
of fish stocks, which have been the focus of unregulated 
overfishing in the high seas.  Overfishing is a problem in a 
number of places around the world, as on the Grand Banks of 
Newfoundland, beyond the Canadian 200-mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overfishing by foreign vessels outside and inside the 200-mile 
limit was a factor in the decline of straddling stocks of cod, 
flounder and turbot in the northwest Atlantic. 
Stock declines have had a very serious impact on the economy of 
coastal villages in Canada and forced thousands of fishers and 
plant workers onto unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which 
came into force in 1994, clearly authorizes coastal states, that 
is, those that border on the ocean, to have exclusive fisheries 
management jurisdiction up to 200 miles, or 370.4 kilometres, 
off their coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the states' legal rights and obligations with respect 
to straddling and highly migratory fish stocks are not clear. 
The agreement fills this gap left in the Convention on the Law 
of the Sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement will come into force once 30 states have ratified 
it or acceded to it. So far, it has been signed by 59 states and 
ratified by 15, including the United States, Russia and Norway. 
Canada will be in a position to ratify the agreement once this 
legislation is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that the new legal framework for high sea fisheries 
will include control measures and effectively protect straddling 
and highly migratory fish stocks against overfishing on high 
seas. Conservation and management measures would go a long way 
to ensure the viability of this critical food source for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is required to protect fish stocks outside the 200 
mile zone against overfishing. I wonder why the Canadian 
government took so long to introduce a bill providing for the 
ratification of the agreement. I should not be surprised, 
though, since this government is one that drags its feet, and 
that has become a habit in the fisheries issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada 
Shipping Act for instance. 
I just love that name, it sounds so convincing, just like 
campaign promises.  If I support this recommendation, I do so 
mainly in the interests of the people of the Atlantic provinces, 
for it is obvious where the old act led us, into a fisheries 
crisis, as far as turbot and Atlantic groundfish, and other 
species, are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That crisis has cost the government and the industry thousands 
of dollars.  When the cod fishery was shut down, we saw how the 
Canadian public paid for it in the loss of economic 
side-benefits.  Canada was one of the biggest cod exporters in 
the world.  Today, with the small amount of cod we can find 
along the coasts, the industry is having trouble getting back 
into the market.  Lacking cod, buyers have opted for other 
accessible species from anywhere in the world, and not 
specifically Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents a big loss for Canada.  The hope that some day 
this fishery will become accessible and profitable is still both 
vague and far distant.  In my region, it is distressing to see 
how many boats are tied up at wharves.  People's morale is at 
rock bottom.  Their boats end up just rotting away where they 
are moored. Is this normal?  No, especially not in a coastal 
region such as mine.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have known prosperity, but now we have fallen into poverty, 
deep poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis has had many consequences, the worst of which is the 
human cost, the lives devastated by the fisheries crisis.  In a 
coastal area like mine, fish is the principal resource, and one 
which provides the local people with seasonal employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the majority of the fish plant workers, cod is what puts 
their bread on the table.  Today, however, they have no more 
jobs. So, the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy was created.  The cod 
fisheries have not opened up again, yet TAGS is to end in August. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will people do? Ask yourself that question. With no work 
and no income, the future looks bleak. I wonder why, given that, 
under the five-year agreement, the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy 
was to end in April of 1999. The government then moved that date 
up to April 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the government did not keep its promises. In an attempt 
to appease the public, it changed the date to August 1998. Since 
the House does not sit in August, we will not be able to rise 
and to criticize the government for the problems in the Atlantic 
provinces. In August, 26,000 Newfoundlanders and thousands of 
people in New Brunswick will be out on the street. In May, 3,000 
Newfoundlanders will no longer be eligible for the Atlantic 
Groundfish Strategy, nor will half of the New Brunswickers now 
benefiting from it. This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking the government to throw money at the problem. 
We are saying that it must find a strategy to help people in the 
Atlantic region. It cannot leave these people high and dry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an unpublished report suggesting that Atlantic 
residents should move. Surprise, surprise, I would never make 
such a recommendation. We want to stay in the Atlantic region. 
We have no intention of moving because of anyone. We must sit 
down together in this House and find solutions for Atlantic 
residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are not responsible for the mistake made by senior 
public servants, according to the report submitted by the 
parliamentarians who traveled to the Atlantic region. That 
committee was made up of Liberals, Reformers, Conservatives and 
New Democrats. They were unanimous in saying that fisheries had 
not been properly managed in the Atlantic region. Today, the 
government is turning around and abandoning these people. This 
is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days ago, I talked to fishers in Newfoundland who told me 
that if the program is eliminated and not replaced by another 
one, they would take their boats and go back out to sea. They 
will not have any choice. The situation will not change if the 
government shirks its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Brian Tobin, who 
was instrumental in the establishment of the Atlantic Groundfish 
Strategy, signed letters with the premiers of New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. These 
premiers are asking the federal government to sit down with them 
and find a solution for Atlantic fisheries, for the 26,000 
people who will be out on the street in August, which is most 
regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again today, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is dragging 
his feet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people from our region, the people in New Brunswick, the 
Gaspé and zone 12, have their boats ready to head out to sea. 
The fish plants are set to open and employees have run out of 
EI.  Once again, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is 
dragging his feet, at the expense of workers and ordinary folk. 
Today, he wonders why a member rises in the House and is 
frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am expressing the frustration of the Atlantic provinces.  I am 
expressing the frustration of people from my region.  I am 
expressing the frustration of families who have nothing left to 
eat, nothing left to put on the table.  They cannot survive on 
welfare. 
It is the lives of these people that the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans holds in his hands.  He could have announced the 
fishing plan last week.  Once again, it is not just the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans' senior officials who are dragging their 
feet, but the minister himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I rose in the House to ask if he was going to 
establish a fishing plan for people in my region, and all he 
could think of to say was that it was coming.  How far has the 
fishing plan got?  Has it reached Montreal, Quebec City, 
Rivière-du-Loup, Edmundston?  We are sure looking forward to 
seeing it get as far as Caraquet, I can tell you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government's role with respect to the present state 
of the fishery?  What has it done wrong?  It is true that the 
government has taken decisions such as the one to create the 
Fisheries Resource Conservation Council, the FRCC. 
When the council was created, the government reassured the 
industry that it would serve as a consultant to the fishery and 
an adviser to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, the FRCC is trying to fulfil its mandate through 
consultations. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans receives 
advice from it, but is in no way implementing or considering it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of consulting and not considering the advice 
and information received?  The government is using initiatives 
such as this one to avoid reality and sidestep its 
responsibilities because, ultimately, it is accountable to the 
Canadian public.  It should stop looking out for its own 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems have not gone away.  That is why the government has 
now decided to use words like protection, conservation and 
processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the government should do its job.  It should take 
our fish and create a secondary and tertiary processing 
industry.  It should help businesses to take our resource and 
develop other products from it for the good of our own people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a truly important industry for our people.  We can 
almost think of everyone on the Acadian peninsula as one people, 
or those along the Newfoundland coast, where fish could be 
caught and a secondary and tertiary processing industry 
developed, to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Atlantic region, we would like to see those fine words 
translated into action, since they suit the fisheries industry 
well.  People just want to work, and they see fishing as a way 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does resource protection mean?  At what price, and which 
country will pay that price?  Before providing work for people 
elsewhere, we should be providing jobs for the people here, for 
Canadians.  Can the government impose quotas on the fishing 
industry and then say to the foreign fleet “Welcome, just help 
yourselves”?  Meanwhile, our people here are going hungry, and 
there is not much on their plates they can help themselves to, 
believe me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop for a minute and look at the fisheries situation. 
What we want is to see it managed, to see the fishery managed 
for the benefit of the Canadian public.

member for Acadie—Bathurst, 1997 version, defending the people 
in his riding this way.  I say the 1997 version of the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, because, previous to the 1997 version, we had 
the father of the employment insurance reform, Doug Young, the 
man responsible for the economic mess people are living in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, however, I was very hopeful.  I thought that if the

he had a few cards up his sleeve.  Today, we have understood—he 
had no trump cards.  I think that is what the people of

you imagine the difference in the amount of work when quotas 
suddenly drop from 20,000 to 12,000 metric tons? It is almost a

</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for the lobster industry. In past years, quotas 
were set. In fact, they were not quotas but total allowable 
catches. Some lobster fishers could catch 20,000 or 25,000 
pounds of lobster. Today, they harvest about 6,000 or 7,000 
pounds. It is not easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I say that the fisheries minister should get 
involved. 
In 1997, I issued a challenge to the other side of the House, 
and I was prepared to get involved. I suggested that the federal 
government come to our region, with people who could make 
decisions, and organize a conference with members of Parliament, 
the federal and provincial fisheries ministers, fishers, and 
plant workers and owners, to try to come up with ideas and 
solutions together. We can sit down, discuss intelligently and 
figure out what we can do for our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is in Ottawa, Toronto or Montreal, people enjoy going 
out to eat some nice fish or lobster, but it takes fishers to 
catch that fish or lobster. It takes plant workers to process 
it. Lobster and crab taste so good, but it takes people to 
harvest them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I say something can be done. I have a number of 
suggestions regarding, for instance, secondary and tertiary 
processing. Why take our fish and ship it abroad without first 
turning it into a finished product? The government keeps saying 
that it is not its responsibility to create jobs; it is however 
its responsibility to develop the infrastructure required to do 
so. I think that together we can succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfortunate for the people in our regions. I have 
meetings scheduled for the weekend with people in my region to 
discuss the three fish plants that had to close down and try to 
find solutions. Hopefully, the answer will not be the one the 
fisheries minister gave us last week when he said that the 
fisheries plan would be forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he check with the people in Montreal, Quebec City, 
Rivière-du-Loup, Edmundston or Bathurst? In any case, he has not 
hit the Acadian peninsula yet. 
He should give us our fisheries plan so that we can put our 
people to work, because they want to work. He should take 
positive action instead of giving answers that do not make any 
sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the remarks made by my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you that, in these times of economic growth, in the 
best country in the world, as our Prime Minister often refers to 
Canada with its modern technology, it is really moving to hear 
this heartfelt plea to fight poverty and help those who are 
going hungry. I cannot help but wonder if the problem with this 
great country is not one of mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the $14 billion sitting in the employment insurance fund, 
the $50 billion being paid out in interest charges on the debt 
accumulated by the Liberals over the years, the $750 million 
recently invested in submarines that were not good enough for 
England, and the $30 million recently spent on flags, I would 
like to ask my hon. colleague if he could feed the people in his 
riding with all this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we could put this money to good use. There is however 
one point on which I disagree. If I were in office, you can be 
sure I would not use this money for patronage purposes as the 
Liberals do in our region and I would not be buying votes as 
they do on a daily basis. Perhaps that is the problem. They have 
done so in the past and they still do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Come on, be nice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  It is very hard to be nice when you know 
what is going on, when there is a guy like Doug Young.  Our 
people are suffering and he is getting millions of dollars from 
the taxpayers.  It is pretty hard to be nice to your government. 
The people of New Brunswick know that.  The people of this 
country should know that it is pretty hard to be nice to your 
government when there are all these expenses and kids are going 
to school with no food in their stomachs.  It is pretty hard to 
be nice.  It is pretty hard to be nice to that party. Just look 
what it has been doing to the Atlantic region.  It was not 
without reason that they voted in the NDP in Nova Scotia's last 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell all Canadians today that the government can say it 
worries or the people can say they worry about the NDP because it 
spends too much.  The NDP has never been in power as a national 
party in this country.  This country is in debt like we have 
never seen and it is not the NDP that did it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend my colleagues from the Bloc and the NDP for their great 
speeches.  It was nice to see them bring some concern and some 
passion to the debate.  It is obvious they are aware of the 
fishery problems, the conservation problems and the enforcement 
problems.  They are certainly well versed in the difficulties 
faced by their constituents in their ridings and in their 
provinces.  Again I commend them both for the speeches they gave 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-27, a bill relating to the 
conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks.  We are talking about cod, flounder, 
turbot, tuna and swordfish.  These fish are very important for 
the livelihoods of Atlantic Canadians, all Canadians and the 
entire world.  We are talking about a renewable resource, a 
valuable protein source for the entire world.  That is why I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will support any piece of legislation, measure or initiative 
that improves conservation and improves and enhances the 
protection of our fishery resources.  I will support any measure 
that provides for more effective enforcement.  In my view this 
legislation does all three.  I go on record up front as saying 
that I do support the initiatives of this legislation.  I do 
support the ratification of the United Nations fishery agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with previous speakers that it is with regret we are so 
late in getting this legislation to the floor of the House of 
Commons.  We should have dealt with it before because Canada has 
been a leader in this United Nations fisheries agreement.  We 
have led in promoting it and in getting it to this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other speakers have alluded to the fact that the agreement has 
59 signatories.  I believe there have been 17 ratifications and a 
number of other ratifications are ready to be made.  We are at 
the point where we are almost too late because we need 30 
ratifications before the agreement can come into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government moves this legislation forward very 
quickly so that before we adjourn for the summer we will have 
dealt with the bill.  It is so important for Atlantic Canada, all 
Canadians and the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important measure and there are very important 
conservation principles included in this legislation. There will 
be an exchange of information, an exchange of science and catch 
data.  These are all very important to the conservation of our 
fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the great problems we are experiencing in Atlantic 
Canada.  They have been brought to the forefront of the nation in 
the last 48 hours by demonstrations in Newfoundland and Labrador 
and by the disruption of government services.  That is very 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People may say how is this connected, how does this piece of 
legislation, in any way, relate to what is happening in 
Newfoundland and Labrador and in Atlantic Canada today. It 
relates in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The straddling stocks we are talking about, the fish that 
swim inside and outside our 200 mile economic zone, have been 
subjected to tremendous harvesting pressure inside and more so 
outside the 200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreigners for years and years have scooped that fish up once it 
went outside the 200 mile limit on the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks, the Flemish cap, what is referred to as the nursery 
grounds for juvenile fish.  They are nursery grounds, great 
feeding grounds where these fish feed and grow. They swim in and 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is very important but it relates to the 
situation in Newfoundland and Labrador today in that these stocks 
have been decimated.  We cannot point the finger at the 
foreigners.  We have to take some of the blame and some of the 
responsibility for where we are today with our fish stocks, 
particularly with our groundfish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very discouraging and disconcerting yesterday in question 
period to hear the Prime Minister try to blame this crisis on the 
previous Conservative government, the previous Tory 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem has been building for at least 30 years, the same 
number of years the Prime Minister so often boasts about in this 
House that he has been a member of parliament.  It is about the 
same length of time.  The Prime Minister has been in more 
administrations and in more cabinets and in more government 
departments, I would say, than any other member of this House, 
certainly sitting today.  Therefore he must take some of this 
responsibility through the Trudeau years and the Turner years and 
now through his own administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mulroney administration and the Clark administration must 
take some of the responsibility as well because they made 
management decisions that were not in the best interests of our 
groundfish stocks and this very renewable resource worth billions 
of dollars to Atlantic Canada per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought this very rich, renewable resource into Confederation 
and we have very little left today.  When we brought this 
resource into Confederation, who became the custodian of the 
resource?  It was the Government of Canada.  The government was 
to look out for, protect, control and manage this resource for 
the benefit of Atlantic Canadians and indeed for all Canadians. 
It has not done a very good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive federal governments have not done a very good job at 
managing as the custodians of our resources. That is why we find 
ourselves in the position we are in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Fisheries and Oceans decides the number of 
vessels that fish off our shores.  It determines the size of the 
vessels that fish off our shores.  It determines and approves the 
harvesting technologies that these vessels use.  It determines 
the fish quotas, the total allowable catches, how much fish is 
caught and when it is caught.  All those are decisions of the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans of our national government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial governments of Atlantic Canada have no 
jurisdiction or control.  The fishermen have no jurisdiction or 
control.  The unions have no jurisdiction or control.  The 
Government of Canada has total control over our fish resources 
and management of those very valuable resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been let down big time by bad decision after bad 
decision. That is why we have the very volatile situation in 
Atlantic Canada today.  People do not know where they are going 
to turn.  Their futures are very uncertain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some days the federal government tells them they should move to 
some other province in Canada to find work. 
Others suggest they go on welfare.  These are proud, hardworking 
people.  It is not a very pleasant thought when you have worked 
25 or 30 years in an industry, working 12 months a year, and 
someone tells you to pack up your bags and move out or go in the 
welfare line.  Unless the government comes up with an acceptable 
plan and program for those people that is exactly what they are 
facing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had people call me who are 55, 56 years of age and ask me 
“What are we going to do?  We own our home here. We are not well 
trained.  We are not well educated.  All we have done all our 
lives is work in the fishery.  What advice can you give us?”  It 
is a difficult question. Where are they going to find work?  If 
they do find work how much will they be paid?  At least they own 
their homes where they are now and they want to continue to live 
and work there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the dilemma these thousands of people we have talked 
about in the last number of weeks find themselves in. This is a 
crisis that has been caused by mismanagement by the federal 
government, mismanagement of their resource, the people's 
resource, a common resource, a very valuable renewable resource 
that has been totally and grossly mismanaged by the Government of 
Canada, not by any other government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to admit its responsibility.  It has been 
very devastating to those people and that is why we see what is 
happening in Newfoundland and Labrador today.  Those people want 
an answer.  They want a future.  More and more of them are 
willing to accept early retirement.  More fishermen are willing 
to sell their licences and get out of the industry, but that will 
not take care of all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands have already gone and become better educated and 
better trained and found employment in other professions. 
Thousands have left the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
There are communities with no young people left. When you go to 
these communities all you find are people who are in their mid 
fifties and sixties, basically retirement people.  What are we 
leaving behind to continue with our rural way of life and the 
social fabric of those communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not understand this.  It is very disturbing when you 
come to the House of Commons representing more of those people 
than any other member, which I do.  I have more TAGS clients in 
the riding of Burin—St. George's than any other riding in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come here day after day and I try to bring the message to the 
federal government.  I see so few members here who even want to 
listen or participate in this important debate, particularly 
those from Ontario, those who are most resisting any help to 
those people, the 99 or 100 who are so opposed to helping the 
people of Atlantic Canada, who resist in caucus week after week 
and heckle MPs from Atlantic Canada who get up and promote the 
cause of their people.  That is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  The member can say not true all he 
likes.  I know full well it is true.  He can have his chance when 
he stands in his place in debate.  He can stand in his place and 
give his side of the story and we will see then what he supports 
for the people of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some concerns raised about Bill C-27, 
particularly about the procedures of boarding and what happens 
after our enforcement officers board a vessel.  There are those 
who still think and are saying publicly that we must have 
approval of the flag state before we board a vessel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been briefed by officials from foreign affairs and DFO 
and I comfortable and accept that this is not the case.  Our 
enforcement officers can board those vessels if they see fit and 
when they desire.  If they find a violation then quite naturally 
out of courtesy they have to notify the flag state, the state 
from which the vessel hails. That is only common courtesy.  Then 
there is a three day period in which the flag state has to 
respond. 
The flag state can respond in a number of ways.  It can try to 
contact another patrol vessel in the area, a NAFO patrol vessel, 
send it to the ship and then the Canadian people will move off 
and the NAFO vessel will take over.  If the flag state does not 
respond in three days and that lack of response is concurrence 
with what has happened, then the Canadian authorities can take 
that vessel to port.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament and a person very concerned with this 
type of legislation because of all the implications for the 
people I represent, I feel the legislation is a move in the right 
direction.  It will enable us to better enforce the high seas. 
It will enable us to better detect violations on the high seas 
and it will enable us to deal with those situations which for 
years have gone on undetected in a lot of cases but which when 
detected nothing has happened to the violators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not mention the <I>Estai</I> affair 
which got so much attention in this country just a few years ago. 
We used force on the high sees and fired a shot across the bow 
of the <I>Estai</I> and brought the vessel to St. John's, 
Newfoundland.  We found juvenile turbot caught by a liner in a 
net of the <I>Estai</I>.  It was an international incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is ironic is that after all the kerfuffle and the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars spent in that arrest, using our military 
vessels and our coast guard vessels, putting the crew of the 
<I>Estai</I> up in the Hotel Newfoundland, an approximate cost of 
$100,000, the end result was that the <I>Estai</I> was given back 
to the Spanish, the fish were given back to the Spanish, 
including the juvenile turbot, and the half a million dollar 
court bond that was posted by the <I>Estai</I> was given back to 
the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cost $100,000 of taxpayer money to wine and dine the 
Spaniards in the Hotel Newfoundland and the costs that were 
incurred in the enforcement and the actual arrest of the vessel. 
We all remember Captain Canada.  That was the end result of the 
<I>Estai</I> affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation in my view will certainly improve on those kinds 
of situations.  By merely signing on to the agreement, the people 
and the countries involved in the agreement are going to concur 
and subject themselves to boarding and enforcement, even in NAFO 
regulatory areas where before they would come in and not be 
subjected to any kind of enforcement.  Because they are a part of 
the agreement, when they fish in NAFO areas they will now be 
subject to NAFO regulations, a very important step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back again to the situation we face in Newfoundland 
and Atlantic Canada today.  I plead with the Government of Canada 
to move quickly in responding to the needs of those thousands of 
Atlantic Canadians.  There is a big economic and social problem 
in Atlantic Canada and it has been caused by the downturn in our 
groundfish industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishery in Atlantic is by no ways dead.  The export value of 
the fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador last year was $550 
million, quite significant.  What has happened is that people 
have diversified into other species.  What we once called 
underutilized species are no longer underutilized.  There are no 
fish inside our 200 mile limit today that are underutilized. 
They are all very valuable, resources we have to value add to and 
create more employment and more value for our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with the Government of Canada to deal with the very 
serious crisis because it is a crisis, as I have said before, 
that has been caused by years and years of bad management 
decisions. Fish given to foreigners is totally a decision of the 
Government of Canada.  The number of vessels that fish any one 
particular stock of fish is decided by the Government of Canada. 
The size of the vessels is decided by the Government of Canada. 
The harvesting technology, whether it is a gill net, a cod trap 
or a stern trawler, is approved and concurred in by the 
Government of Canada.  The amount of fish that has been allowed 
to be harvested over all these years on an annual basis has been 
decided by the Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those decisions have been decisions of successive 
governments of Canada.  They have contributed to and caused this 
very serious problem.  This government has to accept its 
responsibility to Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fish stocks have not regenerated as quickly as we thought they 
would.  Some of the southern stocks are showing signs of 
improvement, but northern cod definitely is not.  It is the 
responsibility of the Government of Canada to look out for those 
people whose lives have been ruined.  It is going to take another 
five or ten years for this situation to improve and for fish 
stocks to regenerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People's lives have been ruined because successive governments 
have decimated their fish stocks.  Those governments were the 
custodian of the fish stocks.  It is the responsibility of the 
Government of Canada to look after these people until the stocks 
regenerate and they have a future working in the industry.  In 
most cases it is the only job these people ever had.  I plead 
with the government to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to commend previous members on their speeches in support of this 
particular piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the member for St. John's East that when this 
government came to power in 1993 the now premier of Newfoundland 
was fisheries minister.  He went to cabinet to find out what 
plans had been made to continue the support for the Conservative 
compensation plan and he found there was not a nickel.  There was 
absolutely no plan to do anything with the people who were coming 
off the Conservative compensation package. That government, during 
the time of the most massive cuts in the history of this country, 
found $1.9 billion to put toward the TAGS program in support of 
the liability which the federal government had to the people of 
Newfoundland and indeed Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is blame to go around.  There is a lot of blame to go 
around.  We can spread it as thick as we want to.  However, the 
fact is that TAGS is running out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In deference to my colleagues from Ontario, if the hon. member 
had been at Liberal caucus meetings—and perhaps some day he 
might be—he would have heard the report of the Ontario caucus. 
The number two concern in that report was for the government to 
address as quickly as possible the problems with TAGS in 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member owes the members of parliament from 
Ontario an apology for the accusations he made that they are 
doing everything they can not to help the fishermen from 
Newfoundland who are suffering because of the groundfish 
collapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is okay to pass the blame.  We will take the blame and past 
governments will take the blame.   John Crosbie stated in his 
book that when he was the minister of fisheries his problems 
occurred when he was dealing with the provincial premiers.  The 
provincial premiers put on the pressure.  The unions put on 
pressure to keep the quota as high as possible for the people in 
order to get qualified for work during the fishing season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I would ask the member for Burin—St. George's to 
address the comments he made to the members of parliament from 
Ontario who, indeed, support, in every way possible, the 
government moving on a new TAGS.  The old TAGS, as I am sure he 
will agree, was far from perfect.  The new TAGS must address the 
shortcomings of the old program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's comments and his questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just let me say that before TAGS there was NCARP which was 
brought in by John Crosbie, the same man who had the unenviable 
task of imposing a moratorium on northern cod stocks in Atlantic 
Canada.  It was a very difficult decision, but he did what he had 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>TAGS was not perfect.  One of the big problems that we 
experienced with TAGS was the underestimation by HRDC even after 
NCARP had expired.  There was a couple of years of NCARP and then 
TAGS was brought in.  However HRDC underestimated the number of 
people who would be eligible for TAGS income benefits by 50%.  It 
then took money out of the early retirement and licence buy out 
components to put into income support because that was what was 
needed to put bread and butter on the table for thousands of 
Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bungling and mistakes with TAGS goes back to the Department 
of Human Resources Development Canada.  It underestimated, after 
all of this crisis and those years of involvement with NCARP, the 
number of people who would be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some success stories with TAGS.  There are hundreds 
and hundreds of success stories of people who went on to other 
professions and to post-secondary institutions to become better 
educated, better trained, who found new jobs.  These are the 
stories that are not told often enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Ontario caucus, I am very pleased to hear 
that it is supporting a new program for Atlantic Canadians.  I 
welcome the support of those members and I thank them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier 
(Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you see how practical it is that my riding's name lists 
four RCMs; now, everyone in Canada will know the names of the 
RCMs around the Gaspé peninsula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too would like to congratulate the member for Burin—St. 
George's.  Clearly this is someone who really looks out for the 
people in his riding and who has a deep interest in the 
fisheries sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked with him on the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans and I must say that I was impressed with the way we 
worked together, with the fact that we came up with points on 
which nobody toed the party line. 
I am also impressed that a group of Conservative, New Democratic 
and Liberal parliamentarians from Newfoundland has come to get 
its views across to the various caucuses here in the House.  I 
know that my colleague has met with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 contains certain management measures.  Having worked 
with me on the standing committee, the member for Burin—St. 
George's knows that there are serious problems.  We agreed that 
the main one is the poor management by the federal government, 
irrespective of the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Egmont, on Prince Edward Island, referred just 
now to John Crosbie, who said that decisions were difficult 
because the provinces and unions put pressure on them to 
maintain the TAC, the total allowable catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I want to ask my colleague is as follows. Does he 
still mean to recommend, even to the people from his province, 
that the department's management methods and the methods for 
setting the TAC be reviewed and does he still mean to encourage 
the provinces to take part in this exercise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In in the standing committee's report, we urged the government 
to have this review done by an independent committee. If we want 
to restore confidence, that is where we should start.  Once 
again, Bill C-27 is a red herring, but if an independent 
committee were struck, at least we would be able to get down to 
some serious talk. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his compliments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member is referring to the FRCC, the Fisheries 
Resource Conservation Council, but I am not sure.  When he talks 
about management decisions and quotas, I think he must be 
referring to the FRCC which on an annual basis makes 
recommendations to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some concern raised in the standing committee, and by 
people who appeared before the standing committee, which held 15 
public meetings and heard from 5,000 to 6,000 people.  Concerns 
were raised about the independence of the FRCC.  People thought 
it was not far enough removed from the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They felt that it should be totally removed from the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans, that it should be more independent. 
There was a feeling that it was being influenced by people in the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if that is what the hon. member is referring to or 
not.  I had difficulty understanding the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the setting of quotas, with harvesting practices and 
management practices, we have to consult more and more with those 
involved in the fishing industry.  For too many years we went 
through the process of saying that we were consulting, but we 
really did not listen.  That is why we have this big mess today. 
We did not consult enough and listen to those directly involved 
in the industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to some of the 
comments, but also to put on the record my personal feelings and, 
I believe, the feelings of the vast majority of my constituents 
and the feelings of the Ontario caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Egmont pointed out, I do not know where the 
member for Burin—St. George's gets his information, but the 
Ontario caucus is solidly behind the efforts and the concerns in 
looking for an opportunity to provide assistance to the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador and, indeed, all of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that really defines the country of Canada.  I 
say that because we are a country that wants to share from sea to 
sea to sea all the benefits, windfalls and financial strengths. 
We want to share all the good things about Canada with one 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of what I often refer to as 
gate-equalization. In 1949 when Newfoundland joined Confederation 
there was a pact.  There was a reason for doing it.  The hon. 
Joey Smallwood spoke about the strength in unifying and joining 
Canada, becoming part of this great nation, and the benefits that 
would be attributed to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burin—St. George's made some excellent points. 
It is interesting that the member for Acadie—Bathurst as well as 
the previous speaker spoke in support of the bill, and yet the 
games continue to be played.  Why do we not get on with it?  The 
opposition members insist on calling quorum.  For what purpose? 
To delay the passage of the bill?  They know full well, and the 
people at home know, that members do not sit all day in this 
chamber.  They are in committee.  They are in meetings.  They are 
in their offices.  They are phoning their constituents. 
Furthermore, it is against the rules in this place for people to 
make reference to members being absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that members opposite have a strategy.  They are 
upset.  They like to win certain votes and they have not won, so 
they have developed a strategy to be disruptive.  Frankly, that 
is not going to solve this problem, as the member of the New 
Democratic Party and the member of the Conservative want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is support.  Strong support.  Many of us, myself included, 
are urging members of cabinet to come up with a solution.  I 
believe that the solution should not just be the son of TAGS. The 
solution has to be sustainable growth.  The solution has to be 
new opportunities for Atlantic Canada.  Why would a guy from 
central Ontario, Mississauga West, even care about this kind of 
issue?  I can tell members that I honestly believe my 
constituents care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in the Ontario legislature I had the opportunity to 
travel to Newfoundland on a couple of occasions.  One of the best 
experiences my wife and I have ever had was after our public 
accounts committee had finished its meetings in St. John's, we 
rented a car and we drove through the Avalon Peninsula.  We did 
the bed and breakfast routine and we got to know the people of 
the Avalon Peninsula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kitty Sullivan's Kitchen is a very famous stop down the coast of 
the Avalon.  We stayed overnight.  We talked with Kitty Sullivan 
about her past, about her husband's life as a fisherman. He had 
passed away and her two sons were carrying on the family 
tradition.  She has flaming red hair.  With tears in her green 
eyes she talked about growing up in that spectacular part of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what it was but it created an affinity.  Maybe it 
is my Irish roots.  They say on a clear day from Kitty Sullivan's 
Kitchen you can actually see Ireland.  I do not know, maybe you 
can.  It was not a clear day. As we all know, there are not a lot 
of clear days in that part of the world, but it is a wonderful 
part of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute human tragedy, what has happened in 
Newfoundland and Labrador with the fisheries.  Other members have 
said there is enough blame to go around.  Obviously there is.  We 
have to accept our share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the government and we have to come up with a plan.  I 
believe we will.  I believe that this government cares about what 
happens there, but as I said, just making it a son of TAGS is not 
the solution. There has to be a long term plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Newfoundland are demonstrating right now.  On tax day 
they have taken over the Revenue Canada building.  They know how 
to make a point in that part of the world. They are making a 
point.  It is a valid point and a real concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to know that this member from Ontario cares about 
what happens in Atlantic Canada.  As a national government we 
have a responsibility to make sure that we look out for Canadians 
right across this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went around the bottom of the peninsula and up to the top to 
beautiful communities, Heart's Desire, Heart's Delight, Heart's 
Content.  They are absolutely amazing places.  Canadians should 
go and see Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I was scheduled in the March break to go with the 
member for Labrador on a snowmobile trip in Labrador. 
Unfortunately he took ill.  He is back with us now, but he took 
very seriously ill and we had to postpone the trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason he asked me to join him was that I had spoken out on 
an issue that was very important to the people of Newfoundland 
and Labrador.  It was the lobby campaign headed up by the 
International Fund for Animal Welfare against the seal hunt which 
was trying to close down the seal hunt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the fact that in a community like mine in Mississauga 
there are a lot of transplants from Newfoundland and Labrador, I 
spoke up because of what I saw as misleading information, a lobby 
campaign funded by American money, a lobby campaign designed to 
mislead the Canadian public. I received probably 400 phone calls 
all of them computer generated into my voice mail.  That kind of 
trickery, that kind of deceit, no matter what part of Canada we 
are from, no matter what party we represent, is not something we 
should be willing to tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke out.  I wrote a letter to the editor saying that I was 
astounded.  I did it in anger because I was fed up with the 
misinformation.  We talk about the damage to the cod, the damage 
to the fisheries.  Premier Tobin was quoted today.  He said in a 
speech last night at a fundraiser “You know, the seals don't eat 
at McDonald's or Burger King; they eat fish.  They eat a lot of 
fish”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a seal hunt with five million seals in the herd.  There 
can be no doubt when we have a quota set at 283,000 seals to be 
harvested out of a herd of five million, seals have to be part of 
the problem. It does not take a rocket scientist to understand. 
I wrote a letter to the editor which was published in a couple of 
newspapers. I will read part of it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take strong exception to any group that spreads lies and 
misinformation to the Canadian people to further its own, 
somewhat myopic view of the world.  The seal hunt is highly 
regulated and anyone who breaks the law, and I admit there will 
naturally be some who do, will be charged and dealt with under 
the full extent of the law. Other law-abiding citizens, who rely 
on these animals for food, survival and jobs, should be allowed 
to work at their trade without harassment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my constituents would agree with that sentiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members mentioned in the House that nothing came of 
the <I>Estai</I> affair.  I want to correct the record on a few 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the speakers yesterday made remarks, which I will get to 
in a moment.  Frankly he should know better because the area he 
represents is Saanich—Gulf Islands.  He represents the other end 
of the country from Newfoundland but definitely represents an 
area where there is concern about overfishing and everything that 
goes with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burin—St. George's said that nothing came of the 
<I>Estai</I> affair.  He ridiculed Premier Tobin, called “Captain 
Canada” by people around the world for his crusade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in the middle of reading the Michael Harris book <I>Lament 
for an Ocean</I>.  It is an interesting book.  It details at some 
length the events which took place when Brian Tobin, then the 
minister of fisheries for the national government, stood up to 
the overfishing trawlers from Spain.  It details the courage. 
The book details what went on in cabinet in getting the support 
which allowed Mr. Tobin to actually use force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the member for Burin—St. George's is an 
opposition politician.  I understand he is not of the same party 
provincially or nationally as Mr. Tobin, but let us give some 
credit where it is due.  He claims nothing came as a result of 
that effort. The fact is we became an internationally respected 
nation willing to stand up for the protection of the fishery, 
willing to stand up to foreign ships taking baby fish in very 
tiny nets and adding to the destruction of the fish stock.  We 
did stand up and we should be proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that a member in this place from 
Newfoundland would actually stand up and denigrate those efforts. 
Did they solve all the problems?  Obviously not.  This bill will 
not solve all the problems either but it will go a long way 
toward putting in place the enforcement mechanism the Canadian 
Coast Guard needs to be able to board trawlers where it is 
suspected there have been violations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to correct the record from a debate yesterday by the 
member for Saanich—Gulf Islands.  I will quote what he said from 
the <I>Evening Telegram</I>:  “During debate in the House of 
Commons Wednesday, Saanich—Gulf Islands MP”—I will not name 
him since I cannot—said Bill C-27 that implements the provisions 
on straddling stocks is actually more restrictive than current 
measures in Canadian and international law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An official with the department has corrected him in this 
article. I want to do so on the record in this place. 
The official said:  “There is nothing in the bill that limits 
our right to board vessels.  The powers that are in it are the 
same powers that are in the agreement.  We are only giving 
ourselves the powers the UN agreement says we can do”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 is the legislation Canada needs to implement the 
United Nations agreement on straddling and highly migratory fish 
stocks.  Some members mentioned that this agreement could apply 
to salmon.  That was another issue put forward yesterday.  I do 
not have a problem with opposition members disagreeing with the 
government.  All I hear is opposition members saying that they 
support this bill but then they put forward statements that are 
simply not correct, and they need to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said that this could apply to salmon.  The intent of 
this agreement was to strengthen sections of the UN Convention on 
the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, that apply to straddling stocks and 
highly migratory stocks.  As an anadromous species, salmon is not 
covered by these definitions.  These people know that, so why 
would they put out information that they know is false?  I guess 
they are just desperately looking for something negative to say 
about the government even though they support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada cannot unilaterally change internationally negotiated 
agreements and add stocks that were not covered by the agreement. 
As Bill C-27 is an implementation bill, it can only reflect what 
is in the UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members, including the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands, 
have also raised concerns about the procedural requirements in 
Bill C-27 for boarding vessels.  I will set the facts straight. 
The member should know better than to make those comments in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-27 Canadian enforcement officers can board and 
inspect vessels of states party to the UNFA agreement without 
first obtaining consent of any foreign state. If a violation to 
the fishing measures is found, the enforcement officers must 
notify the flag state.  As some members have said, the flag state 
then has three days to respond to such a notice. During that time 
period, the enforcement officers remain onboard the ship.  They 
may search and seize, secure, conduct an investigation to obtain 
any evidence they may need to prove the accusation of a 
violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the flag state has been notified and given 72 hours, there 
are three possible scenarios.  The member opposite knows it and 
should have said it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the flag state may respond by consenting to Canada taking 
additional enforcement action against the vessel.  This could 
include, as occurred in the case of the <I>Estai</I>, bringing the 
vessel to port to continue the investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if the flag state responds with appropriate measures to 
investigate and take enforcement action, then the enforcement 
officer would turn over that vessel to the flag state for further 
action.  If they agree with the allegations or charges, then it 
only makes sense.  The member for Burin—St. George's complained 
about the cost of putting up the Spanish sailors in Hotel 
Newfoundland.  The second option means that we would not have to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, if the flag state does not respond within the three day 
period, the enforcement officers could take the vessel to port 
and continue their investigations.  We have seen that happen. 
Canada has the hard-nosed attitude to deal with this. 
This bill now gives us the teeth to deal with problems on the 
high seas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All these procedures apply only to vessels from states that are 
party to the UNFA and are listed under the CFPA regulations.  I 
want that on the record. For vessels from states that are not 
party to this agreement, the current provisions of the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act will continue to be applied.  It is very 
important to remind this House that Bill C-27 must be read with 
this together.  It does not stand on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, this bill is not 
replacing what we already have.  It is an additional tool that 
Canada can use to stop foreign overfishing of straddling and 
highly migratory stocks on the high seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I appreciate that there is tremendous passion in their 
concern for constituents in Newfoundland and Labrador, I would 
hope opposition members would stop playing games, support this 
bill and let us get on with the solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to address the House on behalf of the 
member for Vancouver Island North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the train leaves the station and you are not on it, it is 
particularly difficult to be the tour guide.  The train I am 
talking about carries Canada's interest in fishing on the high 
seas.  It seems that, with the exception of the half hearted 
introduction of Bill C-27, nobody from Canada is on that train, 
nor do they have any interest in trying to catch it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixteen years have now gone by and this government has still not 
ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
Canada was very much in favour of this convention from its 
inception in 1973 until 1982 when it was adopted at the UN.  The 
law of the sea was negotiated with leadership from both Canada 
and the United States but to date neither country has ratified 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in this House when the member for Davenport, a 
member on the Liberal side, a former environment minister in the 
Trudeau government, asked this government to ratify the law of 
the sea, and yet it has still not been done.  This is one of the 
government's own members, a longstanding member in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Canada dragging its feet?  Perhaps it says something 
about this government and past Liberal and Conservative 
governments that a convention so heavily favoured still has not 
been ratified by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it takes 16 years to ratify something with which the 
government agrees, it is not hard to imagine how difficult it is 
to move the agenda with this government on issues that are not so 
straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law of the sea is an umbrella agreement that deals with many 
topics other than fisheries.  It deals with the preservation of 
marine living resources, offshore oil and gas, shipping, maritime 
boundaries and the resolution of marine disputes, among other 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It required the ratification of 60 nations before it could come 
into effect.  This threshold was reached in November 1994 and 
now, in 1998, over 100 nations have signed on.  Sadly, Canada is 
not one of those members.  The United States still has not 
ratified the law of the sea because it has issues with deep sea 
mining provisions.  What is Canada's excuse? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject of the legislation before us today, Bill C-27, which 
enables the government to ratify UNFA, includes the subject of 
straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.  These 
fish stocks were not considered in detail during the law of the 
sea discussions but because the law of the sea is an umbrella 
agreement, it allows for subsidiary agreements like UNFA to 
expand on topics such as straddling and highly migratory fish 
stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Canada now finds itself in the unpleasant 
situation of looking at the straddling and highly migratory fish 
stocks agreement, UNFA, which we signed in 1994, and the law of 
the sea agreement, which we signed in 1982, knowing we have not 
ratified either one even though we agreed to them when they were 
introduced.  We still agree with them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the government been so slow to move on both the law of 
the sea and the UNFA?  One reason might be that Canada has a case 
pending in the International Court of Justice in The Hague.  This 
case arose from the action when Canada unilaterally seized the 
Spanish trawler <I>Estai</I> back in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada might be concerned that we could be liable for the action 
taken under former Bill C-29 amendments to the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act passed in May 1994 and which allegedly allowed 
Canada to take this unilateral international action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this argument does not make sense with respect to the 
law of the sea.  It does not make sense because in 1982, when 
there was no <I>Estai</I> incident, Canada took no actions to 
ratify the law of the sea. Some experts even say that 
ratification of the UNFA will not make any difference to the 
<I>Estai</I> international court case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us just take the worst case scenario.  If Canada 
were to lose in the international court there might be some small 
embarrassment to the minister of the day but certainly it would 
not put Canada in any great jeopardy.  In fact, the <I>Estai</I> 
is still out there fishing today.  The <I>Estai</I> is Spanish and 
Spain ratified the law of the sea in January 1997 and is a 
signatory to the UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue may be that Bill C-27 might get blown out of the 
water.  How might this happen?  It flows from the ratification of 
UNFA that signatory states are then subject to all the 
enforcement provisions.  Spain and Canada are both signatory 
nations.  The real concern may therefore be that a loss at the 
international court could jeopardize Bill C-27 amendments to the 
Coast Fisheries Protection Act which allowed Canada to take 
unilateral action outside the 200 mile limit on behalf of 
straddling stocks.  If our actions are held to have been illegal 
then Bill C-27 would also be illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the real concern then why is this government playing 
games by pretending all is well and entering into the second 
reading of this bill if it has no intention of carrying it 
forward until proceedings at The Hague are adjudicated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that when the <I>Estai</I> case comes up again in the 
international court in June of this year, Canada will merely be 
arguing that the ICJ has no jurisdiction to try the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from the briefing we received from DFO on the bill we 
are debating today that it is the federal position that once UNFA 
is ratified the enforcement provisions of the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act will continue to apply to those vessels that 
belong to non-signatory nations or flags of convenience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we know for sure is that during the <I>Estai</I> 
incident, Canada did demonstrate an interest in pursuing Canada's 
interests aggressively in the international arena.  Other than 
that singular time, Canada's international posture on fisheries 
issues is extremely weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All evidence demonstrates that we consistently drop the ball 
into the international arena.  In fact, we wonder why Bill C-27 
has been drafted so that a new section of the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act, section 7.01, states that Canada has to get the 
consent of a signatory state before it can take enforcement 
action against one of these vessels.  Imagine, we have to get 
consent before we go after it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to support the intent of Bill C-27.  However, I do 
not agree with the clause in section 7.01 which reads “with the 
consent of the participating state”.  If there are obligations 
imposed on the states ratifying UNFA to comply with agreed 
conservation measures then why should a coastal state need the 
permission of another signatory to enforce those conservation 
measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is Canada pursuing the best interests of Canadians in the 
international arena when it comes to Canadian issues? The 
evidence clearly demonstrates this government continues to drop 
the ball on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there is a growing number of fishermen on the west 
coast who have determined that there is a better future in 
fishing outside the 200 mile limit than fishing inside.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They have realized that there is a large biomass to be 
harvested. They have the opportunity, the expertise and the 
boats.  They have invested in high seas fisheries.  They have 
joined vessel owner associations along with boat owners from 
other nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an international fishery in the mid Pacific.  Many 
countries that fish there have a vital interest in highly 
migratory stocks.  Highly migratory stocks are one of those two 
fish stocks along with straddling stocks which are the subject of 
UNFA legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are approximately 100 west coast Canadian fishing vessel 
owners represented by the Western Fishboat Owners Association, 
some of whom are Canada's distant water ocean going fishing 
fleet owners.  These boat owners fish primarily for albacore tuna but 
are also licensed for yellowfin, bluefin and skipjack tuna as 
well as other species.  Some of the members' vessels operate in 
the north Pacific all the way to the Japanese 200 mile limit, the 
whole north Pacific.  Some operate in both the north and the 
south Pacific albacore tuna fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the Canadian vessel owners who have approximately 
20% of the ownership, the majority of membership in the WFOA is 
American.  The Canadian government is not actively representing 
Canadian interests in this international fishery.  However, the 
United States government is an active participant in what will be 
the third set of talks coming up in June about the management 
issues of this high seas fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous talks have been held in the Solomon Islands and the 
Marshall Islands.  The U.S. state department is there as is the 
Western Fishboat Owners Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the Canadian government in all this?  Is our government 
representing Canadian interests in the Pacific Ocean?  Apparently 
not.  Canadian boat owners have been asking where are we, where 
is our government. The legal counsel for the WFOA is puzzled by 
our lack of interest.  The U.S. state department is certainly 
pursuing American interests, yet the Canadian department of 
fisheries is absent.  Canada needs to get its act together and 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister, if we are going to have representatives from 
DFO and foreign affairs at the next meeting in Tokyo in June, to 
make sure Canada's public interest and fishermen's rights are not 
forgotten in the discussion during the creation of new rules to 
govern the Pacific international fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fishing interests deserve better representation.  Our nation 
deserves better representation and our fishermen deserve better 
representation.  One of the issues which we vigorously championed 
in the development of the law of the sea and UNFA was the 
management of highly migratory stocks.  This issue is being 
debated in the Pacific and we are not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are out fishing on the high seas for tuna and other 
large migratory fish.  A portion of these Canadian licensed boats 
can fish tuna in U.S. waters between the 12 and 200 mile limit in 
the U.S. as well as international waters but they cannot fish 
within Canada's 200 mile limit because of restrictions on their 
Canadian licence.  That is a paradox.  They can fish in U.S. 
waters but not in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American boats have no such restrictions in Canada or the U.S. 
because of the bilateral tuna treaty and because the U.S. does 
not prevent American boats from fishing within American waters. 
We have the bureaucratically driven nonsensical situation where 
some Canadian tuna boats with DFO licensing are the only boats 
excluded from fishing in Canadian waters.  Only in Canada, you 
say.  Of course this policy continues to be under review by DFO 
but it does not make any sense.  Can we hope for a quick 
resolution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason and others it is estimated that 80% of Canadian 
fish landings from the tuna fleet are in U.S. ports. 
Unfortunately when Canadian boats do this there is an under 
reporting of Canadian fish landings.  According to the statistics 
I have seen it looks like Canada does not catch many fish in the 
north Pacific and none at all in the south Pacific.  This is 
simply not the case.  The problem is with the reporting system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO does not keep track of what Canadians catch on the high 
seas. That is a fact.  It will quote statistic but they are 
totally meaningless because they are not accurate.  If a Canadian 
boat lands its catch in the U.S. there is no mechanism for 
counting it as Canadian. 
We are totally reliant on others for the statistics.  The 
majority of Canadian vessel catches are currently recorded as 
U.S. landings by their national marine service and this bolsters 
the U.S. catch at the cost of the Canadian catch.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When it looks like Canadian fishermen are not fishing in the 
Pacific and when the Canadian government does not represent its 
people at international meetings, then the result will very 
likely be that Canada will get left out entirely in allocation 
and conservation decisions.  The government should be looking at 
what the U.S. is doing on the issue because according to our own 
fishermen, they are doing a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is displaying absolute blindness on this 
issue.  The Pacific resource for tuna and other species is being 
increasingly exploited.  So far there are no conservation 
concerns and with some species we are only scratching the surface 
in terms of sustainable harvest.  There is a lot out there. There 
is immense potential and Canada must be a player. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What invariably occurs in these circumstances, and we have only 
to look at the bluefin tuna in the Atlantic as an example, is 
that as conservation concerns develop, countries negotiate 
allocations based on historical catches.  This is the key, 
historical catches.  We are rapidly going to arrive at this 
situation in the Pacific and Canada is simply ill prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without historical data that Canadians have been catching fish 
on the high seas, and we do not have that, we will not obtain our 
allocations.  Without the allocations we also become non-players 
in terms of management and conservation issues.  Here we are a 
major player and we are going to be the Switzerland of fishing 
because of our DFO and because we have not managed this issue 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things that Canada must do immediately to address 
this issue.  Canada needs to invoke a protocol to establish data 
collection.  Canada must immediately commit to be an active 
participant in the high level Pacific migratory fish discussions 
at the next meeting in Tokyo in June.  We cannot stand on the 
station any longer; we have to be on the train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out some gaps in the UN fish agreement, 
noting that Bill C-27 is merely the enabling legislation that 
will allow Canada to ratify UNFA whenever it so chooses.  UNFA 
cannot be used with respect to fish other than highly migratory 
and straddling stocks.  It cannot be used to help with the 
Pacific salmon treaty.  This is not a reason not to ratify, but 
it certainly is a limitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though salmon do not fall into categories of fish 
contemplated by UNFA, Canada's international position with 
respect to international fisheries issues will be enhanced once 
we ratify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another gap in UNFA relates to quotas and to allocations. 
Although UNFA is a multilateral agreement, ratifying it will not 
avoid the necessity of entering into separate treaties or 
subsidiary agreements with foreign nations.  The terms of 
reference in UNFA are very broad and do not address quotas and 
catches.  We know from our experience with the Pacific salmon 
treaty that these specifics have to be addressed in separate 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What plan does the minister have to act decisively?  This 
government has been unable to get the United States to agree on 
smaller catches of salmon on the west coast.  The minister states 
that conservation is his first priority, yet some species of 
salmon are simply disappearing.  What assurances do we have that 
this government will be any more effective when discussing other 
species of fish on a multilateral basis with more nations than 
just the U.S.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people may be surprised to learn that Canada is not in the 
top 10 list of fishing nations.  On the international scene there 
are powerful interests at work and if we snooze, we lose. We have 
a rightful place in the world fishery.  We also have obligations 
with respect to conservation and it will not help us if we do not 
sign on to these international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if we do not have a presence, we will not have a 
voice.  By its inaction the Canadian government is contributing 
to Canada's weak position.  Now is the time for commitment.  Now 
is the time for action.  Hopefully the government will take heed 
and do the right thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past speaker reminded us that we are talking about two 
oceans when we pass fisheries legislation, and also the fish 
committee that is in the north, and there are three oceans that 
this bill impinges upon and that is why it is so necessary to 
have it.  He raised the matter of the <I>Estai</I>. The member for 
Burin—St. George's was saying why it cost us $100,000 to 
prosecute in that particular event and why we had to return to 
Spain the various bonds that were required. That is why we have 
this bill today.  We knew that in an international court we would 
have lost those cases because the legislation that we have before 
us today was not in force.  We are here today to take care of 
that and to make sure that a predator or a pirate ship will be 
prosecuted if it is caught ravaging our stocks on the nose and 
tail of the Grand Banks or the Flemish Cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as we debate this bill today, massive fishing power is 
being deployed on the high seas.  Large vessels armed with the 
latest technology are zeroing in on the world's dwindling fish 
stocks on the high seas.  There are flags of convenience vessels 
that can and do plunder the oceans of the world.  They are 
getting away with it because they operate in the global commons, 
that is, they fish the high seas that belong to no one and lie 
outside the authority of any single state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us today amends the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act and the Canada Shipping Act.  When they are 
amended, Canada will be in a legal position to implement the UN 
fisheries agreement.  That agreement will provide a needed step 
to deal with the world's fish pirates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Brundtland commission, or more properly, the World 
Commission on Environment and Development, made the following 
comment about the global commons. I quote directly from the 
commission's report written more than 10 years ago, in 1986: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without agreed, equitable and enforceable rules governing the 
rights and duties of states in respect of the global commons, the 
pressure of demands on finite resources will [eventually] destroy 
their ecological integrity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, unless we move to stop the plundering, we face 
destruction of many fish stocks around the world.  Time is 
running out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was only one of many similar warnings.  The United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization reported that disastrous social 
and economic consequences await the worldwide fishing industry 
unless fleets are reduced in size, subsidies are eliminated, and 
fishing activity on the high seas is regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before the House today represents those agreed 
to equitable and enforceable rules that are needed for the 
conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks in the global commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we pass this legislation and prepare the necessary 
regulations, Canada will be in a position to join that handful of 
nations that have ratified the United Nations fisheries 
agreement, UNFA.  A total of more than 59 have signed the 
agreement and 17, including the United States and Russia, have 
ratified it so far. We will build the momentum needed to get the 
30 ratifications required for entry into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada ratifies the UN fisheries agreement, Canada will 
underline its commitment to settling fisheries disputes with 
other nations through negotiation and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 Canada was the first nation to sign the UN Food and 
Agriculture Compliance Agreement for vessels fishing in the high 
seas.  The agreement committed us to exercising licensing control 
over any Canadian vessel fishing the high seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was the prime mover and is among the strongest supporters 
of the UN fisheries agreement.  That is one reason why we should 
support this bill, so that we can add Canada's name to the list 
of those who have agreed to work toward a sustainable harvest of 
protein from the high seas.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN fisheries agreement rests on three pillars.  First, the 
agreement sets out the principles on which conservation and 
management must be based for straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks.  One of these principles is the 
precautionary approach.  That means when it comes to setting 
catch limits, net and mesh sizes and so forth we agree with the 
UN fisheries agreement to err not on the side of high hopes or 
greed but on the side of caution.  Conservation measures on the 
high seas must be similar to the measures enforced within 
national waters.  That means we cannot have incompatible regimes 
for straddling or migratory fish inside the 200 mile limit of 
coastal states and outside the 200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in setting up the conservation regime, we agree to use the 
best available scientific information.  That is an important 
point.  Under this principle, states will not wait for so-called 
better information to come along before they limit their catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not be swayed by those who argue that we do not have 
enough information to set limits accurately.  We will not listen 
to those who say “let us study the problem some more and then 
decide”. That is an old dodge.  It has been used from time 
immemorial to delay action and maintain the status quo. If we 
maintain the status quo we will not have to worry about setting 
limits because there will not be any fish left to conserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should think I am suggesting that we should stop or cut 
out our research programs.  We should increase them.  Indeed the 
UN fisheries agreement calls for the parties to commit themselves 
to continued and increased research. That applies especially to 
the collection of high quality data, for it is on the basis of 
this information that we set fishing limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second pillar of the UN fisheries agreement is credible 
enforcement.  Unenforced conservation and management measures are 
not worth the paper they are written on. We will enforce our 
conservation and management decisions co-operatively along with 
other parties to the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary responsibility for enforcement will continue to be 
with the flag state, the nation that, like Canada, licenses and 
regulates fishing activities.  But the agreement enables states 
concerned about conservation on the high seas to take effective 
enforcement measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement sets out a framework for action against vessels 
that break the rules by states other than the flag state, but 
there are clear safeguards against the abuse of these powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has no wish to deprive those who fish on the high seas of 
their right to do so.  I am referring to vessels from those 
countries known as distant water fishing states. We do not want 
to end their legitimate use of the high seas, but we do insist on 
an end to the abuse of the high seas by them or anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional and subregional fisheries management organizations will 
play the major role in conserving and managing straddling fish 
stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.   In fact it is groups 
such as these, and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, 
NAFO, is one example, that establish the specific measures we 
must take to conserve and manage fish stocks.  NAFO sets measures 
for the conservation and management of stocks that straddle our 
200 mile limit.  ICCAT, the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, sets them for highly migratory 
stocks, specifically swordfish and tuna, that move through the 
high seas and through the exclusive economic zones of many 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third pillar of the agreement is a commitment to settle 
disputes peacefully.  The UN fisheries agreement provides for a 
number of methods to settle fisheries disputes.  Some of these 
are non-binding, but if these methods fail to resolve the 
dispute, there is provision for compulsory and binding 
procedures.  My colleagues will have more to say about these 
particular provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the little time left to me I would like to return to the 
enforcement issue.  What will happen under this legislation in 
those cases where fisheries inspectors know that a serious 
violation has taken place in the international waters within our 
200 mile zone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, what is a serious violation?  Some are listed in 
the legislation and some are brought in through regulations which 
incorporate by reference the relevant provisions of regional or 
subregional fisheries management organizations. The agreement 
specifies fishing in a closed area or during a closed season, 
exceeding a quota, fishing without a licence, using prohibited 
gear, or fishing for a stock under moratorium.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a vessel may commit minor violations that cumulatively 
can be regarded as a serious disregard for conservation and 
management measures.  Here is what the agreement allows. 
Canadian officers may board and inspect fishing vessels of any 
other state to verify compliance with conservation and management 
measures; that is, any other state whether it is or is not a 
party to the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where there are clear grounds to believe a violation has been 
committed, the protection officer will notify the flag state 
which is then expected to take appropriate action against the 
vessel.  If it does not respond or if it does not begin to fulfil 
its obligations to fully investigate and does not take 
appropriate action within three days, our officers can search and 
seize evidence and bring the vessel to port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, the legislation goes beyond this.  We can take action 
when any fishing vessel from a state that is party to the UN 
fisheries agreement contravenes conservation measures adopted by 
a local fisheries management organization and we can do that 
whether or not the state in question is also a member of the 
organization.  This is a breakthrough in the development of the 
International Law of the Sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the United Nations fisheries agreement our protection 
officers may take charge of a vessel until the flag state fulfils 
its obligation to investigate fully and promptly and then take 
follow up action.  As it stands now, under NAFO for example, if 
the flag state cannot be contacted our inspectors must leave the 
vessel even if they discover a serious violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations fisheries agreement procedure is another 
significant breakthrough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enforcement is vital if we are to properly conserve and manage 
straddling stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.  However, we 
cannot rely exclusively on these provisions.  The real goal of 
the agreement is to create an atmosphere of mutual trust coupled 
with effective enforcement to ensure the sustainable exploitation 
of these many important living resources of the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by quoting Ambassador Satya Nandan of 
Fiji.  It was Ambassador Nandan who chaired the conference that 
produced the UN agreement.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, this agreement provides for the conservation and 
sustainable use of the fish resources of the oceans.  In place of 
conflict, it provides a framework for co-operation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something that Canada has always sought.  I urge all 
hon. members to pass this bill and thus permit Canada to ratify 
this important agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier 
(Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take this opportunity to give my regards to the hon. 
member for Egmont, who was the chair of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans in the last parliament. I understand the 
hon. member is familiar with the issue, but I would like to see 
if he will be more progressive than his party, he who had such 
progressive ideas regarding Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to ask him a question. The Bloc 
Quebecois has indicated its intention to support the principle 
of Bill C-27, adding however that we have much to do this spring, 
and this week in particular, besides debating Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the rationale for this bill, the government claims it 
will enable it to implement the agreement, which is not true 
since it can do so without our consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it takes the time to ask for our consent, then we should be 
able to take the time to go into the details. I say details 
because the UNFA is not wishful thinking nor a collection of 
generalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the hon. member plans to put pressure on 
his minister to ensure, in return for the favour we are doing 
him this week by discussing Bill C-27, that the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy is renewed as soon as possible and that work 
on the crab management plan for zone 12 is progressing so that 
it can be tabled by the end of the week. 
Finally, I would like the hon. member to tell me if his 
government has started giving some thought to what type of 
fisheries and vision of the future it will put forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he at least plan to put pressure on his minister to hold 
consultations in this respect? The hon. member opposite, who is 
a good man, listed and described the various penalties but I am 
still waiting for him to talk about policy thrusts. For example, 
what fishing gear and vessel should be favoured in view of the 
size of the fish that will be allowed to be caught in the 
future, since there is a decline in fish stocks, as we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the hon. member for Egmont on this point. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question.  I know he stayed in Ottawa to debate 
this bill.  His committee is travelling in the Northwest 
Territories at the present time and I am sure his presence will 
be missed.  I am sure I would miss him if I was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has a number of questions and I think some of them have 
already been answered this morning.  One of his questions 
concerns TAGS, about which considerable pressure is coming to 
bear on the government.  We know that the old TAGS was far from 
perfect.  There were a lot of holes in it.  We intended to help a 
lot of people with that $1.9 billion, but many are still in need 
of assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is because part-way through the process we took money 
allocated for the buy back program and for training and put it 
into personal support because of the underestimation of the 
number of people that would be included in TAGS.  The program was 
running out of money very rapidly, so money was taken out of two 
vital sectors and used for income support when it probably should 
have been used to take fishermen out of the program altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new program must be designed to take people out of the 
fishery, but also to ensure that there are enough fishermen left 
to have a sustainable groundfish fishery off the Atlantic coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also mentioned zone 12 crab.  I think he is aware 
that probably this week the zone 12 management plan for crab will 
be announced by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way a fishery can be continued in Canada, whether it is 
on the Pacific, on the north or on the Atlantic coast, and the 
only way for small fishing villages to survive is to have a 
sustainable fishing industry.  If we continue to overfish, as we 
have done in the past, we will continue to have the same attitude 
and pressures that were prevalent when some of our fish plant 
workers did not get enough work and pressure was put on for them 
to continue to work so they could collect EI.  That created a 
reliance on the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of thinking has to change.  We have to think of the 
resource first.  If there are not enough fish, there are not 
enough fish.  It takes a while.  I know we are dealing with 
families.  We are dealing with the ability of individuals to put 
food on their table, but at the same time if we continue in this 
way there will come a time when no one will have any weeks in the 
fish plants in Atlantic Canada.  We have to look at managing the 
resource in a sustainable way so that it will be there not only 
for the present but for the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
quite ironic that we have a situation where too many people are 
chasing too few fish and relying on this resource to support 
themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not new.  We experienced the same thing a few years ago 
in the forestry industry.  The same thing has happened in other 
natural resource industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the message which we have to give clearly and 
unequivocally is that we have to work on the renewal of the 
resource.  We have to diversify our economy so that we do not 
rely on one source of revenue coming from one natural resource. 
We have to have a renewal mechanism which will help it to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the government on its initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, whether we like it or not, were it not for the actions 
of this government I would be surprised if we had an 
international agreement that deals with fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleague to enlighten us a little on the 
program established by the provincial governments of Atlantic 
Canada to diversify their economies so they can deal with some of 
the difficult situations which the people of Atlantic Canada are 
facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Ottawa Centre for his question and for his concern on this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is vital for any part of Canada not to lose its 
greatest natural resource, that is, the people who live in those 
areas, including those on the coast of British Columbia who have 
been displaced because of the decisions taken regarding salmon 
stocks.  They no longer were able to earn a living for themselves. 
Therefore, they had to sell their licences and move on to 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most devastating part of the mismanagement of any resource 
is the displacement and uprooting of people, whether it is on the 
west coast, in the forestry industry or in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should keep in mind above all else is that in order to 
retain the health of our coastal communities the resource has to 
be in a healthy state to provide a living and work for people so 
they can stay there, bring up their families and educate their 
children so they can contribute to the area when they mature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The diversification issue is something that Atlantic Canada has 
been grappling with since Confederation.  At Confederation the 
Atlantic provinces had one of the healthiest, most vibrant 
economies in the new nation.  The economy was very diversified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through various actions taken by the national government, 
especially on tariffs, the free trade that we had with a lot of 
countries in the Caribbean, in the New England states and in 
Great Britain was diverted into high tariff policies which made 
our industries very unsustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to build up the country, Atlantic Canada had to get 
into something new and diversify because it was competing on the 
north-south axis in a very inequitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only now, since the free trade agreements, that we are in 
a position to restart our economic engines in Atlantic Canada and 
to renew our connections with the Caribbean, which we had for 
centuries, with the eastern United States, which have 
approximately 175 million people, and with western Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that and with time I think the hopes are great for 
Atlantic Canada and the future is very bright.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, for getting me involved 
in the debate on Bill C-27, which is aimed at implementing the 
United Nations Fisheries Agreement and thus ensuring that Canada 
can ratify this convention by bringing its internal legislation 
in line with the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, moreover, like to start by mentioning the worthwhile 
contribution of one of my friends in negotiating that 
convention.  Paul Fauteux, who has been at the Department of 
External Affairs for some years, was one of the key negotiators 
for Canada when the convention was being negotiated under the 
auspices of the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments will focus on two matters that need to be raised 
during the debate at second reading of this bill and could also 
be the subject of more thorough debate when it is examined in 
committee. I will also address the international aspects of the 
bill and the convention it implements.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question I wish to raise today in the House is the 
connection between this bill and the prior bill, C-29, passed in 
1995, which also amended the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, 
authorized Canada to extend its jurisdiction beyond the 200-mile 
fishing zone, and allowed it to board ships in order to ensure 
compliance where straddling stocks were concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that, at that time, the debate addressed 
whether or not these new legislative powers were legal according 
to international law. 
The Government of Canada, and the Bloc Quebecois was in 
agreement, considered such measures licit.  Consequently, the 
bill gave the government jurisdiction, power that had not 
previously been accorded in international treaties, which the 
United Nations fishing agreement has just rectified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, debate continues, because a case is pending before the 
International Court of Justice, that of the <I>Estai</I>, which raises 
the question of the compliance of the 1995 legislation with 
international law in both extraterritorial and penal terms, 
since this legislation provided for the boarding of vessels, 
something that will be permitted in future under the treaty 
adopted by the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question remains, however.  What is Canada's attitude to 
countries that are or are not signatories to the UN fisheries 
agreement?  Will Canada keep its legislation? 
Will it want to apply legislation to countries that have not 
sighed the UN fisheries agreement or will it simply ensure that 
the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, as amended by Bill C-26, 
remains the only law to apply in the matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question is all the more important because it could 
influence the International Court of Justice's understanding of 
the matter before it and in the light of the arguments adduced, 
if it considers it has jurisdiction in the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question needs to be asked and answered.  Will Canada, 
which, in 1995, made the bill conditional on its acceptance of 
the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, want to 
go another route and remove this condition so that the 
International Court of Justice could have jurisdiction on these 
matters, which had been outside its jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, these questions warrant reflection and have not, 
up to now, been thoroughly debated, but should be, and, I hope, 
will be in committee. 
This also raises the general issue of the value, under 
international law, of unilateral legal documents drafted by 
states. In the past, Canada has at times insisted on drafting 
such documents, including for the Arctic, on the grounds that 
while certain unilateral documents may not necessarily comply 
with international law, they should be drafted to promote 
changes to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is unquestionably a degree of success here, and we will 
not criticize a party for drafting unilateral documents that do 
not necessarily comply with international law, when this is done 
to ensure that the law will adjust to facts that are real and 
material.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue of an international nature which I want to 
raise in this debate has to do with the powers that the governor 
in council would have to adopt delegated legislation and adapt 
regulations to implement the provisions of other international 
fisheries agreements or treaties to which Canada is a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring in particular to clause 3(2) of the bill, which 
amends sections 6(<I>e</I>) and 6(<I>f</I>) of the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act. It seems that this clause will give the governor 
in council what is probably an excessive power under common law, 
to the extent that he can exercise this power without any 
involvement of the House of Commons, Parliament or parliamentary 
committees regarding the implementation of international 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should certainly take a close look at this provision, to 
ensure that the implementation of international treaties is not 
even further removed from the control of democratic and 
parliamentary institutions which, in our opinion, already do not 
have the powers they should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge that this provision, and the issue of the role 
of the House of Commons and of Parliament generally in 
implementing, and even signing, treaties be examined as part of 
the debate on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other issues can certainly be addressed in committee.  I would 
like to assist my colleague, the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, and will be at the 
committee's disposal to look at ways of improving this 
implementing legislation so that the UN fisheries agreement is 
incorporated into domestic law in accordance with the 
international obligations that will arise from Canada's 
ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada played an important role in negotiating this convention. 
It is regrettable that only now, in April 1998, is this issue 
finally being debated in the House of Commons, since the idea of 
introducing and passing implementing legislation for the purpose 
of ratifying the UN fisheries agreement had already been 
mentioned in the February 1996 throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope, as would my party, that the government will be 
more diligent in these matters and move much more quickly than 
in this instance to introduce a bill in the House of Commons for 
the purpose of implementing international treaties.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I spoke yesterday on this and I understand some members 
from the government side were quoting me earlier today.  They 
said I was wrong.  We are talking about the two provisions which 
have been debated at length in the House.  I said that an officer 
or an enforcement person would have to get permission to board a 
vessel.  I went on to say that I agreed that was arguable.  My 
point was that this legislation is vague.  One section states 
they can board and then advise the flag state while the next 
section states that before they can do that they have to get 
permission.  I wanted to put those comments on record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, it was 
questions and comments and not another opportunity to be on

and I was speaking on a point.  My friend just alluded that this 
bill has no teeth.  This government has argued that it had to 
follow the UN convention. 
That is what this legislation is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last April just before the government called the election, it 
tabled enabling legislation for the same bill, but ironically 
these same clauses were not there.  The minister at the time did 
put some teeth into it, the very same legislation.  I notice some 
of the members on the opposite side are shaking their heads.  I 
would offer that legislation to them.  They are welcome to 
contact me and I will give them a copy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was negotiated in 1995.  They brought in the enabling 
legislation in 1996 and it died on the order paper when the 
election was called.  I remind members that we can put some teeth 
in the legislation and it is beyond me why the current minister 
has watered it down so it has no effect.  It is supposed to allow 
our enforcement officials to have the ability to act when foreign 
nations are fishing illegally and breaking our rules.  UN 
conventions allow them to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know when the <I>Estai</I> was fishing illegally in 1995 
that is what they did under the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. 
The new legislation takes all the teeth out of it.  They have to 
get permission from the flag state before they can lay a charge.

marks the 75th anniversary of the naval reserve in Canada. 
Located in 24 cities, the naval reserve is made up of individuals 
who have chosen to dedicate a few hours every week and a few 
weeks every year in the interest of serving their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These part time military volunteers represent more than 
one-third of the navy's total strength.  HMCS Carleton located in 
my riding of Ottawa Centre is the second largest naval reserve in 
Canada and includes 264 volunteers who perform extraordinary 
deeds in difficult situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naval reserves from across Canada are always ready to help in 
emergencies, like with the floods in the Saguenay and Manitoba 
and recently during the ice storm in Ontario and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank these dedicated men and women of the naval 
reserve for their commitment to helping others and for their 
service to this country.  They have demonstrated what it truly 
means to be Canadian.

are extremely profound consequences” he is afraid to face.

federal government was never prepared to consider full 
compensation.  It turns out that the bogus talk about principles 
was merely to mask the real issue, money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the health minister go back to the provinces to put more

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what has collapsed is the integrity and position taken by Ontario

that all victims during a period when governments were at fault 
should be compensated and beyond that there is no basis for doing 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from what the hon. member said that she is not aware

had no control over whether they were infected with tainted

not the first time they have dragged innocent people through the

do something with this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see all these people now who did not want to do anything at

cannot believe this.  Yesterday we asked the discredited health 
minister to prove how many Canadians were infected with hep C 
before 1986.  He refused.  We will do what he will not. Recent 
provincial surveys in both British Columbia and Nova Scotia 
indicate there could be as few as 15,000 nationwide.  That is 
15,000 too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister stop pitting Canadians against hepatitis

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should know that Mr. Justice Krever himself 
accepted the numbers that were produced by the director of our 
laboratory centre for disease control.  If the hon. member would 
read the Krever Report, which he likely has not, he would see 
that Dr. Paul Gully's numbers for the number of people infected 
in the relevant period was accepted by the Krever commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event this decision was not made on the basis of numbers. 
It was made on the basis of a proper principle that these

cash to people because they have become sick; you pay cash as 
damages because you did something wrong.

that analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision was not made on the basis of numbers.  Perhaps

they are going to give money. Instead, they passed the buck to 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we take action, they blame us for getting involved. Now

<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

little ego. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the public wants to compensate hepatitis C victims. 
We know that the provinces want to compensate the victims.  We 
know that the backbenchers want to compensate victims even though 
they could not find the courage to vote in favour of 
compensation.

they voted against employment equity legislation?   Where was

they had too much compassion? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
looks like the little guy from Shawinigan is really the big ego 
from Shawinigan.  That is what it boils down to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the government did not have to bring in a 
confidence motion on this vote.  The Prime Minister did not have 
to pummel his backbenchers into submission. 
Why will he not admit that he has made a mistake?  Why is he 
letting his big ego stand in the way of doing the right thing? 
Why will he not help hep C victims?

was clearly determined that the government had responsibility.

do its job.  When it was confronted with the problem it created a 
commission to postpone the solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what we have done as governments is to offer cash compensation to 
people who were harmed through fault.  For those who are ill, 
including all of those with hepatitis C, provinces like Quebec 
and Ontario would do well to look to their responsibilities to 
deliver services to the sick, services that are consistent across 
the country, services that respond to their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of playing cheap political games, the governments of 
Quebec and Ontario should not hide from their own responsibility 
of providing quality health services. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Ontario and Quebec have changed their minds on this 
government's limited compensation package for hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Manitoba government is critical of this government on this 
matter.  We on this side of the House believe that all provinces 
should follow suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the provincial solidarity that the minister has boasted so 
much about is gone, will he now go back to the drawing board, 
contact the provinces and arrive at a compensation package that 
is fair for all blood injured Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  The hon. 
member refers to Manitoba.  The first three times that I met the 
Manitoba health minister on this issue he would not hear at all 
about any compensation for anyone.  The Government of Manitoba 
refused completely to talk about it.  So did the governments of 
other provinces.  So did Ontario, saying there was no way it was 
prepared to talk about compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only because of the leadership of the federal government 
that 22,000 victims of hepatitis C have been offered $1.1 billion 
in compensation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Manitoba minister of health has clearly said 
that if the federal government is prepared to live up to its 
responsibility the provinces certainly would be prepared to meet 
with it to discuss this further. “Certainly I will be”, he 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this government accept its regulatory responsibility and 
come back with a fair compensation package for all blood injured 
Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
after long and arduous efforts we dragged the Government of 
Manitoba into an agreement in which it became a junior partner, 
contributing to compensation for the group that was harmed by 
governments which did not act when they should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To listen to this hon. member suggesting that the Government of 
Manitoba is in some position where it is taking a higher moral 
ground is impossible for me to tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government led the efforts and this government produced an 
agreement that offers compensation to 22,000 victims of hepatitis 
C.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order concerning a breach of the rules of 
confidentiality during the lock-up for parliamentarians prior to 
the release of the auditor general's report on Tuesday, April 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the lock-up prior to the release of the auditor 
general's report, as with lock-ups prior to the budget, the 
estimates and similar documents, is to provide parliamentarians 
and their staff as well as journalists time to study the document 
in confidence so that they are able to comment on it in a 
considered way when it is tabled in the House of Commons. 
It is crucial that those present at such lock-ups preserve an 
absolute confidentiality in order to preserve the privilege of 
the House and to have all important documents tabled first in the 
House before being made public in any way.  In order to preserve 
such confidentiality, participants at the lock-up are asked to 
surrender cell phones upon entering the lock-up to prevent the 
premature release of confidential information.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was brought to my attention by New Democrat staffers who were 
at the lock-up prior to the release of the auditor general's 
report of Tuesday, April 28 that staff members of another 
political party were witnessed using cell phones from within the 
lock-up. These people know who they are and I am not interested 
in naming them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This constitutes a very serious infraction of the rules of the 
lock-up and a threat to the privileges of this House.  Mr. 
Speaker, I ask you to investigate the matter in consultation with 
officials of the auditor general and report to the House if you 
find an infraction has taken place.  I ask you to inform the 
House what action you will be taking as a result to make sure 
this does not happen again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment on this.  After I was made aware of this 
supposed infraction I talked to staff that were in the lock-up. 
This is apparently what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently the lock-up went on for a couple of hours.  When 
staff and others go into the lock-up for the auditor general's 
report they turn in their cell phones and so on, which was done. 
Apparently at the end of the session as the auditor general's 
staff members were cleaning up, saying the lock-up was 
essentially over, they delivered the cell phones back to the 
people who were in the room.  This was three or four minutes 
before the technical expiry of that lock-up time.  When the cell 
phones were returned, one of our staff checked his messages. I do 
not think he misused his cell phone.  He did it at the last 
second when it was returned to him by the staff. There was no 
malice intended.  There was no breach of confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can check to make sure they are not delivered back at the 
last minute.  Perhaps we should do that. I do not think there was 
any intent to break the spirit of the law here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Quite a few Speakers previous to me have 
ruled consistently that these lock-ups are under the auspices of 
the auditor general.  They do not come under the purview of the 
House of Commons per se.  The reason I permitted the second 
intervener was so we could get more information. In any case, I 
would rule that it is not the responsibility of the House of 
Commons per se.  It is outside of our purview.

when we were both in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 28 years the former member for Victoria—Haliburton was 
wise in the defence of the interests of his constituents, and

Speaker, it is with deep regret that I rise today to remember the 
late William C. “Bill” Scott, a dedicated constituency 
politician from my riding of Victoria—Haliburton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege to serve as member of parliament after Mr. 
Scott retired, before the 1993 federal election.  Mr. Scott was a 
kind man who placed an emphasis on his duty to constituents.  He 
was very approachable and his good will attracted people to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before entering federal politics, Bill played important roles as 
director of Agricultural Societies of Ontario, past president of 
the Lions Club, hockey referee with the Ontario Hockey 
Association and the Ontario Minor Hockey Association and as 
an associate member of the Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 441, 
Kinmount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He started his political journey as reeve of the township of 
Snowdon. Mr. Scott won the Progressive Conservative riding 
nomination over seven other candidates in 1965.  He was never 
challenged for that nomination after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Scott was first elected a member of parliament in 1965 and 
he served an astonishing eight terms representing 
Victoria—Haliburton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bill Scott was born and raised in Kinmount, a small friendly 
community in the riding. He always remembered where he was from 
first and foremost.  Bill Scott dedicated his spare time to the 
Kinmount fair, one of the most successful rural fairs in Ontario. 
His involvement began as a youngster and led to president of the 
Kinmount fall fair board.  His involvement in the fair was very 
important to the community and to all those who attended the fair 
year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Scott had an active beef farm which enabled him to be very 
aware that agriculture was an important industry in the riding. 
He was a strong supporter of volunteers.  Wherever he had the 
opportunity to praise volunteers and the work they did he took 
full advantage to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ottawa Bill served many years as a member of parliament.  On 
July 1, 1992 he was elevated to the Queen's privy council.  He 
also served as Assistant Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons 
in 1979 and was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Veterans Affairs in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Scott used both Ottawa and his riding to effectively serve 
for 27 years in this House as a politician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will always admire Bill Scott for what he did for 
Victoria—Haliburton.  Bill's family gave this country a 
hardworking politician committed to improving his hometown, his 
riding and his country.

with distinction and honour for 28 years, from 1965 to 1993. That

statement of the trust his constituents placed in him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people speak of Bill Scott they speak with warmth and 
affection.  They speak of him as an icon among grassroots 
politicians.  They refer to Bill as having served his 
constituents in a selfless manner and say he was a gentleman.  I 
knew Bill and served in two parliaments with him.  I concur with 
their sentiments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Constituents will say that Bill went beyond the call of duty as 
an MP.  No problem or person was too small.  Expediency was not 
in his vocabulary when it came to helping people.  No matter how 
you voted, you could count on Bill for help. Despite his success, 
it never went to his head.  This was truly a statement to Bill's 
dignity and sense of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill served two terms as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Veterans Affairs.  He was appointed to the Privy Council in 
1992 in recognition of his work in parliament, his community and 
his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill will also be remembered for his work at the municipal 
level, first as a reeve in the township of Snowdon, and for his 
long term commitment and work as president of the Kinmount Fair 
and the Agricultural Society.  Both of these were passions for 
Bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my Reform colleagues, I extend to his wife Betty, 
daughter Laurie, son Guy, his sister Margaret, their families and 
his grandchildren our sincere and deepest sympathy.  Bill will be 
missed by those who knew him.  His indomitable spirit lives on in 
this hallowed precinct and in the community he served and loved.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to join other members of parliament in paying tribute to Bill 
Scott. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of sitting here with him from 1984 to 1993. 
When I arrived here in 1984 as a Conservative member, I noticed 
on the list of elected members that Bill Scott had been here 
since 1965. I wanted to know how he had managed to survive for 
so long in politics. Indeed, in 1984 it was said that the 
average political life of a member of parliament was four and a 
half years, taking into account the fact that a number of 
byelections had been held. What had Bill Scott done to 
survive all these changes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to meet him in his office, and he spoke about his riding 
with love and passion. 
He told me all that he was doing in his riding and said that 
debates in the House were not necessarily his priority. Even 
though he was a man of culture and a good speaker, and even 
though he knew the issues very well, he preferred to work in his 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that the year we both got elected he was once 
reprimanded by his whip, because he had not shown up here when 
he was supposed to be on duty. Instead, he had attended what he 
felt was an important meeting in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had a passion for his people. Some say that he could name 
almost everyone who lived in that beautiful riding of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could name every vote getter—important members of the 
Optimist Club or of any other association—and would see them 
often, consult them and ensure re-election with a strong 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another of his passions was agriculture.  He spoke of it often. 
He often attended meetings of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, of which I was also a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention that he was an effective member, with 
high regard for colleagues in his party and in the entire House. 
He was flexible, but he was very firm about his deep 
convictions when debating in the House or in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we wanted him to do something in the House and he had 
something to do in his riding he would smile and say “I take 
orders only from the people in my riding”.  He set an example 
and I thank him for it, because it is no doubt partly due to his 
good advice to me in 1984 on the need to work in one's riding 
and to care for one's fellow citizens that I have managed to 
keep my seat in this House for the past 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer my condolences and those of the Bloc 
Quebecois to his family, his wife, his children and to his 
friends and party colleagues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I served in this House with Bill Scott for 14 years. I did not 
know him particularly well. I do not know what kind of a sense of 
humour he had but he might have seen some irony in the fact that 
for someone who served here for 28 years, he had at that moment 
more colleagues in other parties, Reform, Bloc and the NDP than 
he had in his own party as a result of the election that he chose 
not to run in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember him as a humble man who did his constituency work 
extremely well.  I think his constituents attested to that time 
after time after time.  He is a lesson to all of us who think 
that the bravado, the rhetoric and the theatre of this place has 
something essential to do with the job of a member of parliament. 
It is certainly a part of what makes parliament tick but we know 
there are good members of parliament who are not part of the 
daily theatre of this place and who are content to do a good job 
on behalf of their constituents, to work behind the scenes and to 
render a service to their constituents and to their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us are very honoured to pay tribute today in particular 
to the memory and to the work of Mr. Scott.  On behalf of my 
colleagues in the NDP, I extend our condolences to Mr. Scott's 
family and pay tribute to his long career of service to 
parliament and to his constituents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, four of the five 
interveners today referred to the fact that they served with Bill 
Scott.  I did too.  Bill was a quiet gentleman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall a story after I had been elected in 1974.  The 
Liberals—I was one way back when—were in the lobby and Bill 
Scott was there.  I was brand new and I did not know anybody.  I 
drifted over to him and said “What did you think of caucus this 
morning?” He said to me “We are not allowed to talk about what 
goes on in caucus”.  I said “It is okay, we are in the same 
caucus”.  He said “No, we are not”.  He was the kind of guy 
who you took for granted was one of you, whoever you were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Scott's family was very important to him.  I met his wife 
on a number of occasions.  He served this House well.  I think 
the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona said that he did his work 
quietly, and he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if you would use the word “effectively”, but I 
would use that word when it comes to the work Bill Scott did for 
his constituents.  He was also a good party member.  He 
understood many of the problems parliamentarians have when they 
are brand new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one very much respected him.  I always sought him out when 
I could.  He had a good sense of humour.  He was a jovial man and 
a good parliamentarian.

I rise on a point of order.  I would like to raise a matter with 
respect to tributes.  I did not raise it the other day but I 
noticed that today you began the tributes to Mr. Scott by going 
to a person from the party that Mr. Scott belonged to.  I think 
that is proper and I understood that to be the procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I was, to say the very least, not very pleased 
when we were doing tributes to Father Bob Ogle and you recognized 
the secretary of state first instead of me who was rising to 
speak on behalf of my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not raise it that day because I did not think Father Bob 
would want me to, but I raise it now for future consideration. 
We need to get straight what the procedure is.  I would hope it 
is as I understand it and that simply a mistake was made the 
other day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member has every right to feel 
a little sad about the way it was handled.  It was my fault. 
What happened, very simply, was that sometimes I am given a list 
of people who are going to intervene and sometimes we have the 
member who is sitting from that riding.  I thought this was one 
of those times and that is what we decided to do.  It was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a general rule, the hon. member is absolutely correct in that 
we usually go to the party that the person served.  I apologize

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK206">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-27, an 
act to amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada 
Shipping Act to enable Canada to implement the Agreement for the 
Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to 
the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and 
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and other international fisheries 
treaties or arrangements, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-27, an act to amend the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada Shipping Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill amends Canadian legislation to enable Canada to ratify 
the United Nations fisheries agreement on the conservation and 
management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish 
stocks. The United Nations agreement relating to the conservation 
and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory 
fish stocks was adopted by consensus on August 5, 1995 by a UN 
conference in New York City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Straddling fish stocks do exactly that.  They straddle or 
migrate across the outer limit of national fisheries waters of a 
coastal state and the adjacent high seas.  Examples are flounder 
and turbot. Highly migratory fish stocks, such as tuna and 
swordfish, migrate through the high seas and in some cases 
through the exclusive economic zone of coastal states. Both 
categories of fish stocks have been subject to unregulated 
overfishing on the high seas.  The problem exists in several 
parts of the world, including the Grand Banks of Newfoundland 
outside Canada's 200 mile zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overfishing by foreign vessels outside and inside the 200 miles 
has been a factor in declines in northwest Atlantic straddling 
groundfish stocks of cod, flounder and turbot.  These declines 
have devastated many Canadian coastal communities economically, 
leaving thousands of fish harvesters and fish plant workers 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which 
came into force in November 1994 clearly allows coastal states, 
that is, states which border on oceans, exclusive rights to 
control fisheries within 200 nautical miles or 370.4 kilometres 
of their shores. What is not clear are the legal rights and 
obligations of states regarding highly migratory fish stocks and 
straddling fish stocks on the high seas.  The UN agreement helps 
to fill this gap in the law of the sea convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are discussing, Bill C-27, contains provisions for 
enforcement against unauthorized fishing in Canadian fisheries 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN agreement regarding straddling and highly migratory fish 
stocks will come into effect following 30 ratifications or 
accessions.  Fifty-nine states thus far have signed the agreement 
and 15, including the United States, Russia and Norway, have 
ratified so far. Canada will be in a position to ratify this 
agreement after this legislation is passed.  Therefore, it is 
very important that we pass this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hoped that a new legal system for high seas fisheries will 
provide for effective control and enforcement to protect 
straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks from the 
overfishing which is taking place on the high seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proper conservation and management of these stocks could make a 
significant contribution to ensuring the sustainability of this 
important food source for our future generations.  I think the 
key that is very important here is the question of 
sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The east coast report which was recently tabled by the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans has a quotation on its cover 
“Then God said, let us make man in our image, after our 
likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea”. 
The key word is dominion, not destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today what has really happened with our fisheries is that rather 
than man exercising dominion and wise ruling over this resource, 
there has been a gradual mismanagement and destruction of it.  We 
only have to look at the fact that cod has now been placed on the 
endangered list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at the lobster fishery. 
Unfortunately today if we go to the east shore in my province of 
Nova Scotia we can see one fishing village fighting with another 
fishing village over lobsters.  There are not enough lobsters in 
one area to satisfy the fishers and the license requirement 
there.  Yet there seems to be an overabundance in another area. 
We have this inequality.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, when resources become tight, when there seems to be 
an unfair distribution, then conflict often develops. 
Unfortunately we have community being pitted against community 
because of the mismanagement of the fisheries to the point where 
there are insufficient resources to satisfy the requirements of 
the villages.  This is a very sad state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, when we have a program such as the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy coming to an end, and we do not see any real 
program or alternatives being presented by the government to face 
up to this crisis which is developing in our communities, again 
it becomes very sad.  We know there are people in these 
communities who rely on that program to carry them through to the 
point where they can earn and look after their families. Without 
something to replace it in a meaningful way, or without some very 
positive efforts being made to deal with the issue, we are going 
to see a lot of frustration as we are already seeing in the 
communities affected as this program comes to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this is saying to all of us is that we have to move away 
from that bottom line which government far too often looks at. 
That is the economic situation.  Far too often governments focus 
only on the dollar as opposed to what the dollar is intended to 
do, which is to serve and help people.  Far too often people do 
not look beyond the dollar.  They want to balance the budget. 
They want to define programs in terms of an economic value, 
forgetting about the social hardships being caused and what has 
to be done to alleviate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this with the current proposals with respect to the 
hepatitis C victims where government can narrowly define the 
number of people it feels should be helped based on a dollar line 
rather than on compassion, fairness and what is right.  The 
argument is that if we compensate everybody we are not going to 
have enough money to go around.  We know that is not true.  When 
government wants to it can find the money to do other things.  It 
can find money to assist large businesses.  On provincial levels 
quite often corporations are forgiven loans and outstanding 
money.  Yet there are programs that are needed to help people. 
These are not receiving the attention or the dollars required. 
This excuse of not having the money is simply that, an excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the TAGS program we have to look realistically 
at our priorities.  Are we concerned really about helping people 
who are in need, exercising some compassion, some fairness or are 
we solely concerned with keeping those books balanced?  Even then 
it is questionable what balancing the books really means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we look at that.  As I read in the quote 
when God said let us make man in our image, certainly the image 
of God was not an economic image where the bottom line would be 
dollars and cents.  The image of God is an image of people 
sharing and having respect for one another, helping each other 
when they are in need. We need to move away from that bottom line 
of the dollar being the sole determinant of whether we are going 
to move ahead to help people. We need to move toward fairness and 
compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I attended a committee meeting.  We were looking 
at the question of economic development in aboriginal 
communities.  We were speaking specifically about the northern 
communities in this great country. It saddens me every time we 
look at Canada's great north where there are very valuable 
mineral resources and lots of riches.  Quite often non-aboriginal 
people have come in and have utilized those resources.  They have 
not enabled the aboriginal people who are living on that land, 
who have prior claim to that land, to benefit in any substantial 
or sustainable way from those resources. 
When mining operations are developed sometimes the argument is we 
give jobs to the aboriginal people and they can work on these 
mines but we do not see any real sharing of the royalties and the 
riches that come from the lands which were inhabited by these 
people.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it comes down to the bottom line.  As governments and as 
private companies and corporations are we solely interested in 
our own gain financially to the point that we forget about 
sharing with other people and we forget about loving one another, 
respecting one another and making sure that the resources are for 
the good of all as opposed to only a few? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the issues that we have to look at when we are 
dealing seriously with the many problems facing our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill when we think about the fishing industry, when we 
think about the resource there and how we are going to deal with 
it for the future for our children and our children's children, I 
think we have to look at the priority that we are going to put 
forth as we tackle this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the bottom line going to be the dollar for us or is it going 
to be sharing equitably in the resources that the creator has 
given to us to manage and have dominion over? It is high time 
governments stop treating people simply as statistics, stop 
defining how we are going to handle the problem in terms of 
<I>x</I> number of people fitting within <I>x</I> category or 
within a certain time frame, and remember that the person who got 
sick before 1986 is just as important as the person who got sick 
after 1986.  There is no distinction in terms of the suffering 
these people will feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have to realize they cannot make those kinds of 
arbitrary distinctions and live in good conscience with those 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know many times when I have to make a tough decision and 
people ask me how I am going to wrestle with that, I say that 
what is going to really count for me is at the end of the day if 
I put my head down and go to sleep feeling that I have done what 
is right, I have done what my heart has dictated as opposed to 
what my pocket book may dictate, then I can rest with an easy 
conscience. We have to exercise that kind of feeling, that kind 
of attitude when we are dealing with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me sometimes when I come to this House and I sit in 
this very important Chamber as we are doing the nation's business 
to see the manner in which question period conducts itself.  I 
have said it before and I will say it again.  I feel it is wrong 
when we are dealing with serious issues which affect the lives of 
people that we are screaming back and forth at one another.  We 
are not listening to each other.  We are not hearing what people 
are saying.  We are not showing proper respect. That goes to the 
core of this entire issue of how governments respond to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to listen.  We have to hear what people are saying. We 
have to understand each other.  This cannot be done if we are 
trying to have one-upmanship, one on the other, trying to 
outsmart the other person with some wise remark which has no real 
meaning or relevance for the people who are suffering and the 
people who are looking to us to address their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the members of the House, if we want to be serious 
about the issues which confront our nation, national unity, the 
issues dealing with aboriginal peoples, the TAGS program and the 
fishers who are suffering as a result of the end of that program, 
all these things, we must truly deal with these issues from the 
heart and not from the pocketbook, not from the budget book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure if we do that we will certainly find answers and move 
things forward in a real way which is going to be effective, 
meaningful and help the citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this legislation will give us some control over our 
shores and over the fishing industry and will hopefully will 
bring some order to the way in which the fishery conducts itself 
so that the end result of helping people in our communities will 
be accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great pride that I say that we support this bill and 
I would certainly be pleased to answer any questions.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA EVIDENCE ACT

<A NAME="LINK210">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill S-5, an act to 
amend the Canada Evidence Act and the Criminal Code in respect of 
persons with disabilities, to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act 
in respect of persons with disabilities and other matters and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill S-5 deals with several issues of interest to persons with 
disabilities.  This government fully recognizes that it has an 
important role to play in ensuring that Canadians with 
disabilities are treated as full and equal participants in the 
mainstream of our society. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1995, the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the 
Status of Disabled Persons recommended that the legislation be 
reviewed to reduce the difficulties faced by persons with 
disabilities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1997 after conducting extensive consultations from 
coast to coast, the federal task force on disability issues 
headed by the hon. solicitor general called upon the federal 
government to present amendments to the criminal law and to human 
rights legislation as soon as possible.  Bill S-5 honours this 
request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Evidence Act would be amended to recognize in 
legislation that communication assistance should be provided to 
any witness who has a communication related disability, and that 
any sensory method could be used for the purpose of identifying 
the accused. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code would be amended through Bill S-5 to allow 
witnesses with communication disabilities to use videotaped 
evidence. The Criminal Code would also be amended to include a 
series of changes designed to encourage persons with 
disabilities to serve on juries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code would also be amended to create a new offence, 
section 152.1, prohibiting the sexual exploitation of vulnerable 
disabled persons so that persons with disabilities will not be 
sexually exploited.  The committee has made recommendations to 
improve the section.  The point is well taken and Bill S-5 as 
amended responds to the concerns raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other important part of this bill is the package of 
amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act which provides 
protection against discrimination at the federal level.  This 
bill will enhance those protections for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key element is the addition of an express duty to 
accommodate to the act.  This amendment will require employers 
and service providers to accommodate the needs of persons 
protected by the act except where it would cause undue hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duty to accommodate is of vital importance to persons with 
disabilities as well as to groups such as religious minorities. 
The law will help to ensure equal access to the workplace and to 
goods and services.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other important changes to the act.  This bill will 
extend the substantive protections of the law.  For example it 
will prohibit compound discrimination involving discrimination on 
more than one ground.  The law will also allow complaints where 
there is a discrimination in the provision of goods and services 
but an individual victim has not stepped forward. This amendment 
will ensure that there is no discrimination without redress. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also important changes to the prescribed remedial 
actions to make the act more effective. For example, the maximum 
penalty for pain and suffering would increase to $20,000 from 
$5,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, some of the changes proposed by this bill concern the 
institutions responsible for enforcing the act. The Canadian 
human rights commission will report directly to parliament on an 
annual basis, which will symbolically attest the independence of 
the commission. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human rights tribunal will be reconstructed as a smaller 
permanent tribunal with members with experience and expertise in 
human rights matters.  A small permanent tribunal will adjudicate 
cases with greater expertise and efficiency. This new tribunal 
will operate in conformity with the principles of independence 
and impartiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the highlights of the proposed changes to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act, the Canada Evidence Act and the 
Criminal Code.  Together these amendments represent an important 
step forward in our efforts to ensure that every individual is an 
equal member of our society.  That is the commitment of this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments contained in this bill are aimed at breaking down 
the barriers so that persons with disabilities and other 
individuals and groups can participate as full citizens of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underlying this endeavour are values which are important to 
Canadians such as equality, fairness and justice.  That is what 
we are committed to.  These are important values and ones which I 
know all my colleagues support.  I am therefore very pleased to 
commend this bill to members of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak in the debate on Bill S-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot resist the temptation when we have a bill labelled S-5 
instead of C something, to comment again on the erosion of 
democracy around here.  It is still very offensive to me that 
instead of coming through the House of Commons which is the house 
of representational government, all members here having been 
elected by the people out there, instead of having a bill come 
from this House, it comes from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish in any way to take two hours to talk about the 
Senate today.  That has already been done.  But I think it is 
appropriate at this occasion to draw attention to the fact once 
more that we have things turned around here.  The Senate should 
be elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country we believe in democracy.  We believe in 
representational government. We believe in, as this bill states, 
the worth of individual people.  How is it then that there is a 
body of people in government that has such tremendous power over 
our well-being, over the way our rules are designed that govern 
us, that is not even elected?  I find that particularly 
offensive.  The people in my riding and certainly in my home 
province of Alberta do as well.  That has to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be really wonderful if the Senate were truly elected. 
Then when it came up with a bill labelled S-5, from the Senate of 
Canada, we would say fine, it is from a parliamentary body that 
is equal to this place. We would not have to feel that we were 
somehow being made second class citizens here because a body that 
has no accountability, at least technically it does not and 
practically it does not appear to have either, is lording it over 
us. 
I cannot help but talk about that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is a second thing which was so well illustrated here 
just a few days ago.  Even in this House, where members are 
elected, they are not given the freedom to vote the way they 
believe their constituents would want them to vote, or the way 
their hearts and their conscience would demand.  Now how do you 
say this and still stay friendly?  We have trouble right here in 
river city, river city being the city of two rivers, Ottawa. That 
trouble is due to representational democracy where the reflection 
of the will of the people of Canada is vested in the power that 
is given to a very small group of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one am very happy and very proud to be in a party where I 
am required to represent my constituents.  Not only am I 
permitted to do so, but I am out of step with my party if I fail 
to do so. That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talk about the Senate lacking legitimacy.  To a degree what 
has happened in this place over and over again in this parliament 
and previous parliaments under Liberal and Conservative 
governments is the party whips have these clones I guess we would 
call them.  I do not want to refer to a barnyard animal so I will 
just call them clones.  And we know the most famous clone happens 
to be one of those barnyard animals which makes a baa noise.  I 
will not talk about that at all. It is really unfortunate that we 
do not have true democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had true democracy we would end up with better rules.  It 
is not right for me to say that I am always right.  I know that 
is a surprise to you, Mr. Speaker, but I will confess and admit 
that.  I have on occasion been wrong and I will be wrong again. 
The strength of society is that when I make an error those around 
me will point that out.  They will say “Sir, you are wrong”. If 
enough of my trusted friends say that to me, I am quite likely to 
change my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact I changed my mind very recently on an issue when talking 
with a friend.  I believe very strongly in something, not a 
principle but a process that we were following. This individual 
told me the process was flawed and gave a reason why the process 
was flawed.  After talking with him for half an hour I told him 
it pained me deeply to admit it but yes, he was right and I was 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to admit that yesterday I made an error.  One of my 
colleagues asked me what the area of a circle is if when one 
walked around it it was one kilometre in circumference.  I 
computed it.  My colleague said he did not think my computation 
was correct. I said I would check my arithmetic.  We worked at it 
together.  I am a math major and I taught math for 31 years.  I 
have to hang my head in shame and say I made a mistake.  I 
actually made a mathematical error and here I am right across the 
country now via the wonderful television channel CPAC confessing 
that I made a mathematical error and that my colleague corrected 
me.  Having realized that I was wrong, I admitted that I had made 
a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me that is a strength.  When someone can show me evidence 
that something is wrong then I am really a fool if I do not 
change my mind.  That is really the essence of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real strength of democracy is that if we have true 
democracy, surely the best and most valuable legislation, that 
which is best for our society, best for our taxpayers and best 
for our children will bubble to the surface like cream rises to 
the top.  Or at least it did in my day.  Before everything was 
homogenized and pasteurized and everything the cream would go to 
the top.  The best laws would bubble to the top if we allowed 
interaction where I would say to my colleagues “You have a vote 
and I have a vote.  Let us discuss the issue.  Let us debate 
it”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still on this topic of democratic accountability and true 
democracy in this country, yes, this bill came from the Senate, 
but what is going to happen to it here?  Will the individual 
members be able to look at the items in the bill?  Will any of 
them be able to say “This bill has a serious flaw or two and I 
would like to see it amended”?  Will that happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish it could.  I wish it would.  There are indeed a few 
things in here which should be amended.  There are some flaws, 
but the fact of the matter is that our observation and our 
experience has been that an amendment can be ever so fine but it 
is turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if it is presented in committee it is turned down, not by 
those who have heard our reasoned arguments, but by the 
instructions that come down from the minister who says to the 
members of the committee “Don't approve that amendment”.  That 
is wrong.  There is a flaw in our process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary is asking whether we proposed 
amendments to this bill.  The answer is no, we did not.  Why?  I 
suppose there is perhaps a streak of cynicism setting in with 
some of our members who say “What's the use?  It doesn't happen 
anyway”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that is not what happened here, but it happens over and 
over again.  It certainly has happened in the committees that I 
have served on.  Members work their buns off trying to make good, 
reasoned amendments.  More than once in committees I have 
convinced members, not only in opposition, but also government 
members, that an amendment should be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught for 31 years.  I think I have a fair ability to judge 
body language.  I know when people are with me or when they are 
agin me.  When members say to me “That is a good amendment”, I 
know in their heart they would like to vote in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider a bill clause by clause in committee those same 
members say to me “It is a good idea.  I agree with you”.  They 
say that to me privately or even across the table in committee, 
but when it is time to vote they look at their instructions and 
oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a fundamental flaw in democracy.  It results in laws 
being not as good as they could be or as they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about justice.  This bill will amend 
several acts.  It will amend the Canada Evidence Act.  It will 
amend the Criminal Code.  It will also amend the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot in this bill that is really valuable and really 
worthwhile.  There is a lot in this bill that is right and that 
is worthy of our support as representatives of the people who 
elected us.  There are also, as I said, some flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend a few minutes, since I have lots of time in my 
intervention today, to speak on the priorities of this 
government.  I find it incredible that the Minister of Justice 
finds this bill the one that should be brought in before we run 
out of time in June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will probably break for the summer recess near the end 
of June.  That is our present anticipation.  When we look at the 
number of bills that have to be dealt with and the number of 
supply days that are left, with only May and June to go, time 
will go quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really wish that this government would take an occasion like 
this to bring forward some substantial bills that the people out 
there are crying for, that they are demanding and that we need so 
desperately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, for example, of the misguided justice system in this 
country.  It is not even a justice system any more.  I am talking 
about this specifically because there is a question here about 
sexual assault.  That is one of the things included in Bill S-5.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appalled to see conditional sentencing for people who 
physically and/or sexually attack a fellow citizen.  Usually it 
is a man attacking a woman or an adult sexually assaulting a 
child.  These are horrendous crimes.  If I were to choose 
priorities, would I be talking about these little amendments, as 
important as they are?  Yes, I would.  I would spend about 12 
seconds on this stuff, pass it and then go on to the important 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not terrible that in this country a man can actually rape 
a woman and not serve a single day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  “Unbelievable” my colleague says.  Yes, it 
is unbelievable.  It is unconscionable and wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked the Minister of Justice— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  I am sorry, but in all deference to 
the hon. member I would like to ask what the subject of 
conditional sentencing has to do with Bill S-5 that we are now in 
the process of debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair was paying 
close attention to the hon. member and in the Chair's opinion the 
debate is relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  It is indeed 
relevant since this bill does address the question of sexual 
assault against disabled people.  However, we are also talking 
about the whole justice system.  This is part of the government's 
agenda and it is my job as a member of this Chamber, and as a 
member of the opposition, to point out not only the flaws in this 
legislation but also the fundamental flaws in all of the 
government's priorities with respect to these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the rules of conditional sentencing a judge may give a 
conditional sentence to a person convicted of the crime of rape 
and not even have that person spend a single day in jail.  He 
gets sentenced, but it is a conditional sentence.  It might be a 
sentence where he does some community work or something like that 
and does not go too far from his house.  Those are the different 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have a law in place in this country where a person can commit 
such a heinous crime and serve no time is wrong.  We have asked 
the Minister of Justice to amend the Young Offenders Act.  We 
have asked the Minister of Justice to state explicitly that 
conditional sentencing should not apply to violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would not constitute a great deal of time of the House.  I 
would think the Minister of Justice would be able to bring in an 
amendment.  I would even be surprised if it filled one page in 
both official languages.  The amendment would read that 
“conditional sentencing does not apply to the crimes of assault, 
murder and rape”.  How many words did that take?  That is an 
amendment about which our citizens are saying “It's about high 
time”.  That is what our government should be doing because it 
is important and it is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I am talking today about Bill S-5, which contains 
matters of sexual assault, I am saying that this government has 
it wrong.  There are some very important things it could do.  I 
am sick of the Minister of Justice saying “Oh, this is a very 
complex issue”.  I am sorry, but it is not a complex issue to 
say that conditional sentencing does not apply to people 
convicted of rape.  It is straightforward and simple.  It should 
be done and it should be done fast.  Our members would certainly 
support that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some specific statements that I would like to make with 
respect to Bill S-5.  The bill has a lot of good things in it. 
For example, there is a change to the Canada Evidence Act.  The 
first part of this bill would change that act so that people with 
physical disabilities can still give evidence before the court. 
They are not prevented from doing that by virtue of their 
disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There cannot be anyone against that.  Here is a person who was a 
witness to a crime, or perhaps a victim of the crime, and he or 
she is asked to come and give evidence.  Perhaps that person 
cannot speak.  Perhaps that person is blind.  Perhaps there are 
other conditions that would physically make it difficult for that 
person to provide evidence to the court.  This is overdue.  This 
is one of the things that I would support strongly.  It would 
enable people with various disabilities to provide evidence in 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to this amendment, it is now incumbent on the court to 
make sure that every accommodation is made to hear these people, 
even to the point that if a person is unable to speak certain 
gestures would be agreed upon that would indicate a yes or a no 
to questions that asked by counsel.  We cannot be against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill indicates that the Criminal Code will be amended with 
respect to the protection of disabled people who are assaulted. 
This one deals particularly with sexual assaults.  I wish it 
would have dealt with the subject more widely.  However, in this 
particular case the bill will amend the Criminal Code with 
respect to sexual assaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, by association, I am ashamed to be a man.  So many 
men in our society do such horrendous things to our women and our 
children.  I am not in any way saying that women do not commit 
these serious crimes.  However, it is true that most of them are 
committed by men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I am fully committed as a father, as a 
grandfather and as a husband to guarding and protecting my wife, 
my children and my grandchildren.  My granddaughter Kayla will 
soon be two.  I cannot imagine that anyone would assault her 
sexually.  If I happened to be in the vicinity, they would have 
one bear to deal with.  If grandpa was around I would be able to 
protect her, right then and there.  But what if I am not there? 
How do we protect those who cannot protect themselves?  We do it 
by our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see extremely severe penalties for adults and 
people in positions of power and authority who physically use 
that power to overcome a weaker person, to assault them, whether 
it is sexually or in any other way.  I do not have much time for 
those people.  I would be very severe with them.  The message I 
am getting from people is:  Why are we coddling these guys? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first responsibility must be to protect.  This bill does not 
deal specifically with the protection of children. 
It deals with the protection of people who have physical 
disabilities.  As I have said in the House before, I have a 
disabled sister. She is not able to speak.  She has cerebral 
palsy and she sits in a wheelchair.  This bill deals specifically 
with my sister and with the place where she lives. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT75"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT75"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1615

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am totally confident that staff members where my sister lives 
are loving and caring.  I have been very impressed when I have 
been there.  They care for her very lovingly.  I am not in any 
way implicating the staff members where my sister stays.  I am 
simply saying I trust them explicitly.  But if there were in such 
a place a person on staff or otherwise who would attack and 
assault a person like my sister, confined to her wheelchair, 
unable to defend herself, not even able to cry for help, are we 
going to be very easy with that person?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, and I am supporting this part of the bill, 
strengthens that.  If a person has not given consent, and 
obviously my sister would not be able to give consent, there is 
in this bill a strengthening of the power of the courts to 
properly convict the attacker on evidence and put them in jail 
for a term not exceeding five years.  Five years for that. It 
would be longer if I had my way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That of course is the problem.  We deal with these huge numbers 
and not with individual people.  This bill discusses these things 
and even goes so far as to say that if a person believes the 
other person has given consent but if that consent has been given 
because of being inebriated or because of drug use or whatever, 
then consent is deemed not to have been given and the 
responsibility lies with the attacker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I despair in our society.  I do not know where we ever 
came from.  I sometimes think it all started with cotton pickin' 
Hugh.  He did it to us. He opened up the flood gates to say that 
our sexual behaviour did not matter.  I am here to say it matters 
and it matters a lot.  A person who cannot control his or her 
sexual behaviour is dangerous and we need to make sure innocent 
people, people who are disabled, are protected from such people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly unfortunate in our society that we have come to 
the point where we think we can do anything we want.  We have 
even reached the point where there are some in our society who 
think they can sexually attack the disabled.  That is horrendous 
and I am appalled by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the part of this motion that states we are going to 
strengthen our laws in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to talk about the amendments proposed to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.  I am going to be as careful as I can because I 
want to send out the right message.  I would like to read this 
because this is what this act would put into place in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act: record. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this act is to extend the laws in Canada to give 
effect, within the purview of matters coming within the 
legislative authority of parliament, to the principle that all 
individuals should have an opportunity equal with other 
individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able 
and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated consistent 
with their duties and obligations as members of society without 
being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory 
practices based on— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then there is the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have read so far we cannot argue with. 
Certainly in this wonderful country of ours we would promote the 
equal opportunity of people to do what I have just read, to 
provide for themselves this life, a life they are able to and 
wish to have.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has limitations.  This is where it gets a little dicey 
because I am now going to read the list.  These are the bases for 
discriminatory practices that are prohibited.  We cannot 
discriminate based on race.  We cannot discriminate based on 
national or ethnic origin, on colour, on religion, on age or on 
sex.  I wish they would say gender because sex does imply the 
behaviour of sex as opposed to gender, which is talking about our 
maleness or femaleness.  We cannot discriminate against people 
based on sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, 
disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has 
been granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says the purpose of this act is to extend the laws in Canada 
which will provide for these people all to basically live their 
lives to the fullest. There is a problem here.  This is not the 
purpose of the act.  We already had Bill C-33 which amended and 
inserted the words sexual orientation into this.  Frankly, there 
are a couple of categories, and sexual orientation is one of 
them, that do not fit into this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we are talking here about sexual behaviour and it is 
an imposition of one person's sexual behaviour on another 
person's interpretation of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go on to read the bill there are all sorts of rules and 
regulations that are brought in by the governor in council, the 
minister and his officials, in order to enforce these rules.  I 
can certainly see where it would be valid for us to say that a 
person must do, and this bills talks about it, everything 
possible to accommodate the needs of a person who is disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked with disabled people in the workplace.  I have 
worked with people who are blind.  I do not know if members 
remember, but there was a person working here in the House of 
Commons as a translator, Mr. Conway, who was blind, a wonderful 
person and very competent.  A person with no eyesight usually 
develops an exceptionally fine sense of hearing and he did a 
wonderful job.  I had occasion to speak to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is correct for us to do whatever we can to accommodate a 
person with physical disabilities in the workplace.  I agree also 
we ought not to be saying to a person they cannot work here 
because they are the wrong colour or the wrong race.  That is 
unconscionable.  We need to ask people if they are capable of 
doing the job.  I agree even to the point of saying we should 
make some special effort to accommodate those who have 
disabilities which we need to work together on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone applies for a job as an accountant who happens to 
be in a wheelchair, I think it is totally appropriate for us to 
go that extra mile and make sure that office has wheelchair 
accessibility to all rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person is hearing disabled, let us go that extra mile.  Let 
us provide a hearing device or perhaps a teletype unit.  That is 
old age now.  It was 25 years ago that we provided teletype 
devices for people with hearing disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we provide to overcome the disability of a sexual 
orientation?  We all have one.  It is an undefined term.  It does 
not mean a thing.  So I simply reflect on the fact that the 
Parliament of Canada, having inserted the words sexual 
orientation in here without a definition, makes it totally 
meaningless. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really does not say to an employer that a person has to be 
helped because of his or her sexual orientation.  We all have 
one.  Like I said, it is meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else in this legislation that frightens me. 
The governor in council may make regulations prescribing 
standards for assessing undue hardship.  The parliamentary 
secretary already said the employer or the landowner must make 
accommodation to help the person overcome this undue hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the regulatory part of government, the part that is not 
debated in this House.  In the next section it says that when 
these standards are prescribed they shall be published in the 
<I>Canada Gazette</I>.  In the next paragraph it says when such a 
proposed regulation has been published in the <I>Canada 
Gazette</I> then there is a time for consultation. If someone has 
a problem with these new regulations they will have an 
opportunity to appear before the committee, or before the 
commission, and to make a presentation and perhaps the 
regulations and the standards can be altered based on an input 
from someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the most bizarre thing, and again this is a little 
flawed.  We have not been able to put in a meaningful amendment 
and get this changed.  It says a proposed regulation need not be 
published more than once whether or not it has been amended as a 
result of any representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious flaw because people, a lot of employers around 
the country, read the <I>Canada Gazette</I>.  That is their 
reference book.  That is how they guide themselves.  That is how 
they know which laws the government has passed and here it says 
that we publish the law in its first form and then it may or may 
not be amended but there is no obligation to publish the amended 
version.  That is wrong.  That is an error because basically we 
could end up changing the law or even rescinding it and not 
properly inform the people.  I have an objection to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says this section applies in respect of a practice regardless 
of whether it results in direct discrimination or adverse effect 
discrimination.  That is a bit of a technical term but it has to 
do with the fact that sometimes we can give certain conditions, 
say for job employment, that would disqualify certain people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone wants to hire a person to drive a bus, implicitly 
that does eliminate anybody who cannot see or hear. So it is a 
discrimination in that sense against the disabled person but I do 
not think anyone in this country, including the people who are 
not able to see or hear, would object to that.  And so that is a 
matter of interpretation.  Where do we actually put it?  Where is 
the line drawn? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says here that it is not a discriminatory practice for a 
person to adopt or carry out a special program in order to help 
those whose disadvantages are in here.  I really have a problem 
with that.  This is under the amendment to the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.  I have a great problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those among us, and the Liberals are in this group, 
who think discrimination is solved by discriminating against 
somebody else.  That is a totally false premise.  They are saying 
that in order to reduce discrimination against, say, a group of a 
certain race, a quota is established that means those people must 
be hired and exclude everyone else.  I really believe that is, 
first of all, an insult to these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been responsible for hiring both as a private 
entrepreneur and also in my job as a supervisor at the college 
where I worked.  I have hired people. 
I tried my utmost to hire based on skills and ability to do the 
job.  When I hired a person to work on our dairy farm I wanted 
that person to have strong hands and strong arms because there is 
a lot of heavy work involved feeding the cows and lugging the 
pails of milk and water and all these things.  That was very 
important. I look for the capability to do the job.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hired a mathematics instructor I looked at the 
qualifications of that person.  Can that person communicate?  Is 
he or she able to teach?  I did not ask their race, gender or any 
other thing.  We have a false premise that says we can correct 
these wrongs by simply discriminating against those who are in 
the majority.  That is a false premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a guy in my constituency office who said “All my life I 
wanted to be in the RCMP.  My dad was in the RCMP, my grandfather 
was. It is something I have really wanted to do as long as I can 
remember”.  Lo and behold he came to my office.  Why? He was 
told do not bother to apply, they are not hiring any of his kind 
right now.  What kind was he?  He happened to be a white adult 
male, intelligent, sharp, physically fit, an excellent quality 
person to work in our very highly esteemed Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police.  They said “Do not even bother to apply because you have 
the wrong colour skin and you have the wrong gender”, both of 
which he could do nothing about.  He was discriminated against. 
There are some who think by doing that they correct other 
discriminations.  Wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way we correct discriminations is by giving everyone an 
equal opportunity to become educated, trained, to work, to get to 
the place where they are the best of the class.  They are the 
ones who will move up and get the jobs they want.  Under those 
conditions this young man would have had the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret my time is up because I got only half way through what 
I wanted to say.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for Etobicoke North, 
Training for young people; the hon. member for Lévis, Rail 
transport; the hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac, Hepatitis C. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to begin by indicating that I am disappointed about two things. 
One is, of course, the small number of MPs present across the 
way.  It is very disappointing, especially since this bill is so 
important to so many of our fellow citizens.  During part of the 
debate, there was only one Liberal present.  That is really 
disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second disappointment is about this government's practice of 
introducing bills in the Senate rather than the House of 
Commons.  The government's legislative measures should be 
introduced and debated in the House of Commons, where the 
elected representatives are found, not in a House of unelected 
members, who are therefore not representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Bill S-5, I will start right off by saying that the Bloc 
Quebecois supports this bill at third reading. 
Its purpose is to enhance the equality rights of the disabled 
and to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the three main objectives of the bill is to amend the 
Canada Evidence Act and the Criminal Code. The amendments to the 
Canada Evidence Act will make it possible to use whatever means 
are necessary to enable a witness who has difficulty giving 
testimony to do so.  This would, for instance, include the use 
of sign language interpreters for hearing impaired people called 
on to testify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also certain amendments to the Criminal Code.  Clause 
2 of the bill creates a new offence, sexual exploitation of a 
person with disability.  This is distinct from the general 
offence of sexual assault, and is in response to demands from a 
number of groups representing the disabled, many of whom we met 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might wonder, however, and I think this is a very legitimate 
point, why the sentence is less severe, being a maximum of five 
years, than in the case of the general offence of sexual assault 
as set out in section 271 of the Criminal Code.  We will see how 
the case law evolves with respect to this new offence, or 
whether charges of sexually assaulting disabled individuals will 
still be tried under the already existing general provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other provisions will finally make it easier for persons with 
disabilities to serve on a jury.  The disabled are full-fledged 
citizens and wish to share fully in the rights and 
responsibilities of any citizen.  Serving on a jury is a good 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore in favour of these amendments, because they 
will improve access to the criminal justice system for persons 
with disabilities, and because they are a response to 
long-standing demands from groups representing the disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn to the Canadian Human Rights Act.  With respect 
to the requirement to accommodate needs, this aspect of the bill 
is the one that has understandably received the most attention, 
both from persons with disabilities and from federal employers. 
We will see how existing case law incorporates this new 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the obligation to accommodate needs will lead to 
better integration of persons with disabilities in federally 
regulated businesses. 
This is what many groups of disabled persons that we met with 
are hoping for and it is a hope shared by the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also hope that interested groups and individuals will become 
actively involved in formulating regulations on the criteria for 
evaluating undue hardship.  No one is in a better position than 
persons with disabilities and employers—rather than technocrats 
in their federal government ivory towers—to establish 
regulations following the passing of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and I will be very brief, because I do not want to go 
on like my colleague before me, I want to speak of the Canadian 
Human Rights Tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At second reading and during consideration in committee, we 
expressed certain reservations about the independence of the 
Canadian Human Rights Tribunal proposed in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is noteworthy that, on February 23, in the matter between 
Bell Canada and the Canadian Telephone Employees Association, 
the federal court found the existing human rights tribunal to be 
unconstitutional because of its lack of independence from the 
Minister of Justice and the Canadian Human Rights Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe Bill S-5 would ensure the tribunal's independence by 
drawing on the provisions governing Quebec's human rights 
tribunal.  Quebec, I would point out, sets the example in this 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the proposed tribunal responds to a number of the 
questions raised by the federal court, and we believe it would 
have greater independence than the existing tribunal.  It would 
be up to the courts and case law to determine whether this is 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will support this bill at third 
reading. 
I now give the floor over to other members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the third reading of Bill S-5.  I am pleased to 
say that the New Democratic Party supports this bill in its third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-5 is an act to amend the Canada Evidence Act and the 
Criminal Code in respect of persons with disabilities, to amend 
the Canadian Human Rights Act in respect of persons with 
disabilities and other matters and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the critic for persons with disabilities for the New 
Democrats I am committed to a legislative process to extend equal 
treatment for the disabled and I see Bill S-5 as a step in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill S-5 the amendments recommended to the Canada Evidence 
Act will allow persons with disabilities to participate more 
fully in the justice process.  For example, in a case where a 
person with a mental disability has the capacity to give evidence 
in court but has difficulty communicating by reason of a 
disability, under Bill S-5 the court may order that the witness 
be permitted to give evidence by a means that enables the 
evidence to be intelligible. This is an important gain for the 
disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court would also be compelled to provide whatever resources 
necessary to assist the person to give evidence, whether it be a 
speech therapist, interpreter or mechanical devices for 
communications purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the amendments for a witness who is sight impaired there 
will be also the opportunity to identify the accused by methods 
other than sight.  For example, when asked in court whether the 
witness can identify the accused in the court room, a sight 
impaired witness would be able to use methods other than sight 
such as voice recognition and scent, and I think these are 
positive additions to the Canada Evidence Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the proposed amendments to the Criminal Code I 
endorse the changes which will extend the protection afforded to 
young people in the courts to persons with disabilities. Although 
I concur with my colleague from the Bloc, I have concerns about 
the lesser penalties for sexual assault for persons with 
disabilities as opposed to non-disabled and this is obviously a 
concern which remains to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I endorse the amendment which provides support for jurors with 
physical disabilities and I support the amendments to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act under Bill S-5 which will work to 
prevent discrimination against persons with disabilities within 
the federal sphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key amendment adds a provision that requires employers and 
service providers to accommodate the needs of persons who are 
protected under the act.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duty to accommodate is a concept viewed by persons with 
disabilities as being essential to their integration and 
inclusion in society.  The concept has been recognized and 
adapted legislatively through all provincial human rights 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Duty to accommodate affects how we work, travel and communicate. 
It affects basically all of the fundamental aspects of social, 
political and economic life for persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 12 years disabled people have been fighting for a 
law that provides duty to accommodate in our federal human rights 
act.  It has taken a long time because government agendas have 
taken precedence over the quality of life of persons with 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present bill represents the perspective of the disabled.  It 
provides for a positive duty to accommodate those with 
disabilities subject to a standard of undue hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undue hardship is defined with respect to health, safety and 
cost.  It is important that undue hardship be defined.  It is 
important to have a human rights policy base for limitations of 
undue hardship that will ensure a meaningful duty to accommodate 
people with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is, however, by no means perfect.  The bill needs to 
include the assurance that the human rights system at the federal 
level is effectively working by ensuring that the training of 
investigators at the commission level happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further review of the human rights act and the human rights 
commission system is also needed.  The process at the present 
time is driven by an individual complaint system and that is 
problematic.  Accessibility complaints usually take two years for 
resolution.  Usually resolution comes in the form of one person's 
complaint being answered.  It does not, however, address the same 
complaint that many others may have across the country.  In other 
words, the bill does not deal with systemic problems.  It is a 
complaint driven process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill S-5 and its gains for persons with 
disabilities has been a long time coming.  There is still a great 
distance to go in closing the equality gap for the disabled in 
this country.  Bill S-5 is a start and I urge that we move 
quickly to pass the bill into legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our duty to accommodate the dreams and the plans of our 
disabled citizens.  They have as much, if not more, to contribute 
to this country as anyone.  For that reason, I am in support 
of this first step. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to follow my colleague from the 
province of Nova Scotia.  I am equally pleased to rise today to 
participate in the debate on Bill S-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, as has been previously mentioned by a number of my 
colleagues, will amend the Canada Evidence Act and the Canadian 
Criminal Code with respect to persons with disabilities.  It will 
also amend the Canadian Human Rights Act with respect to persons 
with disabilities and it will make consequential amendments to a 
number of acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset that like my colleagues in the 
Progressive Conservative Party, and I am sure all members of the 
House, I support this legislation.  This is a classic example of 
non-partisan legislation of which we can be proud.  It reflects a 
spirit that we do not often see in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was adopted by the Senate in December 1997 with one 
major amendment.  That amendment was indeed very important since 
it dealt with the grounds of discrimination prohibited by section 
2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For one reason or another, the original legislation as tabled in 
the Senate did not address all of the grounds of discrimination 
prohibited by the charter.  The Senate's amendment to correct 
that situation was very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this amendment which was passed by our 
colleagues in the neighbouring House was a very positive one and 
I congratulate them for their efforts.  It shows that the Senate 
can, in fact, constructively participate in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, Bill S-5 came before us rectified and consistent 
with all the provisions of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, my last comment on this subject is that the Senate was 
very helpful in passing this bill in an expeditious way.  It 
helped to speed the process that is very important to having this 
piece of legislation in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to my comments with respect to Bill S-5 as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill sets out a very important principle and one which we 
embrace, that is, the attempt to remove the barriers to those who 
want to participate fully in society, and I am specifically 
referring to those with disabilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a good example of circumstances where the principle 
of identical treatment versus equality simply does not always 
work.  For those individuals and groups who are disadvantaged, 
identical treatment does not always lead to equality.  This bill 
addresses that problem and rectifies it by removing 
discriminatory barriers to ensure equality.  I fully support this 
principle and the bill in its entirety.  In general, it is a very 
good piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first deal with the amendments to the Canada Evidence 
Act.  Clause 1 of the bill will make two amendments to this act. 
First it provides for the use of any different means necessary to 
allow a witness who has difficulty communicating by reason of a 
physical disability to give evidence in a court.  For example, 
the use of a sign translator to help a hearing impaired person 
testify is a concrete example of how this section will help 
improve participation for those with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain problems might arise.  With respect to translation, 
there is the question of who would choose the translator.  Would 
they be chosen by the court or would the person suffering the 
hearing disability be permitted to provide a translator?  In the 
context of a criminal trial, I suggest this is very important and 
should be given some specific attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of clause 1 will add section 6(1) to the Canada 
Evidence Act.  This new section would allow witnesses to use any 
sensory means, for example their sense of hearing or smell, to 
identify an accused person.  This would allow a person who is 
visually impaired to participate fully as a witness or 
potentially, and sadly, as a victim in a criminal trial.  It 
would allow them to identify the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had personal experience in a trial where the victim 
suffered head injuries and subsequently lost their sight.  The 
accused was not apprehended until 12 years later, at which time 
the victim was called upon to testify.  In that case there was 
other evidence to consider and there were other witnesses. 
However, that gives a concrete example of how this new amendment 
could effectively improve the current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a whole, these two amendments to the Canada Evidence Act 
represent a step forward with respect to the use and application 
of technology in our courtrooms.  They remove physical barriers 
that are present for some people and encourage full participation 
in our criminal justice system.  The justice system and the 
criminal courtroom itself can often be an intimidating 
environment, and these are positive changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 2 and 8 of Bill S-5 will amend the Criminal Code of 
Canada.  The most important of these clauses will create a new 
criminal offence.  This provision, which will create section 
153.1 of the Criminal Code, recognizes that any person in a 
position of trust or authority who sexually abuses a vulnerable, 
disabled person will be guilty of an indictable offence, 
punishable and liable in prison for a term not exceeding five 
years or guilty of an offence punishable by summary conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parallel can be drawn between this new section 153.1 and the 
section relating to sexual violence against children, the current 
section 153, which also constitutes an offence.  In essence, it 
is designed to protect a specific and more vulnerable segment of 
our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first, although I had some reservations that this new section 
was not strong enough because it results in an offence punishable 
by a maximum of only five years, it is important to identify 
specifically the need to protect those with physical and mental 
disabilities.  Such an offence is a morally reprehensible act. 
The Criminal Code should reflect society's revulsion of such an 
act.  That is why I had the initial reservations with respect to 
the maximum sentence being only five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the new section sends an excellent message to those in 
the population who engage in such horrific activities.  It 
creates a new specific criminal offence to address that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also indicate that I was pleased to see that the 
government decided to remove the word “invite” from the 
description of the offences and replace it by the stronger words 
“counsels” or “incites”.  This I believe is intellectually 
sound and it makes the offence a much more precise one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to indicate that I support this new section and the 
changes to the Criminal Code.  I hope it is not going to be used 
frequently.  As a former crown prosecutor, I think what I would 
tend to suggest is that the current section 271, which refers to 
sexual assault for anyone, is much broader and calls for a 
stronger sentence of ten years as opposed to five.  The crown 
attorneys of the land are going to have to make those individual 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 4 to 7 of the bill also modify the Criminal Code and 
make it easier for a person with a disability to serve on a jury. 
Accommodation must be made to enable a disabled person to then be 
selected as a juror to fulfil their important civic 
responsibility, although I must say in my experience that I have 
seen many Canadians who, sadly, reflected an indication that they 
did not want to be on a jury.  But this at least opens that door 
for those with disabilities who want full participation in our 
justice system.  Again it sends an important message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 authorizes video testimony for disabled individuals who 
have difficulty communicating directly during a proceeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes in the Criminal Code I believe are designed 
specifically for those with disabilities.  The changes will 
enable them to have full access to our justice system, which is 
something that organizations for the disabled have been long 
calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final remarks will address the changes to the Canadian Human 
Rights Tribunal which Bill S-5 in essence creates by virtue of 
the legislation.  The creation of a tribunal specializing in 
human rights is certainly welcome and one that has invoked great 
response and is embraced by members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian human rights area is an increasingly complex one 
and one that has certainly been very litigious over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise some concerns, however, about this 
tribunal, and previous members have spoken of these concerns. 
For example, the Minister of Justice under the legislation will 
have a great deal of discretionary power and measures to allow 
them to intervene or to invoke disciplinary measures on members 
of the tribunal.  The fact that the minister can be so directly 
involved certainly might raise some concerns about the 
independence of the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 485 also brings forward a concern and that is with 
respect to the necessity that full time members of the tribunal 
reside in the national capital region.  This, on its face, 
appears to be some form of regional discrimination.  Certainly 
there are people throughout the land who are competent to sit on 
the tribunal.  There are competent individuals throughout Canada 
and I would suggest this is again something that might be 
re-thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also regret that the motion put forward by my colleague in the 
Bloc did not pass at the committee level.  That motion proposed 
that it be mandatory for a member of a tribunal who is coming to 
the end of his or her appointed term to continue to the end of a 
particular hearing.  That is to say, if they were scheduled to 
depart and a tribunal hearing had begun, they would be permitted 
to finish the tribunal hearing.  I believe this is something 
again which could be modified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will refer specifically to the Canadian Human Rights 
Act and note that clause 14 of the bill, which will modify 
section 14 of the Canadian Human Right Act, specifically adds an 
anti-retaliation clause to the act.  I believe this is something 
that is extremely important which did not exist previous to this 
legislation.  An anti-retaliation clause means, in essence, that 
a person who files a complaint cannot then be open to retaliation 
or threat of retaliation by a defendant.  This again is an 
improvement over the current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada support this 
legislation.  We have always been generally supportive of changes 
to the criminal justice system for persons with disabilities and 
I believe that persons with disabilities in Canada will embrace 
the legislation and benefit greatly from it.  It promotes the 
expansion of access to our justice system and it promotes and 
expands access to the courts which in many cases can be very 
intimidating for both victims and members of the public 
generally. 
The jury system will benefit from this and the criminal justice 
system generally will benefit.  It also clearly expands human 
rights in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-244, an act to amend the Income Tax Act and the Canada Pension 
Plan (transfer of income to spouse), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this bill is dedicated to my 16 year old 
daughter Whitney who said to me that the bill made so much 
sense the government should just do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of Dr. Benjamin Spock, despite all the hard work, 
taking care of children and seeing them grow up to be fine young 
people gives most parents their greatest satisfaction in life. 
Intuitively he recognized the linkage between early childhood 
development and healthy adult outcomes.  Today scientific 
research has proved that linkage and sent out a powerful message 
calling on governments to invest in children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-244 is as much a health bill as it is a taxation bill. It 
proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to permit income splitting 
between spouses where one of them chooses to provide direct 
parental care in the home to their preschool children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first introduced this bill in the House of Commons on October 
5, 1994 and laid out the substantive reasons why investing in 
children was both a fiscal and a social policy imperative. 
Research not only sustains that assertion but also provides 
compelling evidence that the quality of care during the formative 
years is one of the most important determinations of lifelong 
physical, mental and social health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recognize the importance of societal contribution of 
providing direct parental care this bill seeks to provide a tax 
break to families by allowing one spouse to pay the other through 
income splitting. As a consequence, the stay at home spouse would 
also be eligible to earn Canada pension plan benefits and both 
jobs and child care spaces would be freed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past I have also proposed other tax breaks such as the 
establishment of a caregiver tax credit or the converting of the 
child care expense deduction to a non-refundable tax credit and 
extending it to families with a stay at home parent. 
Regardless of the approach, the common feature is effectively to 
invest in the quality of early childhood care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to economic considerations, even the most 
conservative estimates of savings on health, social programs and 
criminal justice costs are $2 return for every $1 invested.  It 
has not been until recently that researchers discovered just how 
significantly early childhood experiences affect the outcomes of 
our children.  As such, the estimated potential economic return 
is likely understated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1994 before the standing committee on health Dr. 
Fraser Mustard, founder of the Canadian Institute for Advanced 
Research, presented substantive evidence that childhood outcomes 
were not a question of being rich or poor but rather of other 
factors related to the quality of care during the formative 
years.  He also referred to the comprehensive research conducted 
by the Carnegie task force on meeting the needs of youth and 
children which was published in its 1994 report entitled 
“Starting Points”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its researched observed that good physical and mental health, 
the ability to learn, to cope with stress, to relate well with 
others and to have a positive outlook were all rooted in the 
earliest experiences of life. They concluded that where, how and 
with whom children spend their early years of life are the most 
important determinants of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize some of the key findings of the Carnegie 
research.  At birth the brain is far from fully formed.  In the 
days and weeks that follow vital neural connections called 
synapses form among the brain cells and create maps or pathways 
along which learning will take place.  The first three years are 
crucial in establishing these connections and it is estimated 
that 80% of the lifetime development of the human brain takes 
place at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The synapses do not, however, form automatically. Babies need 
food for their brains as well as their bodies, but not just good 
physical nourishment. They also need loving, responsive 
caregiving. They need to see light and movement, to hear voices 
and above all to be touched and held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we conceive of the brain as the most powerful computer 
imaginable, the child's surroundings act like a keyboard 
inputting experience.  The computer comes with so much memory 
capacity that during the first three years it could store enough 
information that an army of people could input during that time. 
What sets the brain apart from the electronic computer is its 
fragile and ongoing relationship to the world around it.  With 
proper stimulation brain synapses will form at a rapid pace, 
reaching adult levels by age two.  By the end of three or four 
years the pace of learning slows because the synapses begin to 
wither away. Synapses that are not used are destroyed forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of nutrition, caregiving and stimulation that a 
child receives determines not only the number of these 
connections or synapses but also how they are wired for both 
cognitive and emotional intelligence.  As with cognitive 
intelligence, the development of emotional intelligence appears 
to hinge on the interplay between biology and early experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How infants are held, touched, fed, spoken to and gazed at seem 
to be the key to laying down the brain's mechanisms that will 
govern feelings and behaviour.  On the other hand, an adverse 
environment can compromise a young child's brain functions and 
overall development, placing him or her at greater risk of 
developing a variety of cognitive, behavioural and physical 
difficulties.  In some cases these effects may be irreversible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers have concluded that the incredible pace of learning 
in the early years will never again be attained in later years. 
Therefore if the brain development is slow at the beginning 
playing catch-up is vastly more difficult and costly in terms of 
personal sacrifice and social resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1997 the Carnegie research was further corroborated by 
studies presented at the White House conference on early 
childhood development.  The principal finding was that the 
neurological foundations for rational thinking, problem solving 
and general reasoning appear to be established by age one. The 
studies also found that spoken language has an astonishing impact 
on an infant's brain development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the number of words an infant hears each day from 
an attentive engaged adult is the single most important predictor 
of later intelligence, school success and social competence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study suggests that infants need not only a loving but also 
a talkative and articulate caregiver and that a more verbal 
family will increase the child's chances of positive health and 
social outcomes.  The results further suggest that the period 
from birth to three years is so critical that parents actually 
play a more critical role in the child's intellectual development 
than teachers will at school.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They also reported that before birth genes predominantly direct 
how the brain establishes basic wiring patterns.  Neurons grow 
and travel into distinct neighbourhoods waiting for further 
instructions.  After birth, however, environmental factors 
predominate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further support for this research occurred in the fall of 1997 
at the international conference of the Society of Neuroscience. 
Researchers reported that parental care makes such a lasting 
impression on an infant that maternal separation or neglect can 
profoundly affect the brain's biochemistry with lifelong 
consequences for growth and mental ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children raised without being regularly hugged, caressed or 
stroked were found to have abnormally high levels of stress 
hormones.  Although scientists have reported for decades that 
maternal deprivation can cause serious behavioural problems, 
researchers now find that neglect can warp the brain's neuro 
circuits, leading to higher levels of stress which can impair 
growth and development of the brain and the body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These studies have all been well accepted by the world's leading 
child development experts. On April 23, 1998 the Canadian 
Institute of Child Health also announced its concurrence with the 
research to date.  In a booklet entitled <I>The First Years 
Last Forever</I> it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At birth the brain is remarkably unfinished. The parts of the 
brain that handle thinking and remembering, as well as emotional 
and social behaviour, are very underdeveloped. The fact that the 
brain matures in the world, rather than in the womb, means that 
young children are deeply affected by their early experiences. 
Their relationships with parents and other important caregivers, 
the sights, sounds, smells and feelings they experience, the 
challenges they meet, do not influence just their moods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These experiences actually affect the way children's brains 
become “wired”.  In other words, early experiences help 
determine brain structure, thus shaping the way people learn, 
think and behave for the rest of their lives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the overall concerns of the institute is as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youngest children and their families are in a 
quiet crisis.  The crisis is jeopardizing our children's healthy 
development, undermines school readiness, and ultimately 
threatens our economy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, it also concludes that more attention must be paid 
to the quality of care during the first three years of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other significant support comes from the national forum on 
health which issued its report early in 1997.  One of its major 
concerns related to early childhood development: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence suggests that deprivation during early childhood can 
impair brain development and permanently hinder the development 
of cognition and speech.  The impact on children's physical and 
mental health is significant and can only be partially offset by 
interventions later in life.  The environment in which children 
are raised affects not only the number of brain cells and 
connections but also how they are `wired' which, in turn, 
influences their competence and coping skills. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forum concluded there was an urgent need to invest in 
children and stated that failure to invest in the early years of 
life increases the remedial cost of health, education, social 
services and criminal justice costs.  It also noted that children 
who are poor have more sickness, chronic illness, higher rates of 
injuries, more severe injuries and higher rates of death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forum states that while it firmly believes the primary 
responsibility for raising children lies with parents, it is in 
our collective interest to ensure the well-being of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to financial support, the forum pointed out that 
Canada is the only western industrialized country that does not 
take into the cost of raising children in the family home when 
determining how much tax families with children should pay 
compared to those without children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its interim discussion paper the forum went so far as to say 
that the Income Tax Act discriminates against families with 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its final report the forum recommended greater horizontal 
equity for families with children by reducing their overall tax 
burden to reflect our commitment to ensure that every child has 
an opportunity to realize its full potential.  In relation to 
horizontal equity, the gravest social injustice of all time has 
to be the abandonment of the stay at home parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Managing the family home and caring for preschool children 
continues to be in my view the most important job in the world. 
It is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for 
its valuable contribution to our society.  It is unpaid work but 
it is vital work which deserves to be compensated, and that is 
the point of Bill C-244. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the question of parental preferences for caring for 
children.  A 1997 Compass Research survey conducted in Alberta 
found that 95% of respondents felt that it was best for infants 
and preschoolers to be cared for by a parent. 
An earlier Canada-wide poll conducted by Decima Research found 
that 70% of parents of preschool children where both parents 
worked would prefer to have one of them provide direct parental 
care in the home if they could afford it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should a parent have to choose between the job that they need 
and the child that they love?  Norway for example says no and 
announced that starting in August 1998 the government will pay 
$570 a month per child under three years of age where one parent 
provides direct parental care in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research evidence is irrefutable.  The first years do last 
forever in terms of physical, mental and social health, but also 
in terms of societal health.  The 1996 longitudinal survey on 
children and youth showed that 25% of Canadian children enter 
adult life with significant emotional, behavioural, academic or 
social problems.  According to Dr. Steinhauer of Voices for 
Children, with one in four children entering adult life 
significantly handicapped, we can look forward to a society that 
will be less able to generate the economic base required to 
supply the social supports and services needed by one in four 
adults who are unable to carry their own weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet the needs of children in a diverse society, the 
preferred strategy is to provide flexibility, options and choices 
so that parents can determine the best possible care for their 
children. Given the clear linkage between the quality of care of 
children and lifelong health, we all stand to benefit by 
investing in children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1994 economic statement the finance minister acknowledged 
that linkage when he asserted that “good fiscal policy makes 
good social policy, and good social policy makes good fiscal 
policy”.  Now that we are well under way to restoring Canada's 
fiscal health, the time is right to invest in the health and 
social well-being of Canadians in order to secure our fiscal 
health over the long term.  In that context let there be no doubt 
that investment in early childhood development represents our 
best opportunity for sustainable returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons I strongly encourage the Government of 
Canada to make investing in children a principal theme in its 
next federal budget.  Within that envelope, consideration should 
be given to initiatives to address among other things parenting 
education, prenatal nutrition, fetal alcohol syndrome, early 
childhood development, community based child programs, and 
taxation of families with children.  These are but a few elements 
of a pro child policy that will help to ensure not only the 
development of healthy children but also of a healthy country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to say a few words on the private members' bill put forth today 
by my good friend from Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I compliment him on the work he has done on this issue 
over the last few years.  I thank him for the copy of his book. 
He has put a lot of work into this issue. We should all commend 
him for the extra parliamentary hours he puts into this very 
worthwhile issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member remembers that back in November 1990 Ed 
Broadbent was retiring as leader of the federal New Democratic 
Party.  The last speech he made in the House as leader was one in 
which he talked about a need to eradicate poverty among children. 
I remember that very well.  He was sitting about three or four 
seats over to my right.  He made that speech. There was general 
consensus in the House of Commons that it was a very laudable 
objective which we should strive for in the next decade. That 
decade is almost over.  We have less than two years to go before 
the new millennium and we probably have more child poverty now 
than we did in 1990.  We have regressed rather than progressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a sad commentary on our country, a country with 
tremendous wealth and tremendous abundant resources. We are 
extremely fortunate that our country has all these resources.  It 
is like a beautiful necklace of jewels and gold, the resources 
that are here in this country. Yet we cannot organize it in terms 
of public policy to make sure we bring children out of poverty 
and give them an opportunity and a chance.  That has to be a very 
laudable goal and a very laudable objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree fully with the member across the way that 
investing in children should be an objective not just of this 
parliament but for all of us in Canada, the provincial 
legislatures, the Parliament of Canada, the municipalities and 
likewise because the future of the country is our children.  If 
we do not invest in opportunities for young people, we are going 
to have more crime, more unhappiness, more unhealthiness and more 
social problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are laudable goals and objectives.  The member certainly 
has his heart in the right place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the specific amendment to the tax act 
and the Canada pension plan.  Again his heart is in the right 
place but I have some questions on whether or not this is the 
only area that we should move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will enable a taxpayer to make a tax contribution to the 
Canada pension plan on behalf of a non-income earning spouse. 
More often that would be the female rather than the male. If we 
looked at this economically and ran it through a computer model, 
we would find that this bill would benefit only a small segment 
of our population, mainly the higher income part of our 
population. That is the part of the population which may have one 
spouse working and can afford to contribute into a tax benefit 
program in the Canada pension plan on behalf of the other spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is comprised in part of the inner city of Regina where 
there are a lot of low income folks.  In those kinds of homes 
where only one person is working, probably nine times out of ten, 
maybe 99 times out of 100, the spouse cannot afford to make a 
contribution, tax credit or not, to the Canada pension plan of 
the other spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit like the spousal RRSP which is a very good idea for 
people who can afford it.  It has helped a lot of people and we 
do not deny that. We are not saying that we should tear it apart. 
But when we look at the facts, we find that the spousal RRSP 
helps in a great preponderance of cases the higher income people 
who can afford to make that contribution. Someone who 
hypothetically makes $80,000, $100,000 or $200,000 a year, and 
whose spouse is not working can easily afford to maximize his or 
her own RRSP contributions and then maximize the spousal RRSP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the change in the Income Tax Act as proposed by my friend 
from Mississauga South, they could max out in terms of the 
taxable contribution to the CPP on behalf of the spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the problems I have with the bill before the 
House today.  I suppose the bill would have been more equitable 
back in the 1950s and 1960s when there was a greater 
preponderance of one wage earner households, back in the days of 
Archie Bunker and <I>Leave it to Beaver</I> when the only person 
working in the family was the male.  In those days it would have 
covered a wider sweep of the population.  Again it does not mean 
the member's heart is not in the right place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have as alternatives?  The main alternative is to 
make our pension system more progressive and more encompassing to 
cover a broader sweep of people. Instead we now have a federal 
government which for new seniors, for people who have turned 60 
after December 31, 1995, wants to abolish the old age pension, 
the guaranteed income supplement and the tax credit for seniors 
and replace them with what is called the seniors benefit. The 
seniors benefit will be determined by a means test.  In other 
words it is going back to the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s before we 
had universal old age pensions.  The pensions are taxed back from 
the wealthier people based on a progressive taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current old age pension is a monthly pension that most 
Canadians are entitled to.  Those benefits are taxed. They 
disappear for single seniors whose incomes are higher than 
$85,000 a year.  If they make over $85,000 a year, there is a 
claw back.  This was brought in in the Mulroney days.  The old 
age pension is taken back by the government.  For a couple, that 
pension disappears after they earn more than $170,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a progressive scale here.  Everybody is entitled to it 
but the more money you make, the less you get.  When a single 
person makes $85,000 a year, they stop getting the old age 
pension. 
When a couple makes $170,000 a year, then they receive no old age 
pension.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, there is a guaranteed income supplement. It 
is a supplementary benefit that is not taxed and is there for 
only the low income old age pension recipients. A poor person in 
this country, and I represent a lot of them in the city centre 
and small towns in my riding, can receive the maximum guaranteed 
income supplement along with the old age pension.  The GIS is not 
taxable but the OAS is taxable.  It is a fair system.  It is a 
progressive system that is geared to helping those who are the 
most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably what is happening is that this system is going to be 
abolished.  We are going back to the past. There will be a means 
test.  People who make a few dollars will not receive an old age 
pension or the seniors benefit while those who make a few less 
dollars will receive part of the seniors benefit.  Starting from 
dollar one, a person will be judged as to whether or not they 
qualify for the seniors benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the concern I have with some of the details of the bill 
we are talking about today.  The member is going in the right 
direction in terms of his heart and is being very thoughtful, but 
again I think we could put the money into a more progressive 
pension system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, this House just recently voted on the 
Canada pension plan.  It made it a more regressive plan.  It 
upped the premiums by 73% over six years.  It cut down what 
people will receive from the plan during that same period of 
time.  It particularly hit widows and people on CPP disability, 
again going in a regressive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad commentary to have those things happen from a 
Liberal government that at one time had a proud heritage of being 
compassionate, caring and progressive in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member from Hamilton across the way hanging his head 
in shame at the regressiveness.  This government is more 
conservative than Brian Mulroney back in the 1980s.  It is no 
wonder the member from Hamilton is hanging his head in shame. He 
used to be a progressive Liberal. Now he is to the right of Brian 
Mulroney in destroying the old age pension in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Before the hon. member gets all exercised, I just want him to 
know that I am working on facts here and that in fact the 
benefits received by seniors are not means tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Hon. members will 
know that is certainly not a point of order.  It is probably a 
point of debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on Bill C-244, which was introduced by my 
colleague for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would enable a taxpayer to transfer part of his or her 
income to a spouse who remained at home to rear children, to 
enable this person to make contributions to the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this bill is a praiseworthy one, greater financial 
independence at retirement age for whichever spouse remained at 
home to look after children.  I say spouse, but generally 
speaking that person is still the wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The logic behind Bill C-244 is the following: a worker would be 
authorized to transfer part of his income to his spouse on his 
income tax return.  For application of the Canada Pension Plan 
Act, the income thus transferred would be considered income from 
self-employment.  For the recipient, would this self-employed 
status confer the tax deductions related to self-employment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If so, the stay-at-home spouse would pay both CPP contributions, 
the employer and the employee share, which would entitle her to 
a larger pension upon reaching retirement age.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make such a transfer, the couple must have a child 
who is not attending school full time, and the couple must not, 
of course, claim child care expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where my first criticism comes in.  Is this not a way of 
using the wife as a tax shelter?  The societal view behind this 
bill is that women are at home looking after children.  There is 
an obvious risk that the male partner may ask his female partner 
to stay home and look after the children, in order to take 
advantage of this tax measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This view is contrary to a modern family policy aimed at 
improving women's autonomy and their participation in the labour 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family policy put forward by Quebec, with a day care system 
for children over the age of three at $5 a day, and the 
additional social assistance provided by Newfoundland for day 
care expenses are cases in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every major report on women and the labour market released since 
the 1970 report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women 
in Canada emphasized the fact that child care is an essential 
service if women are to participate fully in the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second criticism is the following: What about individual 
autonomy, especially that of women? There is a risk that the 
income transfer will take place on the tax return only, making 
the woman dependent on her husband. 
This is a backward approach that makes no sense at a time when 
the income of EI and welfare recipients is being cut to 
encourage them to go back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, it would be unfair not only from a tax point of view 
but also for single parent families, most of which are headed by 
women who have to put their children in day care so they can go 
to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that women re-entering the labour market would 
rather rely on a family policy adapted to their needs like the 
one in Quebec than lose their autonomy and be subsidized to stay 
at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this tax measure will cost the federal government in 
terms of lost tax revenues. 
Instead of sinking money in such a controversial measure, the 
federal government should transfer to the provinces the money 
they are entitled to and let them implement a family policy 
suited to the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to rise to debate Bill C-244.  I commend my hon. 
colleague from Mississauga South who is probably the most 
distinguished champion of fairness for families in the tax code. 
He has a noble record of promoting the importance of family in 
Canadian public policy as the basic institution of our society. 
This bill is one more effort to his credit.  It follows on the 
successful passage of his private member's Motion No. 33 in the 
previous parliament which also sought to change the treatment of 
two parent families under the income tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and most of my colleagues from the official opposition support 
the intention of this bill.  As a general rule I oppose proposed 
amendments to the Income Tax Act because I believe our 1,300 page 
tax code is too complex as it is. 
I believe in principle that tax policy ought to be neutral with 
respect to the choices that people make and that it ought not to 
be a vehicle for social or economic engineering or central 
planning. To a very large extent I would submit that the present 
tax code has become precisely that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mississauga South and I have had, and I am 
sure will continue to have, many provocative debates about the 
advisability of adopting a flat tax model which would replace the 
1,300 page tax code and the several hundred pages of attendant 
regulations with a simple, pure, neutral and clean flat tax 
system. That is what I would prefer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other night I voted against the private member's bill of one 
of my colleagues, a bill which sought to provide for the 
deductibility of mortgage interest payments for the principal 
residence of taxpayers.  I oppose measures of this nature in 
principle.  I seek to remove the complexity from the tax code, 
not add to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the current tax code in all its complexity is 
scandalously weighted against the most important institution in 
society and that is the natural family, the nuclear family, the 
traditional family, call it what we will, apply whatever 
adjective we want.  The fact is the best social program is a 
strong family.  The best school and day care is a strong family. 
The best day care workers and teachers are good parents who have 
time to spend with their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long legislators, bureaucrats and regulators have sought 
to diminish the role of that nuclear family.  We have done so by 
creating a tax code which actively discriminates against the 
choices of many families that opt to have one of two parents stay 
at home to raise their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mississauga South gave what I thought was 
insightful background data on the remarkable importance of 
parental bonding in the rearing of children in their early years. 
It almost could be taken as a given that the more parental 
contact there is in the early years of childhood, the better the 
child rearing experience, the better the child is as he or she 
matures, the better the family is, the better society is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to seek at the very least to create a tax code which 
treats families that seek to maximize their time with their 
children neutrally or at the very least, as someone proposed, we 
ought to make amendments to the tax code to positively 
discriminate in favour of such families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current tax code there are no provisions for income 
splitting.  There are no provisions which recognize that millions 
of Canadian two parent families give up a second income, forgo 
that extra household revenue in order to make the economic 
sacrifices necessary to spend more time with their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do those families get in return from the tax system?  They 
get utterly no recognition of making what is a responsible, I 
would argue the most responsible, social and familial choice.  In 
fact, if families choose, as many do for legitimate and 
understandable reasons, to contract the services of a third party 
day care provider, the government says they are permitted to 
write the costs of those third party child care expenses off 
against their taxes through the child care tax deduction.  What 
this does in effect is force the one income two parent family to 
subsidize through its taxes the choices of two income families 
that opt to raise their children through third party day care. 
This is completely irrational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly feel for the many hundreds of thousands of families that 
feel this discrimination every day and are frustrated by it.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-244 would seek to mitigate part of this unfairness by 
permitting one spouse to deduct payments from another spouse for 
the raising of children at home.  This would essentially allow 
families to contract for child care services in the house as 
opposed to doing it as a third party contract with some profit or 
non-profit day care operator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A wife who works in the workforce can say to the husband “You 
are going to be my day care provider for our children.  I am 
going to pay you to stay at home to raise the children and you 
are not going to be penalized”, or vice versa.  It does not 
matter which gender is involved.  What matters is the principle 
that families ought not to be discriminated against for making 
choices they believe are right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign as I went around my broadly middle 
class constituency with many young families, I found no issue 
that resonated more strongly with many of my constituents than 
the need for tax fairness for those families.  These measures 
would go a long way toward providing that kind of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could use this opportunity to make an advertisement for the 
policy proposed by the Reform Party in this respect, we have 
proposed converting the child care tax deduction into a 
refundable credit that would be available to all families, to all 
parents.  This refundable credit would, in a sense, be a subsidy 
for low income families that currently cannot take advantage of 
the deduction because many families do not have sufficient income 
against which to apply the deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A refundable credit would provide recognition of the at home 
child care implicit expenses of many low income families.  They 
would get a credit for it and families all the way up the income 
scale would get the same kind of recognition which they now are 
denied unless they pay for third party child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of this House surely must recognize that for too 
long we have allowed our laws to discriminate against the basic 
institution of our society.  It is time to act.  For too long too 
many governments, this government, the preceding government and 
the government before that, built up a tax code that made the 
wrong choices about families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know many members here agree with me.  It is time for us to 
work together in a non-partisan way to see that legislation like 
Bill C-244 is enacted so that we can allow Canadian families to 
make the choices they believe are best for their children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise today to speak on behalf of 
Progressive Conservatives and all Canadians on Bill C-244. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I commend the member for Mississauga South on this 
initiative and on his hard work and diligence in representing and 
seeking solutions and assistance in visionary policy on behalf of 
Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, the importance of child friendly policies are 
absolutely essential, especially as we enter the 21st century as 
a knowledge based global society.  I think it has never been more 
important than now to invest in our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some difficulty with the complicated nature of the 
changes to the tax code.  I would echo some of the comments of my 
hon. colleague from the Reform Party on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, today millions of Canadians are filing their 
income tax returns and millions of Canadians have hired 
accountants and tax lawyers to enable them to effectively liaise 
with their own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an affront to a democratic society that in an 
industrialized nation with a high rate of education, Canadians 
need to hire professionals just to deal with their own 
governments on something as fundamental as paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that we definitely need to simplify the tax code and 
the size of the tax code.  I studied taxation law at university 
and got a finance degree.  The tax code is egregiously 
complicated. 
I have some difficulty with any measure that serves to further 
complicate the tax code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do respect the premise under which the member for Mississauga 
South brings forward this legislation.  If one parent wishes to 
stay at home in a family during the formative years of their 
child's upbringing I do not believe they should be penalized by 
the tax code, which currently is clearly the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested also to learn that the hon. member has brought 
forward other proposals, including the conversion of the child 
care expense deduction into a non-refundable tax credit and 
extended it to families with a stay at home parent.  I believe 
that is the kind of policy that would be less complicating 
potentially than the current legislation we are discussing but 
would have a similar impact.  I think the important thing is that 
the intent and the impact is very sound.  Again we are supportive 
of that intent and that potential impact of tax policy that will 
reduce the disincentive currently for families that are trying to 
do the right thing and look after their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with tax policy, like so many public policies, is 
the law of unintended consequences.  When we have, as my hon. 
colleague from the Reform Party has pointed out, a tax code of 
1,300 pages it does bring to light the fact that there are a lot 
of unintended consequences with a tax code that complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week in the finance committee we are studying Bill C-36 
regarding the creation of the millennium scholarship fund. One of 
the witnesses was David Stager, an economics profession at the 
University of Toronto.  He stated unequivocally that adequate 
support in a child's formative years has a far greater social and 
economic impact than funding later in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An investment in preschool education, particularly prior to age 
three, will provide society with a better return on that 
investment than an investment in primary education.  An 
investment in primary education will provide society with a 
better return on investment than an investment in secondary 
education.  An investment in secondary education will provide a 
better return on investment than an investment in post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when we are committing $2.5 billion worth of Canadian 
taxpayer funds to the millennium scholarship fund I think it is 
time that we really worked together in the House to develop 
solutions similar to what the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca has suggested in head start programs, for instance, which 
are designed to reach out to high risk children who are most 
vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the studies that was conducted in the United States 
accounts for the result that $1 invested in children in high risk 
situations up to age 3 will provide society with a return of $7, 
I believe, by age 25, if one combines employment insurance costs, 
welfare costs, if one considers the costs of the judicial system, 
the police and the penal system, all the things that occur 
because children are neglected up to age 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely essential that we develop some way either 
through tax policy, and that is one alternative—I respect the 
hon. member for Mississauga South for bringing light on this 
issue—or through direct programs that would be designed to 
effect change in that area.  Perhaps it is time for us in the 
House to look at a national head start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own preference when I am talking about tax policy is to 
simplify the Canadian tax code and thus make it fairer.  Not 
necessarily reducing all taxes but reducing some of the absolute 
gross unfairness that exists in the Canadian tax code.  I believe 
that if we do simplify the tax code and we do make the tax code 
essentially what it should be in the first place, a revenue 
generating vehicle and not a vehicle for social engineering, we 
can then use social policy to invest strategically in those areas 
where Canadians need investment most.  One of those areas might 
be a national head start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the hon. member across the House who just asked if I filed my 
return, no, but I will be shortly.  It is so complicated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head start program that is currently in Moncton, New 
Brunswick was modelled after similar programs in Hawaii and 
Michigan.  These programs do not address the economic situation 
of the parents as much as they address the social aspect and the 
interplay between the parent and the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern with some of Bill C-244 is that it does have the 
potential to benefit some families, depending on incomes, 
significantly more than other families.  I would favour, for 
instance, the member's earlier initiative of the tax credit.  I 
think that is far fairer in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge this House to continue to work in a multi-partisan way to 
develop solutions.  When we hear a member of the Reform Party 
talking about a head start program, I think that is very 
positive.  When I see a member of the Liberal Party developing 
policies relative to the task, I see that we are all looking for 
the same end although we may differ on the means. However, I 
suggest we continue this dialogue and continue to develop, 
debate, discuss and implement policies that will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are again concerned about further complicating the tax code. 
There is a strong argument to be made that there is a current 
punitive treatment of families trying to do the right thing for 
their families.  Perhaps that playing field needs to be levelled 
in the short term.  Tax reform of this nature is better than no 
tax reform at all.  However, let us keep our eye on the ball for 
the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best policies in the long term involve a simpler, fairer and 
less complicated tax code which benefits all Canadians and a 
government that is not afraid to invest strategically in the 
needs that face Canadians as we enter the 21st century at a time 
when it is more important than ever in a global knowledge based 
society that our young people are provided with the best 
opportunities in the world, that we have a society that is not 
only prosperous but fair, that the equality of opportunity is not 
just a phrase but a fact in Canada and that we are not having 
debates on child poverty in this House 10 years from now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to first take this 
opportunity to applaud my colleague, the member for Mississauga 
South, for the dedication and effort he has put into this and 
other bills which are ultimately aimed at this country's greatest 
asset, our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say this government is placing a priority on 
supporting Canadian children and Canadian families.  The current 
income tax system attempts to strike a balance between treating 
all individuals the same and considering different family 
circumstances.  As a result, taxes are collected largely on the 
basis of individual income, treating individuals as equals in 
assessing their ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the tax system recognizes that family 
circumstances affect ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's Bill C-244 appears to be aimed at putting in 
place further recognition of family circumstances by providing 
additional measures in support of families with children and a 
stay at home spouse.  I appreciate the principles behind this 
bill. Indeed the tax system already includes a large number of 
measures that recognize and help alleviate the extra financial 
responsibilities of families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the current personal income tax system allows the 
transfer of unused, non-refundable credits from a lower income to a 
higher income spouse in order to lower overall family tax 
burdens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not certain that the benefits of this bill are distributed 
widely enough given the high costs of this measure.  Only about 
975,000 one earner families with children would benefit under 
this proposal.  This represents about 8% of Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the total cost of this measure would be 
approximately $1.2 billion in reduced federal income taxes and a 
further $800 million in reduced provincial taxes for a total of 
over $2 billion.  In my judgment this is too expensive given the 
small number of beneficiaries. 
For example, the $2 billion total cost of Bill C-244 would be 
enough to increase the child tax benefit which was received by 
over three million Canadian families with children by about $350 
per child.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I share the goals put forward by my colleague in Bill 
C-244 of ensuring that Canadian families with children are 
supported by the tax system, the specific provisions of the bill 
are not the best way to accomplish this.  It would be 
administratively complex for both government, employers and 
individual taxpayers.  It would distribute benefits too narrowly 
given its $2 billion price tag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current individual based tax system achieves a good balance 
between equity and administrative efficiency for the vast 
majority of taxpayers.  The current tax system already contains a 
number of measures that recognize the special circumstances faced 
by families, the child tax benefit and GST credits, married and 
equivalent to married credits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure my colleague from Mississauga South this government 
will continue to work with him and as a government on improving 
the benefits the current system delivers to Canadian families in 
a fair, efficient and effective manner as the fiscal situation 
permits. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss in not 
congratulating the member for Mississauga South for his 
continuous work in this area.  I take great pride having a member 
in the House who touches the hearts of all members in an area of 
expertise that he is devoted to and continually brings to the 
attention of the House.  This is an area of democracy that brings 
home to us the importance a member like the member for 
Mississauga South can have.  He has made Canadians aware of this 
area.  He has allowed members to discuss properly and with 
decorum a matter that is very close to Canadians.  I congratulate 
the member for Mississauga South. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank all my hon. colleagues who spoke on Bill C-244.  I 
appreciate their kind words.  As a member of parliament, it can 
only help to encourage members to continue to work hard to 
resolve some of these issues.  I want all members to know that 
I'll be back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will respond quickly to a couple of points that were raised. 
The NDP member suggested there seemed to be something for some 
people but not for others.  He is quite right.  The bill does 
focus on the middle class.  The member should remember that the 
child tax benefit is only for low income Canadians who make under 
$25,000 in family income.  The middle income earners really do 
not qualify for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the child care expense deduction is available 
for families where both parents work, but it is not available for 
those who provide care in the home to their own children.  What 
is really left out here is the unpaid work, that vital work of 
providing care to children, and it is the stay at home parent who 
does this.  At a time when home based businesses are becoming 
more prevalent there may be some more opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc member suggested there is an expense and that we should 
be careful about spending a lot of money.  There is not just an 
expense but an investment that would result in lower health care 
costs, social program costs and criminal justice costs.  We have 
to look at investing in the longer term to secure our long term 
fiscal health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Conservative and Reform members talked about the tax 
code.  Surely we will be moving toward tax reform. I hope we will 
get the process started in this parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the childcare expense deduction, $7,000 for a 
preschool child, high income earners where both are working will 
get a tax refund of $3,500.  A low income earner would only get a 
tax refund of $1,750, all other things remaining equal.  That 
means that someone who is paying $7,000 for childcare gets $1,750 
more back if they have a higher income than someone with a lower 
income.  It makes no sense.  There is no fairness.  There is no 
equity.  It should be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this House will look at a way to determine whether or not 
the childcare expense deduction is an equitable instrument within 
our tax act to deal with the necessary expenses of raising 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, my colleague from Hamilton referred to the cost.  There 
is no question.  There is a big outflow in terms of reduced tax 
revenue.  There are also some inflows to the extent that someone 
would withdraw from the workforce and provide direct parental 
care.  Some unemployed people on welfare or EI are going to take 
those jobs, relieving us of the EI and welfare costs.  They would 
also pay taxes on their income, which apparently we have lost. 
There are some offsetting revenues.  Not all of them.  There 
already are some parents who stay at home.  They are sacrificing 
the opportunity to earn income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do understand the mathematics, but I also believe in my heart 
that the National Forum on Health is correct when it says that 
for every one dollar invested we will over the long term get two 
dollars back to cover our health care costs, social program costs 
and criminal justice costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To close, I want to thank my 16-year old daughter Whitney who 
said to me “Dad, this bill makes so much sense the government 
should just do it”.  She has been a very staunch supporter of 
her father who is away so often.  She is very interested in the 
divorce bill that I had about requiring mandatory counselling 
prior to legal separation. She tells me about the circumstances 
in her school and about children whose mothers and fathers are 
not at home.  She is concerned about that. Even at the age of 16 
our children recognize that there are problems.  They detract 
from a child's ability to achieve his or her full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again thank all hon. colleagues for their very kind words.  I 
intend to continue to work on behalf of the family and Canadian 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian opportunities strategy that was announced by our 
government in the last budget is a very important and significant 
initiative. As part of this initiative, Canadian millennium 
scholarships will benefit more than 100,000 students.  Likewise 
the plan will provide assistance to students with their student 
debt loads. There are many other advantages and features of the 
Canadian opportunities strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour market has a supply side and a demand side.  The 
Canadian opportunities strategy deals mostly with the supply 
side. The demand side of the labour market is driven by potential 
employers, both private sector and public sector employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the Canadian opportunities strategy deals more 
particularly with the supply side of the labour market.  It 
provides Canadians with greater access to education and training. 
Many or most Canadians view training and education as a means of 
obtaining a job or a career.  All Canadians want to be 
contributing members of society and to have the means to care for 
and nurture their needs and the needs and aspirations of their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question often boils down to:  What do I educate or train 
myself for?  Most Canadians would like to have some degree of 
confidence that the education and training they are acquiring is 
providing them with skills that will be in demand in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Manufacturers Association reports labour skill 
shortages in the following areas:  marketing jobs, 29%; design 
jobs, 27%; engineering jobs, 26%; machinist jobs, 23%; software 
programming jobs, 22%; tool and die jobs, 21%; and on and on it 
goes.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These shortages are significant particularly when we look at 
unemployment and youth unemployment.  The level of unemployment 
although much improved since 1993 is currently hovering around 8% 
nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a well accepted fact that in Canada we are currently 
experiencing a shortage of information technology professionals 
of between 20,000 and 30,000 people.  In my own riding of 
Etobicoke North which is quite industrial with aerospace 
companies and a pharmaceutical industry, I often hear that some 
of their jobs remain unfilled due to what they describe as a lack 
of qualified personnel.  This troubles me, particularly given the 
number of unemployed people in my riding.  I refer to the problem 
as the skills gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year I hosted a workshop in my riding and I brought 
together business leaders, educators, student career counsellors, 
young people and human resource professionals.  At this meeting 
representatives from Humber College, York University, the 
Etobicoke School Board, the University of Toronto as well as 
representatives from companies such as Allied Signal Aerospace 
and Schukra Manufacturing, and many other stakeholders exchanged 
views on the skills gap problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was seeking solutions and ideas at the micro level that 
perhaps could also be applied at the national level to deal with 
this problem. At this workshop, consensus emerged quickly around 
a single theme:  the need for industry, public sector employers 
and educators to communicate better, to better anticipate the 
skill requirements of tomorrow and the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the complicating factors is the rapidly changing world in 
which we live and the continually changing labour market.  A 
number of us in this House have spoken out on the need for the 
federal government to assume a leadership role in bringing 
industry and educators together to better plan for the future. 
The provinces and the territories clearly have a major role to 
play in education and training, but as a federal government we 
can use our powers of moral suasion and policy levers to bring 
the various parties together and to facilitate a constructive 
dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was for these reasons that I was very pleased to see in last 
September's throne speech a commitment from our government to 
develop a plan to match the skills being taught to young 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In response, the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, jobs, economic growth and 
youth are top priorities of the Government of Canada and these 
are major undertakings.  As the hon. member for Etobicoke North 
has learned with all the hard work he has done in his riding, 
there are no single quick fix solutions nor is it the 
responsibility of any one level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased with the number of measures that have been 
undertaken since 1993 which have created jobs and have ensured a 
skilled labour force for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance as part of our initial red book commitments, the 
government promised to deliver on a youth employment strategy to 
give young people the skills necessary to succeed in the current 
and future labour markets, and we have delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also continued to work with the sectoral 
partnership initiative, SPI.  It brings together employers, 
workers and other stakeholders in a particular industrial sector 
to define and address the human resources challenges facing the 
sector.  Work through this initiative includes the establishment 
of sector councils which provide support to the private sector to 
develop the infrastructure necessary for the development and 
implementation of a particular industry's human resource 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more than 20 sector councils operating, including 
councils for software, auto repair service, electrical and 
electronic manufacturing, and biotechnology, just to name a few. 
The work being done by the sectoral councils is important.  In 
fact Human Resources Development Canada is currently consulting 
with the software sector council with regard to further research 
related to skills gaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion helping Canadians find jobs and be prepared for 
the changing work world is something that requires a 
collaborative effort on the part of governments, businesses, 
communities and individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with 
provinces, industries and other stakeholders so that all 
Canadians, including our young people, can assume their rightful 
place in the workforce.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 1, I asked 
the Minister of Transport a question about the relocation of the 
Lévis station.  I pointed out that I was surprised that the 
station would be relocated to a point west of the Chaudière 
River, at least eight kilometers further away than initially 
planned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his reply, the minister seemed astonished by my question.  On 
April 20, I decided to write him a letter to provide further 
information, and I would like to share some of what I said with 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my letter to the Minister of Transport, I wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to say that, despite the answer you 
gave me in the House, I never told you I was happy that the 
Lévis station was being closed, since I have not spoken with you 
since February 20. 
</UL>
<The minister said I had spoken with him.  The letter goes on to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a communiqué I issued that same day, however, I said I was 
pleased that you had excluded the possibility of having trains 
reverse over the Quebec City bridge to the Sainte-Foy station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the rest, I was resigned to your decision, even though I 
knew it was not the best solution for the south shore, because 
you required that services be maintained at the Lévis station 
until a new station is opened on the south shore.  At the time, 
I thought this station would be built on one of three sites 
previously recommended by the mayors of the RCM of 
Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks later, on March 21, 1998, we learned from the media 
in my region that Via Rail intended to build this station at 
least eight kilometres further away than the three alternative 
sites initially proposed and, worse yet, right in the middle of 
an industrial park where the environment was far from 
attractive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the idea of closing the Lévis station first came out, 
stakeholders have always thought that a new station would reduce 
passenger traffic, because of the distance from the downtown 
cores of Quebec City and Lévis. 
In fact, a study done for Via Rail by SETRA in 1996 forecast a 
28.7% decrease in passenger traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since you asked the 
Standing Committee on Transport to make recommendations to you 
on ways of making Via Rail's operations more cost-effective, I 
have trouble understanding how you could approve an option that 
would decrease its revenues and force it to spend additional 
money to set up a shuttle between this new station and the 
downtown cores of Quebec City and Lévis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Transport was equally astonished on 
March 24 when members of the Coalition pour le maintien et 
l'utilisation accrue du rail gathered 11,241 signatures of 
people in favour of maintaining the Lévis station. 
The chairman of the committee, whom I may not name, because he 
is sitting opposite, had proposed to other members of the 
committee that this relocation be re-examined as part of a tour 
the committee was planning to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the only one astonished by the Minister of Transport's 
decision.  Members of the standing committee, members of the 
coalition, south shore mayors, and even the mayor of the 
municipality in which the new station will be located, Richard 
Blondin, also expressed their surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I impatiently await the reaction of the parliamentary secretary 
who, I hope, will provide me with more valid justifications than 
those I received the other day from the Minister of Transport.

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure the member for Lévis will be elated with this answer. The 
station at Lévis on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River is 
currently used by VIA for its eastern transcontinental and Gaspé 
trains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intercity service between Montreal and Quebec City crosses 
the river at Ste. Foy and uses the Gare du Palais station in 
downtown Quebec City.  This service does not use the Lévis 
station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the normal public hearings process the National 
Transportation Agency authorized CN to abandon its Montmagny 
subdivision, the south shore line used by VIA to serve Lévis. The 
abandonment was originally set to take place February 18, 1997. 
However, the line has remained open so that VIA and the 
government could look at options for the eastern transcontinental 
and Gaspé trains that would continue service to the south shore 
area near Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of CN's decision to abandon the Montmagny rail line VIA 
would either have to purchase and upgrade the line or else use 
another site to service the south shore.  After carefully 
considering the options, the Minister of Transport concluded that 
temporarily keeping the station open and building a new station 
is the most economic way to serve the travelling public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister announced the decision on February 20.  VIA has 
been asked to conduct a study to ensure that there are no 
significant disruptions to customers who will need to travel 
between the new station and Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the minister's concerns VIA was instructed to 
negotiate temporary arrangements with CN to keep the trains 
operating to the Lévis station. 
The line has been officially abandoned, but VIA has temporarily 
leased the tracks from CN.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in December of 1989 our Progressive Conservative 
government announced a compensation package for all victims of 
HIV tainted blood.  This package was universal and compassionate. 
Justice Horace Krever in his report asked that a compensation 
package for hepatitis C victims be universal and the health 
minister himself promised these victims that it would be 
compassionate.  This package is neither. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister put on his lawyer's hat and drew an 
arbitrary line of January 1, 1986, not based on doing what is 
right, but doing what he thinks he can get away with.  The result 
is that 40,000 innocent victims, who through no fault of their 
own were infected with this fatal disease, are being abandoned by 
this heartless health minister who cares more about the 
government's wallet than he does about our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When thousands of Canadians, through no fault of their own, 
suffered as a result of the Saguenay and Manitoba floods did the 
government say “It is not our fault so we will not pay”?  No. 
It helped everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When millions of Canadians suffered injuries as a result of the 
ice storms in eastern Ontario, Quebec and the maritimes this year 
did the government try to weasel out of helping those victims 
because it did not cause the disaster?  No.  It put together a 
compensation package that was universal and compassionate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this morning the immigration minister stated “If you stand 
on principle and have political courage then you must be willing 
to pay the price”.  I could not agree more.  Unfortunately, the 
government has demonstrated that it is completely devoid of 
principles, has no courage and is definitely not willing to pay 
the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last month the health minister has tried to hide behind 
the ten provinces who, because of the 40% cut in health 
transfers, had no choice but to sign on to his bargain basement 
package.  Now we see that the health minister's house of cards is 
beginning to fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Quebec National Assembly passed a unanimous 
resolution calling on the government to compensate all hepatitis 
C victims.  This morning the province of Ontario, this afternoon 
the province of Alberta and about half an hour ago the province 
of British Columbia echoed that same request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only time this government shows compassion to Canadians is 
at election time.  What is left now for these victims is that 
they will have to spend precious years of what is left of their 
lives in court fighting for compensation which they should 
rightfully receive.  Undoubtedly, many will win those court cases 
and because the government will have to pay millions of dollars 
in legal fees the package will ultimately end up costing much 
more than any universal compensation package that could be 
announced now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These victims want and deserve to be compensated.  Judge Krever 
wants all victims to be compensated.  The provinces want all 
victims to be compensated.  Canadians want all victims to be 
compensated.  Even the Liberal government's own backbenchers want 
all victims to be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, will the health minister do the principled 
thing, do the politically courageous thing, do the right thing 
and pay the price?  From one human being to another, will he 
renegotiate the hepatitis C compensation package?  It is time for 
this health minister to shape up or ship out.

1990 in our blood system.  This will provide for up to 22,000 
people.

purely on court cases, nor is it all about money.  It is about 
finding the best way to resolve these issues without creating 
other problems in the process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian society has not yet discussed, never mind decided about 
no fault insurance for its health care system.  We had to be 
careful not to embark on that road before these discussions could 
take place.

government.  They could have just allowed those to continue, but 
the federal health minister is on the record as having supported 
the idea of trying to steer these cases away from the courts 
before we started the process leading to the federal, provincial 
and territorial governments' announcement last month.  Trying to 
avoid the courts was something they wanted to see happen and they 
are hoping their approach will lead to that as soon as possible.

rationale for hepatitis C assistance.  He has explained the 
parameters that Canadian governments have established.  He has 
explained the dangers of being careless in making this kind of 
public policy; that is, the dangers of being hasty and 
irresponsible.

is right or what is wrong, it is a question of what is the 
responsible thing to do on behalf of all Canadians.
