	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend its 
Direction to the CRTC (Eligible Canadian Corporations) in order to authorize 
the CRTC to grant Québec-Téléphone a broadcasting license under the 
Broadcasting Act, so as to permit competition in distributing broadcasting 
signals in the territory served by Québec-Téléphone.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in this House to 
debate a motion I tabled with respect to Québec-Téléphone, whose 
head office is located in the city of Rimouski, regional capital of 
the Lower St. Lawrence administrative region in Quebec.
<P>
	Motion M-102 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend its 
Direction to the CRTC (Eligible Canadian Corporations) in order to authorize 
the CRTC to grant Québec-Téléphone a broadcasting license under the 
Broadcasting Act, so as to permit competition in distributing broadcasting 
signals in the territory served by Québec-Téléphone.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	For the benefit of our listeners, I should explain that the 
government's direction to the CRTC on eligible Canadian 
corporations allows the CRTC to set the requirements for 
recognizing a company as Canadian.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 86(3), this motion was formally 
seconded by four of my colleagues when it was moved at the 
beginning of this second session: two from the Bloc Quebecois, the 
hon. member for Portneuf and the one for Charlevoix, the 
independent member for Beauce, and the NDP member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway, a riding in British Columbia.
<P>
	I think it is important to understand what led to the tabling of this 
motion. First of all, the CRTC and the advisory council on the 
information highway recommended that the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage  and the Minister of Industry maintain Canadian 
ownership requirements for broadcasting businesses and that the 
grandfather protection already enjoyed by Québec-Téléphone 
under the Telecommunications Act not be granted to it in this 
sector, thus preventing Québec-Téléphone from entering the world 
of convergence and competition.
<P>
	Second, Québec-Téléphone then decided to step in to defend its 
rights and to do everything it could to survive as a corporation, 
which led to two concrete actions. It started by lobbying to have its 
case heard. The company had to define, present and clearly explain 
its situation so that government officials could seek and find a 
solution without compromising Canada's cultural sovereignty.
<P>
	It also had to set up a survival committee composed of managers 
and unionized employees to promote public awareness of the 
company's future prospects: either to stagnate and perhaps go into 
decline or disappear as an autonomous entity, or else to prosper by 
entering the world of convergence in order to obtain a broadcasting 
license.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Third, once these decisions had been made, they then had to be 
implemented. The committee for the survival of 
Québec-Téléphone circulated a petition, which was signed by 
94,253 people residing on the territory served by 
Québec-Telephone, a territory stretching from Rimouski to Gaspé, 
over to the Lower North Shore, from Baie-Comeau to 
Lourdes-de-Blanc-Sablon, to Montmagny, the Beauce region and 
finally Donnacona.
<P>
	This petition, most of which has been tabled in this House, urged 
the government to grant Québec-Téléphone an extension of the 
grandfather clause whereby it could be issued a broadcasting 
licence by the CRTC.
<P>
	In addition, of course, the senior managers of the company 
lobbied their member of Parliament and a number of government 
members, as is normal and necessary, to state their concerns, so 
that the whole situation would be clear and that an appropriate 
solution could be devised that would satisfy all those concerned.
<P>
	It is as part of this effort that I tabled a motion before this House, 
to make the whole issue transparent. There is a solution that would 
allow Québec-Telephone to take its place in the field of 
convergence and to be competitive. But it is a political solution; 
therefore, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1736"> 1736 </A></B>
<P>
the  fact that the matter is raised in political terms should not come 
as a surprise.
<P>
	Based to a large extent on a brief submitted by 
Québec-Téléphone, I would now like to give a brief historical 
outline of this company, which is part of the everyday lives of 
many Quebecers and was the largest telecommunications carrier 
under Quebec jurisdiction until the Supreme Court of Canada 
decided otherwise in its April 26, 1994 ruling.
<P>
	The origin of the Québec-Téléphone company we know today 
dates back to 1898. This was the year when Dr. Ferdinand Demers 
founded the Métis telephone company. But it was not until July 7, 
1927 that the company was officially incorporated, under the name 
of Corporation de téléphone de valeurs d'utilités publiques de 
Québec. A vigorous company from the beginning, it eventually 
integrated most of the province's telephone networks.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone's true founder was the Hon. Jules A. Brillant, 
who bought the Compagnie de téléphone nationale in 1927. Twenty 
years later, the company received supplementary letters patent and 
became known as the Corporation de téléphone de Québec. On 
February 10, 1955, through a special act, Quebec's Parliament gave 
the company the power to expropriate, along with the name 
Québec-Téléphone.
<P>
	The company then had to modernize its operations and look for 
considerable capital input, which was indispensable if it was to 
develop its communications infrastructure. In 1966, the Brillant 
family sold its Québec-Téléphone shares and, on July 21, the 
Anglo-Canadian Telephone Company, a subsidy of GTE 
Corporation-General Telephone and Electronics-, whose head 
office is located in Connecticut, became controlling shareholder of 
Québec-Téléphone with 50.4 per cent of the shares.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that, in spite of this association with an 
American multinational, the company presidents, namely Messrs. 
Bénéteau, Sirois and Laroche, have always been from the region 
and have worked their way up within the company.
<P>
	Mr. Bénéteau was president from 1967 to 1974. During that 
period, the company's growth was characterized by technological 
excellence and emphasis on network automation, while also giving 
priority to the development of telephone services in the middle and 
lower North Shore regions. The construction program to provide 
the north shore of the St. Lawrence with communications 
infrastructures was very ambitious, but the company was 
convinced that it would prove a powerful development tool for 
these regions, which were not industrialized, as yet.
<P>
	By the end of 1968, the 2,085 miles of Québec-Téléphone's 
microwave network made it the largest one in Quebec while also 
ensuring  communications with western Labrador and the island of 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	On September 1, 1974, Raymond Sirois took over from Mr. 
Bénéteau and a true era of change started for Québec-Téléphone.
<P>
	The company was always at the forefront of change. On October 
14, 1975, it started a convergence experiment, bought the 
infrastructure of Cablovision Bas-Saint-Laurent Ltée, and pledged 
to serve subscribers from Matane and the Matapedia Valley. In 
Rimouski, its suburbs, and Mont-Joli, Québec-Téléphone worked 
with Câblodistribution de l'Est. To comply with a Supreme Court 
ruling, it was forced to stop its involvement with cable television 
infrastructures.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Rapid changes in telecommunications did not prevent the 
company from quickly adapting to an increasingly competitive 
environment. As early as 1981, the company started digitizing its 
telephone system by using fibre optics in the long distance system.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone was the first company in Canada to offer all 
its clients private lines in 1991, and touch tone lines in 1993. In that 
year, the company also finished converting its switching and long 
distance transmission facilities to fibre optics, thus taking the lead 
in electronic highway development.
<P>
	On February 1, 1992, Gilles Laroche became president of the 
company, and his arrival signalled the beginning of the age of 
partnerships. The company joined the Stentor network, thus 
becoming a Telesat shareholder. By adding a satellite component to 
its services, Québec-Téléphone could contemplate efficient and 
economical solutions to serving remote and not very accessible 
areas in its wide territory.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone must continue to work to ensure its clients 
have equal access to services at a reasonable cost. Thus, in 
September 1995, through a subsidiary, the company introduced the 
Internet under its GLOBE TROTTER trademark.
<P>
	In summary, to conclude this historical overview, I would like to 
quote at length from the brief prepared by Québec-Téléphone: 
``The history of Québec-Téléphone is simply and above all the 
history of the builders and developers of a region which is arid in 
appearance but rich in a commitment and a will to succeed 
collectively in being and remaining a company whose heart beats 
to the rhythm of the life of the people representing it and pushing it 
to achieve excellency''.
<P>
	Let us now briefly turn to the operating environment of 
Québec-Téléphone. This company serves a 272,000 square 
kilometre territory, which forms 40 per cent of Quebec's populated 
area. This territory is spread over three distinct administrative 
regions: Quebec, the Lower St. Lawrence and the North Shore. 
Within the territor assigned to Québec-Téléphone, the company 
serves a
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1737"> 1737 </A></B>
<P>
total of 309 municipalities; 300 of them have a population of less 
than 10,000, and 168 one of less than 1,000. Only one, Rimouski, 
has a population of more than 35,000. On the whole, 54 per cent of 
the population served by Québec-Téléphone can be considered 
rural.
<P>
	According to the 1991 census, Québec-Téléphone provides its 
telecommunications services to 550,400 people. Expressed as a 
number of inhabitants per square kilometre, this translates as a 
population density of 2.2 people per square kilometre. This 
population, living in a vast but sparsely populated area, is 
characterized, in demographic terms, by evolution, aging and 
particular needs.
<P>
	Indeed, between 1981 and 1991, the number of households 
increases as much in the territory served by Québec-Téléphone as 
in Quebec and Canada, the increase being 1.8 per cent compared to 
2.2 per cent for Quebec and Canada resppectively. The population 
served by Québec-Téléphone is aging more rapidly, because the 
young are drained toward big cities outside the territory served by 
this company. Finally, it is impossible to ignore certain general 
needs of this population, such as maintaining its living standard, 
improving the quality and efficiency of public services, 
maintaining vital relations with big cities, and improving the 
transportation system to guarantee a better access. In short, this 
population wants to break free from the isolation that comes with 
living in remote areas.
<P>
	Despite the context it has to cope with, Québec-Téléphone has, 
through its presence and involvement in the regions, a great 
regional economic impact. First of all, it is the most important 
private sector employer in Rimouski, and over half its 1,700 
employees live there. The total payroll of Québec-Téléphone 
employees living in Rimouski was over $48 million, and that of all 
employees of that company was almost $75 million, in 1995.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Figures for 1993 show that Québec-Téléphone bought 
$21,294,565 in goods in the territory its serves, and $64,780,435 in 
Canada. The company purchased 92 per cent of all the goods it 
bought in Canada.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone is well established, and it contributes to the 
social and cultural development in its region. It also contributes to 
the quality of life by supporting many community services. Its 
involvement and sponsoring activities are mainly in health, 
education, arts, culture, and outdoor recreation. I could not 
possibly give the complete list of activities Québec-Téléphone is 
involved in, but here are a few examples.
<P>
	In the area of health, it contributed $350,000 to the Association 
du cancer de l'est du Québec towards an experiment with a chip 
card to allow consultations and updating of medical records.
<P>
	In the area of education, it has sponsored for five years the chair 
of optical telecommunications at Laval University. A first 
agreement for $600,000 was signed in 1988, and then renewed and 
increased to $1 million in 1993.
<P>
	In the arts and culture area, financing of an international organ 
and harpsichord international workshop; financing of the 
publication of books on the history of the Lower St. Lawrence and 
the South Shore; for the last 26 years, publication on the front cover 
of the phone directory of a work of art by a Quebec painter.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone is also getting involved in the multimedia 
sector, with distance learning, distance diagnosis, distance justice, 
the Internet, and broad band frequency communications services.
<P>
	At this point in my speech, I would like to quote again from the 
brief submitted by Québec-Téléphone: ``These latter services 
demonstrate the capacity of our company to provide, at the same 
time as other companies, if not before, advanced services to meet 
the real concerns and needs of the people and the businesses we 
serve. Québec-Téléphone expects a very bright future if it is given 
the opportunity to acquire a broadcasting license. As the company 
has done in other areas, it will take this new responsibility 
seriously. It will strive to set up a multipurpose network for all of 
its customers. It will remain attuned to the daily and more general 
needs of the people in order to provide them with a standard of 
living comparable to the technological development of the larger 
urban areas''.
<P>
	The brief continues: ``Should Québec-Téléphone's request for a 
broadcasting license be turned down, it will mean that these 
advanced services will not be available over a good part of the 
territory it serves-Québec-Téléphone has a good knowledge of 
the people and the companies it serves, especially of their needs. 
Throughout its corporate history, it has shared many co-operative 
projects and experiences with its customers-and has proven its 
sense of responsibility, its entrepreneurship and its progressive 
vision as a Canadian company. If Québec-Téléphone is prevented 
from getting a broadcasting license, not only will the company be 
denied a privilege that could have granted by the lawmakers, but a 
majority of the people living on the territory it serves will have to 
do without the advanced services the company could have provided 
and the residents of the larger urban areas already enjoy''.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone's brief goes on to say: ``The 1987 policy 
statement and the 1993 act led us to believe that nothing would stop 
Québec-Téléphone from offering a comprehensive package of 
communication services on its territory, as all other telephone 
companies will be able to do, wherever they may be located in 
Canada. Québec-Téléphone believes this demand is natural and 
that it constitutes a logical extension of vested rights recognized by 
the 1987 policy statement and in the  communication act. 
Québec-Téléphone is convinced that the government will 
recognize its efforts and its determination in all fields which have 
marked its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1738"> 1738 </A></B>
<P>
long experience and that the government will simply allow it to go 
on doing what it has already started out to do''.
<P>
	Last year, the government adopted orders in council which were 
a lot more threatening for Canadian culture than what we are 
proposing today. Allowing satellite broadcasting where 75 per cent 
of programs originate in the United States represents a much bigger 
risk.
<P>
	A broadcasting licence is important for Québec-Téléphone 
because it will allow it to develop the regions affected by the 
creation of quality jobs, to make new services accessible at a 
reasonable cost, to ensure competition over the territory served by 
the company, to promote culture in French and to guarantee the 
development of Québec-Téléphone.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	A licence is desirable for Québec-Téléphone, its customers, the 
people it serves, its employees and its shareholders.
<P>
	I am convinced the government will do everything in its power 
to consider this motion favourably and to find a solution which will 
be acceptable for all stakeholders, without compromising the 
cultural sovereignty of Canada and Quebec alike, and as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Québec-Téléphone's rights to hold a licence to provide 
broadcasting services on the information highway is a crucial issue 
for the people of eastern Quebec. These people should have access 
to the same kind of broadcasting, telecommunication and new 
communication services as the rest of the Canadian population.
<P>
	The information highway offers hope for the economy of the 
future. I think that is not unrealistic. Right now, the economic, 
social and cultural sectors are going through a period of rapid 
transition brought about by the power of the information, to name 
but one factor.
<P>
	It is true that electrical connections and wires by themselves will 
not create that economic growth. But it is there new information 
content and applications essential to every information based 
society will be developed.
<P>
	The federal government showed the way by dealing with issues 
related to the creation of the information highway in Canada. That 
information highway will answer the needs of the Canadian 
population and allow us to remain competitive on the global 
communication market.
<P>
	The government identified three study objects for the public 
consultation process leading to the implementation of policies in 
that area, namely facilities, content and competition.
<P>
	With regards to the competition policy, many supported the 
guiding principle according to which a fair and sustainable 
competition is good for consumers. Canadian consumers have 
clearly indicated they want more competitive distribution choices.
<P>
	Our government's policies have already helped to determine 
how competition will be introduced into direct to home satellite 
services. Among other things, the government has launched a 
process that will make it possible to ensure healthy competition in 
the delivery of direct to home broadcasting and telecommunication 
services.
<P>
	Despite the strong competition that will result from these new 
types of systems for delivering services, the development of our 
cable television and telephone networks in Canada will continue to 
be one of our greatest assets in meeting the challenges of the future 
in the communications field.
<P>
	Clear guidelines resulting from the government's policy will 
reassure the industries in question and encourage them to invest in 
the technologies that will benefit Canadian consumers.
<P>
	The freedom of consumers to use the services they feel are the 
best and to select whichever network or networks they wish can be 
respected only if competition between the various stakeholders is 
fair and defensible.
<P>
	In this regard, we have pointed out to the government that it 
would be preferable not to give an initial advantage to the cable 
television and telephone companies in the provision of services 
traditionally offered by one or the other. These conditions apply not 
just to the regions served by Québec-Téléphone and BC Tel, but to 
the entire country.
<P>
	It is the CRTC that studies regulatory questions such as the 
conditions of interconnectivity and interoperability, in order to 
ensure competition in the local telephone services sector. For its 
part, the government will determine the evolution of competition 
between these networks.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister and heritage minister has indicated 
her readiness to find solutions that will guarantee residents of 
eastern Quebec and British Columbia the same kind of services 
enjoyed in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Numerous meetings have already been held between the 
directors of Québec-Téléphone and BC Tel and the minister or her 
representatives. The talks are continuing, with a view to finding 
solutions that will maintain the integrity of the Canadian 
broadcasting system, while offering Québec-Téléphone and BC Tel 
the latitude necessary to ensure that their networks can be used 
effectively and that they complement communications services in 
the regions inhabited by their clientele.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1739"> 1739 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will shortly be announcing the implementation 
of its policy with respect to merging telecommunications and 
broadcasting. I am sure that this policy will include the inhabitants 
of the Gaspé, the Lower St. Lawrence, the North Shore and any 
other region served by Québec-Téléphone or BC Tel.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend my colleague from Quebec for Motion No. 102 which is 
currently before the House. It is an excellent motion and one which 
we could support 100 per cent if it were expanded to include B.C. 
Tel in every reference that was made to Quebec Tel. It seems to me 
that the problems with Quebec Tel with regard to the CRTC 
regulations and other legislation in Canada apply equally to the 
B.C. Tel organization.
<P>
	I commend the concise way in which the arguments were 
presented. The examples given were excellent and they continue to 
also prevail in the province of British Columbia particularly with 
reference to B.C. Tel. The difference between B.C. Tel and Quebec 
Tel is that B.C. Tel is much more pervasive in that it covers the 
whole province. I commend my colleague for her willingness to 
bring forward this issue.
<P>
	Rather than rehearse all of the good things that B.C. Tel has done 
and is doing and all the good things that Quebec Tel has done and is 
doing, I would like to draw brief attention to what brought about 
the need for a motion of this type to be introduced in the House. 
The primary reason this kind of motion must be presented to the 
House is that the legislation governing these foreign ownership of 
telephone companies and things of this sort is obsolete. Let me give 
a couple of examples of why I think this is the case.
<P>
	A tiny little company is being developed in southern Ontario 
called The Linc which is going to try to combine the provisions of 
Internet with long distance telephones. We know that the 
communication signals are rapidly going into digital form and not 
too long in the future all of them will be digitized which creates 
some very interesting points. This makes it possible for signals to 
be compressed so that they take up very little space on the highway. 
They can then be decompressed at the receiving end to be 
interpreted as to what the message really was.
<P>
	The minister's Information Highway Advisory Council was 
made up of all kinds of people. They were not political but were 
people who understood the business, particularly the technology 
pertaining to communications.
<P>
	Members of the council said the following about foreign 
ownership limits: ``As a means of reinforcing Canadian 
sovereignty, the Telecommunications Act, the Broadcasting Act 
and Teleglobe Act include provisions respecting Canadian 
ownership and control. In broadcasting and telecommunications, 
current regulations limit foreign ownership to 20 per cent''. 
Apparently as of last week that was changed to 33-1/3 per cent. 
``As part of foreign ownership provisions and the Canadian 
ownership requirements in the Telecommunications Act 1993, 
Parliament introduced grandparenting provisions for two telephone 
companies: B.C. Tel and Quebec Tel. The council considered 
whether the grandparented status of these companies should be 
extended to cover licences to operate broadcasting undertakings. I 
submit they should.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Foreign ownership limits are meant to promote Canadian 
control. They may, however, deny Canada access to the investment 
necessary to develop the Canadian information highway. My hon. 
colleague across the way recognized how important the 
information highway is to Canada's economic, social and cultural 
development.
<P>
	The very restriction being proposed, that is currently in vogue, 
and the one that is being proposed that it be lifted would encourage 
the development of the information highway, not discourage it. If 
we continue to insist on obsolete legislation, we will discourage the 
very thing the Minister of Industry is so strongly supporting and 
developing.
<P>
	The council believes that with respect to investment the 
behaviour of capital is more critical as a policy issue than its 
source. It raises the very interesting question of how one 
determines the nationality of capital in the first place. It is 
important to recognize that capital in itself has no conscience. 
Capital does a variety of things. It seems the issue is not where that 
capital comes from but rather what that capital does.
<P>
	We have Canadian capital engaged in all kinds of activities, 
some of which are smuggling and dealing in contraband activities. 
It is not that the capital did not originate in Canada; it is capital that 
is doing the wrong thing. If we really want to control capital we 
should be controlling what capital does so it can meet the 
objectives of our social, economic and cultural goals.
<P>
	We need to have legislation that governs capital so it can operate 
in manner consistent with Canada's economic, social and cultural 
objectives. To that end, the advisory council went on to say that the 
liberalization of the telecommunications environment may be the 
most important step to realizing the economy-wide benefits of 
information highway use and development following a transitional 
period toward market based pricing, a framework of open and 
sustainable competition. That is at the heart of this issue.
<P>
	It is all very well to speak about competition, and then have 
legislation which defies the implementation of that competition. It 
is important to recognize something which happened last week. 
The director of the CRTC, Keith Spicer, proposed that long 
distance charges be  deregulated. In other words, the CRTC should 
not have regulatory power over the setting of those rates. That is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1740"> 1740 </A></B>
<P>
the first admission that it cannot control those rates. The 
competition is such that it is always behind the eight ball in those 
areas.
<P>
	Last week the U.S. deregulated local telephone charges, which 
raises an interesting question for the ministers involved. What are 
the priorities? If Canadians were given a choice between giving the 
Canadian telecommunications industry the advantage it needs to be 
a strong contender and a leader in the global communications 
market, or preventing the Canadian industry from having a fair 
chance to compete by condemning our industries to third class, 
unable to compete, unable to produce jobs and growth, which do 
our ministers think Canadians would choose?
<P>
	We want jobs. There is no doubt that if we are to have jobs we 
need to have competition especially in the electronics industry. If 
one talks to the people in the industry it becomes clear very quickly 
that if they were limited to competition in the Canadian 
environment only, they would not be able to generate the kinds of 
profits they would need to expand.
<P>
	It is highly necessary for the government to realize within its 
own ranks, within its own cabinet there is a split over the issue of 
foreign ownership of phone and cable firms. There is a 
convergence developing in Canada today between telephone 
companies and cable companies. They can do exactly the same 
thing, provide telephone service and provide cable service.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I ask the government to examine the efficiency of the CRTC on 
the one hand dealing with telecommunications and broadcasting, 
and the Department of Industry dealing with spectrum 
management.
<P>
	We have three different kinds of operations now. We have 
telecommunications and cable on this side. With industry, we have 
local multiple communications systems and the personal 
communication system.
<P>
	The last two deal with licensing of certain spectra so that the 
industries or the companies involved will manage and 
communicate on those spectra. These licences have been granted 
by the minister of education to some companies. I have a lot of 
questions about exactly how the process was implemented to show 
fairness and equity for all those applying.
<P>
	On the other hand, I want to compare what that process was with 
what the CRTC is doing. The CRTC is holding back technological 
development. It is making it very difficult for the companies to 
advance technologically.
<P>
	On the other hand, the LMCSs and the PCSs and the way the 
licences were granted provided increased competition. While one 
of the processes is efficient, the  other is not. Both have some 
problems with them. The time has come to examine how we will 
control what capital does in Canada. That becomes the issue, not 
where capital comes from.
<P>
	I encourage the hon. member from Quebec to expand her motion 
to include B.C. Tel so that we could support it 100 per cent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a few brief remarks to give the House an idea of 
what is going on in the regions with regard to important issues such 
as the one raised by my colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata, 
namely the granting of a broadcasting licence to 
Québec-Téléphone.
<P>
	Such a licence would put regions such as the North Shore more 
or less on an equal footing with the large cities as far as 
communications are concerned. I will start by giving a quick 
overview since my colleague covered the subject in more detail.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone was founded in 1927 by Jules A. Brillant. It 
is important to note that in 1966, in order to have access to the 
capital he needed to modernize and develop his network, Mr. 
Brillant gave up his interest in the company. GTE Corporation 
became majority shareholder, which allowed to keep the head 
office in Rimouski. That was done to protect the regional character 
of the company.
<P>
	To better understand the difficulties Québec-Téléphone faces, it 
is important to know the context in which it operates. The territory 
it serves extends over 72,000 square kilometres, which is 40 per 
cent of Quebec's total area. Québec-Téléphone is independent in its 
decision-making and in the choice of its suppliers. One important 
detail I want to mention is that French is the company's only 
working language.
<P>
	During my speech, I will talk a lot about the regions because 
Québec-Téléphone is essentially an image of the regions and of the 
kind of service that can be offered and obtained in the regions. It 
must be noted also that the company is technologically advanced, 
offering affordable digital service to all its clients in the regions.
<P>
	Of course, the company is proud of offering equal access to 
advanced services such as teleforum, videoforum, cellular 
telephony, 911, Internet, which is very popular right now, and I 
would add that the information highway is the key to the future.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	I was just reading a document describing the information 
highway as a way of putting all regions at the heart of economic 
activity. It said it gave access to ``cybervillages'', a typical term in 
this field.
<P>
	What is Québec-Téléphone's contribution from the economic 
point of view? There is mention of close to $75 million in salaries 
in 1995, paid to nearly 1,700  employees spread out more or less 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1741"> 1741 </A></B>
<P>
across the area. Despite difficulties in covering the territory, there 
are 1,700 workers, 600 of which are also share-holders. This is a 
figure worth noting.
<P>
	There is also more than $800 million worth of property 
throughout the area, as well as modern tools for communicating 
with customers.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone contributes to social and cultural 
development through such means as promoting culture, 
particularly via its directory, which always features the work of 
local artists.
<P>
	Financial support to the arts is a very important aspect, and one 
not shared by other regional businesses: close to $100,000 in 
funding to museums, theatre and music in 1995, for example.
<P>
	One of the key problems encountered, and one for which no one 
can be blamed, it is just a regional reality: some, if not most, of 
regional businesses merely siphon off local funds, perhaps even 
taking away raw materials. Not all of them do so, and not all of 
them do so to an indecent extent but, if we look at businesses in the 
regions and compare the value of what is taken out of the region 
with the sums ploughed back into the region, investment in culture 
and young business entrepreneurs, for example, true implication is 
a fair exchange. Québec-Téléphone has earned good marks in this 
regard, for it has no other investments to protect and to build up 
elsewhere. Think Québec-Téléphone and you think North Shore, 
the Gaspé, all those areas my colleague for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata has just mentioned.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone is therefore in the vanguard as far as efforts 
invested in cultural and social development are concerned.
<P>
	There is also mention of a $350 000 donation in 1995 to the east 
Quebec cancer society, over 7 years.
<P>
	Furthermore, its employees are involved in education, health 
care, culture, socio-community activities, sports, economics and 
politics, areas in which they put some 26,000 hours back into the 
region in 1995. This is a huge amount of time. I know from 
experience that the corporation vigorously encourages its 
employees to get involved in the arts. I know that many are 
involved, not only politically but socially and in the community, 
pretty much everywhere. The company often provides flexibility in 
terms of working hours in order to offer organizations in these 
areas some help.
<P>
	Québec-Téléphone contributes more than $1 million a year to 
research and development. It has an endowed chair in optical 
telecommunications at Laval University, a French language 
research centre on organization automation, and so on.
<P>
	As time is moving along, I will shorten my next point, which 
concerns the high rate of unemployment and the exodus of young 
people in fringe areas. Therefore it has  to be shown that the 
company wants to continue to increase regional development.
<P>
	With the famous information highway connecting our regions, it 
helps outlying regions like eastern Quebec, which encompasses a 
considerable area. Things are made so much easier that, through 
these technologies, progress is being made at essentially the same 
rate. Regions are not necessarily at an advantage, because that 
would mean they have more, but they are more or less on the same 
footing.
<P>
	The problem for everyone in the regions is the transmission of 
information, getting up to date more quickly. With the new 
capabilities Québec-Téléphone is asking for, this problem would be 
resolved with a totally regional flavour, something that would not 
be guaranteed with outside firms. Québec-Téléphone has proven 
itself in this area and, I am sure, will continue to do so.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that the firm has demonstrated its 
ability in this regard. I think all Bloc members would endorse what 
would be, in my view, a justified swing of the pendulum in its 
favour while ensuring the region served by the company is well 
represented in its future development.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very glad to have introduced this motion. I was often 
asked about the origin of the grandfather clause. As many will 
know, its comes from the 15th amendment to the American 
Constitution giving blacks the right to vote. But when they came to 
vote they were told: ``You can neither read nor write but if your 
grandfather voted in the past, this gives you the right to vote''. This 
is why we use, by analogy with this 1869 amendment to the 
American Constitution, the term ``grandfathering'' when referring 
to vested rights.
<P>
	I readily accept the request of the hon. member of the Reform 
Party who asked that the motion I introduced be extended to B.C. 
Tel. Besides, B.C. Tel is already participating, as a partner, to all 
discussions between Québec-Téléphone and the government and, 
as my hon. colleague from the government said, the solution that 
will be found for Québec-Téléphone will apply to B.C. Tel as well.
<P>
	The minister has recently amended the direction on eligible 
Canadian corporations, but it is still not enough to meet the needs 
of Québec-Téléphone since it is still not 50.4 per cent of shares that 
can be owned by a foreign company. The important aspect of this 
whole issue, as I believe I have said at the start of my speech, as the 
heritage minister herself said and as everyone will understand, is to 
find a solution allowing Québec-Téléphone and B.C. Tel to 
continue to provide legally and openly multimedia services to the 
public, but in a way that would protect the cultures of both Canada 
and Quebec.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHEALTHACT">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 19 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-18, an act to establish the Department of Health and to 
amend and repeal certain acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege to speak today on Bill C-18 
which will establish the Department of Health.
<P>
	Many in the House have observed that the health related duties, 
powers and functions which are set out in the proposed new 
legislation do not differ greatly from the previous act. Indeed, it 
can fairly be said that the old act has served us very well over the 
past half century.
<P>
	At this point I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague from 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury for a motion he put forward. His 
amendment reincorporates a clause from the current Department of 
National Health and Welfare Act, an act dating back to 1944. This 
amendment explicitly defines the minister's personal and legal 
responsibilities for the department.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that the government gave the member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury its full support on this amendment 
and it was passed at report stage. The Minister of Health as well 
shared the concerns of the member that this legislation makes 
things perfectly clear with regard to his powers, duties and 
functions.
<P>
	There are some obvious differences in this bill which is to be 
expected in a knowledge intensive field like health. One of these 
differences is found in clause 4(2)(a) where there is explicit 
reference to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the promotion and preservation of the physical, mental and social well-being 
of the people of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is an amplification of the reference in clause 4(1) to the 
promotion and preservation of the health of the people of Canada 
which corresponds to section 5 in the old act.
<P>
	What does this mean? Some people have read into it something 
of a sinister message, a sign of an as yet undeclared plan by the 
federal government to occupy the full arena of physical, mental and 
social well-being. Such a move would have a significant impact on 
the division of responsibilities for health between the federal and 
provincial legislatures.
<P>
	Others have observed that the inclusion of this clause seems 
somewhat odd, given the transfer of the welfare side to the 
Department of Human Resources Development. After all, would it 
not make sense to consolidate all federal responsibilities for 
physical, mental and social well-being in a much more inclusive 
health department?
<P>
	My first observation is that the legislation makes it abundantly 
clear that the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of Health 
do not extend beyond the area over which the federal Parliament 
has jurisdiction. This means that the reach of Health Canada cannot 
and will not extend to the legal mandate of other federal entities. 
Rather, section 4(2)(a) says how the federal government views 
health. The choice of the words ``physical, mental and social 
well-being'' is no accident.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	These are the exact words used by the World Health 
Organization to define health. It is a concept that goes beyond 
seeing health in terms of the presence or absence of disease. It is a 
concept that sees health in terms of the whole person. This is a 
concept of health that embraces quality of life rather than just 
duration of life. Including the phrase ``physical, mental and social 
well-being'' in the bill before us today does little more than to 
formalize what has long been a reality.
<P>
	In my former life I was in the health industry for 30 years and for 
many of those years advocated bringing those three elements 
together. Rather than divide a person let us look at the person in a 
holistic fashion.
<P>
	It is neither new nor startling. It makes it clear that health means 
so much more than the absence of disease. Good health across a 
society flows from an entire set of public policies and personal 
decisions.
<P>
	The determinants of health are the complex web of factors that 
contribute to the overall state of a person's health. These are social, 
economic, physical, psychological and other elements. Is it any 
wonder that research shows that people who are unemployed 
experience both stress and greater health problems? Or perhaps
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1743"> 1743 </A></B>
<P>
hon. members have seen some of the reports in the newspaper 
where researchers have found real differences between the health 
of people who feel a sense  of personal control in their livesand those who do not. All of this simply reinforces what wealready know.
<P>
	Despite the best technology and the advances in drugs and 
procedures, what takes place outside a doctor's office is more 
important than what goes on inside that office. This fact has 
become a common theme in the analysis of health policy options. 
For example, Health Canada spends a large sum of money each 
year to provide health services to status Indians and Inuit. Yet 
aboriginal people continue to suffer, with many of the poorest 
health statistics in our society.
<P>
	This of course is not a place to discuss these health statistics but 
it makes clear the importance of the comprehensive focus on 
well-being. It also underlines one of the basis facts of health, 
system renewal. We cannot spend our way to good health through 
the health care system no matter how much we invest.
<P>
	We are better off to help people achieve a state of well-being that 
results in better health and less need for health care. A growing 
appreciation for the many factors that contribute to the health of 
Canadians has sparked an increased focus on the elements of 
well-being. Progress in this area establishes a foundation from 
which our health care systems can operate more effectively. It is 
rightly seen as an investment that minimizes future health care 
costs and that is extremely important.
<P>
	Some of these factors lie within the mandate and the programs of 
the federal health department. Others lie within the mandates and 
programs of other federal agencies. Some are within the reach of 
provincial and territorial governments and still others lie totally 
outside of the public sphere. This is the reality of health. It is the 
reality of Canada's health system. It is a reality that requires 
partnership and co-operation. It is a reality that places a premium 
on the evidence about determinants of health and the outcomes and 
effectiveness of health policies and programs. Most importantly, it 
is a reality that does not require any expansion of the federal health 
mandate.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Once this focus on partnership for well-being is put into practice, 
we see it as the practical concept that it is. Let me use the example 
of Canada's drug strategy. The ultimate aim of federal 
programming is to minimize if not eliminate the human tragedy 
that is the common consequences of drug abuse.
<P>
	Looking at the problem of drug abuse in these terms allows us to 
also consider contributing factors in the context of a much broader 
array of health determinants.
<P>
	Many here will recall the ``Really Me'' message that Health 
Canada coined for Canada's drug strategy. This message is meant 
to capture in two words the sense of confusion over identity and 
destiny that often contributes to a young person's decision to 
experiment with  dangerous substances as well as the positive 
imagery of a drug free life.
<P>
	Canada's drug strategy obviously encompasses a great deal more 
than slogans and messages but is aimed at addressing what 
physical, mental and emotional well-being is all about.
<P>
	Let me offer a current example, the Canada prenatal nutrition 
program. This initiative arose from the red book commitment. Its 
goal is to promote the development and growth of healthy babies. 
However, the route to that goal means addressing the factors that 
can harm that development.
<P>
	Clearly, a child in a mother's womb is no healthier than his or 
her mother to be. If the woman is eating poorly or in an abusive 
relationship or using drugs, the risks to the baby are very high.
<P>
	This program, as members are well aware, supports 
comprehensive community based efforts aimed at reaching these 
high risk, pregnant women. At one level it includes food 
supplementation, nutrition and lifestyle counselling and related 
information. At another level it gives them more tools to take better 
care of themselves and their babies.
<P>
	The mothers to be targeted by this program are usually poor. 
They are often underweight themselves. They may smoke, drink or 
use drugs. They also may be in abusive relationships. They often 
live in poor areas of our communities. They are often young, single 
and uneducated.
<P>
	Such conditions are the determinants of health that lead to 
40,000 low birth weight newborns a year who begin life at less than 
full capacity. These are the factors that this program is working to 
correct.
<P>
	The focus on well-being goes far beyond many health promotion 
efforts by Health Canada. It extends into health care delivery. The 
phrase quality of care clearly means more than clinical outcomes.
<P>
	Whether or not quality is the result will inevitably vary between 
individuals, not because the results vary in clinical terms but 
because identical health states may be valued differently by 
different people.
<P>
	Take for example a surgical procedure for which there is a good 
chance of a known side effect. For some the side effect may imply a 
lower quality of life than living with the disease in question. For 
others the reverse would hold true. In both instances the aim of the 
clinical decision is to achieve the health states of greater value to 
the individual.
<P>
	This is a choice that every one of us wants to have. Yet it is a 
choice that is not available if health is conceptualized in a way that 
sees it only as the presence or absence of disease. We are talking 
holistic medicine here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1744"> 1744 </A></B>
<P>
	At another level it is obvious that there remains much to be 
learned about the factors that underlie and shape a person's fiscal, 
mental and social well-being. I am reminded that health concepts 
in medical terminologies and technologies have evolved greatly 
since 1867 yet at no point has Canada's Constitution been a bar 
to the effective pursuit of health.
<P>
	We are now at a point in which provinces and the federal 
government understand and accept the need to build well-being as a 
part of the overall health strategy. Governments work together. I 
am not aware of any province that seriously sees the Health Canada 
mandate for well-being as a threat to its responsibilities. If 
anything, it underlines the shared commitment to addressing the 
basis of good health and well-being. It underlines a longstanding 
commitment to the co-operation that has served us so well.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	In terms of health status, we are second only to Japan in terms of 
neonatal deaths. In terms of our record in the development of 
health concepts, Marc Lalonde's 1974 ``A new Perspective on the 
Health of Canadians'' is still regarded internationally as a 
breakthrough, 21 years after its release. The record of our health 
care delivery system speaks for itself, a source of pride for all 
Canadians and the envy of the world.
<P>
	The inclusion of section 4(2)(a) in the enabling legislation 
conveys a message about who we are and what we stand for. We 
stand for a commitment to the physical, mental and social 
well-being of Canadians and a readiness to work with others to 
achieve that end. This section simply recognizes the complex range 
of factors that influence health and that they deserve consideration 
as we promote health.
<P>
	In short, this section tells us what we already know to be true. A 
department charged with promoting the health of Canadians needs 
to see its mandate in terms that reflect the reality of peoples' lives 
and all the elements that lead to good health.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to speak once again to Bill C-18, which was 
introduced as Bill C-95 before the recent prorogation of the 
Houses. The bill's purpose is mainly to establish the federal 
Department of Health. It also amends and repeals certain other 
acts.
<P>
	Such a bill is absolutely unjustified. There is no reason to pass 
such a measure since health is exclusively a provincial jurisdiction. 
It is crystal clear in the very constitution the government wants to 
impose on Quebecers. I said it before, I say it again and I will go on 
saying so. It seems hard to understand, but health is an exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	With its spending power, the federal government retains the 
possibility of interfering in all areas of provincial jurisdiction as it 
pleases and without consideration for the distribution of powers 
guaranteed in the Constitution. To prove my point, I quote 
Alexander Galt, one of the Fathers of Confederation, who stated 
that the distribution of jurisdictions as described in the British 
North America Act of 1867 did not give provinces enough money 
to enable them to properly administer their areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Alexander Galt's comments leave no doubt as to the initial 
intentions of the Fathers of Confederation as well as of another 
author of the 1867 act, who said that eventually the provinces 
would become nothing more than big municipalities under federal 
supervision and largely dependant on the central government.
<P>
	It might be difficult for some to admit today that this might have 
been the goal of those who thought up the British North America 
Act. Difficult to believe that the act which gave birth to Canada 
provided, even at a very early stage, for an increased centralization 
of powers in Ottawa.
<P>
	The point of my little aside was to show that, contrary to what 
some would have us believe, nothing has changed. We can see that 
the same centralized approach giving the present central 
government an overwhelming importance is permeating not the 
discourse, heaven forbid, but the actions of today's main federal 
leaders. The best example of this can be found in the health care 
area in which the federal government has continuously interfered in 
an increasingly more persistent way. Bill C-18 before us today is a 
case in point.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The Constitution Act gives the provinces general jurisdiction 
over health care by including generally all matters of a merely local 
or private nature in the province. Anyone can read this under 
subsection 92.16. Moreover, subsections 92.7, 92.13, and 92.16 of 
the same act give the provinces exclusive power over hospitals, the 
medical profession and the practice of medicine as well as health 
care in general in the province. I might add that this is an area of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction because it pertains to property and 
civil rights.
<P>
	Accordingly, it seems clear that health is under provincial, not 
federal jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been 
intruding in this area for many years now, and in various ways. The 
Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act, the Medical Care 
Act and, more recently, the Canada Health Act, which combines 
the other two and sets so-called national standards, show clearly 
what this federal government thinks about shared jurisdiction.
<P>
	The will or temptation to intrude on health is not new. It goes 
back to the end of the second world war. The federal government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1745"> 1745 </A></B>
<P>
had taken over all main taxation  areas to make sure it would 
control most of the taxes normally levied by the provinces.
<P>
	At the end of the war, the federal government had a bright idea: 
instead of returning powers of taxation to the provinces, why not 
redistribute the money through grants subject to standards it would 
set. This was a clever way to intrude even more in aareas under 
provincial jurisdiction, at a time when it seemed that the Privy 
Council in London, which then played the role now assigned to the 
Supreme Court, wanted to limit the federal government's 
centralizing tendencies.
<P>
	Since then, the federal government has been using established 
programs financing to transfer money to provinces for health and 
post-secondary education. The amounts given to provinces under 
that program are transferred partly in cash and partly in tax points.
<P>
	Transfers were computed from expenditures for a base year, 
1975-76, and were supposed to be indexed on the average GNP per 
capita over the last three years. Basically, since its implementation 
in 1977-78, established programs financing has been characterized 
by a unilateral partial withdrawal on the part of the federal 
government.
<P>
	Implemented in 1977, the established programs financing 
structure has remained unchanged. However, for the last ten years 
or so, its intended rate of increase has not been respected. This is 
where the shortfall for provinces and Quebec in the area of health 
comes from. This is a good example of the damage that a 
government can do when it refuses to acknowledge that it cannot 
substitute itself to other levels of government everywhere.
<P>
	In 1986, the federal government reduced the growth rate of 
transfers by 2 percentage points, which means that health 
expenditures had to grow 2 percentage points less than the GNP. 
That was the start of a long series of cuts in payments.
<P>
	In 1989, there was another cut in the indexing factor of 1 
percentage point, which meant that by now growth in health 
expenditures had to be 3 points below the growth of the GNP.
<P>
	In 1990, Bill C-69 froze transfers at the 1989-90 level for an 
anticipated period of two years, regardless of inflation, when actual 
health costs were continuing to rise.
<P>
	In 1991, the federal government announced that it was extending 
the freeze for another three years. During most of this sad period 
for health care, the opposition party was outraged. It clamoured 
that this could only lead to ruin for the heath care system. Yet, that 
same party, now the government, continues to weaken the system.
<P>
	The result is that between 1977 and 1994, the federal 
contribution to health care went from 45.9 per cent to 33.7 per cent, 
a drop of 10.6 per cent that Quebec and  the provinces had to deal 
with to the best of their abilities. Unfortunately, forecasts for 
1997-98 indicate that the federal share will drop to 28.5 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Over the years, as Ottawa withdrew from health financing, it is 
almost $8 billion that Quebec alone did not get, that the Quebec 
government had to manage to find elsewhere. We can add to that 
amount the cuts expected in the Canada social transfer, that is $308 
million for 1995-96 and more than $587 million in 1997-98.
<P>
	According to a study by the C.D. Howe Institute, from 1988 to 
1992, while spending for transfer payments remained unchanged, 
spending for other federal programs increased by 25.5 per cent. 
Consequently, cuts in health transfers to the provinces went to 
reduce the federal deficit. The federal government went on 
spending too much, while telling the provinces to tighten their 
belts.
<P>
	The leeway the Canada social transfer is supposed to give is in 
fact nothing but an opportunity for Quebec and the provinces to 
decide for themselves where they will make cuts to make up for 
this unilateral withdrawal. That is the vision the present Liberal 
government has of decentralization. That is what it means when it 
talks about flexible federalism. Thanks, but no thanks. We are not 
interested.
<P>
	Last Spring, the National Council of Welfare, an organization 
whose mandate is to advise the federal health minister, had this to 
say to the minister: ``It would be extremely hypocritical to reduce 
contributions to the provinces while increasing the requirements 
they would have to meet''. Yet, the National Council of Welfare is 
not known for its sovereignist leanings.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, sections 92.7 and 92.16 of the British 
North America Act state that health and social services are 
exclusively under provincial jurisdiction. Yet, the federal 
government also has a health department.
<P>
	Next year, it will cost taxpayers more than $1 billion, $1 billion 
wasted to do what the Government of Quebec and the governments 
of other Canadian provinces could very well do by themselves.
<P>
	Moreover, this redundant department that employs more than 
8,000 public servants allocates significant amounts for programs 
and projects that already exist in Quebec and in the other provinces. 
I can give you some examples from Quebec, where there is 
duplication in programs. Here are a few examples: the strategy for 
the integration of persons with disabilities, the family violence 
initiative, the new horizons program, the seniors secretariat, the 
program to reduce smoking, the anti-drug strategy, the strategy 
against AIDS, the pregnancy and child development program, the 
children's bureau, and so on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1746"> 1746 </A></B>
<P>
	It is this kind of duplication the federal government should have 
cut, instead of stubbornly trying to have its say in every area; the 
disastrous impact of this on government finances does not seem 
enough to make it face reality. It shifts the deficit onto the 
provinces by cutting transfer payments for health care, and people 
are paying the price.
<P>
	There is another federal initiative shows the government's 
determination to meddle in health care without the provinces' 
consent: the national forum on health, aimed at taking a critical 
look at our health care system as a whole and proposing ways to 
compensate for the ever increasing costs in this area. According to 
several analysts, the federal government could even take this 
opportunity to tighten the criteria and requirements in the Canada 
Health Act. Moreover, every single province openly criticized the 
federal government's attitude, which in this instance is pushing 
aside those with legal jurisdiction over health matters.
<P>
	In this regard, on September 27, 1994, the current Minister of 
Immigration told <I>La Presse</I>: ``The federal government's actions 
make no sense. How can it contemplate a review of health care 
plans without the participation of the provinces, which are 
responsible for providing services? This is clearly unacceptable''. I 
would be curious to hear the Minister of Immigration's current 
position on the national forum.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Another extremely wise comment on this Liberal government's 
failure to honour provincial areas of jurisdiction was made by 
Thérèse Lavoie-Roux, who, when she was still a member of the 
other place, asked why the provinces had not been invited to 
participate in the forum. ``Are they not the main players in the area 
of health? Does the government leader think it is appropriate for 
the government to act unilaterally in an area that comes under 
provincial jurisdiction?''
<P>
	Now, looking specifically at Bill C-18, it is clear that, instead of 
showing good faith by withdrawing from this area over which it has 
no jurisdiction, the federal government is doing its best to encroach 
little by little on provincial jurisdictions for its own benefit. This 
bill was not presented as a bombshell, as a megabill; it was 
presented to us as an innocuous and inconsequential bill, while in 
fact it is definitely not so.
<P>
	Paragraph 4(1) sets out the powers, duties and functions of the 
health minister. It suggests that the powers, duties and functions of 
the minister extend to and include all matters over which 
Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the promotion and 
preservation of public health. There certainly is room for 
clarification here.
<P>
	The following clauses are more subtle. Paragraph 4(2) lists 
particulars concerning the minister's powers, duties and functions, 
including the promotion and preservation  of the physical, mental 
and social well-being of the people. The people in question are the 
people of Canada. This clause would give the federal government 
the authority and right to interfere in an area under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Paragraph 4(2) goes on to include the protection of the people 
against risks to health and the spread of diseases. There was 
nothing to that effect in the original act that Bill C-18 seeks to 
replace. This opens the door to the federal government stepping in 
to protect the health and ensure the safety of the people by invoking 
the national interest or peace, order and good government.
<P>
	Paragraph (c) of the same clause provides that investigation and 
research into public health, including the monitoring of diseases, 
come under federal authority.
<P>
	This creates a problem, since later on, in clause 12, it is stated 
that nothing in the act or the regulations authorizes the minister or 
any officer or employee of the department to exercise any 
jurisdiction or control over any health authority operating under the 
laws of any province.
<P>
	How does the Department of Health intend to monitor diseases 
without having access to the necessary information? Under the 
Health Services and Social Services Act, health care institutions 
are governed by provincial legislation.
<P>
	Is this a real problem? Does clause 12 adequately restrict federal 
involvement in the health care sector, or is it just a front to reassure 
the provinces, one that the federal government will easily remove 
at will, as it has done so effectively in recent years?
<P>
	Clause 4 can certainly be interpreted in a very wide and generous 
way. We definitely have to wonder about the real meaning of this 
clause, which can be interpreted in several ways, and which may 
reflect a number of intentions.
<P>
	It is typical of the federal government to use a seemingly simple 
and inoccuous bill to intrude on fields that come under provincial 
jurisdiction. However, nobody is gullible to the point of not seeing 
what is going on.
<P>
	Bill C-18 is another typical example of the federal government's 
sneaky and quiet way of doing things, without making waves. It 
acts like this because it knows full well that no one agrees with its 
way of doing things in the health care sector. Instead of admitting 
that it is in the wrong and taking corrective action before it is too 
late, the federal government persists in a sneaky way, so that no one 
will realize what is going on until it is too late.
<P>
	Clearly, federal interference in the health care sector has a very 
negative impact. It is also obvious that the federal government 
stubbornly refuses to recognize the fields that come under 
provincial authority and also continues to reduce transfers without 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1747"> 1747 </A></B>
<P>
making national standards more flexible. We are headed towards 
the death of the health system as we know it.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	No more sad claims that Canada holds the only insurance policy 
for a health system such as ours. Yes, we are proud of our health 
system; yes, we want to hang on to it and even to improve it; no, 
Canada is not an insurance policy for this system, far from it; and 
no, Quebec's sovereignty will not spell the end of our health 
system, quite the contrary.
<P>
	The only real threat lies in the lack of vision of a federal 
government that no longer has the money to match its centralist 
ambitions and that should, as soon as possible, turn over full 
authority, including financial authority, in matters of health to the 
provinces, at least to those which have asked for it. The health of 
Canadians and Quebecers can only improve.
<P>
	It goes without saying that for all these reasons, and for many 
others that I will raise at a later time, it is impossible for the Bloc 
Quebecois to support Bill C-18 in any way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to congratulate my hon. colleague on the clarity of 
her address. I think that salient point in it is that attempts have been 
made in recent years to clearly demonstrate the considerable 
amount of waste and duplication there was between the two levels 
of government.
<P>
	Often people ask for concrete examples of such waste. The 
various strategies in the different programs my colleague has 
listed, for example to integrate the disabled, the campaigns against 
family violence, drug use or AIDS, can readily be seen as 
worthwhile from the political point of view. The reason for federal 
involvement in these is obvious, particularly because it gets 
involved through its spending power.
<P>
	In today's Canada, we cannot necessarily afford such things. The 
hon. member's presentation has made that abundantly clear. I 
therefore feel that it would be in the federal government's best 
interest to think once again about whether it is advisable to get 
involved in this area, before adopting this bill.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member where the national forum on 
health fits into this. I was looking at its mandate just now: ``to 
improve the health of Canadians and the efficiency and 
effectiveness of health services''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, what I would like to find out from my hon. 
colleague is which of the responsible governments is the one most 
capable of ensuring efficient and effective health services? Is it the 
federal level, which does not provide front line services, or is it the 
provincial level, which does provide such services, which has the  
responsibility for them, which is always on the firing line? Is it the 
provincial governments, all of which are being faced with difficult 
choices at this time?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
question.
<P>
	We have reviewed the history of the national forum on health 
time and time again. Where does it fit in here? I see it as nothing 
more than smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	At this time, and it can never be repeated too often, the provinces 
arre the ones managing health programs within their borders. As I 
have always said, I do not in any way question either the quality or 
the experience of the people on the national forum, but what use 
will their expertise be put to? There is not a single provincial 
representative on the forum.
<P>
	All of the provinces are busy restructuring at this time. We can 
see that in Quebec, where the minister, Mr. Rochon, is in the 
process of reviewing and restructuring, with a view to managing 
the health system in a new way and to ensuring quality health care, 
while taking into consideration our aging population, technological 
innovation and drugs costs.
<P>
	The provinces are the ones who know what their needs are. What 
can the national forum contribute in addition? Once again, the 
federal spending power is being used to start up new things, to 
waste time and money.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	This is not the first time we in the Bloc Quebecois have said that 
the national forum on health is, in our opinion, just smoke and 
mirrors with which to convince the people of Quebec and of 
Canada that this is a good government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the demonstration was quite 
clear. I would ask the hon. member for more details about an 
example of direct concern to her. We are told the government has a 
strategy to integrate people with handicaps, whereas in Quebec 
there is the Office des personnes handicapées du Québec, whose 
head office is in the member's riding, I believe.
<P>
	Would the federal government not be better advised, rather than 
putting in additional funds necessitating even more money for 
administration purposes-there must be administrative costs in a 
strategy to integrate people with handicaps-not to spend this 
money on a program that competes to some extent with action 
taken by the Government of Quebec? Would the Office des 
personnes handicapées du Québec not benefit significantly more 
from the federal government's withdrawal and thus provide a better 
and more complete service to Quebecers with handicaps?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. This is not the first discussion of duplication.
<P>
	It is true, the Office des personnes handicapées du Québec is to 
be found in my riding. Rather than take into  account what is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1748"> 1748 </A></B>
<P>
happening in each province and the programs each has set up, as I 
was mentioning earlier, the federal government steps up with its 
spending power and, in the name of good government, says: 
``There seems to be a problem with seniors-or with people who 
have a handicap''. And it assuages its conscience by putting money 
into a program, setting up a program that already exists in some 
provinces.
<P>
	Why not support the programs the provinces have already set 
up? The provinces know the health care requirements in each of 
their regions. After needs have been assessed, programs are set up 
to help people, with the help of experts in health care. Seeing that 
the program is running well, the government, as I mentioned 
earlier, injects money into the program to justify itself and to 
assuage its conscience.
<P>
	And if it is such a good government, why does it not support 
these programs by paying subsidies instead of cutting transfer 
payments, instead of tightening things up, instead of dumping its 
deficit onto the provinces and cutting transfer payments?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Prince Edward-Hastings, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased and proud to address the House today in 
support of Bill C-18, an act respecting the Department of Health.
<P>
	We have all heard allegations that the federal government has no 
role in health. Some contend that the government should leave 
health issues to the provinces and territories which actually deliver 
the services to Canadians. The government fully appreciates the 
provinces have constitutional authority for health care.
<P>
	The provinces are responsible for health care delivery which 
generally encompasses hospital and medical services. The 
provinces plan, manage and operate Canada's health care system. 
These systems operate however under the framework of Canada's 
national health insurance system which we all know as medicare. 
This national system ensures that all Canadians, regardless of 
ability to pay, have access to well trained doctors and well 
equipped hospitals.
<P>
	I do not wish to lend credence to the myth that the federal role in 
health is limited to its financial and other support of Canada's 
medicare system. At the same time we have every reason to be 
proud of the system and of this government's support for medicare.
<P>
	Canadians justifiably take great pride in our national medicare 
system and the quality of medical services available to all of us. 
They know that regardless of where they live, what language they 
speak or what their employment status may be, they are all assured 
of access to high quality medical and physician services whenever 
they are needed.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Medicare also has economic benefits that accrue to Canadian 
businesses. Business supports medicare because it provides it with 
competitive advantages in the global market. Canadian businesses 
do not pay the costs of providing private health care insurance for 
necessary hospital and medical services.
<P>
	Even after taking Canada's taxes into consideration, the cost of 
providing employee benefits is significantly lower in Canada than 
in the United States. This is certainly one of the factors that helps to 
attract multinational corporations to Canada.
<P>
	The national character of the system also enhances labour force 
mobility. Workers do not need to fear health insurance coverage for 
themselves or their families because they change jobs or move to 
another province in search of employment. Canadians retain their 
coverage even if we move and become unemployed.
<P>
	By guaranteeing Canadians access to quality health care, 
medicare helps to ensure a healthy and productive labour force. I 
believe our health care system has also helped to foster a sense of 
unity among Canadians. Canadian society is multicultural and 
diverse, as we all know. At the same time, it is strongly tied to 
North American culture.
<P>
	It is sometimes difficult for Canadians to define ourselves apart 
from our neighbours to the south, but health care is certainly an 
exception. Our universal health care system is closely tied to our 
Canadian identity. It is valued as an outward manifestation of 
fundamental shared values, justice, caring, compassion and equity. 
Not only is there more to health than health care, there is also more 
to the federal role in health than upholding the principles of the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	There are only about 25 employees who administer the Canada 
Health Act. The department's other employees support uniquely 
federal roles and responsibilities, work which is not carried out by 
the provinces and in which the federal government has a clear 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I will briefly outline for the benefit of everyone the vital work of 
this department. The department's work is clearly focused on four 
business lines. The first of these involves supporting and renewing 
the health system. Health Canada works here to maintain universal 
access to appropriate health care while helping to ease financial 
pressures on the public and private sectors.
<P>
	In support of these goals, the department administers the Canada 
Health Act and makes transfer payments to support provincial 
health insurance systems. It also promotes collaboration and 
consensus on options for involving the effectiveness and efficiency 
of Canada's health system.
<P>
	A good example is where the department works closely with the 
provinces and territories to evaluate the quality  and effectiveness 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1749"> 1749 </A></B>
<P>
of how health services are managed and delivered across Canada. 
This information is shared by all jurisdictions and helps shape the 
renewal of our health care system.
<P>
	The federal government has statutory responsibilities to protect 
the health of Canadians. The Department of Health carries out this 
responsibility by monitoring and assessing risks to health from 
emerging infectious diseases and other public health threats. All 
the provinces and public health agencies in Canada rely on the 
department's public health intelligence.
<P>
	The second line is risk management. The department manages 
national disease control strategies and ensures the quality and 
safety of foods, drugs and medical services for all Canadians. It 
also regulates human and veterinary drugs, oversees the safety of 
biologics and cosmetics and ensures the safety and nutritional 
quality of Canada's food supply.
<P>
	I cannot emphasize strongly enough the vital federal presence in 
this area and how important it is to the health of all Canadians. 
Canada currently has no capacity to identify and analyse 
potentially lethal infectious diseases such as the Ebola virus. 
However, the Department of Health is now constructing a level 
four laboratory in Winnipeg which will do just that. When it opens, 
this facility will employ 100 scientists. Their work will further 
enhance the health and safety of Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	The department's third business line involves collaborating with 
partners on strategies related to the health of the population. These 
strategies include health promotion, illness prevention and public 
education elements. They mobilize efforts to address national 
issues such as cancer, family violence, AIDS and prenatal nutrition. 
These strategies address the factors that lead to ill health. They 
provide much needed support to vulnerable groups at risk including 
children, single parents, poor families and seniors. They help 
prevent and combat heart disease, breast cancer and many other 
illnesses.
<P>
	These strategies complement but do not duplicate the work done 
by Canada's many national volunteer health organizations. We owe 
the many volunteers a big debt of thanks for the work they do on 
behalf of the health of all of us. We are recognizing volunteer week 
in Canada and the number of people in all our communities who 
work so hard for the benefit of all of us.
<P>
	At the same time, these health prevention and illness prevention 
strategies of the Department of Health reduce demands on 
Canada's health care system, thus contributing to reduced health 
care costs.
<P>
	Prenatal care is a good example. The cost of neonatal care for a 
low birth weight baby is about $60,000. The health promotion and 
prevention activities aimed at  ensuring a healthy birth weight on 
average costs about $400 per child.
<P>
	The Department of Health's fourth business line involves 
providing health services to First Nations and other groups such as 
Canada's military personnel. It is not generally well known that 
Health Canada provides community health services to status 
Indians on reserves and to residents of Yukon through 600 health 
facilities across Canada. It also ensures that registered Indians and 
eligible Inuit receive a range of medically necessary goods and 
services not available from the provinces.
<P>
	Apart from transfer payments to provinces, two-thirds of Health 
Canada's budget is devoted to the health of natives and native 
health issues. This is the only area in which Health Canada is 
directly involved in the health care delivery system.
<P>
	The department is responsible for assessing and sharing the 
health of special groups such as civilian aviation personnel. It 
ensures the safety of the Canadian public in cases of national 
civilian disasters.
<P>
	Together these four business lines include a range of activities 
designed to maintain and improve the health, safety and well-being 
of Canadians. Without a strong federal role in health we would 
have no national standards or processes to ensure the safety of 
Canada's food supply, its medical devices and drugs. There would 
be no national public intelligence to protect us from the emerging 
infectious diseases which are becoming increasingly common and 
increasingly complex.
<P>
	The Department of Health is certainly vital to the fabric and 
daily life of the nation. It helps ensure the safety and well-being of 
Canadians from coast to coast and makes important contributions 
to the nation's productivity, competitiveness and prosperity.
<P>
	I am proud to go on record in supporting this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to what my hon. colleague just 
said. I appreciated the listing of the various mandates of the federal 
health department but just the same we must wonder what it is 
doing there. Why is the federal government once again interfering 
in an area of provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	Incidentally, I would like to quote two women who can hardly be 
accused of being sovereignists. Mrs. Robillard is currently a 
member of the federal cabinet but she was Quebec's health minister 
in 1994. On September 27, 1994, she was quoted in <I>La Presse</I> as 
saying: ``The federal government's conduct is appalling. How can 
they consider changing the health system without asking the 
provinces, which are responsible for providing the services, to 
participate? That is just not acceptable.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1750"> 1750 </A></B>
<P>
	The other woman is Thérèse Lavoie-Roux, who, on May 31, 
1994, said that the government was wrong in  disregarding the 
role played by the provinces. She added: ``Why were the provinces 
not invited to participate in the forum? Are they not the main 
players in the area of health? Does the government leader think 
it is appropriate for the government to act unilaterally in a matter 
of provincial jurisdiction?'', she asked.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	I wonder why the federal government keeps on interfering 
stubbornly in this particular area. This is obviously an area which 
could pay handsome dividends, come election time. Some areas are 
more important, more strategic than others and health is one of 
them. If only the federal government was responsible, as it should, 
it would recognize from the start that it has no spending power in 
that area and would therefore not spend money there, but rather let 
the provinces look after these matters, thus preventing the kind of 
duplication we are currently experiencing. So, how can the hon. 
member justify that his government's interference in this area, if 
not because of purely political motives?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly not something to win 
votes. The hon. member needs to recognize it is a Canada health 
act. The role of the federal government is to ensure all Canadians 
are treated the same way, that all Canadians have access to the 
same treatment as anyone else.
<P>
	If the provinces in some cases wish to duplicate or add to those 
services as far as informational services are concerned, that is 
certainly up to them to do so. I would question whether that is 
necessary all the time.
<P>
	If we look at the intelligence, the information the federal 
government makes available to Canadians, the government 
certainly feels it has an important duty to inform Canadians. No 
matter what the issue, all Canadians want to know from the same 
source if possible what the health and safety standards are in 
Canada, what the medicare standards are, what they can receive for 
medicare if they move from one province to another province. That 
is the role.
<P>
	We have shown very clearly over the years this is the wish of 
Canadians. We in the government are determined to maintain that 
for all Canadians so they know its full value.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête: </B>Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the forum on health is to 
improve the health of Canadians and to increase the efficiency and 
effectiveness of health care. Can the hon. member, who believes 
the Canada Health Act requires the government to ensure that 
Canadians across the country enjoy the same quality of health care, 
tell us if, in light of its systematic withdrawal amounting to 
millions and billions of dollars, the federal government is not 
managing an empty shell?
<P>
	Despite imposing national standards and gradually withdrawing 
financial support, the government now requires the provinces, 
which are providing the services, to comply with national standards 
without giving them the means to act in this area. If the federal 
government really wanted to carry out its mandate in this regard, 
should it not stop collecting the taxes allocated to health care and 
allowing the provinces to act in this area, thus giving them access 
to more money so they can provide adequate services? Will the 
health forum help improve in any way the quality of health care 
provided to the people of Quebec and the other provinces? I doubt 
it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and some of his 
colleagues should realize and admit that as a country, whether on 
health issues or any other, we will continue to be strong by working 
together.
<P>
	If the hon. member is saying federal dollars for health should be 
handed over to each province and each province should do its own 
willy-nilly thing as far as health care is concerned, I am sorry, but 
he is speaking to the wrong government. He is speaking to 
Canadians who do not want to hear what he is saying.
<P>
	Canadians have made it very clear to all of us that they recognize 
we do not have as many dollars as we once thought we had. We 
have to be doing more with less or at least as much with less in the 
future.
<P>
	Only by sitting down and talking in forums such as the national 
health care forum with representatives of the federal government, 
the health care industry, the health delivery service and people in 
the provinces can we put our heads and available funding together, 
federally and topped up if necessary from the individual provinces, 
to provide what all Canadians have made it clear they want and 
having it made available to them in every corner of the country.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-18, which would formalize 
the reorganization of the Department of Health.
<P>
	As Reform's deputy health critic I will speak in support of the 
bill but before I do I would mention that the bill in our minds is 
simply just another shuffling of bureaucrats. It is taking up the 
expense and time not only of Parliament but more important, 
taxpayers' dollars, as signs are shifted on doors and offices are 
relocated. This is another example of phantom legislation the 
government will say is actually doing something, rather than 
making substantive changes for Canadians.
<P>
	Of course, every member of the House would admit that health 
care and our health system is of very real importance to all 
Canadians. Health Canada is under the  scrutiny of Canadians. A 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1751"> 1751 </A></B>
<P>
very real concern to Canadians is the sustainability of our health 
care system.
<P>
	The federal role in the health care system is very real. A part of 
that role is federal funding to the provinces. I would say that the 
government has failed Canadians in that role. Canadians are feeling 
the effects of the cutbacks from this place. For instance in 
Manitoba, health care workers are on the streets protesting changes 
which have been deemed necessary and are a direct result of 
decreasing and unpredictable federal funding. This place has 
offloaded its debt to the people who will be hurt the most.
<P>
	The current health system is not working and it will continue to 
worsen. The government refuses to recognize this fact. It refuses to 
hear about it.
<P>
	The Reform Party wants to assure Canadians that they will have 
a sustainable health care system. All Canadians should have access 
to health care services regardless of their ability to pay. We in the 
Reform Party care about the system and we are prepared to work 
with Canadians to find ways to make the system better.
<P>
	I have a broad concern that surrounds the bill and the functioning 
of our government. Fundamental to our system of government is 
the principle of ministerial accountability and responsibility. Not 
only is the recognition of this principle vital, the practice of it is 
crucial to another principle, that of good government which our 
system is intended to provide for the betterment of all Canadians.
<P>
	Even though the bill is housekeeping legislation, Reformers 
support it because it has been amended to take this principle into 
account. At report stage we supported an amendment which 
instilled this principle in the bill. It was not contained in the 
previous version which the government drafted and presented to 
the House for its consideration.
<P>
	There is a litany of examples demonstrating the need for the 
principle and practice of ministerial accountability and 
responsibility which are specifically related to Health Canada and 
the health of Canadians. I will mention a few.
<P>
	Recently we heard of the mismanagement within the health 
protection branch of Health Canada. The mismanagement of our 
national blood system by the bureau of biologics has led to a 
tainted and compromised blood supply which has infected 
thousands of Canadians with HIV and hepatitis C. An issue related 
to this is that of the Krever inquiry which is examining the failure 
of the management and oversight of our national blood supply 
system.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Last week in a statement to the House I criticized the 
government and the health minister for failing to uphold his 
ministerial responsibilities. It was revealed that the  federal 
government is paying the legal bills of two former ministers 
involved in this tragedy while giving very minimal legal support to 
victims and their families who are trying to pursue the truth in the 
courts on this matter.
<P>
	What has been the response of the government and the health 
minister? He has joined a chorus of those who are legally 
challenging the legitimacy of this inquiry. Instead he should be 
safeguarding the mandate of the inquiry and facilitating a full 
report on all matters relating to this most important issue. By doing 
so he could actually fulfil his responsibilities to the crown, the 
House and most important, the Canadian people. He has chosen to 
do otherwise.
<P>
	A third and final example of where the practice of ministerial 
responsibility is required is related to the fiscal management of the 
department and the allocation of our increasingly scarce health care 
dollars.
<P>
	Since I was appointed Reform's deputy health critic, one 
observation I have made is the imbalance and inequity in the 
department's and the government's health care spending priorities. 
This became clear to me when I was on the subcommittee on HIV 
and AIDS which studied the national AIDS strategy. I discovered 
an imbalance in federal funding for diseases in relation to the 
incidence of various diseases and the toll they inflict on our society.
<P>
	For instance, in 1994-95 the federal government spent $43.4 
million on the national AIDS strategy while only spending $4 
million on breast cancer research. Compare those funding levels 
with the incidence rates of these diseases and the deaths inflicted 
on society. Since 1980 there have been approximately 10,700 HIV 
cases with 7,400 deaths from AIDS in Canada, while in 1995 alone 
almost 18,000 families will have a loved one affected by breast 
cancer and a total of 5,400 dead.
<P>
	I have received letters from across Canada on that very issue. 
The government must be held responsible for how it allocates 
health care dollars. The imbalance of those figures speaks volumes 
in this place and across Canada.
<P>
	It is clear this government and the health minister must be held 
accountable for their decisions, the management of our health care 
system and the health care policies which have been their track 
record to this date. The principle of ministerial accountability and 
responsibility is so fundamental to our democratic system of 
government that we must all remain vigilant and uphold it. I intend 
to hold the government and the minister accountable for his 
ministerial responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians and Nova Scotians in my area continually want 
to know what the third party's official platform position would be 
on health care.
<P>
	In September 1993 we heard the leader of the third party say that 
his party supported user fees and  deductibles and would eliminate 
universality. He said that in <I>Canadian Living</I>. Then in October 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1752"> 1752 </A></B>
<P>
1993 the Toronto <I>Star</I> reported that Reform was opposed to private 
health care and user fees. The member for Macleod said in the 
House on October 17, 1995 that medicare was bad for everyone. On 
November 23, 1995 he said that medicare was important to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Where does the hon. member feel the federal government has a 
responsibility with regard to our health care system?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, as a member of this House and as a 
public figure, my response to items I read, particularly in some 
papers, is not always reflective of the actual thrust or intent of what 
was written. It is good to have the opportunity to say straight out 
what positions we hold without having it go through the sieve and 
the contortion which can happen in the media.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	I will repeat what I mentioned in my speech. Reform's bottom 
line is that we would like a medicare system which guarantees 
access to needed health care for all Canadians regardless of their 
ability to pay. That is our bottom line and it is what we are seeking 
to find. The system right now is crumbling and the federal 
government refuses to recognize this fact.
<P>
	People are on the streets striking because of federal funding 
cutbacks. We say that the federal government does have a place in 
funding medicare and ensuring the health care of Canadians. The 
funding should be predictable and constant. It should not be, as it 
has been, something that is being continually eroded through time 
so that the provinces cannot themselves make the plans and create 
the necessary approaches for proper health care. There should be a 
place for federal government funding but it should be predictable 
and sustained over time so that it becomes what is needed by the 
provinces to make their plans to meet the needs of the public.
<P>
	Beyond that, we believe that health care needs to be looked at 
and certainly opened to public scrutiny through discussions with 
the various stakeholders and the provinces. In that way we can find 
the means that will actually create a system that will be there for all 
Canadians not only today but in the future. Right now that is not the 
case and it will not be the case unless we open up health care to the 
scrutiny of those people who are involved in it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the speech of the Reform Party member. 
Sublauses 4(1) and 4(2) of Bill C-18 give the minister extended 
powers to act in every area related to the promotion and the 
preservation of the heath of Canadians.
<P>
	These two provisions give the federal government the authority 
to interfere in an area which comes under the exclusive jurisdiction 
of the provinces. As everyone knows, when the federal government 
gets involved in areas of provincial jurisdiction, it is very costly 
and it results in waste.
<P>
	For example, the national forum on health, which the 
government decided to hold without the provinces' participation, is 
a useless effort, precisely because the provinces are not 
participating in it. I want to ask the hon. member what she thinks of 
these two provisions which grant extended authority to the 
minister. As I said, this is a source of waste which we cannot afford 
right now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly a great concern of Reform is 
duplication of federal and provincial powers. We agree with our 
Bloc colleagues that any costs incurred in doing the same thing 
twice is not worth the doing. There has to be a clear delineation of 
federal and provincial powers. As I look at the estimates for this 
year-we are now in the process of looking at the estimates within 
the health department-I see very great problems and greater 
encroachment on provincial jurisdiction in the name of health.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	For instance, in the estimates there is an indication through the 
health window that the federal government is encroaching on the 
education system in the area of sex health education. The federal 
government has guidelines for kindergarten through to grade 12.
<P>
	What my colleague has suggested is of great concern to me. I go 
back to what I referred to in my speech, and that is ministerial 
accountability. The minister is responsible for what is done, how it 
is done and who pays for it. If it is a duplication of service, I would 
be the first to say that it is not an appropriate expenditure or effort 
for this place if it is a provincial responsibility. Certainly 
jurisdiction has to be taken into consideration and should be a very 
real concern for members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the third reading of Bill C-18. 
This bill is not earth shattering in what it does. It does something 
which is very important nevertheless.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It is typical Liberal legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> My friend from Wild Rose is informed, as usual.
<P>
	I say to him and others that this bill will create the new 
Department of Health. The old department was called national 
health and welfare and this bill together with the one dealt with the 
other day affects the change.
<P>
	This bill confirms the mandate of the minister regarding the 
promotion and preservation of the health of Canadians. Health is a 
matter that affects Canadians  very deeply. Our medicare system 
has come to be part of the way in which we see our country. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1753"> 1753 </A></B>
<P>
believe that the federal government has an essential role in 
medicare and in safeguarding the overall health of the Canadian 
population.
<P>
	In this time of change to our health system, many people want to 
know where the federal government stands on health issues. 
Canada's health system will continue to rely on the interlocking 
responsibilities of federal, provincial and territorial governments. 
That is why in the recent budget of March, the government went a 
long way toward providing provincial and territorial governments 
with stability and predictability in health funding and other social 
services of $25.1 billion each year over a five-year period, 
comprising a tax floor that had been requested by the provinces and 
tax transfer points.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Health Canada bears the overall responsibility for protecting and 
encouraging the health and safety of Canadians through promotion 
and prevention activities at the national level. It assesses the safety 
of drugs and medical devices. It deals with issues such as the 
potential impact on Canadians of exotic viruses or the 
re-emergence of public health threats such as tuberculosis. It 
encourages healthier lifestyles and active living.
<P>
	The federal health department also supports the health system 
through funding for research as well as financial and technical 
contributions to provincial health systems. The federal health 
department arranges health care programs and services only for 
specific categories or groups of people who are a federal 
responsibility such as status Indians and the Canadian Armed 
Forces. Otherwise, the federal department is not a delivery agent 
for health care. That lies with the provincial and territorial 
governments. They have the primary responsibility in the area of 
health care delivery. They design and manage the system that most 
of us as Canadians use. However, the federal department does play 
an important national leadership role in health that Canadians see 
as essential.
<P>
	Health issues figured very prominently in the Liberal Party's red 
book in the last federal election campaign. For example, a head 
start program for children of aboriginal families living in urban 
centres and large northern communities was promised. A number 
of projects under that program have already been funded.
<P>
	Action on prenatal nutrition programs was also promised in the 
red book. They are being delivered through the community action 
program for children.
<P>
	There are other commitments on which the government is acting 
but I will talk about them a little later. What is common to all of 
those initiatives is their  national scope and the value of national 
action on each of them.
<P>
	Of course this work also involves financial support for the health 
care system for the provinces and the territories, as I said a moment 
ago.
<P>
	Federal health contributions have evolved over the last four 
decades from cost sharing arrangements to block funding transfers 
to the provinces and territories. Since 1984 the Canada Health Act 
has set out the five criteria that provincial and territorial medical 
insurance plans have to meet to qualify for federal support.
<P>
	These five criteria are worth repeating here today. The first 
principle is universality. The Canada Health Act supports 
provincial health insurance systems that cover all eligible 
residents.
<P>
	The second principle is accessibility. Services must be available 
without financial barriers. People must be given health care on the 
basis of need, not on the basis of how much they can afford to pay.
<P>
	The third important principle is comprehensiveness. If a 
province defines a service as medically necessary, that service 
must be covered completely.
<P>
	The fourth principle is portability. Canadians with coverage in 
their home province or territory maintain that health plan coverage 
when they travel or when they move. This is a very important 
principle, like the others, given the mobility in this country at this 
time, the number of people who move from jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction, from province to province and from province to 
territory.
<P>
	The fifth principle, together with the ones I have mentioned, 
universality, accessibility, comprehensiveness and portability, is 
public administration. It means that the health insurance plans of a 
province must be administered and operated on a non-profit basis 
by a public authority. That, to me, is the one some of the provinces 
either have difficulty understanding or difficulty wanting to live 
with. That is one of the five principles that we on this side of the 
House are committed to continue to enforce, the principle of public 
administration.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The government takes these five principles very seriously. It has 
resisted the false claims that watering down the act is the only way 
forward. Canadians want the health insurance system they have 
built during our lifetime to continue. They do not want to see a 
two-tier system and I do not want to see a two-tier system either.
<P>
	Canadians understand that medicare has been a great social 
benefit. It has been one with very strong economic benefits as well. 
It is an efficient, effective program for providers, hospitals and for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1754"> 1754 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians. In fact, the average man or woman knows this 
reliability better than some commentators. We are better off thanks 
to  medicare. That is why the federal government has defended the 
Canadian system of health insurance so strongly.
<P>
	The government has been equally clear that it believes the health 
system needs to be reviewed. Canadians know the economic issues 
facing the health system. Make no mistake, they are the same 
issues in the United States and in other developed countries around 
the world. Many countries face issues such as rising costs of care, 
the emergence of new health needs, aging populations, the 
appearance of new medical technologies, drugs and other factors. 
We are all asking where the money goes.
<P>
	As a country we face more challenging health issues. For 
example, all Canadians agree that tobacco is a major health issue. 
The Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed that smoking 
consumption in this country causes deaths of the order of nearly 
40,000 each year. Remember that smoking is a costly exercise to 
the Canadian economy. The estimated cost to the Canadian 
economy is $11 billion a year. This figure incudes the costs to the 
health care system and the overall loss of productivity for 
Canadians as a whole.
<P>
	The federal government is determined to work with its 
provincial counterparts as stakeholders to bring forward a 
comprehensive and focused package to address the tobacco issue.
<P>
	There are other concerns. I have mentioned the tobacco issue. 
There are women's health issues for example. It is an important 
priority for the government and I am sure it is for provincial 
governments and stakeholders alike. It is time to address key issues 
surrounding women's health.
<P>
	There is the issue of new reproductive technologies. Some who 
may have followed this issue will recall that the previous 
administration sponsored a Royal Commission on New 
Reproductive Technologies which contained numerous 
recommendations. This administration is now considering these 
recommendations. The government hopes to be able soon to move 
on a number of those recommendations in a substantive way. 
Members from all parties in the House have called for action on the 
issues of new reproductive technologies, of women's health, of 
tobacco. There have been calls from all over and the government is 
acting on those issues.
<P>
	We must begin to consider what will become of the health 
system down the road. We know that spending more on the status 
quo is unlikely and that direction would not give us much better 
health outcomes than we now have.
<P>
	The international evidence is clear that spending more on health 
care does not mean better health results by itself. Why? Health care 
is not the same as health and people often wrongly equate the two.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The status of a person's health is determined by many factors 
which are in place long before he or she sees a doctor or is admitted 
to a hospital. Some are as basic as genetics. Others involve the 
economic, the social or the environmental conditions in which we 
live. Still others are grounded in lifestyle choices. All these are 
determinants of health.
<P>
	Progress in improving health may owe far more to living in an 
economy which produces good jobs or programs that help people 
live in proper housing surrounded by a clean environment. They 
are reasons for us to invest in effective health protection and 
promotion measures, ones that result in people making better 
health choices.
<P>
	Health care is not enough, but it is important. Our question is 
how to achieve the best health results possible with the money that 
we have. This renewal process has been under way now for a few 
years. The challenge for all of us is to break out of the traditional 
box of health thinking. It will mean change. Community based 
health service centres and multidisciplinary team approaches to 
health care are changing the landscape of health care delivery.
<P>
	The increased awareness that good health begins long before a 
visit to a doctor will mean an increased emphasis on the education 
of health consumers and preventive medicine. People will need to 
learn what physicians can and cannot do for them. People will need 
to learn how much they can take charge of their own lives. These 
steps are each part of a broader evolution of our health care system.
<P>
	Canadians trust their health care system. They expect the federal 
government to support and defend that system, especially the 
fundamental principles on which medicare is based. That is why we 
need a strong federal Department of Health and why I am 
encouraging members of this House to support the bill before us 
today.
<P>
	I mentioned a moment ago the issue of determinants of health. 
We in the Standing Committee on Health which I have the honour 
to chair are doing a study on the determinants of health as they 
relate to younger children. It is an important issue.
<P>
	We in this Chamber and elsewhere are aware that poverty for 
example is a real determinant of health for people. We have direct 
correlations between poverty levels and such matters as the rate of 
suicide among people. Poverty levels and achievement in school 
are two areas where poverty impacts on other outcomes. The 
all-party health committee of the House is now undertaking a rather 
in depth study of this issue to see what needs to be done and is not 
currently being done in the area of children's health.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1755"> 1755 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill before us is not one that is terribly earth shattering but 
Bill C-18 is an important piece of legislation. In the jargon of the 
House it is considered only a housekeeping bill to put in place 
the necessary statute to allow the department to function.
<P>
	I am rather delighted that the current Minister of Health is my 
good friend from Cape Breton. Already in the short time he has 
been in the portfolio I have watched with some satisfaction his 
commitment to the serious challenges we face in health care and 
his determination to do something about those issues. He is a good 
spokesperson for the issues. I certainly wish him well, together 
with his parliamentary secretary from Eglinton who has just taken 
on that responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on first looking at the bill to establish the Department of 
Health, one might think that it was a housekeeping bill, that it was 
quite ordinary, since there was at one time a department that looked 
after social affairs, welfare and such things. One might also tell 
oneself that the federal government had already played a role in 
this field and that this was probably just an update.
<P>
	But it is also an opportunity to look at what the federal 
government has to do and what its responsibility is in the health 
sector. For this, we must look back at the origins of our health 
system. In the past, because of its spending power, the federal 
government contributed to the development of programs that, 
while they must be recognized, often parallelled those run by the 
provincial governments.
<P>
	Today, these prosperous times are pretty much over and we are 
facing a completely different situation. The federal government is 
reducing its spending on health by billions of dollars, but insists on 
maintaining national standards. It is determined that the rules 
should be the same throughout Canada.
<P>
	The way the government has found to ensure this is by creating a 
department, by means of the Canada Health Act, which sets these 
standards. But it is like anything else: to keep the thing going, you 
need the corresponding funds and an effective way to put them to 
use.
<P>
	I think that the best example of very inappropriate interference 
by the federal government in this sector is the creation of the 
National Forum on Health. What is the National Forum on Health? 
It is a group of specialists appointed by the federal government 
with a mandate to improve the health of Canadians, increase the 
efficiency and effectiveness of health services, and formulate 
related recommendations for the government. It is a forum with a 
multi-million dollar budget.
<P>
	The problem is that this forum is looking at a provincial field of 
jurisdiction, because in Canada the everyday management of health 
is a provincial responsibility. When there is a problem in a hospital 
or community health centre or any other kind of health problem, it 
is the provincial government that is responsible. It is to the 
province that people must address their questions and inquiries as 
to why things are not working or their praise when things are 
working as they should.
<P>
	The federal government, meanwhile, gives itself the right to 
meddle in this area by assigning to the forum the very general 
mandate of improving the health of Canadians and increasing the 
efficiency and effectiveness of health care. Unfortunately, the 
provinces were not invited to participate in this forum as 
full-fledged members. How can the federal government assess the 
quality of Canadians' health without allowing the main players to 
participate and have their say in this? This forum has a budget of 
several millions of dollars and, when we see how difficult it is to 
fund health care across Canada, we cannot help but think that these 
millions of dollars could have been better spent elsewhere.
<P>
	I know that if the people in my region had received any of this 
money, they would have known exactly what to do with it. Given 
the need to restructure the system, to reduce the number of beds for 
seniors, to convert hospitals, if money had been available, if the 
federal government had withdrawn from health care and allowed 
the provinces, including Quebec, to act in this area without 
increasing taxes, interesting solutions could surely have been put 
forward.
<P>
	Why is the federal government stubbornly meddling in this area 
even though it does not have the money to do so? One cannot help 
but wonder if this has anything to do with the significant impact of 
health care on voters. Of course, a government with the power to 
spend as it sees fit, a power only limited by its capacity to borrow, 
may be tempted to meddle in areas likely to improve its chances of 
re-election, in areas that may improve the government's image but 
are none of its business.
<P>
	For instance, the federal government has a strategy for the 
integration of people with disabilities, while Quebec has the Office 
des personnes handicapées du Québec. This is an obvious case of 
duplication since it is impossible to act in an area like this without 
part of the budget going to administration. Had the money 
allocated to the strategy for the integration of people with 
disabilities been transferred to the provinces, all the money could 
have gone straight to the handicapped, since most of the 
administrative costs would already have been borne by the existing 
bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	At the same time there is a federal strategy on violence, an 
anti-drug policy, an AIDS strategy, the children's bureau, an 
anti-smoking strategy, all areas in  which provincial government 
take similar action and that require dialogue between the two levels 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1756"> 1756 </A></B>
<P>
of government, if duplication is to be prevented. Interface 
committees have to be established, which involves operating 
expenditures, but these committees do not provide services directly 
to the public.
<P>
	This is important, especially since individual citizens are 
wondering these days why the system costs so much to operate. Are 
doctors, the nursing staff or those providing services on the front 
lines in the hospitals overpaid? Or are there not clearly savings to 
be made at the administrative level?
<P>
	When the federal government acts in exactly the same areas as 
the provinces, we must ask ourselves who is responsible for these 
areas under the Constitution. It is clearly stated that health matters 
come under the jurisdiction of the provinces. So, under the cover of 
an innocuous bill, the federal government is once again meddling 
in the provinces' affairs. In that sense, it is not playing the role it 
was intended to play, it keeps interfering in an area over which it 
does not necessarily have jurisdiction and it could even take 
conflicting action in certain areas.
<P>
	There is also an element that is more tendentious, in a sense: 
federal interference in the form of national standards. This leaves 
the provinces, who are facing budget cuts, with the unpleasant task 
of making choices, taking into account population dynamics and 
ageing. They deal directly with clients and have to make choices in 
terms of direct service, but at present they do not have all the 
leeway they could have on behalf of those clients, because 
spending power in this specific area is in the hands of another level 
of government, which interferes indirectly.
<P>
	We are also faced with a somewhat absurd situation. In past 
decades, the federal government invested a lot of money in that 
sector and a number of programs were created. Now, we no longer 
have the means to fund these programs. However, the federal 
government would never say that it is because less money is being 
given to the provinces.
<P>
	It invokes the need for national standards to justify telling the 
provinces that they must somehow find a way to meet these 
standards. This puts the provinces in situations which can 
sometimes be absurd, given that they have no money for certain 
programs, while spending could be reduced in other sectors, but is 
not.
<P>
	Imagine a federal government that would only get involved in 
those areas for which it is responsible. Imagine the latitude that 
provinces would have from a taxation point of view, to look after 
their own areas of jurisdiction. The federal government would then 
simply have to assume its own responsibilities.
<P>
	In such a situation, federal cuts affecting national defence could 
be used by the central government to fulfil  its responsibilities. 
However, withdrawing from an area such as the health sector could 
also be a way to reduce the size of the federal government, which 
spends about $1 billion in that sector, even though it does not come 
under its jurisdiction.
<P>
	Let me stress my point by mentioning again the areas in which 
the federal government is involved. There is the issue of family 
violence. As you know, family violence is the result of a whole set 
of situations. The Government of Quebec, among others, has 
implemented policies to deal with this issue. However, federal 
initiatives do not necessarily complement these policies and there 
is room for improvement in that regard.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' position on these issues is not necessarily 
held only by Quebec sovereignists, or like minded proponents of 
independence.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	As an example, I give you Lucienne Robillard, now a federal 
minister. At the time, she was Quebec's health minister. On 
September 27, 1994, she told <I>La Presse</I>, and I quote: ``The 
behaviour of the federal government makes no sense. How can the 
health system be overhauled without involving the provinces, 
which are responsible for the delivery of services? It is quite 
simply unacceptable''.
<P>
	I think that says it all. These are the words of the minister, who 
was a minister in a provincial Liberal government, a federalist 
provincial government, in reference to the national forum on health 
on September 27, 1994.
<P>
	In the same vein, Thérèse Lavoie-Roux, a senator, told the 
Senate on May 31, 1994 that the government was wrong to neglect 
the role of the provinces. She asked the following questions, and I 
quote: ``Are the provinces not considered major partners? Why 
were they not invited to participate in the forum? Does the 
government leader find it appropriate for the government to be 
acting unilaterally on a matter of provincial responsibility?''
<P>
	We must remember how it was that the national forum on health 
came about. The Prime Minister invited the provinces to take part 
in the creation of this forum. Talk about hard to believe. Here we 
have a provincial field of responsibility, and the provinces are 
relegated to a position of listening to what is going on but not 
allowed to voice their views, to make suggestions for 
improvement. Perhaps it was feared that the provinces might 
indeed make some suggestions. Perhaps the provinces ought to 
have joined forces to state that the best thing would be for the 
federal government to pull out of this area and to turn the available 
funds over to the provinces for their own use.
<P>
	Despite provincial opposition, despite opposition from such 
people as the senator, despite submissions from everywhere in 
Canada, the federal government has  decided to continue, to go 
ahead with its project, to create the national forum on health, solely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1757"> 1757 </A></B>
<P>
for the purpose of meeting the campaign promise that had been 
made.
<P>
	How effective was the forum? Are there many people who have 
seen concrete solutions offered by the forum? Are the millions of 
dollars spent in this sector being used to improve Canadians' 
health, as the mandate given it by the federal government would 
have it?
<P>
	What more needs to be said to make it clear that the federal 
government is involved in an area it does not necessarily have any 
business being involved in? In the bill it is indicated that it could 
not intervene in areas that are already governed by the health 
authorities, yet these are described elsewhere in the bill as 
authorities with which it may have dealings.
<P>
	In the last budget, the government decided to create a research 
centre in this area, once again an action that appears totally 
praiseworthy at first. We are told that health research is really very 
important, will lead to the develop of new drugs, will help people 
be healthier.
<P>
	But if we look a bit further, we see that the provinces have the 
same mandate. There will be overlap in spending at a time when we 
cannot afford to do that.
<P>
	When asked where to cut, we answer: ``Eliminate overlap''. 
Health is a case in point, a clear case where the federal government 
should be made to withdraw from this area. Before passing a bill 
establishing the health department, in its present form, before 
granting the minister, as in clause 4, extremely wide powers to take 
action, we must question the real scope of the clause.
<P>
	Clause 4 deals with the powers, duties and functions of the 
minister with regard to health, including:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the promotion and preservation of the physical, mental and social 
well-being of the people of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think that some provincial health ministers must have 
wondered who was responsible for what when they read this clause.
<P>
	Paragraph 4(2)(b) says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the protection of the people of Canada against risks to health and the 
spreading of diseases;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	In this case, the federal government can always invoke the 
national interest and the federal power related to law and order, and 
good government to step in to protect the health and safety of the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	The concept of good government is an interesting one, but one 
which is open to abuse. Perhaps this bill should have been better 
framed, better defined, to state clearly in which fields the federal 
government is allowed to take action and to limit it to those.
<P>
	For instance, when we talk about health care for natives, we 
realize that the Constitution provides the  legal basis for action. But 
when we talk about getting involved in people's health in general, 
we realize that under the Constitution, this is under provincial 
jurisdiction, and we question whether it is legitimate to keep on 
interfering in this area.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, had it not been for the possibility, in the 
beginning, in the sixties and seventies, to use the spending power, 
that is to tax citizens to provide them with services in order to make 
the federal government more visible, it is unlikely that such 
interference would have occurred.
<P>
	After the second world war, the federal government realized that 
with the power to levy taxes it had increased through income tax, it 
weilded great political power. So it tried to implement a universal, 
Canada-wide health system to provide the same services all over 
the country. However, there are different regions in Canada and, 
since there are two levels of government, different provinces can 
make different choices according to what their citizens want.
<P>
	The power the federal government wields, through national 
standards, allows it to try to impose the same behaviour to all 
provincial governments, but this is not necessarily good. If 
Quebecers and Canadians had wanted that, they would have said so 
and the Constitution would provide for this area to come under 
federal jurisdiction, but it is not the case. This is not what is in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	For many who are involved with federal programs the reality is 
always the same. Take, for example, the new horizons program. 
The orientation of that program has changed from year to year, at 
the whim of successive governments. There were years where 
seniors' clubs in various municipalities were able to buy very 
useful equipment. Suddenly, last year, the program changed 
direction, but the connection between that change and the needs of 
the people was not at all clear.
<P>
	Today, the new horizons program is aimed at specific clients 
who would be in a difficult situation. I do not know it members see 
the direct link there is with the local implementation of CLSC 
policies. Local community service centres have mandates to help 
seniors, but they do not have the financial resources of such 
programs as the new horizons program; they see this as federal 
involvement that, often, goes against their own action. There are 
fields of activity where the action of the federal government may 
go directly against the action of the provinces, and it is very 
difficult to understand exactly what the federal government's 
objective is, in that regard.
<P>
	There are other fields of activity. For instance the fight against 
AIDS and drug enforcement. In the past, there were different 
approaches according to different governments. The federal 
government might prefer a more punitive approach. The provincial 
government might prefer an approach that will correct behaviour 
patterns. In the case of young offenders, for example, we  have seen 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1758"> 1758 </A></B>
<P>
provincial governments-the Quebec government, among 
others-put in place systems such as the Direction de la protection 
de la jeunesse, and different sectors where crime has been greatly 
reduced in Quebec. This has a direct link with to the health issue.
<P>
	If the federal government chooses a totally differing line of 
action, then it is a disservice to the people, and services are not as 
efficient as possible.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I think that, in this era of dwindling financial 
resources that calls for very wise choices, the federal 
government-instead of creating a department like the Department 
of Health and meddling in areas of provincial jurisdiction-should 
consider withdrawing from health care and transferring the money 
to the provinces so that each of them can provide services that meet 
the needs of the people.
<P>
	A province with a widely scattered or a sizeable rural population 
and one with large urban centres can make very different health 
choices. It might be unwise to try to impose the same standards on 
both.
<P>
	This is also directly linked to the provinces' respective policies 
regarding development and other matters. Health is not simply a 
matter of spending money on drugs. It is the result of the actions 
taken by the various stakeholders in society.
<P>
	I think that, in the past, the federal government's actions in the 
area of health, because of the amount of money available, led to the 
development of some worthwhile programs. Today, however, its 
attempt to impose very high standards while at the same time 
reducing the amount transferred to the provinces so they can 
provide these services puts people before a difficult choice, as the 
federal government will be assessed on the basis of its programs.
<P>
	People put pressure on the governments to develop programs 
against family violence, for instance. Yet, the provinces, which are 
responsible in this area, cannot afford to take action, because the 
federal government does not give them the means to do so. 
Taxpayers are stretched to the limit. In the end, people are in no 
position to assess the quality of health care. They tend to blame the 
government providing the services, when the cuts are made by the 
government that continues to collect the taxes without providing 
the expected services.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last year the Deputy Prime Minister proposed an 
endangered species act. She claimed it would help prevent 
Canadian species from becoming extinct. The difficulty is that the 
proposal only covered 4 per cent of all of Canada's land and it 
failed to consider the most important aspect, species habitat. 
Habitat protection must be the cornerstone of any endangered 
species legislation. There is no other way.
<P>
	Last Thursday, 16 new species were added to Canada's growing 
list of species at risk. Canada's new environment minister wants to 
make us believe that his government is working toward sustainable 
development except his words are meaningless unless he can 
assure Canadians that a new endangered species act will stop 
further species from becoming extinct.
<P>
	Today is Earth Day, a day first conceived by environmentalist 
John McConnell who said that such a day is needed to ``celebrate 
the wonder of life on our planet.''

planet for future generations.
<P>
	Allow me to present Erie riding's must list. We must work 
together to prevent toxic chemicals from entering our air, soil and 
water resources and to eliminate pollution of every nature 
everywhere. We must protect our ocean habitats and fish stocks. 
We must harvest our forests prudently taking care to preserve old 
growth areas. We must undertake extraction of our mining 
resources with minimal effect on our fragile ecosystem. We must 
take all measures necessary to protect our endangered plants and 
animals. We must use our energy sources wisely and efficiently. 
Finally, we must contribute to an international plan to reduce 
global warming.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu opened hearings of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission which was mandated by the bill 
entitled ``Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation'' under 
the democratic Government of South Africa headed by President 
Nelson Mandela.
<P>
	The purpose of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to 
look into the gross human rights violations and atrocities in that 
country, not in search of vengeance but in search of truth, 
forgiveness and reconciliation. This is not easy work. This was 
demonstrated by the painful testimony of torture and abuse the 
commission heard last week.

Archbishop Tutu. I presented to him the statement of principles and

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this weekend I

social programs. For example, it costs 37 billion federal dollars to 
keep

<P>
our health care and education systems going and to provide 
benefits for senior citizens.
<P>
	This year interest payments on the massive federal debt dwarfed 
the cost of all these vital programs combined. Interest payments are 
at $48 billion and rising. This is a scandal and the federal 
government bears full responsibility. The current government has 
added $100 billion to our children's debt and this has increased our 
annual interest payments by $10 billion per year since the Liberals 
took power.
<P>
	Canadians I talked to realize the biggest threat to our future 
prosperity is the interest payments being racked up by the current 
government. This government has set no date to balance the books

millions of unemployed and underemployed Canadians who have 
been left out and left behind. The jobless figures are a scandal with 
1.4 million Canadians out of work and another 800,000 forced to 
settle for part time jobs.
<P>
	The current government shows no sense of urgency. The only 
targets the government has set are inflation targets. Canada needs a 
serious commitment to attainable targets on income levels, 
unemployment rates, job creation and sustainable economic growth 
rates.
<P>
	The government must adopt a twofold strategy which tackles, 
not creates, barriers to opportunity for Canadians, including banks 
with record profits which do not reinvest in Canadians or our 
communities, institutions which think short term, and employers 
who fail to train.
<P>
	The government must use its power to intervene to promote 
economic development. What about the red book promise to create 
jobs, jobs, jobs? This government needs to answer the urgent need 
to get Canadians and Canada working again. The government has a 
role to play and it should perform it.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we learned a lot in the papers over the weekend about the 
Canadian army's actions in the Somalia scandal. We learn in fact a 
lot more from the papers than we do from the minister in this 
House.
<P>
	On April 16, he said, and I quote: ``This question casts 
aspersions on the Armed Forces and on the men and women who 
serve each day with distinction both at home and abroad. 
Everyone's reputation is being tarnished by incidents that occurred 
three years ago''.
<P>
	How could the Minister of National Defence talk in the House 
about events that happened three years ago, when he knew as he 
was making this statement here, following an investigation by 
military police, that documents were being illegally destroyed and 
falsified up to last September?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.  Speaker, the hon. 
member is extending the type of questioning we heard last week. 
He deals with the question of the public affairs branch and the 
question of documentation.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, the Somalia commission will be 
commencing hearings on Wednesday on this problem. All of the 
answers the hon. member wants will be forthcoming at the 
commission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has responsibilities. He must exercise these 
responsibilities in this House when questions are put to him on 
behalf of Canadians who want to know what is happening. He 
cannot hide behind a committee, when he already knows the 
answers.
<P>
	On April 15, the Prime Minister said that the events under 
investigation took place under another government. Clearly, the 
Prime Minister had not been informed by the Minister of National 
Defence that an investigation had been conducted within the army 
and that despicable events were known to have gone on until 
September.
<P>
	Why did the Minister of National Defence not inform his Prime 
Minister that an investigation by the military police had already 
revealed orders had been given, under his command, to destroy and 
falsify documents, up to last September? Why did he hide this from 
his Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, clearly I carried 
out my responsibilities by setting up the commission of inquiry on 
Somalia. I would ask the hon. member to await the commission's 
deliberations. Once these deliberations are over, he will have all the 
answers he and the people of Canada want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a commission of inquiry is usually called upon to 
investigate events of the past that continue to take place in the 
Canadian army. Events have occurred under the responsibility of 
the minister that warrant his action. The minister cannot hide 
behind a commission letting it assume his responsibilities for him. 
Things are happening right now.
<P>
	How has the minister been able to hide behind the commission 
since the start of this affair saying that all issues would be 
examined, when he knew the identity of the military personnel who 
gave the orders to falsify and hide documents, officers who remain 
in positions of responsibility and whom he has not yet sanctioned 
as his responsibilities would require him to do?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that the 
hon. member read the terms of reference of the commission of 
inquiry on Somalia.
<P>
	In the terms of reference, which I quoted from last week, there 
were the terms ``cover-up'', ``missing documents'' and ``tampering 
of documents''. This terminology was used in the original terms of 
reference.
<P>
	In specific reply to the hon. member's question, the commission 
has determined that even though the mandate of the commission 
was to November 28, 1994, when it comes to documentation and 
the allegations of tampering, destruction or cover-up, the 
commission feels it can go beyond that timeframe.
<P>
	If the hon. member has some concerns about other events that 
did not take place in the watch of the other government, all this will 
be under the eye of the commission. It will get to the answers the 
people of Canada expect and which they will receive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it appears that the commission members are aware that 
some documents have been destroyed. It also appears that the 
military police are aware that some documents have been 
destroyed. It seems that the public relations office, presumably 
reporting to the minister-there is perhaps a minister in that 
department somewhere-is also aware that some documents have 
been destroyed. It would appear the minister is the only one not 
aware. There was no video this time, so he knows nothing.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us whether or not he has seen the military 
police report stating that documents were destroyed? Has he or has 
he not seen it? A very simple question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been 
selective readings from what I suppose is the military police 
document which will be part of the evidence presented this 
Wednesday at the inquiry.
<P>
	The inquiry should be allowed to table that report, have it made 
public, let everyone read it and come to their own conclusions, 
rather than my selectively responding to quotes from a report, 
whether from that report or another document, in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	The whole point of creating the inquiry was to allow a 
thoughtful, orderly process with due regard to the legal rights of 
individuals, all to be conducted in an impartial setting away from 
the partisanship of the House of  Commons. It was the right thing to 
do. It was what this party called for in opposition. We have 
delivered on that commitment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I understand correctly, the military police are 
investigating the events of June, July, August and September 1995. 
The minister refuses to deal with it, washes his hands of it, passes 
the buck to commission members. So much for his version.
<P>
	I have a very simple question. Is the minister telling us that, in 
the Canadian armed forces, you can do anything you want without 
the minister dealing with it, that it will just be handed over to 
commission after commission after commission? Is that what his 
attitude is?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question 
really makes sense. The hon. member will get all the answers to the 
questions he posed today and the questions in the House in the last 
couple of weeks.
<P>
	If they are patient while the commission does its work, there will 
be a subset of hearings on the documentation issue beginning 
Wednesday. Other things will be revealed and other testimony will 
be given over the coming months with respect to the general 
incidents that occurred in Somalia.
<P>
	Everything, I assure members, will be answered. That is why the 
terms of reference were crafted in that way. No one outside of 
selected members of the opposition have criticized the terms of 
reference. Most people realize they are broad, that they are 
all-encompassing and that they will get at the truth.
<P>
	The government wants to get at the truth. Canadians want to get 
at the truth.

<P>
	How many billions of dollars is the Prime Minister willing to 
give to the Atlantic Liberal provinces and how may of his own MPs 
is he willing to sacrifice to come across on his broken GST 
promise?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, page 22 of the red book is very clear:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that generates 
equivalent revenues, is fairer to the consumers and to small business, minimizes 
disruption to small business, and promotes federal-provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is exactly what the Minister of Finance is trying to do at this 
time.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have seen on parallel here that instead of replacing the GST he will 
harmonize it. He is now replacing MPs. It is as simple as that. He 
has gone back on a promise and those people who campaigned in 
the last election know full when what they campaigned on.
<P>
	By his heavy handed actions today, the Prime Minister has 
shown complete disregard for the democratic process and that his 
precious red book means absolutely precious little. The Prime 
Minister has placed party and politics ahead of principles and 
people. The message is clear. If you want to keep your election 
promises, you cannot do it in the Liberal caucus.
<P>
	Is it really worth it? Is saving face on the broken GST promise 
worth the billions the government plans to spend on 
harmonization? It is worth punishing MPs whose only crime is 
standing up for their constituents?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every Liberal MP campaigned on the red book. It is very 
clear this phrase is part of the red book and everybody knew it. It is 
exactly what we are doing at this time.
<P>
	I remember the days when the member was in the House 
advocating and supporting the concept of the GST and flip-flopped 
a couple of times. We said it. We put it in writing and it is very 
clear.
<P>
	Some members of Parliament voted against the government on 
some bills. We have acted accordingly. When a member of 
Parliament clearly votes non-confidence in the government it is 
because he does not want to support the government. He wants to 
be independent and he will sit as an independent member of 
Parliament. I wish him good luck getting elected as an independent 
candidate.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all 
respect and in supporting the member for York South-Weston, he 
did not want to support the government. ``You got that right'' is 
what he would say to the government and to the Canadian people. 
He knew what he had campaigned on in 1993.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister, who campaigned to resign if the 
GST were not scrapped, is still here. The Liberal member for York 
South-Weston, who was merely living up to the campaign 
promises in the red book, got the boot.
<P>
	The government can hide the GST. It can spend billions trying to 
harmonize the GST. It can ditch all the anti-GST Liberals it wants. 
However, Canadians will not be fooled. They know these people 
campaigned on scrapping, abolishing and killing the GST.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not simply admit he has no 
intention of keeping his election promise? Why does he not simply 
tell Canadians not to believe a word they read in the red book?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I ask the hon. member to read the promises. She should 
listen:

disruption to small business, and promotes federal-provincial fiscal

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the Minister of Finance did not deny that 
replacing provincial sales taxes and the GST with a new GST 
hidden in the sales price would involve federal compensation of $1 
billion to the Atlantic provinces, to come out of the pockets of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister 
confirm that the agreement his government is preparing to 
announce with the Atlantic provinces does not constitute the 
removal of the GST as he had promised, but an expensive 
camouflage of a new 15 per cent GST in the price of goods and 
services?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just read the Liberal Party's promise in the red book 
twice. I do not need to repeat it. We said that we wanted to 
harmonize with the provincial governments so that there would be 
a single tax, so that businesses had only one sales tax report to do, 
and so that we would have a system that was the same for all 
Canadians, simplifying everyone's operations. That is exactly what 
the Minister of Finance is in the process of doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1765"> 1765 </A></B>
<P>
	When the agreements are concluded, the Minister of Finance 
will have no trouble expressing himself, and indeed is rarely hard 
put to do so in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to refresh the Prime Minister's memory ever 
so slightly. He said, during the 1995 election campaign, that he 
would abolish the GST. He made a solemn promise to abolish the 
GST and, as with the numerous defence department scandals, we 
have it on tape.
<P>
	Not only is the Prime Minister telling us that he will not abolish 
the GST, but he is confirming that by hiding the new GST in the 
price of goods, the federal government will more easily be able to 
increase it, unbeknownst to the public. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again, they are trying to scare people. It is not a 
question of increasing the GST. It is a question of changing the 
GST, of putting in place a national tax that will apply to everyone. 
There will be more work to do outside Quebec, because the tax is 
already harmonized in Quebec.
<P>
	Right now, the Minister of Finance wants the same taxation level 
for all Canadians who pay a federal and provincial tax, and that is 
what he is working out with the provincial governments, who will, 
over the years, have to forgo a certain amount of revenue. As 
always, as we have done in other cases, we will help the provincial 
governments, especially those having the most trouble, the poorest 
provinces, to adapt to the new national system.
<P>
	It is a question of being fair to all Canadians and that is what we 
are aiming for: a clear, simple and fair system for everyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
absolutely unbelievable. By sacrificing a caucus member because 
he had the nerve to hold the Prime Minister accountable for his own 
promise to kill the GST, the Prime Minister has made a mockery of 
parliamentary democracy and a mockery of this place.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has betrayed the member for York 
South-Weston, who was only attempting to hold him accountable 
and give him a chance to fulfil his promises and the principles he 
ran on and won the election on. That is a fact.
<P>
	Why has the Prime Minister abandoned the promise to bring 
about parliamentary reform?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> A little while ago I asked all hon. members to 
please direct their questions to the administrative responsibilities 
of the minister or ministers involved.
<P>
	In my view the way this question is framed, we are dealing with 
party matters as opposed to government matters.
<P>
	I will permit the hon. member to rephrase the question, not the 
preamble, and put his question to whomever he likes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, why has the Prime Minister 
flagrantly broken his promise to bring about parliamentary reform?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the first time when private members' bills come 
before the House we are allowing ministers and members of our 
party to vote the way they want. That has never happened before in 
the history of Parliament. It is working. It is a reform that has been 
appreciated but not noted.
<P>
	Unlike the member, I have been here for a few years and it is a 
big departure from what existed before. Members of Parliament 
voted on private members' bills according to the party line. We 
have given that freedom. It is a step in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	However, we live in a system in which we have a responsible 
government. When the government is defeated on a question of 
confidence it has no choice but to call an election. When it is a 
matter of voting non-confidence in the government, it is a question 
that one does not belong to the party that forms the government. 
That is all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister would not know parliamentary democracy if he 
grabbed it by the throat. That is a fact.
<P>
	A few years ago former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney kicked 
an MP out of caucus for voting according to their constituents' 
wishes. At that time the current Prime Minister welcomed that 
principled member into his own caucus. What a great irony. The 
Prime Minister said they would be a lot better than the hated Tories. 
What a farce that turned out to be.
<P>
	Why oh why is the Prime Minister breaking his promise on the 
GST and parliamentary reform and why is it not the Deputy Prime 
Minister being forced to resign instead of the member for York 
South-Weston?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the government denies the endemic assimilation of francophones 
outside Quebec, the future of four francophone schools in Ottawa is 
at stake for lack of students. They include the école Sainte-Anne, 
the last remaining francophone primary school in Lower Town, a 
francophone bastion in Canada's capital.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. When will 
the minister stop denying the problem of the assimilation of 
francophones in Canada, which leads to the disappearance of their 
most vital institutions, such as the last primary school in Lower 
Town?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would first like to point 
out our interest at the hon. member's concern over education. This 
goes against the policy of his party, which says that education is a 
provincial matter.
<P>
	I would first like to point out there are 60 schools under the 
school board for Ottawa-Carleton, including the one my daughter 
attends, along with école Gaston-Vincent, école Baribeau, école 
Cadieux, école des Pins, école des Villageois, école des Voyageurs, 
that are French language schools, and not immersion. Four of them 
are currently threatened with closure because of budget cuts.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Government of Ontario followed the example 
of the Government of Quebec, which announced cuts of $300 
million in education on March 27. These cuts by the premier of 
Quebec are unfortunate. We also find most unfortunate the cuts 
made by the Government of Ontario, but we respect its jurisdiction 
over education, which is, as the Bloc Quebecois policy provides, a 
matter of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
federal government has interfered in provincial matters frequently 
and on a number of issues, but the minister is denying the 
assimilation of francophones in Canada in her response, and no one 
dare deny this assimilation when it is occurring at the rate of 30 per 
cent in the Canada's capital.
<P>
	We must have francophone schools, but Sainte-Anne is closing. 
It is a fact that English predominates in the federal public service. 
Francophones must use English in the public service.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that her government is therefore 
practicing a policy of assimilation leading to the disappearance of 
the francophone community in the heart of the nation's capital?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in response to his 
question, I told the member that there are currently 60 French 
language schools in the Ottawa-Carleton region. Thirty years ago, 
there was no francophone school board in Ottawa-Carleton.
<P>
	His questions are almost as logical as his comments today-the 
member is weeping crocodile tears. Assimilation is about as logical 
as the comment: ``One of the reasons I became a sovereignist was 
because of the threat of assimilation''.
<P>
	Does he really think that a policy of separating francophones in 
Quebec from those in the rest of Canada will keep the country 
bilingual? The exact opposite is true. This is why we have 23 
francophone members and senators from outside Quebec here. This 
is why Canada is on its way to becoming a country for everyone.

his party made in opposition.
<P>
	Liberal MPs opposed taxing reading material when the GST was 
imposed by the Tories. They promised to remove the tax on books. 
Now they are proposing double digit taxation on reading with their 
piecemeal, half-hearted effort with three Atlantic provinces on 
harmonization.
<P>
	When will the Liberal government meet this promise? Where is 
the Prime Minister on this promise?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would repeat to the hon. member that at the time we 
opposed the GST and we still oppose it. We argued in this House 
that it would be two systems of taxes with two different types of 
reports. It is very complicated for the consumers and for the the 
business people who had to report. There would be two sets of 
books, two sets of inspectors and so on.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>

	We argued against this complication in the tax system. We 
always talked about harmonization. At the time of the election we 
put it in writing on page 22 of the red book. It is very easy to verify 
and we stand by what is written in the red book.

the hon. member said in terms of the availability of standards 
affecting both linguistic groups and services.
<P>
	I have also visited the Moose Jaw base in western Canada and I 
have not been directly informed of some of the things of which the 
commissioner apparently has been made aware.
<P>
	We try to make sure that no matter what language is spoken by 
members of the forces that obviously they are entitled to all of the 
services, priorities and prerequisites that all Canadians have no 
matter what language they speak. If improvements have to be made 
we will certainly put them in place.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is really unfortunate that, every time something goes 
wrong, this minister is always the last to know about it. There have 
been six complaints in Moose Jaw. I find it strange that when he 
went to Bagotville, he was told that everything was fine for 
anglophones but when he went to Moose Jaw, he was not told about 
the difficult situation faced by francophones there. I will not repeat 
the speech made by my colleague about assimilation, but that is 
how it happens, especially when a minister does not even care 
about the situation of the minority in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	I do not want a vague answer to my question, I want a straight 
answer. Does the minister intend to ensure that francophone 
members of the armed forces in Moose Jaw have access to a French 
school as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, obviously the 
member has not heard my answer. I am very concerned about the 
problems of access to services in both official languages across the 
country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With respect to education services, as the hon. member knows, 
under agreements that have been coming into effect that were 
signed by the previous government, the Department of National 
Defence is now handing over education to the various provinces. 
When we do this we try to ensure that linguistic minorities are dealt 
with fairly.

provide broadcasting services changes very rapidly at the present 
time. Most service providers are now switching to digital 
technology, which does not work with existing satellite dishes.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	There might be a potential problem for consumers. The sale of 
satellite dishes, used to receive television signals, is not regulated 
by the federal government. With any high technology equipment, 
consumers must examine their options very carefully before they 
buy. This is very important.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the GST was introduced by the Tories in 1990, the Liberals of 
the day argued for a free vote. They said that the Prime Minister, 
Brian Mulroney, had promised more free votes in the House of 
Commons. The Tories said that they could not allow a free vote 
because it was a money measure. Of course the Liberals were 
outraged, or they feigned outrage, at this kind of response.
<P>
	The current Prime Minister will not allow a free vote on another 
similar measure, and he kicks people out of the caucus.
<P>
	Many Canadians, especially one from York South-Weston, 
would like to know the answer to this question: Since the Liberals 
deplored this kind of  iron-fisted discipline while in opposition, 
what happened to them when they formed the government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have dozens of free votes in the House of Commons 
that did not exist before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> No, you do not; not one free vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> We have dozens of free votes in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	When a bill is by a private member, it is a bill presented to the 
Parliament of Canada. These bills will change the laws of Canada. 
We have accepted a lot of free votes, even with ministers splitting 
on some votes. We have never seen that before.
<P>
	I am satisfied with the experiment. I think it was good and did 
not cause too many problems. We might have them on other 
occasions. We had free votes before on capital punishment and 
abortion. We had free votes on problems of morality or moral 
decisions.
<P>
	When it is a question of confidence in the government, 
government members have to support the government which has 
helped them to get elected.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> May I encourage you both when a question is 
being asked and when an answer is being given because it is a bit 
difficult for me to hear all the words. I know you will co-operate by 
letting me hear both the question and the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the current Deputy Speaker was kicked out of the Tory caucus 
for voting against the party line, he said that the Conservative Party 
was so undemocratic that it would make General Noriega blush.
<P>
	This Liberal government promised Canadians that if it was 
elected it would be different, that Canadians would finally get MPs 
who were free to represent the wishes of the constituents that 
elected them. Why did the Liberals lie to Canadians?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would like the hon. member to withdraw the 
word lie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, why did the government misinform the 
Canadian people?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Very simply I would like you to please withdraw 
the word lie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw that word. Is it true that the 
government's idea of a free vote is that it is free as long as the 
dictatorial Liberal Party says it is free?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when it is a confidence vote in the government, it is a 
confidence vote in the government. It was discussed in caucus last 
Wednesday and the views of the member were clear.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston had a bill in the House on 
which we permitted a free vote. However, a  question of confidence 
<P>

in the government is something else. He could have waited and on a 
specific bill he could have voted against the government.

people across Canada are most disturbed with the Prime Minister's

<P>
	If MPs cannot speak out on important issues without being 
punished, Canada is in serious trouble. Remember, if the GST is 
not scrapped, the Deputy Prime Minister will resign. My question, 
therefore, is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister sit there in all good 
conscience after having gone back on her word while a long-time 
colleague of hers is made a scapegoat and hung out to dry while 
standing up for his principles?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am trying to tie that into the administrative 
responsibilities of members. If the Prime Minister would like to 
answer, I will permit him to do so.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every member has a chance to express his or her views on 
everything. However, when it comes to non-confidence in the 
government, it is a very clear statement that they do not support the 
government.
<P>
	Coming from rural Quebec, I have to explain to the hon. member 
who was born in Nova Scotia that I am here defending the British 
parliamentary system which has existed for a long time. A vote of 
confidence in the government is not the same thing as other votes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> They have free votes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> That government has free votes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> We have had more free votes 
here. We do not need a lesson on that score from the Reform Party.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> You are an embarrassment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> The problem with members of 
the Reform Party is that they do not want to know what is a 
government because they will never be a government. Having the 
responsibility of a government, people can ask my members. They 
have had more free votes than ever before in this Parliament.

given that today is Earth Day not only in Canada but across the 
entire globe. It is a time when we can hopefully put aside our 
differences and unite in pledging ourselves to conserve, to protect 
and to renew our planet. The theme of this year's Earth Day 
worldwide is ``To Your Health''.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it, a deteriorating environment does 
harm human health. We see it around us manifested in different 
ways, in different shades and in different shapes.
<P>

<P>
	I recently returned from the Arctic where I heard daunting 
stories of wind driven pollutants and poisons that taint mothers' 
milk. Also Environment Canada just finished issuing a sun screen 
warning for this coming summer because the ozone layer which 
is thinning continues to be a problem of large magnitude. We all 
know, in particular those of us who live in large urban centres, 
that the air quality is at risk. It is a risk to people, including our 
children and to those who suffer from breathing disorders.
<P>
	The words ``environment'' and ``health'' at the end of the day are 
really about the same thing. They are interchangeable and the risks 
and stakes are quite high.
<P>
	It is appropriate also that a United Nations report was just 
handed down which said that the pollution of earth's air and water 
was getting worse and not better. It warned that a staggering 150 
species of plants, animals and fish become extinct every single day. 
Imagine the magnitude of that mathematics. Every day as a result 
of our unsustainable development the world over we are losing all 
those species around the globe. It is staggering. We truly are getting 
close to nature's limits which means that yes, it is time that we 
collectively changed our ways.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Today on Earth Day citizens and communities across our nation 
step boldly forward to act as responsible stewards of our natural 
heritage, now and for the future. Through these actions we commit 
ourselves to conserve nature and we promise to share the benefits 
of nature across our regions, across nations and across the 
generations.
<P>
	Canadians fundamentally understand their responsibility to 
protect the environmental wonders that are Canada. Communities 
all across the country have the ideas, the energy and commitment to 
be and act as that first line of defence. We as a national government 
are prepared to help in that national exercise through action 21, a 
national $10 million annual program that tries to assist local groups 
who are trying to reclaim their respective environmental 
backyards. Today I have announced the latest round of projects 
from this program. About $2.5 million will be going to some 84 
groups across Canada all aimed at creating a healthier more 
sustainable environment.
<P>
	These projects include the East Toronto Green Community 
Group's efforts to reduce runoff and waste water contamination of 
the lower Don River; the Habitat Unlimited Society project to 
restore a rearing and spawning habitat for fish populations in 
Brierly Brook; and a project by a group southwest of Montreal to 
improve the methods of storing pesticides in the rural agricultural 
community. These are but a few examples of the innovative 
projects led by individual Canadians that are happening in our 
nation's neighbourhoods. That is where it must start because if it 
does not happen locally, we can talk about our strategies nationally 
and  internationally but at the end of the day they will not succeed.
<P>
	Canadians also know we are the custodians of the world's 
longest coastline and the stewards of one-fifth of the world's 
wilderness, one-fifth of the world's fresh water supply and 
one-quarter of our planet's wetlands. Sitting around kitchen tables, 
Canadian families and their neighbours have come up with 
grassroots ideas to restore and reinvigorate nature for the future.
<P>
	In P.E.I., 50 volunteers have adopted beaches in order to protect 
the endangered piping plover. The Wildlands Park Development 
Society in Calgary is revegetating an oil refinery site. Jack Bell, a 
senior citizen from Vancouver, started a van pool and now operates 
95 vans in order to reduce the emissions from vehicles.

	Only a few hours ago I watched as grade 6 students from Rideau 
Valley Middle School presented us with projects they have 
designed to help clean up the historic waters of the Rideau River 
which is simply yards away from the House of Commons.
<P>
	Grassroots groups and individual Canadians deserve our praise 
for their work to restore Canada's natural legacy. They recognize 
that nature is central to who we are and what we are not only as 
Canadians but as human beings.
<P>
	Canadians rightfully expect, in fact demand, that national and 
international actions match their personal efforts. Canada's 
environment is a source of national pride. Canadians want their 
national actions on the environmental front lines to also be that 
same source of inspiration.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	As one step in that direction, I am pleased to announce that every 
provincial and territorial government in Canada has joined with the 
federal government in signing a statement, a contract to conserve 
Canada's biodiversity. This statement is a companion piece to the 
Canadian biodiversity strategy released last year. This strategy will 
guide all governments in conserving nature and living up to 
Canada's global and national obligations.
<P>
	There are not too many documents on which we can achieve 
unanimous agreement these days. However, governments in this 
sense have heard the voices of Canadians. Canadians want Canada 
to be the world leaders in the use, in the conservation and in the 
sharing of the wonders of nature.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
celebrate Earth Day. Of course, this day which is dedicated to the 
conservation of the earth is also linked to the environment. I 
believe that, as parliamentarians, we are willing to pass and enforce 
laws to protect the health of the people of Quebec and Canada. We 
must protect the environment, otherwise the population will 
experience serious air, health and water problems.
<P>
	The protection of the environment is also a matter of education 
and information. I believe that very early on, children must be 
informed and taught about the environment, first and foremost at 
home, but also in school. We must protect the environment at work 
and in our daily lives.
<P>
	I would encourage school boards do draw up an information and 
education plan on environmental protection to make our young 
people aware of this very important issue.
<P>
	I would also encourage municipalities in Quebec and in Canada 
to set up environmental protection committees. I would give as an 
example the municipality of Baie-Comeau, in my riding, which 
created an agency to protect and improve the environment 10 years 
ago. The mandate of the agency was and still is to protect the water, 
the air and the environment as a whole.
<P>
	We all know that nowadays, municipalities determine their own 
environmental standards. Therefore, federal, provincial and 
municipal laws should not overlap if we want to keep inherent costs 
at a minimum and avoid conflicting legislation that would impede 
proper application and enforcement in some areas.
<P>
	In Baie-Comeau, in the riding of Charlevoix, a group called the 
Corporation d'amélioration et de protection de l'environnement 
recycles durable goods. We all know that almost everything can be 
recycled now: paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, wood, steel, etc. 
That corporation even salvages furniture which it repairs and gives 
to underprivileged families.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	It also collects, repairs, cleans and stores clothing to give it to 
needy families or those who have lost their belongings in a fire, for 
example. It collects and repairs household appliances that 
previously would have ended up in the municipal dump. 
Nowadays, many municipalities practice selective collection; in so 
doing, they can reduce their sanitary landfill costs. This gives 
municipal governments a chance to reduce their costs for sanitary 
landfills.
<P>
	You know that today everything is recyclable. I would even say 
that municipal governments would be well-advised to have their 
own selective pick-up and their own sorting facilities. This would 
even protect waterways. Certain Quebec waterways flow into the 
St. Lawrence River. We know that previously all municipal 
governments where discharging their waste into the waterways 
which, eventually, reached the St. Lawrence. At one time, the St. 
Lawrence River was considered one of the largest open air septic 
tanks in the world. Yet, some municipal governments are drawing 
their drinking water from that same river.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I want to congratulate the minister. Action 21, 
although a very limited program, is a start. It will allow some 84 
projects, totalling some $2.4 million, for the improvement of the 
environment. I urge all levels of government-federal, provincial 
and municipal-to do the same.
<P>
	To conclude, as parliamentary assistant to the hon. member for 
Laurentides, my job is very important because the environment is 
the way of the future. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let us celebrate 
together this Earth Day.

environment minister's statement this afternoon. The minister has 
a great deal to clean up following the tenure of the Deputy Prime 
Minister, so what better day for the minister to start than Earth Day.
<P>
	When former American President Gerald Ford proclaimed this 
day Earth Day he stated: ``The earth will continue to regenerate its 
life sources only as long as we and all the peoples of the world do 
our part to conserve its natural resources. It is a responsibility 
which every human being shares. Through voluntary action each of 
us can join in building a productive land in harmony with nature''.
<P>
	There is no question that a day such as Earth Day is beneficial to 
heighten the awareness of the problems with our environment. 
However, this one day should not be the only day when we bend 
down to pick up the litter scattered over our streets, sidewalks and 
yards. The three Rs are for everyday in our communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1773"> 1773 </A></B>
<P>
	At the federal level Canadians should be able to look at the 
actions of the minister and be confident that his actions will be 
beneficial to help keep our air, land and water very clean. We 
should not have to worry but we do worry when we look at the 
record left by the former Minister of the Environment and the 
plans set out by the current minister.
<P>
	When I became the Reform caucus environmental critic I found 
myself dealing with a number of issues such as lifting the <I>Irving 
Whale</I>, the toxic waste mess of Sydney Tar Ponds and the gasoline 
additive MMT. To date the <I>Irving Whale</I> remains at the bottom on 
the Atlantic ocean off the coast of Prince Edward Island, leaking 
bunker C oil and PCBs.
<P>
	The Sydney Tar Ponds site is far from being cleaned up since 
more hot spots of PCBs have been found. The Irving Whale has 
cost taxpayers $18.7 million, and still nothing to show for it. The 
Sydney Tar Ponds site clean-up has cost taxpayers more than $55 
million with only 90 tonnes of the 700,000 tonnes incinerated.
<P>
	With respect to the ban on the gasoline additive MMT, the 
minister still has no proof that MMT is harmful to the onboard 
diagnostic systems of automobiles. The issue is not environmental, 
it is political.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The west coast fishery is at risk. The minister has a role. We are 
monitoring. May he have courage to act.
<P>
	In the minister's speech he made reference to the uncontrollable 
smog in urban areas and how it is a risk for children. If the minister 
is so concerned with smog, why would he want to ban the use of 
MMT in gasoline when even his own officials admit that MMT 
reduces NOx emissions, one of the greatest contributors to urban 
smog?
<P>
	It seems the government's environment ministers make 
decisions based on what they think will affect their political future 
rather than on the future of the environment.
<P>
	The minister mentioned various private citizens co-operating in 
various ways to clean up the environment. Throughout this Earth 
Day week in my area of Burnaby volunteers are doing what they 
can to make a difference.
<P>
	On the British Columbia Institute of Technology campus a litter 
pick-up campaign is under way, which will include the Guichon 
Creek. Others are raising money for the Canadian Parks and 
Wilderness Society by getting pledges and walking or running the 
five-kilometre Burnaby mountain loop, starting at the Simon 
Fraser University campus.
<P>
	Fish habitat in New Westminster in the Brunette Creek will be 
restored. People across the country will be doing what they can to 
make a difference in their local communities. Unfortunately this 
will not be enough.  There are many large scale projects too large 
for volunteers to do on their own.
<P>
	Last Thursday the committee on the status of endangered 
wildlife in Canada added 16 new species to Canada's list of species 
at risk. The issue of endangered species is one for which Canadians 
will want to find a solution.
<P>
	Last year the former Minister of the Environment came forward 
with a proposal. She announced it as the solution, one which all of 
Canada would readily adopt. The proposal was weak from every 
angle. Not only did it not address the most serious issue of habitat 
preservation, but the proposed act would have covered only a mere 
4 per cent of the land of Canada. If the Deputy Prime Minister 
believes animals respect provincial and federal borders, she has 
been drinking too much water out of the Hamilton harbour.
<P>
	If the new Minister of the Environment, who so eloquently spoke 
about how Canadians want national action to conserve nature, truly 
believes what he speaks, he will have no trouble assuring the House 
that a new endangered species act will stop any further species 
from being added to a list of species at risk as a consequence of 
human activity.
<P>
	Canadians understand the current Minister of the Environment 
has a great deal of work ahead of him. They also understand the 
previous minister created more problems than she solved.
<P>
	Today, being Earth Day, is a great day for the minister to put 
Canada's environment back on the right track. Therefore I urge the 
minister to listen to what the grassroots are telling him and to allow 
independent, scientific tests whenever necessary and to use the best 
that science has to offer rather than political preening in the 
decision making process.
<P>
	We all want to do what is right for the environment. During the 
minister's tenure, may we anticipate results rather than speeches, 
and sound policy rather than more reports on the shelf. The country 
is waiting.

commit suicide or (b) aids and abets a person to commit suicide, 
whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and 
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years, that the

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> The next petition, Mr.

helps Canadians to offset the high cost of transportation in a 
geographically dispersed country and that mobility is a basic right 
and an economic necessity; that 52 per cent of the price of gasoline 
is composed of taxes; that the federal government reinvests in 
highways less than 5 per cent of its fuel tax revenues; and that two 
committees of Parliament recommended federal gas increases of 
1.5 per cent and 2 per cent per litre respectively.

the philosophy of zero tolerance toward individuals who drive 
while impaired by alcohol or drugs, and that the impact statements 
of the victims of the crime of impaired driving must be given the 
highest priority prior to the sentencing of anyone convicted of 
impaired driving.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners, with whom I agree, pray and request 
that Parliament proceed immediately with amendments to the

capital last year when the National Capital Commission was 
looking at selling off parts of green space and open corridors in the 
nation's capital.
<P>
	The petitioners call to the attention of the House that when 
Jacques Gréber released his plan for the national capital in 1950 it 
was dedicated, at the direction of the cabinet, as a national war 
memorial to those who had fought in the wars in defence of 
Canada.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHEALTHACT">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-18, 
an act to establish the Department of Health and to amend and 
repeal certain acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address Bill C-18 which prior to prorogation was referred to as Bill 
C-95. It has been is brought back substantially in the same form, in 
the same place, in the same position as it was before. I do not know 
why we prorogued. The whole thing was a farce.
<P>
	This is a housekeeping bill that we will support because it 
amalgamates basically two departments, the Department of 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs and what was formerly called the 
Department of National Health and Welfare. Now the government 
wants to call it the Department of Health.
<P>
	Since this bill touches on the new Department of Health I would 
like to submit for consideration some comments and 
recommendations respecting the health of this nation, the health of 
the government and what the government could do to improve 
health care for Canadians. I am concerned that the new minister for 
health, like the previous minister, is not in control, that he will not 
take responsibility for the department and that he is letting the 
bureaucrats set the agenda for him.
<P>
	More people are concerned about long line-ups in hospitals and 
getting care and attention, yet this minister makes a big to-do about 
attending wine and cheese parties and the possibility of banning the 
importation of unpasteurized cheese.
<P>
	This is foolish. The bureaucracy has come up with something 
that is scientific somewhere, unbeknown to us in opposition. We do 
not know where they are going and what they are trying to do. If 
this was the case there would be a lot of problems in Europe, would 
there not? For more than 500 years Europeans have been eating 
unpasteurized cheese and nobody is dying. Are Canadians dying? 
Where are the facts? What kind of game is the Minister of Health 
trying to play?
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	This is the issue of the day versus cigarettes and some of the 
petitions presented today about alcohol and breast cancer. These 
are the important things, not unpasteurized cheese. Tainted blood; I 
will return to the Krever inquiry shortly.
<P>
	When it comes to the health and well-being of Canadians, I 
believe the government is being hypocritical and duplicitous in its 
approach. Government members  talk about the five principles of 
health care and how they will protect them. They think they are the 
only ones who can protect them. Who will pay for it? Reformers 
have made recommendations for health care. All the Liberals do is 
scoff and laugh at them: ``slash and burn''.
<P>
	I have accused the government of hypocrisy and duplicity. Let 
me try to prove that with facts and evidence. I will compare one 
aspect of the Liberal budget with what we had in our zero in three 
budget.
<P>
	On government spending and non-social spending we, along 
with the government, would probably have cut, as the government 
has, about $10 billion. On social spending, the one area of 
established programs financing which refers to health care and 
education, and the Canada assistance plan, which is welfare, the 
total expenditure by the government in 1994-95 was $17 billion. If 
we compare that with the cuts which we would have made to health 
care, education and welfare, the combined total in our budget was 
$3.5 billion. The federal government cut $6.6 billion in these areas, 
$3.1 billion more.
<P>
	Who is guilty of slash and burn? Who is giving less money to 
those programs which are most important to the Canadian public? 
Health care and education are the key foundations to any structure, 
especially the social structure in Canada.
<P>
	When I went door to door I said we have to cut spending 
everywhere else to preserve the amount of funding we have for 
health care and education. Even in caucus many of us argued there 
should not be any cuts in those areas. The counter argument was to 
show the Canadian public the effects of the debt and the high 
interest costs to service the debt, how these are actually suffocating 
and restricting the amount of money for all programs and therefore 
the cuts also must touch on health care and education.
<P>
	We asked those two institutions to look at some areas which 
could be rationalized to eliminate waste in spending. That is not 
something which is preferred, and yet the government has made 
large cuts. That is duplicity.
<P>
	The government had the hypocrisy to say that it would protect 
health care for Canadians. It promised it would ensure portability. 
It argued the Reform Party had a two-tier system.
<P>
	The funding for health care by the federal government, when it 
was first instituted, was to be maintained at the 50 per cent level. 
That has been reduced to 27 per cent. Now the government is 
saying it will guarantee stable funding two or three years from now. 
It is guaranteeing that $11 billion will go to the provinces. What 
security does the Canadian public have that the federal government 
will stick to that solution?
<P>
	I have a suggestion for the federal government to consider in 
terms of health care. We have something more. We like to highlight 
an alternative. This is a health  care bill, after all. The alternative 
we are suggesting is medicare plus. We are talking about other 
options and improvements for the system which the federal 
government is too afraid to approach. It needs input. It needs 
debate. It is not the final Reform Party platform. It is not the final 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1778"> 1778 </A></B>
<P>
Reform Party position. However, it should not be rejected out of 
hand, like the Liberals are doing, by labelling it a two-tier system.
<P>
	The objectives we have are to ensure the stability of funding and 
to focus our existing resources on the core and essential services. If 
the Canadian Medical Association, the public and the experts could 
help us to come up with a definition of core, we could get on to 
choices beyond medicare, choices which would reduce the existing 
line-ups.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The medicare we have is vital and important and is something I 
will always argue in favour of and I will gladly pay my tax dollars 
to support it. However, we must make it efficient and effective and 
return to the best health care safety net in the world.
<P>
	We have to remove the existing funding freeze. If we can we 
should give more money and look at restoring the per capita 
transfers to the 1992-93 levels rather than what the Liberals are 
doing, cutting by stealth.
<P>
	Maybe we should consider converting the remaining cash 
transfers to tax point transfers. Index growth in transfers with 
economic and population growth trends; keep in touch with what is 
happening in society.
<P>
	Focusing resources was another suggestion. Canadians need to 
define what constitutes core, essential health care services. For a 
broken arm one type of cast could cost more than another. Let us 
guarantee the cost. If other services are needed then there may be 
other ways to pay for it. Perhaps other people have suggestions on 
how funds could be raised for that.
<P>
	Choices beyond medicare, we should consider removing existing 
restrictions in law which prohibit choices in basic health care 
beyond the publicly funded health care, medicare.
<P>
	This is what the federal government stubbornly refuses to do. 
Where medicare does not meet the needs of Canadians, they should 
have the option to exercise these choices by finding services 
elsewhere if outside the scope of the core services.
<P>
	Where Canadians exercise choice beyond medicare they will be 
responsible for arranging appropriate, private funding of such 
choices either with employer-employee benefit plans, third party 
insurance or through private resources.
<P>
	This gives the provinces the flexibility. The five principles of 
medicare can still be ensured and guaranteed, but it gives the 
provinces some room to  manoeuvre. These are things the federal 
government refuses to accept or even consider.
<P>
	I have seen a copy of some talking points the federal government 
has given to its 177 members in terms of what to say on certain 
issues; how to brag about revisions to the MP pension plan it so 
proudly boasted about in the red book; that it has eliminated double 
dipping and that it has done this and that. Yet notwithstanding all 
the bragging comments, the government still has a pension plan 
four to five times better than that in the private sector and it still 
tries to justify its pension plan, the millions of dollars members 
will receive after leaving the House on the basis of the low $64,000 
salary in the House.
<P>
	I will read one of the talking points which will show the 
hypocrisy and duplicity. It will give further evidence of these two 
words through some specific examples: ``It is always intriguing to 
watch the right-wingers practice what they preach. The Ontario 
Tories have proposed a 5 per cent pay increase for themselves 
while slashing hospitals and social programs. At the same time, the 
Reform MP for Calgary Centre has proposed more than doubling 
MP salaries to $150,000 while his party has advocated two-tier 
medicare and the demolition of seniors' pensions. Our government 
has different priorities''.
<P>
	Liberals are being told what to say out there, what to tell the 
Canadian public. This is so hypocritical and so duplicitous, it 
forces me to address this. I take exception to the use of political 
partisanship and the political game to this extent.
<P>
	It says the provincial Tories have proposed a 5 per cent increase 
for themselves where they just announced they have rolled the 
MPP pensions into compensation and above board, taxable, look 
after yourself, thank you very much type of job. In fact, they have 
done the exact opposite. It is a 5 per cent decrease, according to the 
MPP pension plan in the Department of Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The nerve of the government saying right-wing provincial 
governments slash hospitals and social programs. Excuse me, does 
it not realize who gives them the money? Does it not realize who is 
supposed to help fund social programs, hospitals and education? 
Who receives $7 billion less for education, health care and 
welfare? It is the provinces.
<P>
	The government brags about the cuts it has made to program 
spending. All it has done is give the provinces less, which then in 
turn have to find the ways and means of delivering the same level 
of service they did before with less money.
<P>
	Who gets rocks thrown at their windows? Who gets the rallies 
and the special interest groups complaining about what is happen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1779"> 1779 </A></B>
<P>
ing? It is the provincial governments of  Alberta and Ontario. They 
are the ones that get all the rallies, not the federal government. The 
federal government has been very smooth and good at reducing 
transfers to provinces, making them come up with the solutions, 
making the provincial governments the guilty party and at the same 
time increasing transfers to individuals.
<P>
	The federal government has slashed spending to hospitals and 
education to the tune of $6.6 billion versus what we would have 
done, only $3.5 billion.
<P>
	The government talks of compensation. It refers to me, the 
member for Calgary Centre, that I recommended doubling MP 
salaries. That is another hypocritical, duplicitous and self-serving 
statement. Every member knows the compensation in the House. 
They know the compensation consists of $64,000 on a yearly basis. 
There are two tax free allowances which we all get of $29,000. If 
that were transparent and taxable like everybody else's in the 
country, such as teachers and professors, that alone would equate to 
around $120,000.
<P>
	I have not recommended doubling the salary to $120,000. What I 
am saying is that what members in the House already receive as 
salary is probably close to between $120,000 and $130,000.
<P>
	All I am asking is to quit justifying this gold plated MP pension 
plan on the basis of one part of their salary when there are more 
parts to that salary than they pretend. That is hypocritical, that is 
duplicitous, it is self-serving and it is not coming clean with the 
Canadian public. I for one will not stand for.
<P>
	I think it is stupid that any member of Parliament uses arguments 
like that to convince people of the sacrifice they have made to 
justify the millions of dollars after they leave the House. I find that 
offensive and I will never defend something like that.
<P>
	I have given up an MP pension plan here. I will never qualify for 
one no matter how long I work here. I have to look after myself. I 
appreciate the government's doing that but even there it played a 
stupid game. It restricted future members from not being able to 
opt out. It gave it only to this crop of honest MPs from the Reform 
Party who stood on principle and put their money where their 
mouth is; but not this government.
<P>
	The government says it has different priorities. You bet it does. 
Its priorities consist of broken promises, distorting the truth or 
exaggerating the truth, bragging to the public about its 
achievements.
<P>
	Broken promises; it promised to protect civil servants and fired 
44,000. It promised to renegotiate NAFTA and endorsed it carte 
blanche. We all know about the GST promise. Members opposite, 
members within the government are being kicked out because they 
know what they said door to door. They did not go door to door 
reading page 22 of the red book. Everyone of these hypocritical 
members of that party knows that.
<P>
	For the Prime Minister to stand in the House today and say ``read 
page 22, that is what we said'', is a bunch of crap, and he knows it 
is crap. That is not what they said door to door. That is broken 
promises. That is hypocritical. That is duplicitous. That is 
self-serving and that is not coming clean with the Canadian public.
<P>
	Talk about distorting the truth, they say Reformers would cut 
$25 billion in one year. That is not true. We would not cut $25 
billion in one year. The truth is we would have cut $25 billion over 
three years.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Calgary Centre may not mind it but I am having a devil of a time 
trying to listen to everybody at once. It is in the best spirit of debate 
in this House that whoever has the floor be given the opportunity to 
speak clearly without interruption.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know I have hit a nerve when they start 
yelling. I know I am hitting the truth when they start to rebut.
<P>
	I was giving examples. I am not trying to inflame or exaggerate; 
I am trying to be factual. I have given examples on distorting the 
truth.
<P>
	Who is slash and burn? Not us. It is this government unloading 
onto the provinces and bragging to the public about its 
achievements on deficit elimination, deficit reduction, that they 
broke the back of the deficit. If a $30 billion deficit is breaking the 
back of the deficit, if projecting a $24 billion deficit next year is 
breaking the back of the deficit, if adding $111 billion to the debt is 
putting Canada's financial house in order, we damn well do need a 
new finance minister. We need a new CEO and a vice-president of 
finance because these two people are doing this country a great 
disservice.
<P>
	Worst of all this government has different priorities which really 
frustrates me. The government has the priority of cover-up from 
the department of defence where it covers up on Somalia. Here is a 
minister who gives instructions which are not even followed. Is 
that respect? He is out of control with his department just as the 
Minister of Health is with his.
<P>
	The Krever commission was set up to find out the truth. I have a 
letter from a lady whose husband died as a result of tainted blood. 
She also has it now because they did not come clean with her and 
tell her what was going on. They did not provide adequate 
information to prevent her infection. This lady is going to die and 
what does the government do? What does the justice minister do? 
They comply with all these idiot groups that want to ban the release 
of what the Krever commission is finding out. Is that serving the 
Canadian public?
<P>
	Something went wrong. Do Canadians not have the right to know 
what went wrong? We are not looking to  jail anybody, we just want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1780"> 1780 </A></B>
<P>
the truth. We want to know what happened and when it happened. 
The government should be embarrassed about that. If that is the 
kind of government the Liberals like, if those are their priorities, 
they are welcome to them.
<P>
	I would have nothing to do with this. It is frustrating. I heard the 
Liberals say one thing in opposition. I read about it and heard about 
it and now the Liberals are the same as the Tories. They are doing 
what they want in government. It is not right.
<P>
	This country deserves justice. It deserves honesty from its 
politicians. It deserves more than simple rhetoric, saying one thing 
to get elected and then laughing and doing something else once 
there. The Canadian public deserves more and it can get more. 
There are more Liberal backbenchers with more integrity than any 
I see along the front line of this House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note 
with some interest that the member mentioned our country's blood 
supply system. The important Krever inquiry has been put into 
place because the Liberals in opposition called for it and saw fit to 
put it in place.
<P>
	The member's colleague from Port Moody-Coquitlam 
discussed the blood system at some length earlier in the debate. I 
want to assure all members that a safe and secure blood supply 
system is of critical importance to me as well. It is an issue I am 
fairly familiar with. It has been a horrible piece of our history 
which we need to address.
<P>
	Both members have forgotten, or perhaps they have chosen to 
overlook the fact that this government is taking a leadership role on 
the issue of the blood supply system. On March 11 the Minister of 
Health announced his initiative to put a plan of action in place in 
order to be prepared when Justice Krever submits his final report. 
On the interim recommendations of Justice Krever, the Minister of 
Health has already put in place a number of those 
recommendations to make sure the system is cleaned up.
<P>
	This is a leadership issue. That is what the Reform members and 
many Canadians have called for, leadership. In the course of this 
debate I have not heard what the Reform Party would do on this 
critical issue. Perhaps the members opposite could share very 
specifically with this House their proposals to improve our blood 
supply system. What is the member's idea for what we can do to 
show leadership? What would he do on the blood supply system if 
he were in government?
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment the hon. member on her 
position on the blood inquiry. I do not find that I disagree very 
much with what she said. It does bother me though and I do 
question whether she got my point about duplicity, saying one thing 
and doing another.
<P>
	The member stands up and brags about how it was the Liberal 
Party that commissioned the inquiry. She then fails to go ahead. 
She is like the finance minister; he only does one side of the 
equation and never does the other side.
<P>
	The other side of the equation is: Why will the government not 
allow the information the commission is gathering, the facts of the 
blood inquiry it is receiving, to be released? Why is the muzzle 
being put on by the government? The member may brag about 
striking the commission and putting it in place, but why will this 
new information not be released?
<P>
	The member asks what I would do if I were the Minister of 
Health. I would need all the facts before I would make a decision. 
One thing I know I would do is I would make sure to have 
something in place before all these victims died. Perhaps there are 
as many as 12,000 victims, I do not know.
<P>
	A personal friend was affected by this and he died at a very 
young age. He was just a boy and got tainted blood. It really comes 
close to my heart when I see this. These families are victims no 
different from and no less than victims of crimes by weapons or 
physical abuse. This is something serious. I would have at least 
addressed the victims. I would have told them how they would be 
compensated and when and what would be left for their families 
when they passed away so that there would be some security in the 
future. That is not being addressed. That is being avoided. The hue 
and cry out there is for that to be resolved.
<P>
	I would not muzzle the final report of the commission. I would 
allow for its timely release and would let the cards fall where they 
may. For those who were supposed to be responsible, those who did 
a good job would be complimented. Those who did a poor job 
would be reprimanded. Those who were guilty of any criminal 
actions would then pay the price for it, nothing more, nothing less. 
A lot of people are dying.
<P>
	Those are the things I would do. I am not a medical expert. I do 
know that the system and a whole department has come under 
question. The Canadian Red Cross, my gosh, I have always looked 
up to that organization. I have given blood and I still do.
<P>
	If something happened, tell us what happened so we can avoid it 
in the future. There is nothing to run and hide from. Why cover up? 
That is why I am accusing this government of cover up. That is 
what it is doing.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to address some of the comments the hon. member has 
just brought forward is very significant. Before coming to this 
place, I came out of the health care profession and I had dealt 
internationally with Red Cross centres and blood supplies around 
the world.
<P>
	Hindsight is wonderful vision. In the early eighties when we 
were reading the scientific literature regarding  HIV and all of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1781"> 1781 </A></B>
<P>
proposals that were coming forward there had to be a judgment 
call: Is this significant enough to test at this point; is the test 
specific enough to identify this particular virus if it can be called a 
virus? It is an example of a microbe that encapsulates itself and 
changes over time. It is not something that can be pinpointed very 
specifically, identified, chased down and a concoction found that 
would immediately cure or prevent this very dreadful disease. Back 
in the early eighties it was very much a judgment call. Looking 
back, perhaps we did not make the best judgment as early as we 
should have in the history of our blood supply.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member for Calgary Centre that the 
Canadian Red Cross is one of the most honourable institutions in 
the world. It is one of the most highly respected blood supply 
sources.
<P>
	I have worked in that field where there are transmissible diseases 
such as hepatitis, AIDS and many other things we cannot even 
begin to test for or identify. We go through a spectrum of tests 
which is broad enough and significant enough that we can 
guarantee Canadians and whoever else across this world uses our 
blood supply that we are giving them the best product that can be 
tested and identified in the marketplace today.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	I have worked internationally in other blood supply systems. It is 
like setting an aeroplane and navigation system. If one makes the 
system so absolutely perfect that it is foolproof, there would never 
be a child flying to Disneyworld to see that great and wonderful 
spectacular event. Yet we can do things within a realm of safety and 
predictability that we provide a product which is safe and available 
for those in need of health care. There will come a time when we 
have a synthetic and artificial blood supply that can transport 
oxygen throughout the body and maintain a healthy body without 
the risk of those transmissible diseases.
<P>
	The Canadian Red Cross may not be perfect. Perhaps it did not 
make its decision soon enough to trust that international literature 
and scientific reports were significant enough that we should 
challenge and start testing, although it was not as specific or as 
good as it should have been at the time.
<P>
	I would challenge the hon. member. There is a lot to be thankful 
for in our Red Cross in the safety and respect it holds throughout 
the world in this very valuable blood product.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments and the 
intervention by the hon. member. I found that her from the heart, 
off the top of her head defence of the Canadian Red Cross and of 
the blood system and relating to us her past experience were very 
admirable. An even better compliment is that it was much better 
than the department's canned speech she read a couple of weeks 
ago. Maybe she should speak her mind more often and  we would 
all be better off based on her wisdom and her knowledge. This 
House could benefit from it, with respect.
<P>
	The member knows darn well that I am not criticizing the Red 
Cross. I am criticizing a system that has been set in place. The 
information has to be gathered and should be shared with the many 
people who suffered. The victims of the tainted blood want to know 
what happened. That is all they want to know. I do not think they 
want to go on a witch hunt. They just want to know. I do not know 
why this government is catering to the former ministers of health, 
the pharmaceutical agencies and the people who are now filing 
legal petitions to prevent this report from being made public. That 
is the part I do not understand.
<P>
	My point today in debate was to point out that this government is 
hypocritical in its actions and is duplicitous in the self-serving 
rhetoric it uses. I tried to give specific examples. A lot of the time 
the rhetoric is good. In fact a lot of time it is the same as ours and I 
would swear that the government stole some of our speeches, but 
its actions are not the same and do not match the rhetoric that it 
uses.
<P>
	That is a disservice to the Canadian public. It is a disservice to 
the government. Canadians are much smarter than a lot of 
politicians give them credit for. In our isolated little world here we 
tend to believe what we see on TV, what we read in the newspapers, 
the national media types. We think that is what is important but it is 
not. What is important is the grassroots. Our constituencies are 
what are important and we should always stay in touch with them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-18 sponsored by the Minister of Health. 
It is an act to establish the Department of Health and to amend and 
repeal certain acts. The substance of the act is ostensibly to take 
into account the reorganization of Health Canada to operate now as 
Health Canada as opposed to health and welfare.
<P>
	There subsequently have been some changes to the original bill. 
One had to do with ministerial responsibility. There has been an 
important motion made to amend Bill C-18 in a way that will 
continue to ensure ministerial accountability under the laws of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Canada has the best health care system in the world. That is 
undeniable. There are five principles of the Canada Health Act. 
One of those principles is universality: health care is available to 
all Canadians. I will speak more about that a little later on.
<P>
	The second principle is public administration. The third 
principle is portability which means that people can receive the 
health care services they need regardless of where they live or 
where they travel in Canada. The fourth principle is accessibility. 
This ensures that health care is reasonably accessible for the 
important health 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1782"> 1782 </A></B>
<P>
care needs of Canadians. The final principle is comprehensiveness. 
This means that our health care system continues to provide the 
broadest range of essential or necessary health care componentsto Canadians.
<P>
	These are the five principles which the Government of Canada 
and the Minister of Health continue to talk about to the Canadian 
people. They also talk about its implications to Canada as a 
country.
<P>
	There has been a lot of discussion about the possibility of things 
like extra billing, user fees or some other special arrangements but 
that is not the philosophy or the principles of the Canada Health 
Act.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act and its five principles are a very 
important component of Canadian unity. They are principles which 
I believe have made probably the largest contribution to keeping 
Canada together and keeping it strong and united. It is a fibre that 
transcends all partisan politics, notwithstanding the comments just 
heard from the previous speaker.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act represents an instrument of the Canadian 
government. It represents the principles that we want to share with 
all Canadians, features such as helping those most in need first. We 
want to make sure that under any circumstance Canadians will 
never feel alone when it comes to their health care and other social 
needs.
<P>
	We want to make sure Canadians understand that in our health 
system, the best system in the world, they will receive health care 
not because they have money but because they are sick. That is a 
principle and a value of which I am very proud and about which 
most Canadians are very proud.
<P>
	The previous speaker talked about long line-ups in hospitals and 
a number of other things. I want to comment briefly on line-ups in 
hospitals. I spent a number of years as a trustee for the hospital in 
my community of Mississauga, the Mississauga General Hospital, 
a 600-bed facility with an excellent, well-trained and 
well-qualified staff.
<P>
	A tremendous metamorphosis in health care has taken place over 
the last decade. The changes within the health care system are 
substantial in that there was, as evidenced, a shift or a reduction in 
the average length of stay by patients in hospitals from somewhere 
in the neighbourhood of 7.2 days average to about 4.2 days. That 
represents a very significant efficiency, a productivity 
improvement and a savings to the hospital environment to deliver 
care.
<P>
	During that period, the Mississauga hospital reduced the number 
of beds from some 600 down to below 500 beds. However, in terms 
of the statistics, the hospital continued to serve more patients than 
it did as a 600-bed facility. One of the critical reasons for that has to 
do with  the shift in philosophy toward ambulatory care. It used to 
be that one would go into the hospital and prepare for a surgical 
procedure maybe a day or two in advance and stay a little longer. 
Now one goes in a little later, the day of surgery, and then goes 
home early enough to convalesce in one's home environment, 
which the medical profession has found to be a more conducive 
environment to the healing process. The other aspect of the shift to 
ambulatory care is basically for people to receive their services and 
then move out. All of this has resulted in substantial savings to the 
health care system over the years.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The funding of hospitals is a joint responsibility between the 
federal and provincial governments. Through the transfers to the 
provinces, the federal government funds a very substantial portion 
of health care costs but it is administered and managed by the 
provincial governments. Through that administration certain funds 
are granted for capital purposes as well as for operating budgets.
<P>
	It is up to the provinces to deliver the capital and the operating 
revenue necessary under certain guidelines concerning which they 
have some discretion. However they have no discretion with regard 
to the five principles of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	The savings that were achieved over these many years as a result 
of improved technologies, of care giving and medicine, of the shift 
to an ambulatory based system and simply due to productivity 
improvements in the health care sector, went to benefit the 
provincial governments. As announced by the Minister of Finance 
in his first budget two years ago, changes were made in the 
transfers to the provinces with regard to the various elements of the 
transfers. It is now called the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	The federal government never got benefit or credit for those 
savings or efficiencies within the health care system. They were all 
left to the provinces. This ensured they had the kinds of tools 
necessary to maintain, protect and defend the principles of the 
Canada Health Act. Now the government must make sure it is 
doing even better and will continue to do better with the limited 
dollars available for all spending purposes and for the health and 
welfare of all Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to highlight a couple of features of the Canada 
health and social transfer. This instrument and the so-called block 
funding was created by a situation to do with the combined value of 
the cash transfers to the provinces as well as tax points, or the 
ability to tax at the provincial level.
<P>
	One thing that occurred was that the cash component of those 
transfers was beginning to be reduced. In circumstances where 
provinces had violated certain principles of the Canada Health Act, 
the federal Minister  of Health would have stepped in and after 
some review and time for correction, would have withheld certain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1783"> 1783 </A></B>
<P>
amounts of cash transfers to the province, until such time as the 
province desisted from a particular activity.
<P>
	As long as there is a cash component in the transfer to the 
provinces, the federal government has the opportunity to enforce 
the principles of the Canada Health Act. However, it was very clear 
that in time the cash component would disappear. In fact, the 
federal government would not have an opportunity to enforce the 
principles of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	As a result, the combination of various levels of transfers, not 
only for health but for post-secondary education and the Canada 
assistance plan, does provide some latitude where cash under all of 
the block funding will be available for an extended period.
<P>
	Since that time the finance minister has also put in place as a 
result of the budget a new funding arrangement that provides an 
iron clad guarantee that the cash cannot fall below $11 billion.
<P>
	Fiscal responsibility was an issue about which the previous 
speaker wanted to spend quite a bit of time talking. The federal 
government has shown a continued, strong and unwavering 
commitment to the five principles of the Canada Health Act and an 
unwavering commitment to ensure there is a cash component 
available to the provinces so they can continue to administer the 
health system and still respect the five principles of the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	I want to make a comment about some other items, having been 
a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Health since January 1994. The committee has looked at a couple 
of areas and the member touched on them, for instance, cigarettes. 
The members of the committee looked at health warning labels on 
tobacco products, as well as plain paper packaging. There were a 
number of other initiatives which the committee has considered 
because of statistics, such as 40,000 Canadians die each year as a 
result of tobacco use.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	These issues are important to Canadians. They want us to 
continue to look at ways in which we can provide cost effective 
health care and also shift the emphasis away from cures and 
remedies to prevention. That is the important issue.
<P>
	Today Canada spends approximately 75 per cent of its health 
care dollars on curative or remedial approaches and only 25 per 
cent on prevention. It is becoming very evident that to continue 
spending money at those levels is unsustainable. Ways have to be 
found to shift those dollars into the preventive sphere so that 
savings can be achieved and the costs which will be incurred 
forgone if certain products are not used more responsibly in our 
society.
<P>
	Tobacco is one of those products. Another which is very 
important to me these days has to do with alcohol consumption, 
and particularly the misuse of alcohol. My private member's Bill 
C-222 calls for health warning labels on alcoholic beverage 
containers.
<P>
	A number of people have asked why I am doing this. The answer 
is painfully obvious to many Canadians. In fact, some 19,000 
people die each year from alcohol related causes. Alcohol costs 
Canada approximately $15 billion in health care costs, social 
program costs, criminal justice costs and productivity. Fifty per 
cent of family violence cases are related to alcohol abuse. One in 
six family breakdowns are related to alcohol abuse. Thirty per cent 
of suicides are related to alcohol abuse. Forty per cent of 
automobile accidents are related to alcohol abuse. I could go on and 
on. Everyone knows how terrible it is in our society. The costs are 
very significant.
<P>
	The direct alcohol related cost of some $15 billion is only a 
portion of it. The ripple effect and the impact on families and 
friends is far more than $15 billion.
<P>
	Five per cent of birth defects are caused by alcohol consumption. 
There is a problem known as fetal alcohol syndrome. Medical 
expenses incurred during the lifetime of a fetal alcohol child cost 
Canadians approximately $1.5. million. Fetal alcohol syndrome 
costs Canada approximately $2.7 billion a year. Another problem is 
known as fetal alcohol effects. It is very similar to fetal alcohol 
syndrome, but it does not have the same physical effects. However, 
it occurs two to three times more than FAS.
<P>
	This is the kind of thing at which the health care system has to 
look. We are talking about tens of billions of dollars in expenses 
because products are misused. People do not take care of 
themselves or they do not make positive lifestyle choices.
<P>
	These are the things which are important to Canadians. They 
want to ensure that health care dollars are spent wisely and that we 
look at ways to save money on direct health care, as well as 
reducing the demand on the system so that we can ensure its long 
term sustainability for all Canadians for generations to come. That 
is the important message.
<P>
	I have listened to other speakers. I understand the role of 
opposition members and that they have to be critical of the 
government. However, I do not understand how partisan speeches 
can be given in the House which talk about hypocrisy, duplicity, 
broken promises and cover-ups, and then attempt to talk eloquently 
about the blood commission.
<P>
	The blood commission affects many Canadians. It is very tragic. 
I want all Canadians to know our blood supply system today is safe. 
Immediate steps were taken to ensure the safety of our blood 
supply system.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1784"> 1784 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	However, that does not relieve us of the responsibility to have an 
inquiry, the Krever commission, to look at all of the things that 
happened during that period to ensure we understand what 
happened, that we make sure there is nothing left to correct, to 
ensure there is no future risk to our blood supply system. Those are 
the things that are important.
<P>
	Canadians need to have that confidence level. They need to have 
the feeling we are doing the right things. I do not think they got it 
from the comments made by the previous speaker who tended to 
suggest that somehow there were still problems here.
<P>
	Anytime is a good time to get the facts right. If it takes more 
time to make sure they are right so we can have the correct 
information in order to make correct decisions, then I say we have 
to move on with this.
<P>
	The commission is doing its work. The same can be said with 
regard to the Somalia case and members' compensation, which the 
member wanted to talk about. He showed a tremendous amount of 
frustration but I do not want to fall into that trap.
<P>
	I simply want to reiterate for all members and for all Canadians 
that the Canadian health care system is the very best in the world. 
We are the envy of every other country. We have principles which 
the federal government is committed to defend and to protect. We 
will never leave any person in Canada without the protection of our 
health plan.
<P>
	The principle all Canadians should remember is that in Canada 
health care will be available to you not because you have money 
but because you are sick. The Prime Minister has made that 
commitment. I trust the Prime Minister and I know Canadians trust 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for Mississauga South and the 
member for Calgary Centre who both touched on a very important 
aspect of the Krever commission debate on Canada's blood supply. 
However, they did not explore it as fully as I would like to in my 
remarks.
<P>
	We sometimes have the problem that rhetoric gets in the way of a 
clear discussion of the consequences of events evolving around us. 
In the case of the Krever commission and the Somalia inquiry, the 
issue of the destruction of documents has been repeatedly raised. 
This is a central issue to the accountability of all government 
departments, including the accountability of Health Canada.
<P>
	If officials are allowed to destroy documents without fear of 
severe consequences, not only would the public be denied access to 
the truth but there would be no such thing as ministerial 
accountability. How could a minister know, be it the minister of 
defence or the health minister, what was actually occurring if 
officialswere  destroying documents and preventing people from getting at 
the truth?
<P>
	It is not just an issue of whether the media, the press or even MPs 
have access to the documents that tell the story, perhaps a very 
terrible story, the issue is whether the minister actually has access 
to these documents.
<P>
	The Access to Information Act contains no provision which 
specifically applies sanctions to government officials' destroying 
documents. This is a terrific omission. I will say publicly that the 
information commissioner, John Grace, has done a wonderful job 
in bringing before the public the entire issue of the destruction of 
documents.
<P>
	This is a very essential issue, essential to our very democracy, 
this question of whether officials, elected or unelected, can 
cover-up accidents of incompetence, to use the words of the official 
opposition. We are probably talking more about incompetence than 
malfeasance here.
<P>
	Unfortunately not only is there no provision in the Access to 
Information Act to prevent this, there is no other provision save for 
one clause. I do not remember the section number, but one section 
in the Criminal Code forbids government functionaries from 
deliberately wilfully destroying documents. However, the penalty 
is less than two years.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Opposition parties as well as government members would do 
well to pay very close attention to this failure in existing legislation 
to protect Canadians, to give Canadians the opportunity, be they 
elected officials or ordinary Canadians, to have access to the truth 
of what goes on in the events that affect them the most.
<P>
	I cannot prejudge the findings of either the Somalia inquiry or 
the Krever inquiry, but at issue here is not just what the truth was 
but whether the truth will ever be available to Canadians. On issues 
in all ministries, certainly in Health Canada, because decisions are 
made that affect human lives, we as Canadians need the 
opportunity to examine those decisions.
<P>
	I use the analogy of mad cow disease in Britain. Certain 
decisions were made by both government and bureaucrats that have 
put in jeopardy about $11 billion in the economy and possibly 
human lives as well. We need the opportunity when major 
government departments are making decisions on our behalf to to 
examine them to make sure those decisions are being made wisely 
and well.
<P>
	I think the member for Mississauga South would support me in 
suggesting that changes to the Access to Information Act would be 
of great assistance to giving the kind of accountability we demand 
of the best health service in the world, Health Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1785"> 1785 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member certainly does raise some 
interesting points. He said them quite well and I will not try to 
elaborate.
<P>
	However, I note from an extract of <I>Hansard</I> of November 18, 
1992 that the member for Cape Breton-East Richmond, the 
current Minister of Health, speaking to the then Minister of 
National Health and Welfare, called for a public inquiry into the 
blood supply conducted by individuals of the highest calibre and 
qualifications.
<P>
	On that basis I have absolutely no question in my mind the health 
minister is fully committed to dealing with the blood supply issue 
in the most thorough and open fashion possible.
<P>
	On March 11 of this year the minister did announce that he is 
calling on the partners in Canada's blood supply system to discuss 
how to redefine and renew the blood system. The minister has 
reaffirmed that all the partners in the blood system, including 
consumer groups, must work together to plan and provide for the 
preparation of the final recommendations of the commission of 
inquiry on the blood system in Canada.
<P>
	I do not want to belabour it, but I know the minister absolutely 
concurs with the member that information must be on the table. We 
are prepared to receive, now that we have the interim report of 
Justice Krever, the final recommendations to move forward to 
ensure we have a safe and secure blood supply system in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Mississauga South is obviously very well 
versed on health issues. I bring the following proposition to his 
attention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These past few weeks, the Minister of Health has been criticized 
by Bloc Quebecois members, and the Bloc's critic for health in 
particular, for his initiative concerning cheese made from raw milk. 
I am one of those members who represent rural ridings. Of course, 
prima facie, nobody wants stricter rules to be imposed on any 
industry, especially not one located in our own electoral riding.
<P>
	At any rate, the health minister did bring this issue to the 
attention of the House, or rather submitted it through the regulatory 
process to seek the public's opinion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I bring the following to the attention of the House. I do this with 
the concurrence of my electors. A constituent of mine, Mr. Robert 
Redmond, son of Mrs. Barbara and Mr. J.P. Redmond of Vankleek 
Hill, Ontario, is presently in a hospital in Toronto recovering from 
having contracted listeria bacteria, apparently from having 
consumed raw milk cheese. This person is now paralyzed.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I ask my colleague if he does not agree with me that as difficult 
as this issue is, the Minister of Health is right in at least gazetting 
this particular regulation to make sure that in a responsible way, 
which he is as the minister, that all sides of this issue be heard.
<P>
	I have more constituents who are dairy producers than anyone 
else in the House-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are here to discuss Bill C-18, not 
raw milk cheese. I think the hon. member is out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With all due respect for the 
hon. member, the issue of relevance is always a difficult one. A 
degree of flexibility comes into play. While the debate is on the 
critical issue of health, I think that the member can raise a health 
related issue.
<P>
	As I just said, with all due respect for the hon. member for 
Drummond, this is a matter of debate; it is not a point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, does my colleague not agree with me 
that the minister acted responsibly in ensuring this issue was 
gazetted and permitted that consultation to ensure that on one hand 
my dairy producer constituents are protected and that on the other 
people like Mr. Redmond, this young person paralysed in hospital 
today, also receive the protection of our health care system, and 
that the minister, knowing these issues are important, brought it to 
the committee?
<P>
	Would my colleague not agree that the minister in his power 
under this act did the appropriate thing in referring this issue to the 
gazetting process which permits that kind of consultation with 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the chief government whip raises a 
very important and timely issue. He is quite correct.
<P>
	As the minister indicated, we want to get all the facts and listen 
to Canadians before any decisions are taken. That is why he sent 
out draft regulations for a 75-day comment period.
<P>
	The government is not prepared to take risks with the health and 
safety of Canadians. Evidence suggests there may be increased 
risks of illnesses or disease when consuming cheese made from 
raw milk. Obviously from the example cited by the hon. member, 
this is a very important issue and I know it will receive due 
attention and care by the Government of Canada to ensure the 
health of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that  the question to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1786"> 1786 </A></B>
<P>
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Mercier-unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address this bill which seeks to create a superfluous 
department-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Superfluous?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Yes, superfluous. This bill will allow the House to 
spend over $1 billion and to hire 8,000 people before even treating 
one person and taking one medical action regarding a patient.
<P>
	I can understand that members opposite are a bit touchy when 
questioned about the establishment of such a department, which 
brings nothing new and which favours overlap more than anything 
else.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	These people of course are very sensitive; they get touchy when 
we raise this issue. All the more so because a debate like this one 
allows us to point out some electoral promises in the red book that 
have still not been kept. When we do that, they fidget and get upset.
<P>
	The establishment of this department shows us once again that 
the federal government seeks to act in an area of jurisdiction where 
it has no authority. I say it once again because this is not the first 
time this happens, since the House has considered bills to establish 
other departments also.
<P>
	Yet, the minister would have us believe that this is an act without 
much importance, that this is no big deal, as we say where I come 
from, and that the bill's aim is simply to change the department's 
name. Nonsense. It is more than that. I will take a few minutes to 
demonstrate that this is not true.
<P>
	When we read the bill and look at paragraph 4(2)(<I>a</I>), describing 
the minister's powers, duties and functions, we have to pay 
attention, because that is what the whole bill is about.
<P>
	This provision says that the promotion and preservation of the 
physical, mental and social well-being of the people of Canada will 
be ensured by the department. What a fine plan of action. With 
such a mandate, however, the minister is using the physical, mental 
and social well-being of the population to interfere even more in 
the area of health. This is the federal government's excuse for 
claiming a legitimate authority over a matter of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. This issue has already been raised in this 
House, and it has also been raised in other legislatures throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	Discussions over this intrusion clearly show that everybody is 
fed up. The BNA act of 1867 provides for provincial primacy over 
health. That provision has not been amended, as far as I know. The 
federal government does not have any power over health except 
what flows  from its spending power, which it interprets in a such a 
way as to set up departments in areas over which it has no 
jurisdiction whatsoever. The federal spending power is a licence to 
do as it pleases.
<P>
	It is also because of this spending power that this government 
and the previous one have accumulated a huge debt. While driving 
us ever deeper into debt, this government is reducing transfer 
payments to provinces. These payments are being constantly 
reduced, yet they are made under certain conditions. The provinces 
can lose them if those conditions are not met. And successive 
budgets have made cuts.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Let us consider what happened recently in British Columbia, 
where new welfare measures and structures were put into place. 
Since these structures and measures did not meet national 
standards, the Minister of Human Resources Development told the 
provincial authorities that they would suffer the consequences if 
they did not move toward those standards, because there would be 
cuts.
<P>
	In fact, I do not think that this situation has been resolved. In 
fact, negotiations between the federal government and that 
province are still going on. These negotiations are time-consuming 
and extremely costly. In the meantime, the recipients, the people in 
need, are getting low quality, substandard services. Therefore, 
within specific programs, the money allocated to the people in need 
is not totally spent on them. If we take into account all the money 
that is spent on management and on discussions at various levels, 
what is left? Very little, only half of what should have been 
allocated to the programs and gone directly to the citizens.
<P>
	However, a lot of existing acts ensure that the doors are wide 
open-and I say wide open-for the health department to intrude 
on areas under provincial jurisdiction. There are, for instance, the 
Criminal Code, the Narcotic Control Act and the Food and Drugs 
Act, where the central government is getting fully involved.
<P>
	Of course there is duplication in health care. I have always 
wondered why members of the armed forces were not treated by 
the same physicians as everybody else. Why was this kind of health 
care system created within the armed forces? You certainly know 
that the army has its own physicians, its own dentists and its own 
psychiatrists. They have a parallel system for every type of health 
care service found in a province.
<P>
	Imagine the costs. Imagine the savings we could make if these 
people used the services provided by the provinces. But no, the 
army had to build this large structure that cost a lot of money. 
Moreover, the army had to have the required infrastructure to 
accommodate these people, so it built military hospitals across the 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1787"> 1787 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us not forget about the social health services that are mainly 
for aboriginal people and residents of northern Canada. This is all 
duplication. Since aboriginal people are under federal jurisdiction, 
the health department is responsible for them. Duplication, 
overlap, and at what cost?
<P>
	I can easily understand why our debt is growing so rapidly. 
Canadians are making the necessary effort to pay taxes in order to 
reduce this debt, but the government is not doing what needs to be 
done. It is creating parallel structures while we can barely pay the 
interest on the debt.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The federal government has no right to interfere in these areas, 
but it is doing so anyway. It is doing so with Bill C-18. It wants the 
right to interfere in the area of health care. This is just one more 
instrument to launch debates between the provinces, debates that 
lead absolutely nowhere. Let us leave these rights where they 
belong.
<P>
	If members look at the funding aspect, they will see that 
something is wrong in this bill. Members will recall that transfers 
to the provinces do not come from the health department but from 
the finance department.
<P>
	This is a situation I would call ludicrous. The Department of 
Health will set its national objectives, the standards to be met if the 
provinces are to get their money, but it is the Minister of Finance 
who eventually-although the cost has not yet been 
calculated-will make the decision, depending on what he wants to 
have as a deficit or a debt. He will decide what amount will be 
transferred. He sets the amounts himself without assessing the 
costs of the national standards.
<P>
	Putting it more clearly, this means that the Minister of Health 
tells the provinces what they need to do, and then the Minister of 
Finance hands over the money: ``Manage with that as you can''. 
Obviously, reducing transfer payments indicates a lack of cohesion 
somewhere. The objectives remain the same, but cannot be met if 
the financial resources are not there.
<P>
	In Quebec, what is transferred or not transferred, depending on 
the mood of the Minister of Finance, is tax points. Naturally, in the 
aftermath of the massive cuts to health and the Canada transfer to 
the provinces, Quebec will soon be receiving no more real money, 
just tax points. What does that mean? It means that the government 
will have to either limit services or increase taxes in order to 
provide quality services, yet with less money.
<P>
	What makes the situation ridiculous is that, once again, the 
federal government will continue to dictate to Quebec what it must 
do, while the federal government will not cough up one cent more.
<P>
	Contrary to what one might think, the Minister of Health plays a 
very great economic role as well. That economic role has 
repercussions within each region. When there is a shortfall 
somewhere, cuts somewhere, the entire population, the entire 
region feels it. In Health Canada's 1995-96 main estimates, it 
indicates financial requirements of a little more than $1 billion for 
operations.
<P>
	Very often, as I said at the beginning, when that money is spent 
on infrastructures or discussions here, there and everywhere, there 
is very little left for medical care for Canadians.
<P>
	I would also like to focus on the national forum on health, held in 
October 1994, when we were here in this House.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	It was obvious that this government wanted to increase its 
involvement in the area of public health. Visibility was the 
watchword of this forum. This government tries to pounce on 
everything that moves to increase its visibility. Instead of 
increasing its credibility, it increases its visibility. Flags are going 
to be flown all over the place; we are inundated with flyers from 
each department; they are very visible. But when the time comes to 
provide heath care, the government is no longer visible. It does not 
believe in high quality care. It would rather have little red flags on 
paper, brochures, and cheques instead of improving its credibility.
<P>
	It is no wonder so many people no longer trust politicians. It is 
very simple. When you do not take any action, when you act solely 
to be visible, you cannot expect any other outcome.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, as far as the national forum is concerned, I 
remind the House that every single province, not only Quebec, 
openly criticized the government's attitude. Why? Because the 
government wanted them to play second fiddle with regard to 
health. In this respect, many people can be quoted. The 
Conservative health minister in Ontario criticized the federal 
government, saying that the federal government's attempt to 
impose its own interpretation of the health care principles should 
be opposed.
<P>
	The Conservative premier of Alberta was of the same mind. He 
condemned the inflexibility of the federal government in that area.
<P>
	Furthermore, this government reneged on one of the red book 
promises. Let me quote it. It is said in the red book that ``a Liberal 
government will establish a National Forum on Health'', up to here 
everything is fine, ``chaired by the Prime Minister'', imagine, the 
Prime Minister himself will chair the forum, downplaying all other 
participants, but even that would have been acceptable, ``bringing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1788"> 1788 </A></B>
<P>
together for public discussion the major partners and parties 
involved with the health of Canadians''. So everybody was to be on 
the same level,  talking about health problems, with a moderator in 
the centre who just happens to be our Prime Minister.
<P>
	In spite of this firm commitment, again stated clearly in the 
Liberals' red book, the federal government refused to let the 
provinces participate fully in the proceedings of the national forum 
on health.
<P>
	This government wanted to grant provinces observer status only.
<P>
	As you are indicating that my time is almost up, I will conclude 
with the following. The provinces are should be the main players as 
far as health is concerned. The central government should review 
its intention to cut the Canada health and social transfer. It should 
no longer offload the deficit onto the provinces. Why? Because this 
impacts on the quality of health care and adds to the financial 
burden of each and every Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak, at third reading stage, on Bill 
C-18, an act to establish the Department of Health and to amend 
and repeal certain acts.
<P>
	I believe it is essential to remind my fellow citizens that health is 
a provincial jurisdiction under sections 16(7) and (16) of the BNA 
Act of 1867, and the interpretation given to it by the courts. It is 
clearly established and recognized that health and social services 
are exclusively under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal 
government has often intruded in the health sector, over the years.
<P>
	Since the beginning of the century, the federal government 
passed the following health legislation. In 1919, it created its health 
department and gave its first grants; in 1948, it put in place a 
national program of health grants; in 1957, it passed the federal act 
on hospital insurance, in 1966, the medical care act and, in 1984, 
the Canada Health Act that superseded the 1957 and 1966 acts.
<P>
	Moreover, this act established the federal principles governing 
the Canadian health system, enacted national standards and, by the 
changes it imposed, limited Quebec's autonomy. Bill C-6 of 1984 
set out the criteria to be met by the provinces, including 
universality, accessibility, portability, public administration and 
comprehensiveness. Otherwise, the federal government might 
withhold its financial contribution to health care.
<P>
	The Quebec government has always condemned federal 
meddling in the area of health. In 1926, the Taschereau 
government-a good Liberal government, needless to say-was 
the first one to oppose federal interference in health care, and all 
successive Quebec governments have followed suit.
<P>
	Although the health and social service system appears to have 
originated in Ottawa, it was only used as an excuse by the federal 
government to gradually encroach  on an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. Every federal intrusion in health care forced the 
Quebec government to respond in order to regain full control and 
assert its determination to exercise its authority in an area under its 
exclusive jurisdiction.
<P>
	Let me remind the House, for example, of two great moments in 
Quebec's history with respect to health care. In response to the 
Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act passed by the 
House of Commons in 1957, Jean Lesage, then the Liberal premier 
of Quebec and a former minister in Lester B. Pearson's federal 
government, set up Quebec's hospital insurance plan, which was 
approved by the National Assembly in 1961.
<P>
	After the House of Commons passed the Medical Care Act in 
1966, Robert Bourassa's Liberal government introduced the health 
insurance act, which was adopted by the Quebec National 
Assembly in 1970.
<P>
	Over the years, the federal government's meddling cost 
taxpayers more and more money. Ottawa could afford to be 
generous as it was using the provinces' money or buying on credit 
through its own unlimited spending powers, which played a large 
part in getting all of us into debt.
<P>
	May I remind the House briefly that, during the second world 
war, the federal government invoked the war effort to encroach on 
the area of corporate and personal income taxes, which was then 
under provincial jurisdiction. This measure, which was supposed to 
be temporary, is still in place. The federal government has clearly 
succumbed to the temptation of exerting greater control and, 
instead of giving back to the provinces the taxation powers they 
enjoyed before the war, granting subsidies linked to the 
establishment of federally approved programs.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	By exercising such control over tax revenues, the federal 
government has been able to keep on centralizing, which caused 
untold duplication and shameful squandering of taxpayers' money. 
Worse yet, to make sure they would remain in office, generation 
upon generation of federal politicians distributed presents, even if 
it meant putting future generations of Quebecers, Canadians and, 
just for you, Madam Speaker, Acadians, into debt.
<P>
	In the report of 1987 commission of inquiry on health and social 
services in Quebec, Thomas Dupéré wrote that establishing federal 
programs merely shifted to the federal level a debate that had 
already started at the provincial level and would have led to the 
same results over the same period of time, give or take a few 
months or a few years.
<P>
	It is therefore pretentious to claim that, through its involvement, 
Ottawa has been an instigator in the social and health area. It would 
be more accurate to say that Ottawa's action was made much easier 
by the  concentration of resources that took place at the federal 
level during the second world war. Ottawa took over the provinces' 
idea of developing a health care system. After the federal 
government made an about-face in 1945, refusing to give back the 
taxation it was supposed to have taken away from the provinces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1789"> 1789 </A></B>
<P>
only on a temporary basis, Ottawa had the means to act, to carry out 
its plans to encroach on exclusive provincial powers.
<P>
	Today, in spite of the fact that health is clearly an area of 
provincial jurisdiction, Health Canada looms large. Its operating 
budget for 1995-96 is $1.5 billion, $347 million of which just goes 
to pay federal employees, from Newfoundland to British 
Columbia, to administer something that essentially comes under 
provincial jurisdiction and $703 million to procure goods and 
services for the department, while transfer payments to the 
provinces are $7 billion for the same year.
<P>
	Altogether more than $8 billion is being spent in an area that 
comes under provincial jurisdiction. That is one quarter of the past 
year's deficit. When we look at all the departments where there is 
duplication, it is easy to imagine what how much money this 
government is wasting and to see how the current situation came 
about.
<P>
	However, the federal government never indicated that it intended 
to loosen its grip on the Canadian health system. Also, during the 
election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada wrote in the red 
book, and I quote: ``The role of the federal government should 
include the mobilization of effort to bring together Canada's wealth 
of talent and knowledge in the health care field. This is a societal 
issue in which every Canadian has an interest. The federal 
government must provide the means to ensure that Canadians are 
involved and informed, and can understand the issues and the 
options''.
<P>
	For once, the Liberal Party kept its word. Last June 29, even 
though all the provinces were opposed, the then Minister of Health 
announced the creation of the national forum on health. The forum 
was to define a vision of the Canadian health system in the 21st 
century, to promote dialogue between Canadians concerning their 
health system, and to set priorities for the future.
<P>
	On October 14, 1994, Quebec's minister of health and social 
services, Jean Rochon, wrote to the federal Minister of Health to 
tell her, and I quote: ``The mandate of this forum is an 
encroachment by the federal government in a field which 
essentially falls under provincial jurisdiction, and that is 
unacceptable. The clearly stated objective of your government, 
which is to give the forum a mandate to define future priorities, in 
the context of health care reform, and to define the means to that 
end, is a direct intrusion in provincial governments' affairs. This is 
something that cannot be hidden behind the consultative nature you 
ascribe to the recommendations that would come out of this 
forum''.
<P>
	Incidentally, Mr. Rochon, the Quebec Minister of Health, was 
recently congratulated for the courage he  displayed in 
implementing the health reform in Quebec by one of his 
predecessors, Marc-Yvan Côté, who is well known to the Liberal 
Party of Canada, since it recruited him to be its chief organizer in 
Quebec, in anticipation of the next federal election.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	In his letter to the federal health minister, Mr. Rochon added that 
Quebec had not waited for the federal government to adjust its 
health care system according to current needs, and that extensive 
public consultations had already taken place.
<P>
	Moreover, he reminded his federal counterpart that cuts in health 
related transfers to the provinces were not the best way for a 
government to protect and to promote health care in Canada.
<P>
	Indeed, it is precisely these cuts that undermine the very 
principles stated in the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	While the federal government was pursuing its efforts to take 
control over a field of provincial jurisdiction, it unilaterally and 
drastically reduced its contributions to provincial health programs. 
In that regard, in the spring of 1995, the National Council of 
Welfare, whose role it is to give advice to the Minister of Health, 
warned the government against such a situation, saying that it 
would be very hypocritical to reduce contributions to provinces 
while increasing the requirements they have to meet.
<P>
	Yet, this is precisely what is happening. I should point out that, 
when the finance department created the program called 
established programs financing, through which transfers to 
provinces are made regarding social services, health and education, 
it was understood that such transfer payments would be indexed 
according to the growth in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Since 1986, the federal government has been using money from 
these transfers to contain its deficit. It made a unilateral decision, 
without any regard for the provinces' ability to cope. Between 1982 
and 1995, it saved, at the expense of Quebecers, $8 billion in the 
health sector alone. This shortfall forced Quebec to increase taxes 
to make up for the federal withdrawal.
<P>
	According to a study carried out by the C.D. Howe Institute 
between 1988 and 1992, while established programs financing 
expenditures remained stagnant, other federal program 
expenditures increased by 25.5 per cent. In other words, while the 
federal government was telling the provinces to tighten their belts, 
it continued to spend right and left and to add to the deficit and the 
debt.
<P>
	This lack of stability in federal health expenditures is a serious 
problem. Expenditures are in turn frozen, reduced or de-indexed 
according to the mood of the finance minister and the cash 
requirements of his department. We no longer have a fixed funding 
formula approved by all the governments. Funding is unilaterally  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1790"> 1790 </A></B>
<P>
and arbitrarily determined by the federal government, without any 
consideration for the real costs of the provincial programs.
<P>
	This constant change in the funding level, which is always 
dropping, has become a real nightmare for those involved in the 
health industry. What is worse is that the finance minister does not 
seem to realize that he is no longer juggling only with figures now, 
but that he is playing with the health of the Canadian population.
<P>
	Last February, in his latest budget, the finance minister decided 
to reduce once again health transfers to the provinces. In this area, 
Quebec stands to lose $650 million in 1996-97 and $1.9 billion in 
1997-98. That must be part of the benefits of federalism. It is 
important to note that when a federal government member says that 
federalism is profitable, he means it is profitable for the federal 
government, but costly for the provinces which do not have as 
much leeway as they used to.
<P>
	In the spring of 1995, the National Council of Welfare made 
these comments about the planned cuts to health care funding, and I 
quote: ``The measures announced in this budget would likely 
destroy a national social services system that took a whole 
generation to build''.
<P>
	Here is what the British Columbia health minister said about 
these cuts, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Last February's budget which cut transfers to provinces for 
health has forced provinces to look at unpalatable cuts that threaten 
medicare''.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If Canada's health minister was so concerned about the health 
care system in our country, he would have done what his colleague 
from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce did and would have opposed his 
government's last budget attacking social programs. He would 
have stood up in cabinet where these decisions are made and would 
have set the people's pressing needs for quality health care in 
Canada against the finance minister's figures. The health minister 
could have suggested to the government to get the money from 
those who benefit from many tax shelters, starting with the Liberal 
Party's generous financial backers, and not forgetting of course the 
finance minister's own companies.
<P>
	But this is not what he did. Today, he is proposing to us an old 
bill that was severely criticized by all stakeholders at second 
reading, during the first session of this 35th Parliament. A bill that 
is nothing but rehash, a bill that perpetuates the federal 
government's interference in health care, an area-we will never 
say it enough-under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Subclause 4(1) of the bill describes the powers, duties and 
functions of the minister while subclause 4(2) spells out what these 
functions encompass and deals with the  protection of the people of 
Canada against risks to health and the spreading of diseases. 
Having seen where that got us with raw milk cheeses, we can easily 
imagine that on the strength of these provisions the federal 
government would not hesitate to meddle further in the 
administration of health care in Canada.
<P>
	The bill before us is hypocritical enough to state, in clause 12, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nothing in this Act or the regulations authorizes the Minister or any officer or 
employee of the Department to exercise any jurisdiction or control over any 
health authority operating under the laws of any province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When provincial health funding is cut this drastically, there is 
direct interference in the operation of agencies operating under 
provincial authority, by reducing their ability to continue to offer a 
satisfactory level of services to the public.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois condemns this bill, because it sanctions the 
interference of the federal government in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. In the health field, Quebec has its priorities and must 
have the right to manage them independently, in accordance with 
the current Constitution. This bill does not talk about ensuring 
satisfactory and stable funding for health care. The minister has 
abdicated his responsibilities in this field and is taking his orders 
from the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	This bill attacks the provinces to such an extent, without helping 
them to solve the pressing problems they face, that even the most 
ardent federalists have decided to fight the initiatives of the health 
minister. Ontario's Conservative health minister said on September 
19 of this year that there should be opposition to the federal 
government's desire to dictate to the provinces its interpretation of 
the principles that should govern the health care system. That same 
day, Ralph Klein, the Conservative premier of Alberta, also 
condemn the federal government's inflexibility, with reference to 
the then minister.
<P>
	In a joint communiqué, on the occasion of a meeting of health 
ministers, the provinces declared that the federal government's 
desire to take unilateral decisions with respect to health funding, 
the interpretation of standards, and the setting of arbitrary 
deadlines for the termination of consultations was certainly not 
helping to resolve the problem.
<P>
	Because the federal government is not able to protect the public 
adequately against risks to health, and because its continual cuts 
constitute the main threat to the health of the people of Quebec and 
of Canada, the federal government should withdraw from the 
health field and transfer the corresponding fiscal resources to the 
provinces, allowing them to take over responsibility for this area 
with, at the very least, the same level of effectiveness as the federal 
government.

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (for Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-19, an act to implement the Agreement on Internal Trade, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak in favour of Bill 
C-19. This is an important piece of legislation and marks a major 
advancement in the quest to reduce barriers to trade within Canada 
and to open up the domestic market to the freer flow of goods and 
services.
<P>
	Bill C-19 is the result of a long process of consultation which has 
included many Canadians: people who are concerned aboutthe economic future of Canada; people who want to expandthe scope for employment and wealth creation for the benefit of allCanadians.
<P>
	In the years since 1867 the Canadian economy has grown and 
evolved in ways never imagined by the original Fathers of 
Confederation. The federal government still has constitutional 
responsibility for trade and commerce but over time individual 
provinces have assumed prominent roles which have influenced  
economic growth and have set regulations for the conduct of trade 
and commerce at their levels. As a result of this, a variety of ad hoc 
measures have been introduced over the years.
<P>
	We now have a system of federal, provincial and territorial 
trading arrangements and regulations which often conflict, which 
sometimes discriminate, and which can put Canadian businesses at 
a competitive disadvantage. Such barriers can cause the inefficient 
use of our economic resources and can limit the ability of our 
industries to take advantage of economies of scale and to maintain 
competitive market positions.
<P>
	There are many examples of such impediments to trade in 
Canada. There are different professional and occupational 
standards in different jurisdictions which can work to limit the 
mobility of labour between provinces. Some provincial liquor 
boards have followed selective listing policies which have the 
effect of discriminating against products from outside their 
jurisdictions. There are different transportation regulations 
covering safety codes, inspection arrangements and vehicle 
standards which make it difficult for truckers to operate in different 
provincial markets.
<P>
	Many local governments and other entities that have spent 
taxpayers' dollars practise procurement policies which give 
preference to local companies so that the ability to offer 
competitive sources of supply can be determined by geography and 
not by traditional marketplace measures such as price and quality.
<P>
	Some jurisdictions seek to attract new investment by offering 
special incentive programs for industry development which can 
distort normal risk-reward equations in the investment 
marketplace. Regulations governing construction procedures and 
building standards can differ from one jurisdiction to the next and 
cause difficulties for construction companies and labour alike.
<P>
	These are just some examples of barriers and impediments that 
can impact negatively on our ability to do business openly and 
freely in Canada. There are many many more. Thus we have in 
Canada a patchwork of regulations, standards and other barriers to 
interprovincial trade which have grown around us and which have 
become an unacceptable feature of the domestic marketplace.
<P>
	The business community has been aware of the negative impact 
of this situation for some time. Our government as well as other 
governments have heard from many representatives of the private 
sector who have assessed the problems in the domestic trading 
environment and who have been pressuring us to make necessary 
changes to open up the system.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1792"> 1792 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	These people and many others, including colleagues at the 
provincial and territorial levels, have recognized that a new trading 
regime has to be established, one based on more open 
interprovincial trade, one that will not impede the movement of 
people and investment within the country and one that will give us 
a mechanism to allow for co-operative approaches to the resolution 
of domestic trade disputes.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade, which was negotiated by the 
committee of ministers responsible for internal trade and signed in 
July 1994 by the Prime Minister and all the other first ministers of 
this country, gives us the framework to create such a new regime. 
Bill C-19 puts in place the legislative changes that need to be made 
at the federal level in order that the agreement can be implemented 
and the process of change can continue.
<P>
	With these changes, we will ensure that the framework for a new 
regime will be in place and that we can continue the work to 
remove barriers to interprovincial trade in goods and services as 
well as to reduce impediments to the movement of workers and 
capital between provinces. We will establish the forum for the 
resolution of individual trade disputes without resorting to the 
courts.
<P>
	By passing this bill, the House will show leadership to other 
Canadians and will confirm the intent of the federal government to 
make the changes necessary to create a new trading regime within 
Canada, one that reflects the political and economic realities of the 
day.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the process leading up to this bill has 
been a long one. It has involved many people and it has considered 
many issues and perspectives, both national and regional.
<P>
	Federal, provincial and territorial governments at both the 
ministerial and official levels have been extensively involved. It is 
important to note that political parties of all stripes and regional 
perspectives have been involved in the process. So have many 
sectors of the private sector, including business, labour and 
consumer organizations.
<P>
	A notable aspect of the process has been the spirit of 
co-operation which has consistently characterized the negotiations. 
There has been a high degree of goodwill from all parties. There is 
a shared recognition that the domestic trading environment must be 
improved and that it is up to governments to meet this need head 
on.
<P>
	The agreement represents a major step toward the shared 
objective of improving the domestic trading environment and 
eliminating the barriers to trade, investment and labour mobility. It 
gives us general rules that prevent governments from erecting new 
trade barriers and which require the reduction of existing ones in 
areas covered under the agreement. As well, it gives specific 
obligations in 10 economic sectors, streamlining of regulations and 
standards, a formal dispute resolution  mechanism and a 
commitment to liberalize trade further through continuing 
negotiations.
<P>
	This last point is important because the bill before the House 
does not signal the end of the process. It signals our support for a 
continuation of the process of domestic trade policy renewal and 
our commitment to make it work for all Canadians.
<P>
	The committee of ministers of internal trade, which achieved the 
current agreement, is now constituted as a permanent body to carry 
on the work of domestic trade policy renewal. A secretariat has 
been set up to provide administrative and technical support to 
ministers and negotiators in this work.
<P>
	A key aspect of the agreement, indeed, a key aspect of any 
trading agreement, is the method by which disputes that may arise 
under the agreement are to are to be resolved. While international 
trading agreements have useful lessons for us in Canada, none of 
their precedents was directly suitable. To meet the special needs of 
the Canadian situation, an approach was needed that would 
accommodate the federal-provincial system of power sharing. A 
dispute settling mechanism was needed that would deal with both 
general level compliance complaints, those based on the principles 
of free trade, as well as specific complaints from consumers and 
private business interests, those complaints that cannot be resolved 
by governments themselves.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	The challenge was to find solutions that would accommodate the 
desires of the provincial governments to retain the flexibility 
necessary to pursue their legitimate political and economic 
objectives under existing constitutional power sharing 
arrangements while at the same time providing a dispute settlement 
mechanism that would offer open access and cost efficient 
resolution without resorting to court action and enforceable 
implementation. This was the challenge and the agreement has 
given us a new model for handling trade disputes, a made in 
Canada model.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade sets out the framework for the 
new dispute resolution mechanism that is unique to the Canadian 
situation of federal and provincial power sharing and that provides 
for open access to the settlement process. The approach being 
followed commits all parties to the use of conciliation to address 
problems that may arise from the provisions of the agreement, 
including issues arising from the application of its principles, its 
rules and its individual sectoral agreements.
<P>
	Issues are to be resolved in the first instance on a government to 
government basis. In the case of an issue or problem of concern to a 
private individual or business that governments cannot or will not 
deal with and where the private interest is not satisfied, the 
complaint can be raised directly with a dispute resolution panel. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1793"> 1793 </A></B>
<P>
This is an  important feature. It means that individuals as well as 
governments can bring forward issues for consideration.
<P>
	In other words, a private party that feels harmed by an alleged 
unfair trade practice or policy can bring his concerns forward 
whether or not the government under whose jurisdiction a question 
has arisen agrees that there is a reviewable question.
<P>
	A defining principle of the internal trade agreement and of the 
dispute settlement process is an emphasis on open co-operation to 
solve problems. Disputing parties will be encouraged to make 
every attempt to arrive at a solution through consultation and 
conciliation.
<P>
	If consultation fails, governments or governments on behalf of 
individuals or individuals directly can ask to have a matter raised 
before a panel. The panel will consider the facts and, if appropriate, 
make recommendations for changed policies or behaviour.
<P>
	The underlying objective of the process is to promote changes in 
inconsistent behaviour and policies through recommendations and 
not by applying penalties or awarding damages. Concerns have 
been raised in some quarters that the federal government will be set 
up as the policeman of interprovincial trade under the provisions of 
Bill C-19. During committee hearings a few points of concern were 
raised on the language of the act with respect to the powers of the 
federal government under the act. These sections have been 
clarified and the bill that we now have for third reading reflects 
these changes.
<P>
	It is simply not true that the federal government is seeking to act 
as a policeman nor will the federal government have the power to 
act unilaterally on matters concerning internal trade because of Bill 
C-19. The ministerial level committee on internal trade is the main 
body responsible for the implementation and operation of the 
agreement, including the resolution of disputes.
<P>
	All governments which are party to the agreement, that is the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments, are members of that 
committee. At this time the committee is co-chaired by the Hon. 
James Downey, Minister of Industry for the Government of 
Manitoba and the federal Minister of Industry. They are co-chairs. 
They share the job. The office of the secretariat has been set up in 
Winnipeg and Mr. André Dimitrijevic, a former associate deputy 
minister of federal-provincial relations in Saskatchewan has been 
appointed as the head of the secretariat. His office will be 
responsible for administering the dispute resolution mechanism.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	A number of working groups have been or will be formed to 
assess and report annually on the effects of the agreement on each 
province and territory. These working groups will continue to 
monitor the domestic trading environment and will make 
recommendations as appropriate.
<P>
	This is a broad based agreement. It includes a broad based 
dispute settlement process. It includes the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments and it responds to the very real concerns 
which have been brought forward by representatives of all parts of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	The agreement represents a significant milestone in the 
evolution of Canadian economic development. It represents an 
important step in the process of creating a more open and 
competitive market. It is a flexible agreement and it provides the 
framework to deal with special situations or changing priorities.
<P>
	At their annual meeting last year, the provincial premiers 
reaffirmed their commitment to the objective of reducing and 
eliminating barriers to the free movement of persons, goods, 
services and investment among the provinces and territories. The 
premiers want to continue the process of trade renewal and so does 
this government. Internal trade remains an important priority, as 
was most recently reaffirmed in the speech from the throne.
<P>
	The passage of Bill C-19 will provide the foundation for a more 
competitive domestic marketplace. It will complement the work of 
the Prime Minister and other first ministers who have been actively 
involved with the highly successful Team Canada approach, 
seeking to broaden the market for Canadian goods and services in 
export markets. We are part of a global economy and we have to 
compete in the competitive international environment.
<P>
	Internal barriers to trade inhibit our ability to compete 
internationally. We may not be able to control every factor in the 
international marketplace, but we can act on the problems that arise 
within our borders.
<P>
	Bill C-19 does that. In the spirit of co-operation which has 
brought us this far in dealing with the matter of improving the 
environment for doing business within Canada, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to express my support for this legislation. I 
urge other members of the House to support it as well.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-19, an act to implement the 
Agreement on Internal Trade.
<P>
	To those of us in Quebec, this bill is both very significant and 
very encouraging. For a number of years, I would say more than ten 
even, we have been discussing the possibility of freeing trade 
among Canada's provinces. Today, we are proud to see that the 
government has acted on it.
<P>
	It is vital to harmonizing trade relations, and I will explain in 
detail a little later on why we agree with harmonizing trade 
relations among the provinces. We freed trade with the United 
States first, before we freed trade among the provinces. You can 
imagine how important it was to do so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1794"> 1794 </A></B>
<P>
	It is also important to have a dispute resolution mechanism. We 
find this mechanism quite acceptable, except as we mentioned at 
the bill's earlier stages, and as we discussed with Quebec officials, 
it is a bit odd in our free trade agreement with the United States 
that the parties-Canada and the U.S.-have to decide as the very 
last thing how a dispute between firms or sectors of the economy 
is to be resolved.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In the end, the federal government will decide by order in 
council where disputes will be settled. In other words, it will 
unilaterally decide what is right and what is not.
<P>
	This is why we, together with my colleague who was then the 
industry critic, had suggested a two day debate in the House of 
Commons on the importance of dispute settlement. We believe, as I 
said earlier, that some sectors might be more affected in some 
provinces than in others and that if a dispute was settled by order in 
council, it could be unfair at times to economic sectors which 
might be in a more favourable position in one province than in 
others.
<P>
	This is why we believe that settling a dispute by order in council 
might be harmful to certain economic sectors and to certain 
provinces, especially the small ones.
<P>
	Interprovincial free trade is of the utmost importance. Already, 
trade in goods and services in Canada and in Quebec represents 16 
per cent of the gross domestic product of Quebec, for instance. It is 
quite important for Quebec to have free competition with the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	For instance, we can say products that Quebec sells in the rest of 
Canada represent $23.3 billion. The goods we purchase from other 
provinces represent $19 billion. That means we sell a little more in 
the other provinces than we buy from them.
<P>
	However, we sell $11 billion in services to the other provinces, 
and we buy $14 billion from them. We buy about $3 billion more in 
services than we sell. So, if we look at the total average, what we 
sell and what we buy is about equal.
<P>
	If the government had not acted by liberalizing trade between the 
provinces, we could see that Quebec would have further developed 
its trade with the United States. We will continue to do so with the 
United States because, particularly in Quebec, we have an 
extraordinary market with the cities of New York, Boston and 
Buffalo, in the United States, and with Toronto, in Canada. We 
have a tremendous market. In a radius of about 1,000 kilometres, 
there are almost 100 million consumers.
<P>
	For Quebec, it is very beneficial to work at the shortest distance 
possible. We have an extraordinary market. New York and Boston, 
the northeastern United States, is the richest region in the world; it 
is where consumers buy the most. That is also where the business 
culture is the most like ours, so that it is much easier for us to do 
business in  this radius. It requires much less effort, much less 
research on the human behaviour level, on the cultural level, etc. It 
is much simpler. Quebec will pursue its efforts to develop these 
markets, which have become much easier to break into. The figures 
I just gave you are based on the year 1994.
<P>
	For all these reasons, our ultimate goal is to achieve Quebec 
sovereignty and negotiate an economic partnership with the rest of 
Canada. The government is to be thanked for this initiative. It is a 
step in the right direction. As we proposed during the referendum, 
we want to negotiate an economic partnership with the rest of 
Canada. What we have done, what we are doing today is a step 
forward that will help us achieve our goals when Quebec becomes 
sovereign. In this regard, I think we have just taken an 
extraordinary step.
<P>
	There are other reasons, for example the advantage of 
liberalizing trade with the other provinces and the U.S. The 
economy is changing and will change even more dramatically in 
the future. We face an extraordinary, an exciting challenge in the 
coming years. The new ways of communicating, high technology, 
robotics, computers, the electronic highway are all transforming 
the dynamics of the economy.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	That is why borders should disappear, so that everyone can 
benefit from their own intellectual and technical resources. I would 
like to say a few words on this, if I have the time.
<P>
	I will deal mainly with our economy of the past 50 years-there 
is no need to go back to ancient history-for those sceptics who 
think that free competition and free trade at the international level 
are bad for us.
<P>
	For those sceptics, I would like to go over the economy of the 
past and that of the future. In my days as a Conservative member, I 
took a strong stand for free trade with the United States. I worked 
very hard to make it happen. That is why, thinking back on all the 
speeches we made, the studies we commissioned and the evidence 
we heard, I am convinced that free trade is a good thing.
<P>
	For the benefit of those who remain sceptical, I will raise the 
issue of competition. Let us not forget that, in the old days, our 
main markets were wood, fur and iron. We also had a very 
domestic farm industry. We raised our livestock to meet our 
immediate needs. We also had coal, petroleum, in very limited 
supplies, and all naturally renewable commodities, which ensured 
our survival locally.
<P>
	When we had plentiful supplies of natural products such as coal, 
iron, wood and so on, we sold some and used some. Revenues were 
relatively stable. In the old days, the economy was relatively stable 
because it was driven for the most part by natural resources.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1795"> 1795 </A></B>
<P>
	Wood was used to build houses and to heat them, livestock was 
killed for its meat and cows gave milk. All this makes for a very 
local economy. To keep warm, people burned wood; that is quite 
simple. They did not have much need for trading with Ontario or 
the U.S. to feed themselves, heat their homes and what not. Theirs 
was a strictly local economy. We had an enormous wealth, 
particularly in Quebec, but also in the other provinces, of materials 
of all sorts.
<P>
	In a way, it was quite important to take protective measures. In 
those days, Canadians were very afraid of having their market 
invaded by the Americans or the Europeans, of anything that might 
destabilize their economy. It was therefore important that barriers 
be erected to protect our small local economy.
<P>
	We tended to be protectionists. Barriers were erected. Customs 
tariffs and tariffs of all sorts were imposed to prevent our economy 
from being disturbed in any way. For decades, I would even go as 
far as to say centuries, our economy remained virtually unchanged. 
We were undoubtedly protectionists, and probably rightly so.
<P>
	As far as national and international markets is concerned, as I 
said earlier, we did not really need to rely on other countries to 
provide for our needs.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Our multinationals set up mainly in countries where natural 
resources were vast and where labour was cheap. Products were 
made, finished and then sold. This is how the economy and the 
multinationals used to work. These businesses would go in 
countries where they could produce at a low cost, thanks to the 
natural resources and cheap labour available.
<P>
	In the sixties, seventies and eighties, governments would get 
involved when they realized that a business was experiencing 
financial troubles or productivity problems, among others, and they 
would subsidize these companies. It was easy for companies to get 
subsidies. A lot of money was spent to subsidize businesses. I 
clearly remember, and so do other members who take an interest in 
the economy, that enormous amounts of money were used to 
subsidize companies, until governments realized that they were 
just wasting our money.
<P>
	Generally speaking, when companies were in financial 
difficulty, it was because they had not properly analyzed future 
markets, changes affecting labour and technology, automation, and 
all sorts of new ways of doing things. This was the main reason 
these companies had problems and were helped out by 
governments, which were essentially wasting money. Indeed, even 
though they were subsidized, these companies still ended up 
shutting down.
<P>
	They were subsidized because they were located in remote areas. 
However, they were not suitable for the region, sometimes because 
the natural resources were no  longer as abundant as when they had 
first settled there. In any case, this resulted in a lot of money being 
wasted.
<P>
	Let us now look at the current economy. To those who are 
sceptical and who believe that free trade is something bad which 
will hurt us, let me say that I think just the opposite, and I have for 
several years now. The economy in which we live, and in which we 
will live in the years to come, is based on ideas rather than on 
natural resources.
<P>
	Mental competence will be very important. In Quebec in 
particular, we have tremendous intellectual competence, and young 
people graduating from our schools, colleges and universities are 
outstanding. With regard to software development, in particular, 
we see that we are among the best in the world. The economy of the 
future will be based a lot more on mental competence than on 
natural resources, as used to be the case. The information highway 
is a case in point. There is much talk about it now.
<P>
	People with the capacity to develop software and to use it for 
promotion, sale or information, whether through the Internet or 
other means of communications, will be in the forefront and will do 
well. This economy will be based on ideas, on mental competence.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Thanks to this new way of doing business with ideas and mental 
competence, the economy will change a lot more rapidly. We will 
witness an economic revolution that could be considered 
astounding by some, but which I would see instead as a particularly 
exciting new development. As you know, ideas evolve a lot faster 
than coal or iron plants. Ideas change, evolve at a rapid pace.
<P>
	Previously, the economy was based on natural resources like 
coal and iron. We could rely on our resources, we had plenty of 
them for 50 or 100 years. We lived off them, we had only to extract 
and sell them, it was not complicated.
<P>
	Tomorrow's economy will be much more flexible and will move 
much faster. It will change more rapidly, and I think it will be very 
exciting for young people.
<P>
	Help from governments will be different too. Governments will 
help companies to better communicate and sell their products, get 
international information and international market intelligence, 
and assess world markets. Government help will also target certain 
sectors of the economy.
<P>
	Small businesses may need information, for example. It will be 
important for the government to have experts throughout the world 
that can use Internet to let that small business acquire some 
knowledge of what the culture is like in India, of what the lifestyle 
of the Indians, the Japanese or the Chinese is like, and on how they 
go about purchasing goods or services. So the government will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1796"> 1796 </A></B>
<P>
have an important role to play in  conveying to small businesses the 
information they require in order to develop.
<P>
	This is the economy of the future, and it is important to realize it. 
I think we do, but governments will have to be flexible. That is why 
Quebec is looking for more autonomy. We want to be flexible in 
order to move quickly. We think that federalism, with its eleven 
governments, is doomed to stagnation. It stifles development. The 
government is always slow to move and takes a lot of time to react. 
That is why we advocate sovereignty with an economic and 
political partnership with the rest of Canada. In order to expand, we 
need to be able to react more quickly and to be more efficient as a 
government in our support for this new approach.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that more accessible markets will mean a lot 
more transfers, not only of products but also of skills. Transfers of 
skills do not cost much in transportation fees. It can be done 
through computers. It will be done in the future through the 
Internet and more user friendly communication services.
<P>
	We are told that we will soon be able to contact anyone in the 
world without having to make long distance calls. We will not have 
to call long distance to talk to someone in Japan or in China in the 
near future, in just a few years from now. It means we will be able 
to exchange ideas and work on research or other projets with 
experts from anywhere in the world.
<P>
	This is why free trade with the United States, with the provinces 
and with other large markets is so interesting. It will allow us to be 
more efficient. Our productivity will increase and who will benefit 
in the end? The consumer.
<P>
	We will have good high-quality products. We will definitely be 
able to increase the standard of living of our citizens. It can take us 
far, but I just wanted to show that an opening onto the world, with 
freer trade and increased competitiveness, should help to improve 
our productivity. In turn, it should improve our products and result 
in a higher standard of living for consumers and the general public.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	We will have better and nicer clothes. We will have nicer 
automobiles and television sets with interactive programming. We 
will be able to afford a lot of things. We need high technology, but, 
in some cases, it can cost a lot of money.
<P>
	When we were negotiating free trade with the United States, 
some major international investors told us: ``We need large markets 
to justify our investments''. People stopped investing in Canada for 
two main reasons. First, they told us: ``The market is not big 
enough to justify our investments. Besides, Canada's debt is too 
high and we will have to pay for it. It will be too expensive and, in 
the end, it will not be profitable to invest in Canada''.
<P>
	High technology has its advantages, but it can sometimes be 
expensive. It costs a lot of money to invent a high technology 
product, which means that large investments are required, and you 
need markets to make these investments profitable. Not only did 
Canada have a very small market of about 25 million people, but 
companies were not sure they would be able to sell their products in 
other provinces. So you can imagine how restricted our market 
was. Very few people were interested in investing in Canada 
because the market was too small to justify the investment. 
Consequently, international investors in high technology went to 
Europe, to the United States, to Japan and other countries.
<P>
	For these reasons, it was really necessary to secure free trade 
with the United States. It was hard because Quebec was almost the 
only province in favour of free trade with the United States. We, 
Quebecers, worked very hard because we believed in free trade 
with the United States. There was unanimity in Quebec between the 
Liberal Party, the Parti Quebecois and a majority of Conservative 
members at the time. We worked real hard, and it is with the help of 
Quebecers that we succeeded in signing a free-trade agreement 
with the United States.
<P>
	Except for Mr. Turner, the Liberal Party at the time was against 
free trade with the United States. Only Mr. Turner, the former 
Prime Minister, was in favour of free trade. He came to the House 
to make a speech in support of free trade. He contradicted the 
present Prime Minister, who was against it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> You are a wise man.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Yes, absolutely.
<P>
	So, Mr. Turner was surely a very intelligent man. He had 
understood. He had insight. Unfortunately, his party was against it 
and decided to wage a war to the finish. We had to work for hours.
<P>
	I remember making a speech at about 11.40 p.m. in December, 
just before Christmas, because we had to adopt the free trade 
agreement before the end of the year, so that both countries could 
ratify it. So, we made long speeches until the very end because the 
Liberals, if they did not hinder us, tried to gain time. They used 
every trick of parliamentary procedure to try to gain time until the 
very end, until we succeeded in having the agreement adopted.
<P>
	So it all happened thanks to Quebecers, to the Government of 
Quebec, to its members and to the members of the Quebec wing of 
the Conservative Party. There was about sixty of us at that time, 
and we managed to convince the rest of Canada that free trade was 
a good thing.
<P>
	Today the Liberals are in favour of free trade. They won the 
election, so they do not need to oppose free trade any more. They 
used the free trade issue to win the election. Now they support free 
trade.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1797"> 1797 </A></B>
<P>
	I am also pleased to see today that the Liberals have decided 
to encourage free trade between the provinces. I totally agree with 
that, and this is why I support this bill.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this bill will simplify internal trade. I also 
mentioned earlier that this is in line with the sovereignist project 
that we still have and that we will not forget about because we still 
believe in it, unless the Canadian government decides to make 
changes to the Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	What we are proposing is a close, controlled economic 
partnership. As I mentioned earlier, this is a good start. It will allow 
us to have free trade, which is necessary.
<P>
	Now that we will have free trade with the provinces, we, in 
Quebec, are very aware that we will have to train our workers 
better. Therefore, I urge the federal government again to accept to 
transfer to Quebec the responsibility for manpower training. This is 
very important for us. It is not up to the federal government to 
make decisions about manpower training; it is a provincial 
responsibility. This is my twelfth year as a member of Parliament, 
and for twelve years we have been begging the federal government 
to give manpower training back to the provinces. This is a very 
important issue for us.
<P>
	We can see that there is a lot of waste. There is a waste of time 
and energy, and still people are not being properly trained. The 
effectiveness of the federal government's manpower training is 
rated at about 25 per cent. Imagine, billions of dollars spent and it 
is only 25 per cent effective.
<P>
	This is also true for Ontario and for British Columbia. 
Manpower training should be given by provincial institutions. It is 
the provinces who run educational institutions. Why does the 
federal government have to buy courses from Quebec institutions? 
Often, they have rules that do not correspond to those of our school 
boards or of the provinces' educational institutions.
<P>
	It would be much easier to co-ordinate manpower training if it 
were controlled by the provinces, if the money went directly to the 
provinces so that they could provide satisfactory training. We have 
colleges that adapt to the needs of businesses and that design very 
specialized programs corresponding to sectors of economic 
activity. They take the businesses in a particular sector and create 
specialized classes in order to provide people with very specific 
training to meet very specific needs.
<P>
	Courses are given specifically to meet the needs of these 
businesses, but in many cases the federal government horns in. I 
will give the House an example: someone who is unemployed 
wants to take a 10 month course, starting in May and ending 10 
months later. Since he is unemployed, he is not entitled to any 
holiday time during his unemployment, so he cannot take the 
course,  because the school boards close down for two months in 
Quebec. This is crazy, as well as unacceptable. I find such things 
both scandalous and disgusting.
<P>
	A lot of people come to see us in our offices to tell us things like 
this: ``It makes no sense, I am eligible to take a course but I cannot 
because it starts in the spring and ends in late fall''. Since the 
teaching criteria are not the same for the school boards and for 
unemployment insurance, people end up unable to take a course. 
That is why I find it scandalous that money is wasted and people 
with ability are also wasted. They often give up and go back home 
and on to welfare, living off the government.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I am begging the government to act promptly. In looking at my 
government colleagues close to me, I am convinced that they 
understand my message very well. I am not being aggressive, 
merely pointing out what is nothing more than common sense.
<P>
	I trust that the Liberal members making up the present 
government will heed this message and make it possible for there 
to be greater efficiency and for the people working in our 
businesses to be better trained and therefore more productive, 
turning out better products. With better products, we will be able to 
compete internationally. Such is the purpose of manpower training.
<P>
	That is why we are working very hard in Quebec, to have more 
efficient businesses. It would be a serious mistake not to do so. 
There will be no point in moaning about it when we are flooded 
with products from other countries, creating unemployment and 
welfare dependency. Do we want to become a banana republic, an 
impoverished state, or do we want to move on into this new 
economic era? In this new economic era, high technology will take 
the place of natural resources.
<P>
	This is why training and intellectual skills are essential for this 
new economy we will be experiencing in the years to come.
<P>
	Once again, I am begging the government, and the government 
members in particular, since they form that government. Often 
MPs do not dare speak out, but it is not always necessary to vote 
against one's government in order to have one's ideas noticed. I 
believe we should work very hard inside our respective caususes. I 
know there are excellent Liberal members who understand what I 
have just said, and I am convinced that with time they will come to 
understand, as they finally did and accepted the free trade 
agreement with the United States. It is normal. People evolve 
slowly.
<P>
	There are still people in Quebec who are not sovereignists. I say 
to them that some people take more time than others to understand. 
It is the same thing. There were some people who had not 
understood that free trade was a good thing. Today, people know 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1798"> 1798 </A></B>
<P>
that free  trade is a good thing, at least in Quebec because we export 
much more to the United States than we import.
<P>
	We realize that free trade is a good thing. Yet, at first, some 
Liberals believed that it was not. You cannot blame people. They 
take time to change. As I have just said, some take longer than 
others to understand. It depends where you come from, on your 
education and on where you live. This is all perfectly acceptable, 
and I do not want to point the finger at anyone.
<P>
	There is one thing, however. We live in an age of high 
technology and major communications, and we are going to have to 
meet international competition. It is an extraordinary challenge. 
One that will be very exciting. I am sure the years to come will be 
exciting, but we must make sure that our people receive the 
intellectual training to meet the challenge.
<P>
	I and the other members of the Bloc support this bill, except, and 
I repeat, the part on the resolution of disputes. On the whole, we 
agree with the formula, except at the end, where it provides that the 
federal government may unilaterally decide who is right and who is 
wrong by order.
<P>
	Once again, this could harm certain provinces with very 
pronounced sectors of economic activity. I will give Alberta as an 
example.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Alberta has a number of fairly major economic sectors, 
including oil, beef and wheat. These are the major ones; I might 
even say the only ones. If a dispute were to arise with Quebec or 
Ontario in one of these areas, and the federal government 
unilaterally resolved the dispute by order, Alberta's economy could 
suffer significantly. It is a possibility.
<P>
	Quebec has one really major sector: hydroelectric power. Should 
there be a dispute over power with no solution found and should the 
government unilaterally decide by order in the end to promote 
uranium or atomic energy over Quebec's energy, Quebec could 
suffer hugely. It is for these reasons that to give sole power to the 
federal government to resolve a dispute by order-in-council could 
adversely affect an important economic sector in Quebec as it 
could adversely affect an important economic sector in Alberta, in 
New Brunswick or elsewhere. In this sense, we think it is 
dangerous and we are opposed to it.
<P>
	We would have preferred a two-day debate, a public debate in 
the House of Commons, so that members concerned, who feel their 
rights or those of their province, their region or a sector of their 
province are being abused, can publicly inform the people of these 
risks by their comments.
<P>
	We all know that the ability to speak out publicly often confers 
an extraordinary power. Otherwise, things are done on the sly, often 
in secret. That is why we live in a  democratic system, to be able to 
speak out publicly. It is a shame we cannot speak out freely and 
publicly instead of ruling by order-in-council. It should be possible 
to debate the matter, people should be able to express their views. 
Maybe then, the way we see things could change radically.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about the internal trade 
agreement. I will talk about why I believe free trade agreements are 
good both internationally and internally within Canada. I will 
follow that with a brief analysis of what the bill does and does not 
do as it reflects on internal trade in Canada. I will detail some 
specifics about why the Reform Party has difficulty supporting the 
bill. I will wrap up my speech by specifically talking about the 
energy chapter, or the missing energy chapter, the one we have been 
promised repeatedly over the last couple of years which we are still 
waiting to see come to fruition.
<P>
	I would like to detail why the internal trade agreement is so 
valuable to the people of Quebec as well as to all Canadians. I 
would like the separatists in Quebec to consider the idea that the 
bringing down of interprovincial trade barriers presupposes that we 
have provinces around which there are barriers. There is no 
guarantee that if a province separates from Canada the move for 
free trade within our borders will continue.
<P>
	Some of the benefits which Quebec now receives within the 
Canadian Confederation are not a sure thing if it goes its way. 
NAFTA, GATT and the internal trade agreements all suddenly 
become up in the air for the province, then the country of the 
Quebec. I urge them as they consider their options in the years to 
come that they keep that in mind.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	For instance, Quebec exported more to Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick in 1989 than to any country in Europe, including 
France. Quebec sold as much to Ontario as it did to the United 
States. That is important. Quebec has a huge trade within Canada 
and the separatists put that at risk when they start talking about 
separation. It is no wonder the economy of Montreal and all of 
Quebec is in turmoil right now as they consider their options.
<P>
	The business people in Quebec know the truth. The truth is 
Canada is good for Quebec and they should know that. To start 
tossing around the idea that they could just go their own way, 
everything would be copacetic and not to worry about it, is not 
telling the truth to the people within their own borders. Quebec 
benefits from trade within Canada. I will read a couple of statistics 
about how much benefit it is for some of the provinces.
<P>
	It is interesting that only 23 per cent of British Columbia's total 
exports go interprovincially. In B.C. 76  to 77 per cent of its exports 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1799"> 1799 </A></B>
<P>
go internationally. We in British Columbia are not totally 
dependent on the internal trade agreement and the freedom it would 
allow although obviously it is a good thing for all Canadians. Most 
of our product in B.C. is exported to other countries.
<P>
	Take some of the other provinces. In Quebec 51 per cent of its 
total exports go to other provinces. The majority of its exports go to 
provinces, not to other countries, not to Europe, not to the emerging 
Asian markets. Most of its trade is internal trade. If those in the 
Bloc Quebecois put their thinking caps on, they would realize they 
are not doing any favours to their constituents by proposing the 
breakup of Canada when more than half of Quebec's trade goes to 
other provinces.
<P>
	Alberta exports 61 per cent of its trade to other provinces. 
Alberta understands the importance of the internal free trade 
agreement and of being part of Canada.
<P>
	Whether we are talking about dairy products, manufactured 
goods or whatever, Quebec benefits from being part of Canada. The 
separatists should toss out this idea of leaving Canada which is 
harming not only Quebec's business prospects but is also creating 
that political uncertainty which is hurting the rest of the country. I 
hope we will hear more talk that they are looking forward to 
acceptable change from Canada. Many of us are looking for 
acceptable attitudes from the Bloc Quebecois too.
<P>
	We would like to see an acceptance that this is a mutually 
beneficial thing. Quebec and Canada together is the way we should 
have it. Read the statistics. We are not going to be held hostage on 
this. We hold some pretty good cards in this game and we are not 
about to hand over the whole deck to those who say they want to 
take their ball and go home. I urge them to reconsider their political 
agenda which I think is harming not only Quebec but also the rest 
of Canada.
<P>
	While Ontario is Quebec's most important trading partner within 
Canada, Quebec ran a deficit in its trade with Ontario and its 
surplus came from trade with more distant provinces. In other 
words when we think of trade it is not just Ontario trade; Quebec 
trades with all the provinces in big numbers. If we were to add up 
all the numbers that all the provinces trade, in fact as much trade 
goes on interprovincially as goes on with the rest of the world. 
Interprovincial trade is key.
<P>
	The Reform Party campaigned in the election in favour of the 
free trade agreement. We made no bones about it. We said we 
anticipated that the world was going to go toward a rules based free 
trade economy and that we had best get on the bandwagon because 
that bandwagon was heading out of town. The best way to ensure 
prosperity for Canadians was to ensure that we were on the free 
trade bandwagon.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	We said free trade should move ahead. Reform Party members 
said we would sign the NAFTA and the GATT if it came to that. We 
said that if 150 countries, give or take, in the rest of the world want 
to sign a free trade agreement based on a rules base trade 
agreement, we were to be one of the 150 because trade, 
export-import, is the future of the country.
<P>
	We also said during the campaign that one thing which could 
make free trade work for Canada, although it has not always 
worked for Canada, is to resolve the internal trade barriers first. 
There are $6.5 billion of internal trade barriers within Canada. 
Everything from milk to beer costs Canadians more because of 
internal trade barriers. It is not right. If we are thinking of exporting 
to the world, at the very least we should be able to ensure there is 
also the right to export within the country.
<P>
	Let me read where this agreement is taking us. What was the 
situation before this agreement came into force? Why was the 
Reform Party so adamant about one particular power which should 
be strengthened by the federal government? Everybody says the 
Reform Party wants to dismember the federal government. There 
are many areas where it should be out of business. One area it 
should strengthen is the right to strike down internal trade barriers. 
Section 121 of the BNA act states, and has always been the case: 
``All articles of growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the 
provinces shall be admitted free into each of the other provinces''. 
Those are the rules around which somehow the federal government 
has allowed $6.5 billion in trade barriers to be erected between all 
provinces.
<P>
	We have gone over this already somewhat, but we find ourselves 
in a situation in which transportation companies say it is easier to 
transport goods north and south across the border than it is 
interprovincially. Stocking requirements for shelves state certain 
products can be more visible or displayed more attractively on a 
shelf than others. Interprovincial trade barriers have arisen to the 
tune of $6.5 billion, even though the BNA states all provinces shall 
be permitted free access into each of the other provinces. It cannot 
be more clear than that.
<P>
	The federal government has a responsibility and a legal right to 
ensure that we have free access between provinces. We do not need 
a better right than that. It is true free trade when there is the right 
for growth, produce and manufacture from any of the provinces to 
be admitted freely between provinces. What is needed is a federal 
government with the guts to do something about it.
<P>
	It should not be done after the NAFTA, after the GATT. We are 
still trying to get this internal trade agreement right. Meanwhile the 
band wagon is well out of town and the free trade agreement is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1800"> 1800 </A></B>
<P>
gone. It is no wonder some people say international free trade  
agreements have not been as good for Canada as they couldhave been.
<P>
	I would still argue they had to go ahead. However, federal 
governments past and present should have moved quicker and with 
more vigour on the idea of striking down internal trade barriers 
within our own country. If free trade had begun at home, people 
would have accepted it, seen the benefits and been far more 
accepting of the NAFTA and GATT that followed.
<P>
	I have to mention specifically what happened during the 
campaign when many dairy farmers in my riding were promised by 
the Liberal government that it would not sign the GATT without a 
strengthened and clarified article 11.2(c). I heard Liberal 
candidates swear they would lie down on the railroad tracks to stop 
the deal. They would resign from caucus, which given today's 
activities might have been a good first step. They said they would 
never sign the agreement unless article 11.2(c), dairy quotas and 
tariffication, were strengthened and clarified.
<P>
	The government did not even have time to read that document 
before it signed it. It was signed knowing full well that during the 
campaign it would sign. It was signed with out any strengthening, 
without any clarification. It went immediately to tariffication.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	It was one of those promises that caused a lot of Liberals to get 
red under the collar during the campaign. They did not follow 
through on that to the dairy farmers in my area. The truth in 
advertising council should look into that.
<P>
	There were some wild promises, including the Deputy Prime 
Minister's promises on the GST, including free votes in the House 
of Commons, including-I do not want to pick on your position, 
Madam Speaker-the promise from the red book that they would 
have deputy speakers from the opposition parties in the Chair. 
What happened to all the promises?
<P>
	The red book has gone from the non-fiction section of the library 
and is now firmly ensconced in the fiction section of the library. I 
saw someone walking out of here a while ago with a red book. The 
sucker is only half as thick as it used to be. They are tearing pages 
out of it as they walk, trying to make sure people do not get a good 
look at it. It will be interesting how the promises part of this 
develops.
<P>
	I remind people watching, specifically those in my riding, that 
on that article in the GATT there was enough misleading 
information from the Liberals to gag a dairy cow in my riding.
<P>
	What does this provincial trade agreement actually move 
toward? We used to have total free trade. We had free trade on 
everything that was produced, grown or manufactured, which 
basically covers it. What does  article 101 of this provincial trade 
agreement state? I would think the government might want a 
strengthened article on that. The article states the objective of the 
agreement is to reduce and eliminate to the extent possible barriers 
to the free movement of goods and services.
<P>
	Notice the transition here is not a positive one. We went from 
free trade in anything grown, produced or manufactured to free 
trade wherever possible according to the government. Is this an 
improvement? This is not an improvement. This is not an improved 
internal trade agreement.
<P>
	What does ``to the extent possible'' mean? Does it mean that 
when a separatist government says a barrier cannot come down it 
must stay up? Does it mean that if someone gets a lobby group or a 
special interest group that might be funded by the government to 
aggressively lobby the government, the barrier has to stay up? 
What does it mean? No one knows for sure because it is ``to the 
extent possible'' that the government will remove internal barriers. 
That is not good enough. It is one of the powers which the Reform 
Party has consistently said should be strengthened by the federal 
government.
<P>
	We have said much can be realigned in the federal-provincial 
scheme. If the provinces think they can do a better job, that they 
can handle it better, that they have the resources and they want to 
look after a lot of what is currently done by the federal government, 
we say more power to them, have a nice day, let us do it.
<P>
	However, one of the powers the federal government needs to 
retain if it is to have a union from coast to coast is the right to strike 
down internal trade barriers. It cannot hand that over to the 
provinces. If it strikes down the economic activity between 
provinces, divisions will be created which create political 
divisiveness, interprovincial squabbles, business fights, 
uncompetitiveness, cost to consumers and cost to taxpayers. It is 
not acceptable to allow people, businesses or provinces to erect 
trade barriers within our country when we are looking for trade 
barriers to come down around the world.
<P>
	This legislation is a step in the wrong direction. A promise was 
made in March 1994 just after the first federal budget. The industry 
minister stated the federal government is committed to working 
toward an agreement which is clear and concise, has a set of rules 
that will eliminate protective measures, and includes an effective 
and enforceable dispute settlement mechanism.
<P>
	This agreement does not do that. If it did all of that I would say 
let us go for it, let us give it a whirl and see if it will work. There are 
entire areas untouched by this agreement. There are certain 
agricultural products untouched. Certain government procurement 
and regional development tools are untouched.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	The energy chapter is not even there. The government is asking 
us to sign something that is not even there. There are about 14 
chapters in this agreement. The energy chapter is a blank page. 
That would be bad enough except the government said the blank 
page would be filled in July 1995. July came and went and there 
was no page. It is a document that we need on the energy sector, 
one of the most important sectors of this agreement. September 
rolled around. September 1995 was when it would happen but in 
September 1995 the agreement was blank again.
<P>
	There is no agreement on energy. We are being asked by the 
government to support an internal trade agreement in which at least 
in the area I am critiquing the chapter is non-existent. There is 
nothing there. It is a blank page.
<P>
	We are being asked: ``Trust me. I will sign it later and we will 
negotiate something. Just give me the power now''. That is not 
good enough. Unfortunately, this deal of signing agreements and 
negotiating something later is typical of this government. It asked 
us to do that on the Yukon land claims settlement. It asked us to do 
it on the internal trade agreements. The government has asked us to 
entrust it to do something through order in council on many bills 
where it says: ``We are not sure what it means. We do not know 
when it will come into force. We do not know how we will do it but 
let us pass it''.
<P>
	I say let us not pass it. Let us pass agreements and bills in this 
House which are complete. If the government needs more time to 
complete the bill, by all means take some time but do not ask us to 
approve bills in this House which are not full and complete. With 
this internal trade agreement that is a problem.
<P>
	I will talk specifically on the energy chapter. This is the chapter 
which I find the fact that it is not filled out paints the picture for 
how effective this agreement is going to be. If we do not have a 
chapter on energy I would argue we do not have an internal trade 
agreement.
<P>
	Agriculture is missing too. I guess it will be internal trade on 
widgets and foo-foos but that is not good enough. We need internal 
free trade within this country and we need it on the two most 
important products in the country, at least agriculture and energy. If 
the government cannot get an agreement on them, then it should 
withdraw the bill until the negotiations are complete. When 
negotiations are complete and the government has an agreement to 
present to the House of Commons, then we will vote on it. We have 
to vote no if there is no agreement in place because we will not give 
the government permission to write a blank cheque.
<P>
	I mentioned that the chapter covering energy was supposed to be 
completed in July 1995. Then it was supposed to be completed in 
September 1995. That deadline also came and went. Now the 
officials are  working on yet another draft of the energy sector 
chapter. The council of energy ministers promises again that 
August of this year is when the energy sector chapter is going to be 
completed. It is going to be completed almost for sure a year or so 
late.
<P>
	What are we led to believe about this chapter and about this 
agreement? History tells us that politics will get in the way of 
common sense again, that the energy chapter may well go 
unwritten again. There has already been one written that they 
cannot agree with but it will probably go unwritten, unendorsed 
one more time.
<P>
	I am afraid that sums up the progress to date of the energy 
ministers on this important matter. The blank page is rather 
symbolic of the entire agreement. It just shows again that the 
government cannot come through with its promise on internal trade 
and it is asking us to trust it to come up with something in the 
future.
<P>
	I for one am not prepared to do that and I am surprised the 
Liberal members are prepared to do that. I would think they would 
say to their minister: ``Let us wait until we get the complete 
document''. It is unbelievable. For example when buying a car 
suppose I say: ``I will sign the contract to buy the car. I see it has no 
wheels on it but I will buy it. Sometime when you think you want to 
fill out the contract about when I get the wheels, let us talk. I will 
be happy to do it''. Nobody signs contracts like that.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	In essence this bill is a contract between the provinces and 
between the federal government and the provinces and between the 
Canadian people by inference and all the provinces. The deal being 
signed is just not there and I am not prepared to do that. The Liberal 
backbenchers, at the very least, should not be prepared to do it 
either.
<P>
	I mentioned the size of interprovincial trade and how important 
it is. It is critically important for the country that this is done 
correctly. I do not want to belabour the whole thing, but I can give 
members a list of how many agreements we have had. Somebody 
mentioned being here for 12 years. We had the Macdonald 
commission which recommended the elimination of trade barriers 
in 1984. In 1987 the committee of ministers on internal trade said 
that we had to get rid of internal trade barriers. In 1989 a 
memorandum of agreement stated we had to get rid of them. The 
maritimes then signed a memorandum of agreement. In 1991 six 
governments tried to get rid of an interprovincial agreement on 
beer marketing practices. That is how specific we are in this 
country. Six governments tried to get together to try to decide how 
to put a beer on the shelf. They come to sort of an agreement but 
one still cannot sell beer interprovincially unless one has a brewery 
in every province.
<P>
	We come to the intergovernmental agreement on government 
procurement but that is also a difficult one  to enforce. This goes on 
and on. In 1992, 1993 and 1994 the ministers backed away from 
completely eliminating internal trade barriers. There are about 11 
sectors that they cannot solve yet they are now coming to us and 
asking approval for it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1802"> 1802 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to wrap this up by saying that there is a long history 
in this country of promising one thing on the internal trade 
agreements and delivering nothing on the other.
<P>
	We have a case in point which we have just gone through. I hope 
that sometime during discussions on this bill the new member for 
Labrador will get to his feet and talk about the energy chapter, the 
missing chapter, that should go into this agreement. I would like 
that member to say that the people of Labrador are sick and tired of 
the fact there is no energy chapter in this internal trade agreement. I 
hope that he will stand up and say: ``I am not satisfied with the way 
Labrador has been treated over the years on the internal trade issue. 
I am not satisfied with the fact that Labrador does not have access 
to the hydro lines in Quebec if it wants to build the lower Churchill. 
We are not satisfied in Labrador with the fact that they take our tax 
dollars and we do not even have a gravel road that we can drive 
on''.
<P>
	I hope the member stands up and says: ``The money that we 
could have made if we had a proper internal trade agreement in 
place would look after the entire transfer payments to my 
province''. If the people in Labrador had a decent internal trade 
agreement they would not even need transfer payments from the 
federal government.
<P>
	I hope that member from Labrador has the guts to stand up in the 
House of Commons and say that he is sick and tired of the fact that 
Labrador has been shafted and shafted again when it comes to an 
agreement.
<P>
	Quebec has consistently refused to allow Labrador to build lines 
in Quebec. Furthermore, Quebec has consistently refused to allow 
Labrador to wheel power through its existing power grid. Instead it 
is forced to sell that power to Quebec at ridiculous 1969 prices to 
be resold to the Americans to the tune of $800 million to $1 billion 
a year.
<P>
	The people of Labrador, with some justification, are sick and 
tired of that. I hope the new member for Labrador has the gumption 
to stand up and say that the government had better get it right on 
internal trade. He had better tell the minister that he is not going to 
be satisfied with the namby-pamby promises that some day in the 
future Labrador will be able to benefit from its own power sources.
<P>
	I would hope that he would stand up and say: ``This has gone on 
long enough. You have put Labrador in a catch-22 position''. 
Labrador has to find a contract before it will be allowed to build 
power lines but it cannot build  power lines until it gets the 
contract. They whipsaw Labrador back and forth.
<P>
	By the way, Madam Speaker, the Reform Party went from 0 per 
cent to 30 per cent of the vote in the last byelection. I hope that the 
new member for Labrador is paying attention. There is within 
Labrador a separatist movement now. They have elected an 
independent MLA to sit in their own legislature. The reason for this 
is because they have been shafted. They are sick and tired of it. 
They do not want to leave Canada but they are tired of being fed 
pabulum and lies by the federal government. They are tired of 
being fed pabulum and lies even by their own provincial 
government. Both are Liberal governments by the way. They are 
tired of being beholden to another part of the country or to other 
Canadians when they should be and have the right to be 
independent.
<P>
	I call on the government, when it writes this energy chapter, to 
then bring this internal trade agreement back to the House for 
ratification. When it writes the energy chapter it should include 
Labrador's concerns. You can bet your bottom dollar the reason the 
government cannot get an energy agreement right now is that 
Quebec will not sign and agree to binding arbitration because 
Quebec is afraid of what Labrador is going to get.
<P>
	I would urge the member for Labrador to do his homework, 
study this and not to support this bill until that is fixed. Labrador 
deserves more.
