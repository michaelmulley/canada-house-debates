	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I want to pay homage to a great Canadian who became a 
Nobel Laureate in 1993 and who will be awarded the Order of 
Canada today.
<P>
	Professor Michael Smith resides in Vancouver East and 
teaches biochemistry at the University of British Columbia. 
Professor Smith has an outstanding career of academic and 
humanitarian achievements. He received his Nobel prize for 
work dating back to 1976 centring on a program he developed 
for reprogramming genes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Professor Smith gave the half a million dollars in prize money 
to many causes. He gave $126,000 to the Société des femmes 
canadiennes en sciences et technologie; he has pledged the rest 
of it to schizophrenia research and to assisting people who teach 
in remote regions of British Columbia.
<P>
	Professor Michael Smith's generosity and competence know 
no bounds.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is people like Professor Michael Smith who make us all 
proud of being Canadian. It is on behalf of Canadians 
everywhere that I want to thank and congratulate Professor 
Smith for his achievements and generosity.

Peterborough riding. He visited the RCAF Association, the 
Navy Club, Empress Gardens and a number of other locations. 
He met with ex-servicemen and women from legions 
throughout the city and county of Peterborough and with 
members of the Dutch Canadian community.
<P>
	This visit was part of ongoing activities in connection with the 
Canada Remembers year during which we take time to 
remember the sacrifices and achievements of the last year of 
World War II 50 years ago.
<P>
	It is fortunate that this important anniversary is being 
recognized this year. We need to remember Canada now as never 
before. We should all take time to think about this great country, 
about our history and our future, about our land and about our

government has chosen the Italian Alps as the site of an 
international conference on tobacco farming in third world 
countries. Yes, you heard me right, the Italian Alps.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers will pay the expenses of not only six 
federal representatives, but also 20 experts from various

expenditure in the present context of austerity?
<P>
	Once again, the federal government's total lack of common

	Already over 800 people have attended four gun control 
meetings in my riding with more meetings to come. Not one 
person has spoken in favour of Bill C-68. The majority of the 
people of Yellowhead want the standing committee on justice to 
make changes to the gun control bill so it seeks to punish the

horrible and incomprehensible tragedy. A disturbed father 
killed his daughter and Sainte-Marie de Beauce's chief of police 
before killing himself. The people of Beauce, who always stand 
by each other, have extended their support and compassion to 
the families directly affected.
<P>
	In this ever-changing world, which causes some people to 
become despondent and perturbed, we all hold great power, the 
power to choose: choosing to love instead of hating; choosing to 
heal others instead of hurting them; choosing to create instead of 
destroying.
<P>
	In Sainte-Marie de Beauce, after the initial shock and 
consternation, the time for consoling and forgiveness has come. 
One of the things we can learn from this tragedy and the many 
others preceding it is that we must review the way we control 
guns and bring in measures to manage them wisely.

immediately following the disaster of the Oklahoma bombing,

intolerance for violent crime, something that is greatly lacking 
in our own country. Here a bleeding heart mentality has reigned 
for years.
<P>
	In Canada last week, one of our police chiefs was shot to 
death. Did the Minister of Justice display the same outrage as his 
American counterpart to this senseless act of violence? Did the 
minister express the growing outrage of Canadians, including 
our police officers, who have repeatedly called for a return of 
capital punishment in this country? No.
<P>
	Our justice minister's only response to this latest act of 
violence is to offer Canadians costly and useless gun 
registration. That is what this minister calls getting behind our

the very price of deregulation is making competitiveness almost

<P>
	This government has removed the cost guarantees that went 
with the Crow benefit and is promising to remove the price 
ceilings on freight rates by 1999.
<P>
	Control over farm costs has virtually disappeared. Fertilizer 
and fuel prices have taken huge unwarranted price jumps lately. 
Fertilizer costs are up 20 per cent or more over last year. Big fuel 
price increases are well documented all across the country. 
Combined with freight cost increases of 100 per cent, how can 
the grains industry, which has been struggling already, continue

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in announcing yesterday the amendments to 
Bill-C-76, the Minister of Finance tried to play down the 
motion tabled by the official opposition denouncing the federal 
government's intention to impose new standards on the 
provinces for social programs. I would point out that, with this 
bill, Ottawa is limiting the provinces to assuming a mere 
advisory role in the process of defining the national standards.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Would he acknowledge 
that the most concrete way to show his government does not 
intend to impose new national standards on the provinces is by 
amending Bill C-76 so that these new standards are submitted to 
all the provinces for their approval?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that the Minister of Finance provided a very 
satisfactory explanation yesterday. This bill will come before 
the House of Commons, and we will be able to discuss it. Here in 
Canada, we must maintain national standards. They already 
exist in all these programs.
<P>
	Some need changing, and so the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Minister of Finance will hold 
the necessary discussions. Since we want to maintain an 
appropriate level of support for all Canadians, we must ensure 
that the standards will continue to ensure proper services for 
people from one end of the country to the other.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the head of the government is even more 
ambiguous than his Minister of Finance-no small feat.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> A fine competition. Yesterday, the Minister 
of Finance told us that an upcoming amendment, not yet tabled, 
would provide for mutual agreement in establishing the 
criterion for the imposition of the standards. The expression is 
very vague. I would ask the Prime Minister to tell us what he 
means by mutual agreement. Does the government mean the 
necessary approval of all the provinces or, as with the patriation 
of the constitution in 1982, will a majority of the provinces 
suffice?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just said that standards already exist, which 
must be changed. The opposition has called for their change. We 
want to make changes. We want to discuss the nature of these 
changes in the House and then we will talk with the provinces. 
However, the standards that are in place will stay in place, and 
we are prepared to change them.
<P>
	If the opposition does not want us to change them, on the other 
hand, we will not change them. If they do have to be changed, I 
am sure the proposals of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Finance will be very 
reasonable, as usual, and the provinces will be pleased to accept 
them.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in other words: ``Trust my ministers; everything 
will be fine''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not very reassuring.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> No, indeed. It is not very reassuring.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I am sure it comes as no surprise that we are 
not reassured. If the Prime Minister believes the provinces have 
nothing to fear from the new national standards, why then is he 
still refusing to call a federal-provincial conference to debate 
publicly, first, the distribution of the cuts to the transfer 
payments announced in the budget and, second, the new national 
standards he wants to put forward, particularly in health and 
social assistance?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in health matters, there will be no negotiation, because, 
as we said clearly during the election campaign, and as I repeat 
now, the five principles incorporated in the Canada Health Act 
must remain. We have no intention of changing national health 
standards for any reason.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at a conference on the economy held in Ottawa 
yesterday, the Deputy Minister of Finance, David Dodge, stated 
that Canadians earning between $75,000 and $200,000 a year 
pay too much tax. He suggested that the federal government 
reduce taxes for high income earners so that Canada can remain 
competitive on global markets.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance agree with his deputy minister 
and should we expect a ministerial statement announcing a tax 
reduction for high income earners in the near future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that 
the member opposite is so selective in his reading. I made it very 
clear myself yesterday that this government's ultimate goal is to 
reduce taxes in Canada. In fact, that is one of the reasons why we 
are determined to put our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	At the same time, I indicated that, if taxes were lowered, they 
would be lowered for the middle class and the poorest in the 
country because they are the ones who are paying the most.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, the deputy minister referred to the wealthy 
and suggested that the taxes of wealthy Canadians be reduced.
<P>
	The idea would be to listen a little less to the Power 
Corporation head office and, with respect to tax reform, to start 
by imposing a minimum tax on corporations. That would make 
sense.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Finance reconcile his deputy 
minister's statement with, on the one hand, his so-called 
commitment to ensure that all Canadian taxpayers make an 
effort to help reduce the deficit and, on the other hand, his 
decisions which have consisted thus far in demanding a much 
bigger effort from lower income households and attacking the

of the Bloc Quebecois when we want to build newer

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the former Yugoslavia the Croatian army captures a 
rebel Serb enclave, Croatian Serbs then retaliate by bombing 
Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and Bosnian Serbs threaten to 
resume fighting and to ignore security council peacekeeping 
resolutions because they say the UN did not react strongly to the 
Croatian offensive.
<P>
	Peace is nowhere on the horizon and there is growing danger 
that Canadian peacekeepers will become human shields in a full 
blown conflict.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. What implications will 
this escalation of the conflict have on our peacekeepers' ability 
to fulfil their mandate and to deliver humanitarian aid in the 
former Yugoslavia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we deplore the activities that have resumed in that part 
of the world. We hope that everybody will have the good sense to 
resume the ceasefire. I am informed that at two o'clock p.m.

extremely difficult circumstances at this time.

willing they are to take chances with their own lives in order to 
make sure that people are protected from the misery of people 
who just prefer arms to negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the Liberal red book they said they would not be 
camp followers with respect to foreign policy. That is certainly 
not the case in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Canada is contributing a disproportionate number of 
peacekeepers and yet we have little say in how they are 
deployed. We are not part of the UN contact group. Germany, 
which does not have one soldier involved in the peacekeeping 
mission, has more of a say than Canada.
<P>
	How can the government justify being a major player in the 
peacekeeping effort while it remains a minor player in the 
decision making process?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all major decisions are made by the UN. UNPROFOR 
is a UN group and final decisions are made by the military 
command of the United Nations. We are not a member of the 
group of five for various reasons, among them the fact that some 
of the neighbouring countries think they can play a better role 
than we can.
<P>
	We are doing what we do best. We are on the ground, making 
sure we are not taking sides. That is why the Canadian position 
is always appreciated by everyone. I talked with the President of 
Croatia when I was in Budapest and I talked with the President 
of Bosnia. They both told me they appreciate the 
professionalism of our soldiers.
<P>
	Our soldiers are not there for us to gain political points 
internationally. They are there because they are the best.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Reformers believe that Canadian peacekeepers are the 
best in the world and deserve to be supported where they are 
deployed. However the situation on the ground in Croatia and 
Bosnia has changed but the peacekeepers' mandate has not. 
There is no peace to keep.
<P>
	Given that the Minister of National Defence vowed to 
withdraw our troops if their safety was threatened and if their 
ability to fulfil their mandate was in question, will the Prime 
Minister now order an immediate withdrawal of Canadian 
peacekeepers from the war zone in Bosnia and Croatia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that would be extremely irresponsible at this moment. 
For the last few years situations have arisen where fighting was 
renewed. The troops were there doing their job and brought 
about many ceasefires.
<P>
	The situation today is no worse than it was six months or a 
year ago. It is always difficult. Canadians are not  afraid to take 
on a difficult task. We are there to maintain the peace. We are not 
there to come and go. When we make a commitment we fulfil 
our commitment.

credit during four years, Revenue Canada has now changed its 
mind and is asking the 15,000 Quebecers who took advantage of 
that tax provision to repay amounts which are three to four times 
higher than their tax savings. This retroactive about face could 
force about half of those concerned to go bankrupt.
<P>

my question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The minister has tried several times to attribute poor morale 
in the armed forces to recent cutbacks and the negative attitude

military morale prepared by Colonel Oehring, the main cause is, 
and I quote: ``An increasingly impotent military leadership and 
uncaring system''.
<P>

last week, that the morale of the military is at a low ebb because

Colonel Oehring, maintains that the leadership is to blame?

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
After grossly mishandling the case involving an Algerian 
filmmaker, Ms. Koudil, immigration officials are now denying 
visitors' visas to three Algerian actors, Benguettaf, Ayad and 
El-Kalaa, who were to perform in a play denouncing the rise of 
fundamentalism in Algeria as part of the Theatre Festival of the 
Americas in Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister intend to move quickly to issue visitors' 
visas to the three Algerian actors, so that a repeat of the Algerian 
filmmaker fiasco can be avoided?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows or 
should know I do not believe it is wise for ministerial 
interventions ad nauseam at the visitor visa level.
<P>
	There are a million applications around the world. Your leader 
was the ambassador to France.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. minister to please invoke the 
chair.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12116"> 12116 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> The Leader of the Opposition was at one point 
the ambassador to France. There were a number of applications 
made under his tenure. Some were refused and some were 
accepted. Individuals refused have every opportunity, if the 
member checks with his leader, to put in a new application.
<P>
	With respect to the film maker, there was not a policy of 
favouritism; there was a policy of fairness. The film maker 
made a new application and convinced the visa officer her 
application was justified.
<P>
	If these three individuals have some complaint or there is 
misinformation then the process is very transparent and very 
simple. They are to come forward once again and make a new 
application without political intervention, whether by this 
member or this minister.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
understand from the minister's answer that he does not intend to 
budge and that only a general outcry in Quebec, as occurred in 
the case of the Algerian filmmaker, can spur him to action?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the kind of game that 
does a disservice to the very portfolio the member tries to 
protect.
<P>
	The member just said unless you change there will be pressure 
mounted to make the system change. I ask the member, who 
came to this country as a political refugee claimant, whether he 
wants a system amenable simply by pressure and tactics of a 
community, wherever they are, or does he believe there ought to 
be a system in place that allows for applications to be made and 
if there is a negative determination for the applicant to make 
another application?
<P>
	Does the member know that under the Immigration Act I do 
not have the power or the authority to overturn a visitor visa 
application? The member ought to know that and play by the 
rules rather than create special rules for some people.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Keith Banting,

words join a chorus who agree with Reform: Tom Courchesne, 
the Canadian Medical Association and others.
<P>
	Will the government openly table changes to the Canada 
Health Act to preserve medicare?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister said we 
do not intend to present changes to the Canada Health Act as 
such. There is clarification  in the budget, but the principles of 
the Canada Health Act are there very definitely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians 
were asked last week whether they think health care is 
affordable. Ninety per cent said they think health care will deal 
with fewer services in the future than now. Even the Prime 
Minister said medicare must return to basics.
<P>
	Reformers say let us make these changes in the open with 
consultation rather than by default and with stealth.
<P>

open review?

<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government said in the budget 
and the Minister of Finance has said repeatedly that the Canada 
Health Act is not negotiable.
<P>
	The hon. member is discussing funding of medicare. We know 
that many reputable studies have now shown that we spend more 
as a percentage of our GDP for health care than most other 
nations with systems of medicare like ours. We can manage our 
system better and we can make a better system, a more efficient 
and a more affordable system, by looking at health care renewal 
in terms of management changes, in terms of moving from acute 
care to community care, in terms of looking at technology 
assessment, assessing outcomes and guidelines for care. We can 
save a great deal of money and provide a better system of health 
care.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	An Ottawa gasoline retailer, Mr. Gas, has admitted that 
communications between gasoline retailers are common in the 
industry when setting prices. We have seen six increases in 
gasoline prices in less than year, all uniform across Canada and 
uniform from company to company, with no justification, 
resulting in a 25 per cent increase to consumers and accusations 
of price fixing.
<P>
	The minister in the House last Friday said in response to my 
question: ``When the prices are the same it is consistent with 
both competition and price fixing, so how do you know which it 
is?''
<P>
	Given this Liberal government confusion and the admission 
by the company, Mr. Gas, will the minister now roll back prices 
until an inquiry can be held on gas prices to determine if price 
fixing is taking place or to have oil companies justify these 
increases? Failing a rollback, will he at least hold a price 
inquiry?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course it would be inappropriate to comment on the 
circumstances of a case that is before the courts at the present 
time.
<P>
	What I do make clear again to the member is that first, as he 
knows, the government does not have the power to roll back 
prices. Second, I believe the most effective way to ensure the 
lowest possible prices is through real and sustained competition.
<P>
	The purpose of the Competition Act is to achieve real 
competition. The director endeavours to enforce that. But we do 
live in a system of law, and it does require proof when somebody 
alleges an offence.
<P>
	It is easy for the hon. member to stand in the House of 
Commons and say: ``Look, the prices are all the same; there is an 
offence''. I suggest to him that it is somewhat more challenging 
to get a conviction in the courts. I prefer to see people convicted 
in the courts on the basis of evidence.

following: that the government should be made aware of the 
unfair treatment of seniors in implementing the elimination of 
the capital gains exemption. The fictitious capital gain which

forcing thousands of seniors who cannot afford to do so to pay 
back to the federal government their old age security benefits.

circulating across Canada. The petition comes from the Calgary, 
Alberta, area.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the 
House that managing the family home and caring for preschool 
children is an honourable profession which has not been 
recognized for its value to our society.
<P>
	The petitioners also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families who make the choice to provide 
care in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the

discrimination against families who decide to provide direct

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LOBBYISTSREGISTRATIONACT">LOBBYISTS REGISTRATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 1, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-43, an Act to amend the Lobbyists 
Registration Act and to make related amendments to other Acts, 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to speak in this debate on Bill C-43 which concerns 
the registration of lobbyists.
<P>
	The recent publication of the committee report on Bill C-43 
has shown once again that the Liberal Government and the Bloc 
Quebecois have widely differing views of the work of lobbyists 
and the framework that should regulate their activities.
<P>
	My first comment, and I realize Mr. Speaker, that I cannot 
show it because it is against the rules of this House, but I would 
nevertheless like to say that the colour of the document does not 
necessarily reflect the title, which is about restoring confidence, 
since the document in question is red. I would even call it a 
Liberal red.
<P>
	My second comment is that although this red document comes 
after a Liberal red book we saw during the election campaign, it 
is pretty obvious that this version is quite different from what we 
read in the initial red book.
<P>
	Lately this government has shown, by its conduct, that it has 
decided to govern under pressure from lobbies hired by large 
corporations and financial interests instead of governing in the 
best interests of the people of this country. Recent excesses in 
this respect by the Liberal  government occurred in the matter 
involving the CRTC and Power DirecTv, a subsidiary of Power 
Corporation headed by none other than the Prime Minister's 
son-in-law.
<P>
	Let us see how the government managed to discredit itself in 
this affair. Everything started in the spring of 1993, when the 
CRTC indicated that it wanted to encourage the development of 
a Canadian industry involved in direct-to-home services by 
satellite, the so-called DTH. Last August, the Expressvu 
consortium, a competitor of Power DirecTv, obtained an 
exemption from licensing, allowing it to offer DTH to future 
subscribers.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The CRTC granted this exemption because Expressvu 
intended to use one or more Canadian satellites. Power 
Corporation planned to use the satellites and programming used 
by its American associate, DirecTv Inc. That is why Power's 
subsidiary did not qualify for an exemption from licensing by 
the CRTC.
<P>
	Unfortunately for Expressvu, Power DirecTv had a direct line 
to the Prime Minister. Recently, the Liberal government tabled 
two orders obliging all DTH companies to obtain a 
licence-orders that were tailored to meet the demands of Power 
DirecTv. These orders had the effect of taking the advantage 
away from Expressvu, a consortium that, unlike Power, had 
decided to offer its subscribers Canadian content.
<P>
	I may recall that Expressvu planned to begin operations on 
September 1 this year. By taking this unprecedented action, the 
Liberal government blithely ignored the independence of a 
regulatory agency that also has quasi-judicial powers to enforce 
legislation and regulations pertaining to telecommunications.
<P>
	This was a serious decision. In the process the Government of 
Canada adopted a measure that will take effect retroactively and 
thus have a negative impact on a Canadian corporation-a 
procedure that flies in the face of all the traditions of democratic 
countries. Furthermore, the government is sending a message to 
the entire DTH industry that it no longer intends to support the 
development of a Canadian industry.
<P>
	If the legislation applied by the CRTC no longer serves to 
ensure the development of the Canadian communications 
industry, what purpose does it serve? The government must stop 
hiding and must make public its intentions-if indeed the 
legislation serves no purpose.
<P>
	The worst part of all this is that it occurred because the 
president of Power Corporation had the good fortune-and there 
is no mistake there-to marry the daughter of the Prime 
Minister. The ties between Power Corporation and the Liberals 
do not stop there, as I will demonstrate.
<P>
	Here are a few examples. The current president of Power 
DirecTv, Joel Bell, was Pierre Trudeau's economic adviser and 
was designated by him to launch Investment  Canada. The 
president of Power Corporation, as the head of the 
China-Canada business council, organized the economic part of 
last November's trip by the Prime Minister and Team Canada to 
Asia. Former Prime Minister Trudeau continues to sit on the 
international board of Power Corporation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12122"> 12122 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to being the Prime Minister's son-in-law, André 
Desmarais was his assistant in the early 1980s when he was 
Minister of Justice. John Rae, vice-president of Power 
Corporation, directed two leadership campaigns for the current 
Prime Minister and the 1993 federal election campaign for the 
Liberals, and so on and so forth.
<P>
	The government's shady dealings do not, however, stop at 
this. While some are well married, others, like the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, have, it would seem, the incredible good 
fortune to find themselves at the site of one of the most 
spectacular financial deals of the century, claiming all the while 
that they were not involved. This story does not lack for interest 
either. It could even be made into an excellent sitcom with the 
film and television talents of our neighbours, the Americans.
<P>
	A journalist with the <I>Journal de Montréal</I> even wrote last 
week that the Minister of Canadian Heritage, like the hero of the 
film <I>Forrest Gump</I>, has the ability to be involved almost 
incognito in the major events of his time.
<P>
	Here are the facts. Three weeks ago, Edgar Bronfman Junior, 
an American citizen, and Seagram announced the acquisition of 
the American cinematographic giant MCA-a multi-billion 
dollar deal. This announcement was made in a hotel in Los 
Angeles. Well, surprise, surprise, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage just happened to be in the room next door.
<P>
	No problem up to this point, at least no apparent one. It must 
be said, however, that MCA owns 20 per cent of the shares of 
Cineplex, a Canadian company controlled by another branch of 
the Bronfman family. And it must be said that MCA wants to 
make off with Cineplex by amalgamating with Dallas-based 
Cinemark USA Inc.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Yet, the presence of the Minister of Canadian Heritage in Los 
Angeles got me thinking. In fact, it appears that Edgar Bronfman 
Junior's attempt to convince the federal government that MCA 
is a Canadian company is working. He hopes that this will 
permit him to escape Investment Canada's scrutiny.
<P>
	Need I remind you that the government's official policy is that 
companies dealing in cultural goods must be controlled by 
Canadian interests, which explains why Mr. Bronfman is trying 
to put on a Canadian identity.
<P>
	After the astonishing performance of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage in California, Mr. Bronfman will certainly 
gain what he set out to gain by bringing the minister to Los 
Angeles in the first place. It should come as no surprise then that 
the population is becoming increasingly put off, especially 
young people. I would like  to take this opportunity to point out 
that I am the official opposition's youth critic. My meetings and 
discussions with young people have made it clear to me just how 
much they have lost trust in the political machine. Hardly 
surprising, given the topic of discussion over the past few 
weeks.
<P>
	Along the same lines, there was the Pearson airport scandal 
over the previous government's privatization proposal. The 
Nixon report, a report regarding the privatization contract which 
was signed when the election campaign was in full swing, was 
handed to the Liberal government on November 29, 1993.
<P>
	This report incriminated beyond a doubt the lobbyists, public 
servants and political assistants involved. There are several 
questions which remain to be answered regarding the identity of 
unethical lobbyists and the illegal or illegitimate conduct of 
public servants and political assistants in this case. Up to now, 
the government has preferred to turn a blind eye and to be 
closemouthed about the information contained in the report, 
even though these grim events compromise the credibility of our 
democratic institutions. The demands of the Bloc Quebecois to 
have the government shed some light on this pitiful remnant of 
the Conservative era have fallen on deaf ears, up to now.
<P>
	Of course, the government will claim that it appointed an 
ethics counsellor to navigate the murky waters of its contacts 
with lobbyists. Unfortunately, when the heritage minister once 
again tripped up by writing to the CRTC, which comes under his 
authority, a letter supporting the licence application of one of 
his constituents, it took the Prime Minister three weeks to 
consult his ethics counsellor on this most sensitive issue.
<P>
	By waiting so long, the Prime Minister himself proved how 
little importance he attached to his own ethics counsellor. 
Furthermore, he refused to reveal to the House the gist of the 
ethics counsellor's recommendations. Such lack of transparency 
can only lead people to believe that the government has 
something to hide. The Bloc Quebecois reviewed Bill C-43, an 
act aimed at monitoring the activities of lobbyists, in all good 
faith. A strong piece of legislation is essential to help our 
democratic institutions deal with the wave of public scepticism 
surrounding the affairs of government.
<P>
	Even if Bill C-43 brings about some improvements in the 
somewhat incestuous relationship existing between elected 
officials and lobbyists, they fall short of the Liberals' 
commitments as stated in their own red book, the first one, the 
campaign one.
<P>
	According to the ethics counsellor appointed by the Prime 
Minister, even if Bill C-43 had been in force at the time, it 
would not have helped Canadians to learn more about the 
troubling events surrounding the attempted privatization of 
Pearson airport.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois presented interesting proposals giving 
more teeth to the bill in order to make the process more 
transparent and to restore public confidence in the  management 
of the affairs of government. The issue of monitoring lobbyists 
should not be the sole responsibility of a political party, a Prime 
minister, or a government, because it belongs to an essential 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12123"> 12123 </A></B>
<P>
democratic institution, the House of Commons, which is made 
up of representatives duly elected by the people.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois is proposing that the ethics 
counsellor be appointed for seven years by Parliament rather 
than by the party in power. This ethics counsellor, whose 
appointment is permanent, should be accountable to Parliament 
and should also have the authority to conduct public inquiries 
and report on his activities, findings, conclusions and reasons 
for his conclusions to the House of Commons.
<P>
	In short, the ethics counsellor should be more than a toothless 
watchdog serving his political masters and therefore vulnerable 
to pressure. The Bloc Quebecois also asked that all classes of 
lobbyists be merged into a single one. We also asked that all 
lobbyists be subject to the same information disclosure rules.
<P>
	This recommendation shows the constructive, non-partisan 
spirit that guided the Bloc Quebecois in its consideration of Bill 
C-43. In fact, this recommendation can be found in the June 
1993 Holtmann report, which is the basis for the Liberal 
commitments regarding the use of lobbyists and the disclosure 
of their activities. That is why we, in the Bloc Quebecois, do not 
understand the Liberals' refusal to implement this 
recommendation, which is included in their red book.
<P>
	The strict disclosure provisions proposed in the Holtmann 
report would allow the population to find out quickly about a 
lobbyist's status. Since lobbyists try to influence public policy 
to further private interests, their activities and identities should 
be disclosed to the public.
<P>
	I would now like to address the issue of lobbyists' contracts. 
This bill exempts in-house corporate lobbyists from reporting 
information on their contracts, although consultant lobbyists are 
required to report this information. Again, legislators should 
learn from the aborted attempt to privatize Pearson airport. If 
the bill is adopted without changes, businesses may be tempted 
to hire only in-house corporate lobbyists for megaprojects such 
as the privatization of Pearson airport.
<P>
	Greater transparency in that regard would certainly be to their 
advantage, as it would put an end to biases against them as well 
as sometimes questionable speculations about their income. I 
would like to say, however, that the purpose of a lobbyists 
registration act is not to regulate the profession, although 
Parliament has the right, and even the duty, to supervise the 
functioning of the public administration that lobbyists try to 
influence.
<P>
	The close ties connecting a large number of lobbyists to 
public officials, politicians and their political staff in the 
Pearson airport affair demonstrated the magnitude of the 
problem. Yet, the press was not allowed to disclose  the 
troubling facts surrounding the Pearson airport deal to the 
general public until the privatization process was over. This 
sorry affair, which had repercussions on taxpayers, could have 
been avoided had legislation been in place to prevent the kind of 
uncontrolled skids that have sullied this privatization attempt.
<P>
	It is therefore reasonable that those who seek to influence the 
actions of an administration should also be subject to public 
scrutiny. Let us be clear on one thing: in a democracy, it is 
normal for organizations, businesses and lobbies to solicit 
support from the elected representatives of the people. This is 
totally legitimate. What is unacceptable, however, is that 
individuals and businesses who can afford to do so get tax 
deductions for their lobbying expenses. This has the effect of 
disadvantaging even more those organizations which cannot 
afford to counteract the pressure brought to bear by businesses 
that can afford to hire lobbyists.
<P>
	That is why we recommend that tax deductions for lobbying 
fees be abolished. Also missing in Bill C-43 is a provision 
forbidding lobbyists from circumventing the act. Here again, 
that provision was included in the Holtmann report which the 
Liberals appreciated so much when it was tabled.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The government should, if its commitments are sincere, 
include a clause to prevent avoidance of the law. Secret rules 
between lobbyists and public office holders are another 
problem. They contribute to the mistrust of Canadians toward 
elected representatives. That is why we ask the government to 
give the status of statutory instrument to the code of conduct of 
public office holders.
<P>
	This debate is an opportunity for the Liberal government to 
demonstrate to the public that it really wants more openness in 
the dealings of lobbyists with the federal government. The 
recommendations of the Bloc are not meant to promote the 
image of a specific political party. They would be a great service 
rendered to all politicians in this House and to other public 
office holders.
<P>
	This whole issue is too important to be left to partisan debate. 
It is the price we have to pay to restore public trust in our 
democratic institutions. Another great means to restore that 
trust would be to pass legislation on political party fundraising. 
That would contribute to renewed confidence in the operation of 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for understanding so 
well the issues involved in this very important legislation, Bill 
C-43.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberals came up with their 
famous red book. We heard a lot about it, since that document 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12124"> 12124 </A></B>
<P>
included all the election promises which the Liberals were 
supposedly going to implement if elected.
<P>
	The Liberals are now in office. In their red book, they pledged 
to implement the recommendations of the Holtmann report. 
That report was drafted by a parliamentary committee which 
specifically looked at the issue of lobbying. The 
recommendations made in the Holtmann report went very far as 
regards different tiers of lobbyists, as well as disclosure.
<P>
	A number of witnesses appeared before the current 
committee, the Zed committee, which tabled a report which is 
another red book. Red books keep coming out, but they are not 
all the same. This one contradicts the election promises made, 
since it does not go as far as the Holtmann report recommended.
<P>
	The government seems to be trying to create some confusion 
in this regard and I would like the hon. member to tell me one 
thing. The Liberal government is claiming to go farther than the 
Holtmann report, for example with the appointment of an ethics 
counsellor. Is that not terrific, Mr. Speaker? However, if you 
take a closer look, you realize that the ethics counsellor is really 
just a puppet controlled by the Prime Minister. Indeed, that 
person is appointed by the Prime Minister and will first report to 
the Prime Minister, behind closed doors. We, members of the 
official opposition, will know little about the counsellor's work, 
in terms of the analysis, research, inquiry and investigation 
conducted.
<P>
	The member referred to two very important issues, namely the 
whole episode involving the Minister of Canadian Heritage and 
his secret visit to the United States on behalf of friends of the 
government, as well as the Pearson saga, which also benefited 
friends of the government. Whether the government is Liberal 
or Conservative, the result is invariably the same: the rich 
benefit at the expense of the poor.
<P>
	My question is this: If the ethics counsellor were appointed by 
Parliament and accountable to it, to us elected members, would 
it help reach the objective of Bill C-43, which is to promote 
transparency? I wonder if the hon. member could elaborate.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before giving the floor to the hon. 
member for Lévis, I should explain that, generally speaking, the 
Chair seeks to recognize a member from another party to let him 
or her ask a question, rather than giving the floor to another 
member from the same party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, we cannot refer to the absence of hon. 
members in this House, but you are right to point out that, since 
there are no Liberal members to ask me questions, a question 
was put to me by our own critic. This is a little unusual, since we 
are having a debate today. To have a debate, it usually takes two 
opposing sides to present the pros and cons of a bill. This is the 
way it has always been since Greek Antiquity, since the 
beginning of democracy. True democracy began with debates.
<P>
	Today, I was able to speak to this bill a little earlier than 
expected because no member of the Liberal Party wished to 
speak. And now, after my speech, I have one hon. member from 
our own side of the House asking me questions. This is a bit 
surprising.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm for the really remarkable job 
he has done on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> He wrote the dissenting opinion himself and his 
document was very carefully thought out. I think what he did 
was very important-and I am not saying that just to flatter 
him-but, thanks to his work, we can condemn the Liberal 
government for taking too much time, in my opinion, to fulfil a 
promise it made.
<P>
	Let me come back to the specific question that was put to me: 
should the ethics counsellor be accountable to the House? I think 
it would not set a precedent since, as you and I know, Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor general reports to the House on financial 
matters relating to the operation of the government. Why should 
it be different when we deal with ethics, a more technical aspect 
of the operation of the machinery of government? If there is one 
thing that can help us restore trust, as proposed in the document, 
it is the kind of proposal made by the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm, which would help to improve government 
operations and especially restore trust.
<P>
	You may wonder why a sovereignist who expects to take part 
in a referendum on Quebec's sovereignty would make 
recommendations which could apply for the next seven years. 
This just shows you the non-partisan way the Bloc Quebecois is 
speaking to this bill. We even said to Canada, our future 
neighbours-because we do like English Canadians-that we all 
ought to do a really good job in this instance, so that we can pass 
on to our future neighbours a House of Commons and a 
machinery of government that are truly open and honest.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this bill 
today.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the hon. member from the Bloc. When 
he started talking about the non-partisan way that the Bloc was 
speaking to the bill, I thought I might have to leave the room for 
fear that lightning would strike through the ceiling at any time. 
However we are far enough apart that perhaps it would not have 
affected me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12125"> 12125 </A></B>
<P>
	I spoke to some amendments to this bill a short time ago and 
outlined some of the things I felt the bill lacked. The Liberal red 
book made a promise on which all Liberals ran in the election. 
That promise basically said that a Liberal government wanted 
most desperately to return integrity to our political institution 
and that such integrity had to be restored.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	That is a heck of a statement and it played well with many 
Canadians. Canadians had lost much confidence and trust in the 
way government did business. Canada was in a very sorry state. I 
know I felt apathy from the electors in my election campaign. 
The most common comment I heard was: ``Listen, I hear what 
you are saying, but politicians are all the same. Once you get 
there it is a different world. The deals are made behind closed 
doors. Going there with a noble cause like Don Quixote is not 
going to do any good because there is no integrity left in that 
place in Ottawa''.
<P>
	At the same time the Liberals were saying: ``We are going 
there and if we form the government, we are going to restore 
integrity''.
<P>
	When Bill C-43, an act to control the activities of lobbyists 
and people that are influenced by lobbyists first became 
available my first reaction was that the Liberals were to do 
something. They were to put some visibility into how lobbyists 
operate within the confines of ministerial and government 
offices with all bureaucrats alike.
<P>
	When I picked up the bill and started reading I had great 
expectations. I thought that finally the Liberals would fulfil a 
promise of the red book. I almost said blue book because we 
have made that same promise. When we become the government 
next time and address the subject of lobbyists, we will do 
something far better than Bill C-43.
<P>
	I looked for things like the establishment of an ethics 
counsellor. This was a tremendous step. Then I started reading 
about how the ethics counsellor was to be established and was 
very surprised to see that the counsellor who was to look into the 
activities of all members of Parliament-Liberal, Bloc, Reform 
Party and Independents-was to be chosen and appointed not by 
the members of Parliament, as one would expect for an 
independent person, but by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I said to myself: ``This really doesn't sound right. My 
understanding of an ethics counsellor, who looks after the 
dealings of Parliament, the people that work in government, 
should be someone who would come before the entire House of 
Commons, present his or her credentials and have the approval 
of Parliament as a whole''. This is not the case.
<P>
	We have an ethics counsellor who is appointed by the Prime 
Minister. I do not know but perhaps he is a Liberal. The Prime 
Minister said it is hard to find anyone in the country who is not a 
Liberal any more because so many people voted for the Liberal 
Party. Therefore one  has to assume this independent ethics 
counsellor could possibly be a Liberal.
<P>
	I also looked for comfort in the ethics counsellor. Once I 
found that he would not be independent I looked for some 
comfort. I thought: ``Even though he was chosen by the Prime 
Minister, perhaps he may have to report to Parliament''. I read 
the bill looking for these key phrases and I found that he does not 
have to report to Parliament. He reports directly back to the very 
person who appointed him in the first place. I thought: ``This 
doesn't sound like an independent ethics counsellor''. I was 
really let down from my great expectations of at least restoring 
some integrity and honesty to the government and to the way 
things are done in the House.
<P>
	One of my colleagues put together an amendment that would 
bring the ethics counsellor into a true position of independence. 
The amendment said basically that the ethics counsellor would 
be approved by Parliament as a whole. The ethics counsellor 
would create a code of ethics under which lobbyists and 
government people alike would have to operate. The ethics 
counsellor would also have to report to Parliament. I thought 
this was a good amendment.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague spent a lot of time working on this 
amendment. I was very surprised to see it defeated by the 
Liberal government, the same government that in the red book 
said it wanted to return some integrity to government. If its 
promises could be believed why would it reject an amendment 
that really created a truly independent ethics counsellor?
<P>
	I read on a little further and I realized that it was almost like 
when my wife sets out to make bread. If she uses all the other 
ingredients but forgets to put some yeast in the dough, we do not 
have much of a loaf of bread by the time it is cooked. It is very 
flat. That is what has happened to this bill. It has no yeast in it. It 
does not have the essential ingredients that will send a clear 
message to the people of Canada and to the members of other 
parties that the Liberal government is serious about returning 
integrity and honesty to government.
<P>
	When I spoke last week I said, and I may have surprised some 
of my colleagues, that I do not have too much of a problem 
personally with the job lobbyists do around here. I know what 
the game is all about. They are basically marketing people who 
come to Ottawa on behalf of companies or special interest 
groups to try to sell their client's point of view to government. It 
is a job. If they do it well they are very successful. I do not have 
any problem with someone making a living in the marketing 
business, lobbyist or otherwise.
<P>
	I really do have a problem with people in government who are 
in positions of trust, in positions of power, in positions of 
influence and how they react to lobbyists. In my opinion it is not 
so much the lobbyists that the  ethnics counsellor should be

concerned with. He or she should be concerned with the people 
in government.
<P>
	Without the structure in place, without the independence that 
the ethics counsellor could freely operate under, basically that 
person's hands are tied. There is no way that person is going to 
have independence when it is a personal appointment by the 
Prime Minister, where the position is not approved by the House 
of Commons as a whole and where the ethics counsellor would 
not have to report back to Parliament.
<P>
	Some instances have come up during this Parliament, some 
most recently where an independent ethics counsellor could 
answer questions that are on the minds of the Canadian people. I 
would like to talk about two of the most recent ones which just 
came to light the other day about the grant to the port of 
Belledune.
<P>
	About two weeks ago the Minister of Transport said to the 
press very plainly that there would be not one red cent of 
government grant money going to the port of Belledune as long 
as he was the Minister of Transport. He said: ``I wouldn't even 
give a dime in grant money for the port of Saint John''. That was 
two weeks ago.
<P>
	A couple of days ago we found that in fact the Minister of 
Transport from his own department is granting about $4.5 
million to this port project and another $1.5 million is 
apparently coming from some other department. In that 
two-week period something happened to facilitate this 
complete turnaround in the mind of the Minister of Transport. 
What was that? I suggest someone possibly lobbied the Minister 
of Transport. When a minister of his stature does a complete turn 
around in two weeks, I am sure there are a lot of people in the 
maritimes wondering what happened; he said one thing and then 
two weeks later said another thing, totally opposite.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	That question in the minds of Canadians and in the minds of a 
lot of members could be answered if we had a true ethics 
counsellor who represented all members of Parliament. He 
would be independent to look at that.
<P>
	As a private member I could go to the ethics counsellor and 
present a written inquiry: ``I am concerned about this. Why did 
the Minister of Transport say two weeks ago he would give no 
grant money and then two weeks later he said he would, to the 
tune of $6 million?''
<P>
	This is a small amount compared with some others. We can 
talk about the highways project involving the minister of public 
works. It appears there was some backroom dealing and now the 
minister of public works is being questioned about possibly 
influencing the diversion of some funds allotted to one project 
over another area of the province. These are questions people of 
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have. They are asking: ``What 
happened here? The minister of public works said one thing and 
now he does another thing''.
<P>
	If we had an independent ethics counsellor then private 
members from all parties in the House would have the freedom 
to receive inquiries from everywhere in Canada about what 
government bureaucracy is doing, what ministers are doing, 
what any other representative of the government is doing with 
tax dollars, why they are making these decisions. We do not have 
that freedom now. If integrity, honesty and visibility are ever to 
be restored to the House then we must have it.
<P>
	Some parts of the bill I thought were reasonably positive; the 
part which increases the disclosure requirements for lobbyists, 
especially to tier two in-house lobbyist. As I have said before, I 
do not have as much of a problem with lobbyists as some of my 
colleagues have. I have more problem with the government, but 
that is a positive.
<P>
	The bill talks about lobbyists whose clients are coalitions and 
will have disclose the membership of the coalition. Finally the 
Canadian people should have the opportunity to see what special 
interest groups are lobbying the government for special favours 
or more money.
<P>
	The bill will add government funding and the subject matter 
of lobbying proposal to disclosure requirements. That is a good 
part of the bill. It extends the statute of limitations for 
investigations from six months to two years. Those are all good 
things.
<P>
	All of the good parts of the bill are negated because there is no 
independence in any type of inquiry that could result from an 
incident. I listed the positives and I used a very short part of the 
page to list the negatives. Surprisingly enough it was quite a bit 
longer. I am sure my colleagues came up with the same results.
<P>
	I want to talk about some of the negatives. This bill classifies 
lobbyists not on what they do but whom they work for. Lobbyists 
should be defined by their activities, not their employers. Who 
employs them is really of no consequence. The focus should be 
on what they are doing on the Hill.
<P>
	In our opinion all professional lobbyists should be treated the 
same. The red book promises recommendations from the 1992 
unanimous Holtmann report would be implemented by the 
Liberal government. Removal of the tiers was an explicit 
Holtmann report recommendation. This has not been done.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	A lobbyist is defined as someone who lobbies as a significant 
part of their duties. John Turner, who may only lobby two or 
three times a year, can make the case that this is not a significant 
part of his duties, but what he does may have a significant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12127"> 12127 </A></B>
<P>
impact on government. He may be able to have a significant 
impact on decision making.
<P>
	We have many cases in which questions have arisen in the 
House about the activities of government which simply cannot 
be answered because we do not have a mechanism by which to 
have an independent inquiry into those questions. Recently we 
have talked about the direct to home satellite episode. We have 
talked, as we did today in the House, about the Seagram episode. 
We have talked about the Pearson episode and now we are 
having a public inquiry into it. That is good, but a public inquiry 
may have been averted if we had a position in the House where 
an independent inquiry could have been made by someone 
designated by all members of the House.
<P>
	Probably one of the more questionable policies the 
government has undertaken is the infamous credit card 
infrastructure program. We spent day after day as Reformers 
telling the Canadian people about some of the incredible 
projects in the infrastructure program. My colleague from 
Calgary talked about the expensive box seats at the Calgary 
Saddledome. Could one suspect there was some lobbying done 
in that instance? What kind of conversations went on behind 
closed doors? We could even talk about the situation in the 
Prime Minister's riding of the now infamous canoe hall of fame.
<P>
	The list goes on and on. One could stand here for a full 20 
minutes to bring up circumstances or happenings which have 
raised questions in the minds of the Canadian people as to how 
the government does business, why these decisions were made, 
exactly who were the lobbyists who did the influencing and how 
much influence they had on government officials who were 
placed in a position of trust.
<P>
	There are three words which sum up what Canadian people are 
looking for in the House not being addressed by this bill: 
accountability, legitimacy and autonomy: accountability of 
MPs, ministers and people in positions of trust in government, 
accountability for their decisions and how they use taxpayers' 
money, and how they make decisions which influence the 
society in which we live and the morality of the country; 
legitimacy in the operation of Parliament. People want to see 
their members representing them in a responsible and legitimate 
fashion. With respect to autonomy, I speak of the autonomy of 
an ethics counsellor. It is imperative to the position. 
Unfortunately in Bill C-43 these three words and what they 
mean are missing.
<P>
	Government members stood on many soapboxes during the 
campaign and promised the people they were speaking to that a 
Liberal government would bring honesty, integrity and 
accountability back to Parliament. If they truly believe Bill 
C-43 is a step in that direction, they have sadly missed the mark.
<P>
	I am very disappointed our very commonsensical 
amendments to the bill were not accepted by the Liberal Party. 
They were defeated. We will continue to speak about 
accountability, honesty and integrity in the House until the 
government gets the message. I hope it does some day.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Reformers like to believe we have brought honesty to 
Parliament. I cannot support Bill C-43 because the essential 
ingredients to make it a good bill are simply not there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I share the view expressed by the member of the third 
party in this House that, to restore the integrity of our 
democratic institutions, the government has to stop making 
empty promises that mislead the public. I think that, as the 
member mentioned, the commitments made by the Liberal Party 
in its red book and what it is doing now as a government indicate 
clearly that, once again, we have a government that is constantly 
misleading the public with regard to certain commitments it 
made in the past and to the legislation it is introducing to 
supposedly honour these commitments.
<P>
	It is not often that I have a chance to say this, but I agree with 
some of the things that the member said concerning the 
legislation itself. I understand that he was surprised to see some 
things in this bill that appeared to be good at first glance. If there 
is one thing that this government is to be given credit for, it is its 
ability to hide almost everything it does behind a smoke screen. 
It gives the impression that it is doing something, which is fairly 
important for a government. We have to recognize that it is one 
of this government's strengths. However, once we get through 
the smoke screen, we realize immediately that there is 
absolutely nothing behind it, and that is just awful.
<P>
	The member mentioned this a few moments ago when he said 
that he was surprised to find in this bill some elements which 
seemed good at first glance but which, after a closer look, turned 
out to be just terrible. One example he gave, and rightly so, is the 
ethics counsellor. Yes, Mr. Speaker, it is a good thing to have an 
ethics counsellor. Yes, it is important. Yes, it is important to 
have investigations. That is what we see in Bill C-43. Yes, it is 
important to have some kind of report on these investigations. 
That is what the government is saying. But when we look closely 
at what is in the bill, we can see that the ethics counsellor is 
appointed by the Prime Minister, that his investigations are 
secret and that he will be only required to prepare a report 
including his findings, his conclusions and the reasons for his 
conclusions. That is all the proof we are going to have that he has 
done his job.
<P>
	If that is not a smoke screen, then I do not know what it is. The 
Liberals say one thing and do the opposite. They want to be 
transparent, but there is no transparency in Bill C-43. They want 
to give credibility to their government, but Bill C-43 will 
certainly not do the trick. When will they listen to the 
opposition's demands? This is serious. The official opposition 
and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12128"> 12128 </A></B>
<P>
third party moved more than 60 amendments to achieve the 
desired transparency. Sixty times, the government said no to  
transparency and no to integrity when we were just trying to help 
it stick to the promises it made during the election campaign.
<P>
	I will conclude by asking a question of the hon. member, 
because I think that he has a very good understanding of the 
problems with Bill C-43. I now want to get back to the ethics 
counsellor. Let us suppose that that counsellor is appointed by 
Parliament and that his or her inquiry report on a specific case, 
for example the Pearson contract, if it were still an issue, 
contained not only conclusions, but also the rationale leading to 
these conclusions. Does the hon. member think that that would 
give us the transparency that Bill C-43 is supposed to bring to 
the system?
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
concurrence with my remarks.
<P>
	In order to obtain the integrity of this House and the 
transparency and the visibility the Canadian people are looking 
for one has to have a truly independent ethics counsellor.
<P>
	Perhaps I can give this example. It is almost like two baseball 
teams playing a game of baseball. If the umpire is chosen by 
both teams to be independent then it is a fine game. However, if 
the umpire is chosen by only one team then how can the other 
team have any confidence that it will be a fair game?
<P>
	That is what the Canadian people are saying. How do they 
have any confidence in what is happening in government when 
all the rules are determined by the Liberal government and the 
opposition party and the Reform Party do not have input into 
some very fundamental elements of fairness and integrity in the 
House?
<P>
	The Liberals may say they are the government, they have a 
majority, a majority of the people voted for them. That is fine, 
but I would like to remind the Liberal Party that there were 
several million other people in Canada who did not vote for 
them, and they are looking very closely at what this government 
is doing. If the Liberal government wants to try to swing their 
vote the next time, they are looking for the government to give 
them some message and some reason to vote for them again.
<P>
	If the Liberal government carries on the way it has been, not 
fulfilling its promises, even a good majority of its supporters, 
those who voted for it the last time, will become disillusioned 
with the fact that the Liberal government has no more intention 
of delivering visibility in the way it operates than the previous 
Tory government had.
<P>
	I hope to remind the Liberal government of what happened to 
the previous Tory government when it did all its business behind 
closed doors. That should be a good lesson for this government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased that my turn has come to speak to Bill C-43. For 
those who just arrived and those who, maybe, have just tuned in, 
I would like to say that Bill C-43 is a bill which the government 
has tabled to regulate lobbyists on Parliament Hill.
<P>
	Lobbyists are individuals or associations who represent 
private interests. There are all kinds of lobbyists. Some 
represent legitimate associations, such as the Canadian 
Association of Firefighters, farmers, etc. But there are also more 
worrisome lobbyists who try to influence the government for the 
benefit of private interests. Sometimes, these interests do not 
serve the general public interest, and often represent unjust 
causes.
<P>
	This is what the Canadian public is concerned about. We have 
known for a very long time, maybe a decade or more, that the 
general public wants lobbying activities to be regulated to make 
them more transparent, to bring out in the open what exactly it is 
that lobbyists do. The public is concerned because it knows that 
the work of lobbyists often leads to abuses of authority. We saw 
this very recently in a series of troubling cases.
<P>
	For example, there is the case of the Pearson airport contract. 
It was mentioned during debate. This was a contract prepared by 
Conservative and Liberal lobbyists which amounted to hundreds 
of millions of dollars. We still do not have all the facts on this 
matter. However, the Conservative Senate decided, today, to 
appoint a commission of inquiry into this use of lobbying.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	There was also a second case, one which clearly shows how 
lobbying can vary considerably, the case of bovine somatotropin 
or BST. This substance is a hormone produced by Monsanto, a 
pharmaceutical company which wants to introduce BST in 
Canada to increase milk production. Well, the Monsanto 
lobbyists managed to influence Health Canada, they even bribed 
Health Canada officials, so much so that, even though the 
industry disagrees and the population disagrees, Canada will 
soon have milk produced through the use of BST. This is the 
result of a disturbing kind of lobbying.
<P>
	There was also the case of the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
who tried to exert influence on an agency under his 
responsibility. He interceded directly on behalf of one of his 
constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12129"> 12129 </A></B>
<P>
	Really, Bill C-43 on lobbying raises questions of fairness, 
justice and transparency. It has been said over and over again, 
we want a bill that would really regulate lobbying because we 
know there were cases of abuse of power and that colossal sums 
of money can be taken out of the system for the benefit of some 
special interests.
<P>
	This is what Canadians are concerned about. As you know, we 
have a weakened bill here. At first, what was proposed with Bill 
C-43 was legislation that had teeth, that members of the 
opposition could have approved.
<P>
	The government could have presented a bill offering more 
transparency in such cases. What happened is that lobbyists 
themselves intervened in the development of this bill to water it 
down and weaken it to the point that the bill we are dealing with 
today is no better than the previous act. It is indeed all smoke 
and mirrors. As far as control and openness with regard to 
lobbyists is concerned the situation has not really changed, as 
evidenced by the government's refusal to put into Bill C-43 the 
provisions we recommended with regard to the ethics 
counsellor.
<P>
	Currently, there is an ethics counsellor appointed by the 
Prime Minister and that he can consult if he wants. But as we 
know very well, in the instances I just mentioned, despite abuse 
of power and disturbing cases of lobbying, the Prime Minister 
did not consult his ethics counsellor. We know it because he 
admitted it himself.
<P>
	So, we now have an ethics counsellor, but the House of 
Commons cannot turn to him, because the Prime Minister has 
him in his pocket, so to speak.
<P>
	We would like to see in the bill a clause providing that the 
ethics counsellor be appointed by the House and report directly 
to the House. In that way, the ethics counsellor would be 
independent enough to intervene in the issues and settle them 
and would be empowered to investigate even if it means 
bringing proceedings against lobbyists or people abusing their 
power.
<P>
	I think that in this case, the essential condition for a strong 
piece of legislation that has teeth and that will be respected, is to 
have an ethics counsellor appointed by the House and reporting 
directly to the House, and operating sufficiently at arm's length, 
like the auditor general, to settle issues.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We make that request because there are issues we would like 
the ethics counsellor to be able to decide. An example would be 
the whole question of conflicts of interest which has been under 
discussion for several weeks concerning direct-to-home 
television broadcasting. This is a case of lobbying that is 
particularly interesting and even quite disturbing.
<P>
	You are familiar with that case, but, for the sake of those who 
are not, let me outline the particulars of the incident we have 
been dealing with for a couple of weeks. A wholly Canadian 
company called Expressvu Inc. managed to get the direct 
television broadcasting  contract. Direct broadcasting means 
programs are transmitted directly by satellite and not through 
cable companies. Expressvu complied with the rules of the 
CRTC and its bid got CRTC approval. The whole process had 
begun several months earlier.
<P>
	Just when the decision was about to be made in favour of 
Expressvu, a new company called Power DirecTv came into the 
picture at the last minute and managed to have the CRTC 
decision overturned so as to get at least part of that market. We 
all know that Power DirecTv belongs to the son-in-law of the 
Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	That is what I call patronage. It is hard to imagine that, in such 
a case, a private company could act so quickly to set up a 
network of influences in order to have a CRTC decision 
overturned by the federal cabinet. That takes some doing. It 
takes some clout to get the consensus needed in the federal 
cabinet to overturn a proper decision by the CRTC. This is the 
first and only time in the history of the CRTC that such a thing 
has happened. It is really incredible. All this just to further the 
interests of a fully private corporation chaired by the Prime 
Minister's son-in-law.
<P>
	It is really incredible. It takes some clout to do that. That is 
some kind of lobbying. One might even say that the Liberal 
government is lobbying for Power Corporation. It is a known 
fact that Power Corporation has certain ties in Canada. Its 
network of influences was active throughout the federal 
government and even put pressure on the very top, the cabinet, 
in order to have the CRTC decision overturned, a first in the 
history of the CRTC, all in the interest of a private company 
which wields a great deal of clout.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	In fact, as I said before, one wonders whether the Liberal 
government was perhaps lobbying for Power Corporation, 
because the process to promote Power DirecTv included 
appointing a panel of three former deputy ministers, all friends 
of Power Corporation and of Mr. Goldenberg, an adviser to the 
Prime Minister. We know that Michael Pitfield, the senator and 
former Clerk of the Privy Council, is also a vice-president of 
Power Corporation. Many of those involved are very, very close 
to the Prime Minister. They are almost part of a family. In fact, 
they are family.
<P>
	So all this raises a number of questions. How did they manage 
to reverse a decision so quickly, to influence cabinet? 
Meanwhile, and this is what I find so amazing, they managed to 
give the impression that the Prime Minister himself was not 
involved in this decision. That takes some doing.
<P>
	They managed to give that impression, despite the fact that he 
was surrounded by friends, neighbours, a son-in-law, former 
colleagues, and so forth, and they managed to reverse the 
CRTC's decision. They brazenly claimed that the Prime 
Minister himself was not involved in this decision, but that is 
inconceivable. We understand  how this could happen when we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12130"> 12130 </A></B>
<P>
realize that Mr. Desmarais, the head of Power Corporation, is a 
very powerful man in this country. So powerful that he is able to 
use cabinet to further his own interests and, on top of that, he 
manages to control the media. That is what he did. He controlled 
the media. He controlled public opinion in Canada. That is quite 
a feat.
<P>
	Normally, if Mr. Desmarais had not been the kind of man he 
is, if this had been a normal case, once this conspiracy, this 
massive lobbying on the part of the government in favour of 
Power Corporation was revealed, the headlines of newspapers 
across the country would have screamed ``Nepotism, 
Nepotism''. The Prime Minister is giving preferential treatment 
to his son-in-law's company. That is obvious.
<P>
	The long and the short of it is that, Mr. Desmarais owns the 
newspaper <I>La Presse</I> in Montreal. He is very close to Conrad 
Black, who controls nearly all newspapers in Quebec. They both 
have a major interest in Southam News across Canada, which 
controls L'Actualité and <I>Maclean's</I>. Now that is power.
<P>
	This man and his organization, Power Corporation, this is 
more than a lobby, this goes beyond lobbying. It is a superlobby. 
Not only did it reverse a CRTC decision, but it also swayed 
Cabinet in favour of one of Power Corporation's subsidiaries 
and used the press to influence public opinion.
<P>
	Why has this case been dropped? After, all it is extremely 
disquieting. In my opinion, this is reminiscent of the family 
compact era, which in the 19th century was so damaging for the 
interests of the state. A few families who controlled money, 
power and trade were intimately linked with the politicians in 
power. It caused, as we know, rebellions in both Upper and 
Lower Canada.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I do not mean to say by this that the issue will spark a rebellion 
because, obviously, we have come a long way since then. We are 
a very democratic country, but in essence, we have remained a 
family compact. It is the family compact revisited. This incident 
with Power DirecTv is a case in point that the family compact is 
coming back.
<P>
	And now, I come back to this doubt, to this suspicion that 
Power Corporation manipulated public opinion in order to 
distance the Prime Minister from a decision which has turned 
out so favourably for a company held by his son-in-law. Who in 
this country could doubt that the Prime Minister was unaware of 
this ploy? Legitimately and reasonably we have to assume he 
was involved even though in the House he has said he did not 
comment in Cabinet on this matter.
<P>
	However, that Saturday night, at the home of Paul Desmarais, 
his daughter's father-in-law, he could have easily discussed it. 
Do you not agree with me, Mr. Speaker? He could easily have 
talked it over with his senior adviser, Mr. Goldenberg. Just as he 
could have spoken to Michael Pitfield or his buddies, there are 
so  many of them. Can we for a moment think that the Prime 
Minister was not familiar with this matter? Impossible.
<P>
	I contend that it is definitely a question of honour for the 
Prime Minister to obtain a decision in favour of Power DirecTv. 
It is a question of honour, of power and of fine politicking. This 
is politics at its highest and finest level. We know that all 
politicians want power. Supreme power is having the ability to 
do whatever one wants and to be totally above suspicion.
<P>
	It is a matter of degree of corruption, in fact, because this is a 
case of corruption. We must not fool ourselves. It is a sign of 
extraordinary power when you can reach such a level of 
corruption and be totally above suspicion. For the Prime 
Minister it is a question of honour. The Prime Minister cannot 
not know about this matter. He was surely aware of everything 
that was happening.
<P>
	He used all his power so that it would pass, because he could 
not say to his daughter: ``My dear, your husband cannot have a 
favourable decision. We cannot overturn the decision of the 
CRTC''. He could not say such a thing to his daughter or to his 
son-in-law. The honourable thing would have been for him to 
say: ``My son-in-law, you will have it. Not only will you have 
it, but no one will suspect that I tipped the balance in your 
favour''. And this is what he did.
<P>
	How could he live with himself as Prime Minister, honourable 
and powerful as he is, if he had failed to grant this favour to his 
son-in-law? I close by saying that this is lobbying at its finest. 
This one more reason, one of many, why we need clear and very 
strong legislation and why we should certainly improve Bill 
C-43.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the 
presentation of my colleague from the Bloc. I was particularly 
intrigued with the examples he used of actual blatant lobbying 
or presumed lobbying, but we do not for sure.
<P>
	I have to underline what he said in the sense that the process 
being produced as a result of Bill C-43 falls completely short of 
having the ability to assure Canadians there is nothing wrong 
when nothing is wrong. In other words, if there is something 
wrong here we should have an ethics counsellor who would have 
total freedom to investigate and so declare it. If there is nothing 
wrong he should have total freedom and independence so he 
would be believable. Both these elements are missing in the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12131"> 12131 </A></B>
<P>
	It is so important when we talk about Bill C-43 that we also 
talk about the openness and accountability provided in it and the 
potential missed by the things not disclosed.
<P>
	One of the elements that is a source of great annoyance and 
suspicion to Canadians is lobbyists very often are trading on 
previous attachments and previous connections.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on that aspect of it, 
whether lobbyists if they are to be required to register should 
also be required to indicate their previous political work, their 
political connections, and whether they should be required to 
indicate things like substantial donations to political parties. 
That would increase the openness and I suppose it would do a 
great deal to introduce a self-policing effect to the whole 
process.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his question. The answer is obvious. Of course, we would like to 
introduce every possible amendment to give more teeth to Bill 
C-43, which has lost quite a few since it was introduced. We 
want this bill to be stronger, and every bit of information 
regarding lobbyists should be disclosed, including their 
donations to political parties and their political affiliation. All 
the information should be provided to ensure greater 
transparency. I justify this disclosure requirement simply 
because when lobbyists are subject to no controls, no 
restrictions, obviously this leads to all sorts of abuses.
<P>
	It is sure, for instance, that if we cannot have an independent 
ethics counsellor, a counsellor appointed by the House rather 
than by the Prime Minister, this really puts the value of this bill 
and the lobbying on Parliament Hill into question. It proves that 
the general public is right to be seriously concerned about 
lobbying. Again, the worst of it all is that it affects us personally 
as politicians because it casts doubt on us. Introducing a bill like 
Bill C-43 regarding lobbyists brings our political integrity into 
question because, as politicians, we know that there is 
corruption and abuse of power in those circles. The fact is that 
we are in a position to act and pass a bill that would have teeth, 
but we are not taking advantage of this possibility.
<P>
	This brings us into disrepute. The public is perfectly justified 
in questioning the integrity of politicians because, no matter 
what people say about politicians, I know that there are certain 
things that we cannot do, like perform miracles. But in this 
House we have the possibility and power to make a good bill out 
of a bill like this one. We could make sure that the ethics 
counsellor is appointed by the House of Commons, thereby 
ensuring greater transparency in a matter of great concern to the 
general public.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
What I find appalling in this is that we have been discussing this 
matter for two days, accusing the government of all sorts of 
things, including a lack of  openness, and saying that this bill 
does not achieve the objective set by the government. We have 
said that government members are reneging on their own 
election promises. We have said all kinds of things in this House 
but the Liberals listening to us are not saying anything. Silence 
means consent. They are not saying anything because we are 
right. This bill is an empty shell and does not do anything to 
ensure openness.
<P>
	I will read some of the clauses so that you can understand why 
the average citizen thinks this bill is a crock.
<P>
	With respect to the code of conduct, the bill provides that: 
``The Governor in Council may designate any person as the 
Ethics Counsellor for the purposes of this Act''. The term 
``governor in council'' means the Prime Minister and his team. 
This piece of legislation will therefore be administered by a 
friend of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	According to another clause, the code of conduct-to be 
developed by a friend of the Prime Minister who will be 
appointed to the post of ethics counsellor by the Prime 
Minister-is not a statutory instrument. The government goes to 
the trouble of indicating in the bill that the code is not a statutory 
instrument and should not be implemented as such.
<P>
	Another clause states that: ``The investigation shall be 
conducted in private''. This confirms, once again, that we are 
right in saying that they were not honest in drafting this bill.
<P>
	According to another clause, ``After conducting an 
investigation, the Ethics Counsellor shall prepare a report of the 
investigation, including the findings, conclusions and reasons 
for his conclusions, and submit it to the Registrar General of 
Canada''. Again, this investigation will be conducted secretly 
and the Prime Minister will receive a nice report, while we will 
have to make do with the reasons for the conclusions they will 
condescend to share with us.
<P>
	I understand why they feel uncomfortable and do not wish to 
rise in this House to defend this bill. I will use parliamentary 
language to avoid being censured. I understand why they do not 
wish to rise. What I do not understand is why, before this bill 
was tabled in this House, they did not warn their caucus that they 
were reneging on their election promises, that the bill did not go 
far enough. They could have argued that we need transparency 
because nobody wants to be a member of Parliament anymore. 
Nobody trusts us any more.
<P>
	I was a lawyer before I became a member of Parliament. 
People used to tell me that lawyers had a bad reputation but 
when I informed them that I wanted to go into politics, they told 
me, ``Are you crazy? It is even worse than being a lawyer''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12132"> 12132 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill gives us an opportunity to increase openness, to 
improve the reputation of members of Parliament. What did 
they come up with? A mess. Instead of restoring confidence, 
they are abusing the trust of Canadian taxpayers, and that is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Your time has expired. I imagine that 
the hon. member does not wish to comment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Kamloops-Taxation; the hon. member for Thunder 
Bay-Atikokan-International Trade.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to speak to Bill C-43. I thank my colleagues 
for the intercession. It was amazing and perhaps amusing. I can 
see that the bill generates a little emotion.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Before addressing the specifics of the bill and more 
specifically the issue of ethics counsellor, I would like to do a 
little lobbying of my own. This is completely off topic but I 
know members will understand.
<P>
	In the years I have sat here there has been nothing more 
glorious than the stained glass windows of the Chamber in the 
afternoon sun. I am lobbying on behalf of whoever wants to look 
at the windows or whoever created them. They are absolutely 
marvellous, gorgeous. They do not have a whole lot to do with 
the bill, but they give us a sense of awe.
<P>
	Those of us elected by the Canadian people have been given a 
terrific amount of trust. People have entrusted us with virtually 
everything in terms of laws and legislation that have to do with 
federal lawmaking. We should be humble and full of awe that 
somebody chose us. We were the winners of the 1993 election. 
Those of us on the government benches and those of us on the 
opposition benches have an incredible responsibility to the 
people who elected us to try to do the best job we could.
<P>
	Someone just before me got very emotional about this matter. 
For the reasons I will continue to lay out, it is important that 
whatever we do in this place be seen as important, as fair and as 
upfront to those in the Canadian public who pay the bills for this 
place such as the bill for the stained glass windows.
<P>
	As I look at Bill C-43 I wonder from time to time about things 
I have heard from the government benches and about things I 
have seen in the red book about honesty and integrity in 
government. Canadians are seeking real political change. It is 
not just a matter of for whom to vote in an election, what they 
should do or who should be put on the government benches. 
They have sent some loud and clear signals. Certainly in the 
Charlottetown accord debate in 1992 they asked loudly: ``What 
part of no don't you understand? '' They said the accord was 
dead, deader than dead. They wanted  politicians to pay 
attention and listen to what they had to say.
<P>
	In 1993 they sent some pretty clear signals as well. The 
governing party was obliterated because people wanted to be 
able to trust their politicians. They wanted to make them more 
responsive and more accountable in the entire political system. 
We cannot continue to sit in Parliament and say it does not 
matter, that some folk on the outside watch the parliamentary 
channel but basically do not know what goes on here.
<P>
	A former Tory colleague said at a public meeting on the 
Charlottetown accord in Grand Centre, Alberta: ``You people 
just do not understand''. As soon as political people, 
government members or opposition members, say that the 
people do not understand, we see a father knows best attitude in 
the country. That is the first sign to beware.
<P>
	If we think we have all the answers, we think we are giving the 
people what they want. However it is not what they want if we 
are not responsive or accountable. Surely the same fate awaits 
anyone in the House who makes the assumptions the last 
government did. In fact they are toast. It is a simple as that.
<P>
	In all probability most of us, as well as all other Canadians, 
talked about all the things we were to do. As campaigners and as 
people running for office we said: ``We are going to clean up the 
system. We are going to do politics differently and we are going 
to do politics better''. That is a quote of someone who is no 
longer here. She promised to do politics in a different way. She 
did and will be forever remembered.
<P>
	We in the 35th Parliament have an opportunity to make some 
changes to the system. We want to make it more open, 
responsive and accountable. We have put forward several 
motions and private members' bills designed to improve the 
political process and to open up democracy to which we should 
be paying attention.
<P>
	Recently we have seen government members being thrown 
out on their ear from all responsibilities they have. This is not 
the kind of thing the Canadian public is working toward.
<P>
	As we look at the bill under lobbying we see more of the same 
attitude. It is frustrating for me as someone on the opposition 
side. Many government backbenchers who sat in the last 
Parliament told the Tories what they were supposed to do, that 
the system was supposed to be transparent, totally visible. Yet 
the government is bringing in a bill which seems to be similar to 
the one of the previous government under Felix Holtmann who 
chaired a committee and came up with a report.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="12133"> 12133 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Let me tell members what it is stated in the red book: ``The 
integrity of government is put into question when there is a 
perception that the public agenda is set by lobbyists exercising 
undue influence away from public view''. That is absolutely 
true. I have to agree with that paragraph of the red book. 
Lobbyists are seen to be the people who are scurrying around 
Parliament Hill in people's offices wheeling and dealing and 
making special deals for themselves or the people whom they 
represent.
<P>
	Is the public perception about undue influence, cosy 
relationships, conflict of interest and influence peddling part of 
the traditional political process? Is it justified? Unfortunately it 
is because that is the way it has been.
<P>
	We have seen an incredible population explosion not just with 
my generation, the baby boomers, but with the lobbyists. They 
have mushroomed on Parliament Hill. All of us can look at our 
daybooks to see that a lot of time is filled up by lobbyists coming 
to visit. I am sure I do not have quite as many coming to see me 
in my office as perhaps the minister of heritage. Who knows 
whether they come to his office or whether he goes to theirs? 
That is immaterial at this point.
<P>
	Those who recall the pork barrelling and fervent patronage 
appointments in the final year of Mr. Trudeau's government 
remember the words of a certain fellow, Mr. Turner, who said: 
``I had no option''. There are all kinds of options open.
<P>
	What about folks who have read <I>On the Take</I>? That is a book I 
spent some time reading while I was on sick leave. I am not sure 
if it helped me recuperate or if it made me feel worse. However 
people will be persuaded when they read these kinds of books. 
They will wonder how in the world they trusted a person. They 
put an <I>x</I> beside a name and pay his or her wages. We read of this 
kind of stuff all the time about somebody receiving so many 
million dollars and somebody else receiving more.
<P>
	Those people who study and pay attention to the political 
process with respect to various government pressures on the 
decision of the CRTC that we have been witnessing are 
suspicious and will likely be persuaded as further information 
becomes available.
<P>
	Public perceptions are justified. These perceptions are true. 
Something needs to be done, not just to tinker with something to 
come up with a new bill but really make some serious changes. 
Can we do anything to remedy the situation, to foster new and 
more positive perceptions about the integrity of those who 
govern, about the political process, and about the lobbying 
industry? Of course there is something we can do.
<P>
	A thorough and sensible rewrite of the Lobbyists Registration 
Act could be part of the remedy. Will Bill C-43 do the job? I do 
not think it will because there are some gaping holes in it. I 
would like to refer to a couple of them.
<P>
	The first hole concerns the ethics counsellor and the 
lobbyists' code of conduct. The most important component in 
the process to regulate and control the lobbying industry will be 
the ethics counsellor. The individual appointed must be highly 
respected. He or she must carry the confidence of the public that 
watches all that goes on and pays the bills, as well as the 
confidence of the House. The ethics counsellor must be 
powerful with respect to investigative and reporting powers. 
Most important, the ethics counsellor must have a high degree of 
independence or autonomy.
<P>
	In theory that is the way it ought to be. I suspect everyone in 
the House would agree and everyone watching or reading about 
it in the newspapers would agree. I am sure they would say that 
makes sense. In reality that is not the freedom or the autonomy 
the person will actually receive.
<P>
	During the last election the Liberals clearly recognized the 
need to reform the practice of lobbying in Canada. We have 
heard about it for a long time. Chapter 6 of the red book is the 
most sensible chapter in the book. We need to see the 
government act on it. Nothing in the chapter calls for more 
money, which is refreshing. It was a pleasure to read it because it 
did not call for a lot of extra cash. Liberals and more cash seem 
to be synonymous terms. All they are really asking for and all we 
are asking them to act on is responsive responsible government.
<P>
	Moreover they recognized the significance of the ethics 
counsellor to the reform of the practice of lobbying. Let me 
quote a couple of phrases in chapter 6: ``A Liberal government 
will appoint an independent ethics counsellor to advise both 
public officials and lobbyists''. This is a great idea. It looks 
terrific. I am sure the Bloc would agree that it is a great idea. I 
am sure Liberal members, both cabinet and backbenchers, 
would say: ``What a terrific idea. It is in the red book. We agree 
with it, yes, but what happened? There is just that one little word 
in there, independent''.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you and I have seen what has gone on in the last 
months on TV or in the scrum outside the House. The ethics 
counsellor was brought in on a couple of things and was 
virtually muted. That is really unfortunate. It gives him kind of a 
bad name, poor soul.
<P>
	I remember when he said: ``I cannot really remember the 
Prime Minister asking me about that,'' and `` I am not really sure 
I was given the absolute independence to make comments on 
that''. If you are going to make someone independent, then do it. 
If you are going to give a teenager the right to be independent or 
to use your car or whatever, then you have to hand over the reins 
and let him run with it.
<P>
	Someone gave me a poster which reads: There are two gifts 
we can give our children; one is roots and the other is wings. If 
we are going to tell our own children that we have given them the 
grounding, the roots, that we have  established them and it may 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12134"> 12134 </A></B>
<P>
be scary but they are on their own when they head off to 
university, then that is what we have to do for them.
<P>
	It is also what we have to do for the ethics counsellor. If we 
have committed to him that he is going to be an independent 
ethics counsellor, then we have to tell him that we are not tying 
him to a chain demanding that if he says something we do not 
like that we are going to yank the chain and bring him back. He 
must be given that independent authority.
<P>
	Further on in the red book it says that the ethics counsellor 
will report directly to Parliament. That would be wonderful and 
is something that is long overdue. I suspect many Liberal 
backbenchers and the rat pack particularly were demanding for 
years that the ethics counsellor report to Parliament so that there 
would be some teeth to this autonomy.
<P>
	What do they say now? The report will be to the Prime 
Minister, cabinet, whomever as long as it is a very small group 
and it does not come to all of Parliament or is not broadcast on 
the national news.
<P>
	There are two essential factors in developing the position of 
the ethics counsellor. That person would be independent and 
would report directly to Parliament. Unfortunately this bill does 
not address those or make sure that those criteria are followed.
<P>
	It leads me to the question: Why did the Liberals change their 
minds when they became government? Frankly, what was said in 
the red book was pretty good. What they did does not add up to 
what they said in the red book. Do we call this another broken 
promise? I guess so. There are probably no other options but to 
call it that.
<P>
	If I am campaigning and I make a promise, I had better keep it 
otherwise it is called only one thing and that is a broken promise. 
Nobody in this country needs any more broken promises from 
politicians. That is the way it has to be. The only option left to us 
is that we give people the option of saying: ``Yes, I trust you. 
Yes, I voted for you and yes, you are somebody who said what 
you were going to do and then did it''. We would go a long way 
in making sure that this bill was going to have some teeth in it if 
we made those changes.
<P>
	Why does the government not wish the ethics counsellor to 
report directly to Parliament? Are we that scary? I hardly think 
so. We have been given a mandate from the people to be able to 
scrutinize some of these things. Our being allowed to say that we 
want to look at something and the ethics counsellor is going to 
report directly to Parliament is what needs to happen. These 
things need to be given a full and free airing here on the floor of 
the House of Commons, not in the cabinet room.
<P>
	What kind of backsliding is this for a party that talked about 
governing with integrity? What degree of independence will this 
ethics counsellor have when required to report to a cabinet 
minister and held accountable to the Prime Minister? Is this 
scary? I hardly think so, when he is appointed by the Prime 
Minister and then has to report to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Nothing could be better and nothing could be healthier than 
reporting to Parliament. If there is something the government 
needs to be attacked on-I do not like to use that word-but held 
accountable for, then do it. If there is a problem in a relationship, 
nothing is healthier than to sit down and talk about it. That is the 
best thing to do.
<P>
	If the ethics counsellor were to report to all of Parliament and 
held accountable to it, then government members may say: 
``Whoa, we made a mistake''. There is nothing wrong with 
saying: ``We have made a mistake''. Absolutely nothing. There 
is no shame in anyone standing up to say: ``Hey, I screwed up 
here. I made a mistake. Please understand. Please forgive me''.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	My testing ground was in front of a grade 8 classroom. It was 
the best thing that could have ever prepared me for Parliament. I 
learned that you better not say: ``Here is the answer,'' and then 
just launch off on some course you know nothing about and 
cannot defend but will pretend that you know all about it to those 
kids. It simply does not work. All of us here should know that by 
now. If you do not know the answer, say so.
<P>
	At town hall meetings I get asked all kinds of questions and 
frankly sometimes I do not have a clue about the answer. I say: 
``I am really sorry. I cannot tell you the answer but I can 
probably find it for you. Give me your name, address and phone 
number and I will get back to you with that information''. It is 
better to do that rather than to look like the quintessential 
politician who just ravels on for 20 minutes not knowing what 
you are saying, what you mean and having a whole crowd know 
that you are simply filling in time. Frankly, you look like an 
idiot.
<P>
	It would be best if we said: ``Let the person have 
independence. Let the person report back to Parliament and let 
us not just fool our way through these kinds of things''.
<P>
	There is no shame in saying: ``I made a mistake''. If we do 
something wrong, people will respect us so much more if we just 
say: ``Look, I messed up here. Please understand. Tell me the 
right answer or give me suggestions''.
<P>
	The government has said from time to time: ``Please, you on 
the opposition benches, give us your suggestions''. We do give 
suggestions but we are just mocked and scorned and madefun of.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12135"> 12135 </A></B>
<P>
	I think of my friend, the finance minister. I have a lot of 
respect for the finance minister. Maybe we do not agree on 
policy certainly. Surely to heaven if we have some of the best 
economic minds in the country, like the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound who is internationally renowned, why 
then can we not put forward a couple of proposals? We go into 
question period and somebody makes fun of them. It does not 
accomplish anything. People say: ``Here they go again. It is just 
the political hoop-la of question period''.
<P>
	Let us work together. Surely it does not need to be this 
partisan. Let us make sure that we can serve the ethics 
counsellor and he can serve us. There are all kinds of things he 
could be requested to look into on our behalf that would make 
things better for us and for the Canadian public. They would feel 
like they were getting their money's worth in that kind of 
situation. Surely we can do better.
<P>
	Let me summarize because I have gone on and on. This bill 
could have done much to improve the political process in this 
country to make it more open, responsive and accountable as I 
talked about earlier.
<P>
	Unfortunately, perhaps there is some pious intention here as 
decreed in chapter 6 of the red book which the government 
simply could not live up to. There is no shame in that. Just say: 
``Hey, we said a lot in chapter 6. If we cannot live up to it, then 
that is the way it is. It is a broken promise but at least we admit it 
is a broken promise. We have not gone far enough to make sure 
that this ethics counsellor is really accountable, that he is 
independent and that he will report to Parliament''.
<P>
	Let us make sure that there is no shame lost in a government 
that would admit that. We know that would refresh the Canadian 
public beyond the telling of it. I am sure they would applaud as 
they watched this debate if some substantive changes were made 
to this bill to make sure that we are not just going along with the 
political process in the old style.
<P>
	We are moving toward the next century. Surely we could 
move our whole political process and the politicians involved in 
it into a new style of politics as well. Some of us on both sides of 
the House desperately want to be part of that new political style.
<P>
	We are encouraging the government to say on this bill: 
``Come on board. Let us get toward the 21st century. Let us make 
substantive changes here so that we will be new style 
politicians''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at first I thought the 
member would stand to congratulate the government on its 
initiative after waiting a number of years for legislation that 
deals with the whole question of lobbyists. I was somewhat 
disappointed to see her turning in circles, repeating herself 
about 365 times to come back to the beginning and say that she is 
not happy. I do not know what will make the hon. member happy.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I will share this with the member in case she is not aware of 
what the committee has done so far. There were a number of 
amendments, a number of good suggestions that were brought 
forward by members of the committee and they were adopted by 
the committee.
<P>
	The bill, along with all of the other good things in it, will now 
capture grassroots lobbying. In other words, any registered 
lobbyist who is involved in grassroots lobbying such as letter 
writing campaigns must disclose this as a communication 
technique.
<P>
	Also, the committee felt very strongly that lobbyists should 
disclose when they are working on a contingency fee basis. This 
is not in fact prohibited by contracting policy. As well, from now 
on informational lobbying will be made easily available to 
Canadians. Industry Canada will put a registry online across 
Canada through a 1-800 number and on Internet.
<P>
	I want also to bring to the attention of my colleague that the 
committee recognized that organization lobbyists and their 
goals are different. Most, if not all of them, will be subject to 
semi-annual update. Also, any organization that lobbies 
government will have to reveal the sources and the amount of 
any government funding it receives.
<P>
	I do not know what the beef is in the hon. member's whole 
question. Since the government came into power the Prime 
Minister has appointed an ethics counsellor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Has appointed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> The ethics counsellor will now develop a code of 
conduct for lobbyists. The committee has ensured that lobbyists 
will have a legal obligation to comply with the code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> To whom does he report?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> If only our Reform colleagues would have the 
decency to listen to a voice of reason, but they do not want to 
listen with how they are going on.
<P>
	I will finish on this. In keeping with the spirit of increased 
powers for members of Parliament, the lobbyists' code of 
conduct will have to be reviewed by a parliamentary committee 
before it comes into effect. I want to ask the member-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, when he says that I have a beef, the 
question of course is: Where is the beef? Is this their only one 
Big Mac in this House? Come on.
<P>
	I spoke about the ethics counsellor and then I was asked by 
Big Mac himself about grassroots lobbying, about disclosure, 
about information lobbying, about semi-annual updates. I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12136"> 12136 </A></B>
<P>
talking about the half of the bill that talks about the ethics 
counsellor; he is talking about the part of the bill that deals 
specifically with lobbyists. That is fine.
<P>
	There have been some good moves in the right direction. 
However, all of this is nothing but fluff if we do not have an 
ethics counsellor who can monitor this kind of stuff, who can 
monitor it, who will be independent and who will report to 
Parliament, not to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	This is not good. He can talk about all the lobbying stuff in the 
world and we might talk just briefly in my remarks about tier 
one and tier two lobbyists. I thought that was kind of sweet 
because we talk about two-tiered things in health care around 
here and in that context it is absolutely horrifying. Yet, here we 
have something where we have two tiers of lobbyists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Three tiers.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Three tiers. Well there are two with parts a and b. 
Part one is that there would be consultant lobbyists; that is tier 
one. Then, tier two, a and b, is that there would be in-house 
lobbyists, which sounds kind of cosy. We have the in-house 
lobbyists, which consists of the corporate in-house lobbyists 
and then we have the in-house lobbyist organizations.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Two tiered pensions too.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> It is sort of like two tiered pensions. It is sort of 
like two tiered health care. It is sort of like the government 
should be shedding two tears right now about this kind of stuff.
<P>
	Let us talk about lobbyists, but let us also talk about the ethics 
counsellor who is not independent. He reports to the Prime 
Minister which is hardly anything that has any teeth in it. He 
does not report to Parliament. He goes to some back office 
upstairs and says: ``Well, Prime Minister, let me tell you about 
the lobbyists''. But who cares and who listens? Let us have it 
here on the floor of the House of Commons.
<P>
	Some of the amendments are perhaps noble, but the right 
amendments were not made. That is the unfortunate part of this 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I truly appreciated the comments made by the hon. member for 
Beaver River. She is right on when she raises the issue of who 
the government is listening to regarding this legislation. The 
government is certainly not listening to its members: it is 
listening to lobbyists. The government listens to lobbyists even 
in the case of Bill C-43.
<P>
	Earlier, the member for Ottawa Centre said that the hon. 
member for Beaver River was going around in circles. However, 
at one point, that same member was laughing when she accused 
the government of tabling a bill with no substance. It is as 
though the government is making fun of people by not tabling 
substantive legislation.
<P>
	Such substance is not found in the details mentioned by the 
government member earlier, but in the comments made by the 
western member when she said that what we need is an 
independent ethics counsellor. The fact that it is not the case 
confirms that this government does not really intend to 
strengthen the legislation and counteract the efforts of lobbyists.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member. Does she not agree that 
lobbyists are the only ones to whom the government is really 
paying any attention?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I suspect they are doing some 
listening to the lobbyists. Perhaps they are listening to cabinet. 
Perhaps they are listening to the Prime Minister as well.
<P>
	I believe there is a deeper issue, a more serious malaise. The 
whole lobbying industry has mushroomed in the last 20 or 30 
years. Something has to be done about it and I do not see the bill 
as going far enough in the direction to make sure people are not 
getting away with things, that people are not getting special 
deals, that they are not convincing the minister of heritage, for 
instance, to go to Disneyland for lunch; making sure these 
indiscreet things are not happening. That is what is frustrating 
about this.
<P>
	There are many parliamentary secretaries in the House, as 
well as backbenchers. No matter what they do, because they did 
not do exactly the right thing by giving those two criteria to the 
ethics counsellor, this thing will not work. It will not work 
because it is tinkering with the system. I am sure the lobbyists 
watching this debate are already lobbying for changes around 
and tunnels and paths through the whole workings of 
government, getting themselves into ministers' offices and 
through the bureaucracy so there can be more money made and 
stronger ties with cabinet ministers' offices.
<P>
	Lobbyists by definition are those who lobby government, 
naturally. They will look at this legislation. I am sure they have 
studied it already. They will be at the point at which they know 
exactly what they are after.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Have you ever been lobbied?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
asks if I have every been lobbied. If he had been here for my 
speech he would have heard that of course we are all lobbied. 
People will continue to be lobbied all the time. Let us have an 
ethics counsellor with some teeth to get to the lobbyists who are 
not doing the right thing. There are no teeth. This is a toothless 
ethics counsellor. That is most unfortunate and yet that is 
exactly what will happen. If lobbyists see somebody who has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12137"> 12137 </A></B>
<P>
absolutely no teeth they will gum it all the way to the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	There are things which are seriously wrong but my time is up. 
I would love to go on as I love this debate but I will sit down 
now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak about Bill C-43, an act to amend the Lobbyists 
Registration Act and to make related amendments to other Acts, 
which the Minister of Industry tabled on June 16, 1994. The law 
preceding it took effect in 1989. First of all we must keep in 
mind that the population has a poor opinion of the government's 
decision making process.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	People have lost a lot of their trust in the government. We 
must, therefore, restore the public's trust and convince the 
population that the government's decisions are fair and are made 
on the basis of merit.
<P>
	Lobbyists, influence peddlars, as some like to call them, have 
always held a great, and at times even disproportionate, amount 
of power. In March 1994, there were 944 of them on Parliament 
Hill. They sometimes work in the shadows and in secrecy; 
sometimes they are at the centre of influence-peddling; they do 
not necessarily work in the public interest. The work carried out 
on Parliament Hill must be made transparent	so that the population will understand, for example, what brings the government to make a deal with a person or an organization or what motivated a regulation, a bill, etc.
<P>
	This bill, although a step in the right direction, is very 
disappointing for many reasons. Unfortunately, the Liberals 
rejected all of the amendments that the Bloc Quebecois 
proposed in committee and in the House to improve it.
<P>
	The population of today's democratic societies is demanding 
more and more transparency in the legislative process and in the 
government's decisions.
<P>
	Under Bill C-43, lobbyists will have to disclose the specific 
subject-matter of their activities, the name of the government 
department or institution they will be lobbying, the 
communication techniques that will be used and, in certain 
cases, information about the true beneficiary of the lobbying. 
They will also have to disclose the names of the legislative 
proposal, bill, resolution, policy, regulation, subsidy, 
contribution or any other financial advantage that they are 
targeting.
<P>
	The second important element of this bill is that consultant 
lobbyists, also known as professional lobbyists, will be required 
to report this information for each new undertaking, each 
mandate.
<P>
	Third, the bill allows lobbyists to file their returns 
electronically, sets the limitation period for enforcement 
proceedings at two years and provides for a parliamentary 
review of the Act in four years.
<P>
	Finally, the bill provides for the designation of an ethics 
counsellor who establishes a lobbyists' code of conduct and 
investigates alleged breaches of it.
<P>
	Over the years, parliamentarians have seen their role as 
representatives of the people diminish. Lobbyists, however, 
have become a powerful force. They manage to obtain direct 
access to government decision-makers. Today, the main 
decision-makers in government are senior officials, deputy 
ministers, ministers and, of course, the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The United States passed the first law on lobbying several 
years ago. It was necessary to curb some of the excesses of this 
profession. The emphasis was on control and disclosure, secret 
lobbying and pressure behind the scenes. Before immigrating to 
Canada 21 years ago, I had read and heard about the powerful 
lobbies acting on behalf of large U.S. corporations.
<P>
	The Parliament of Canada has reviewed the activities of this 
profession several times, more specifically in the Cooper 
Committee's report in 1986 and the Holtmann Committee's 
report in 1993.
<P>
	Today, we have paid lobbyists, professional lobbyists and 
organizations.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The bill provides for only two types: consultant lobbyists and 
in-house lobbyists who work for an organization or a 
corporation. Consultant lobbyists are independent and contract 
their services to clients. They will have to file detailed returns 
on the nature of their clients' interests.
<P>
	The federal government spends $160 billion annually. That is 
a lot of money. We must ensure that public funds are not used to 
promote the interests of certain individuals who have a close 
relationship with, or privileged access to, the government, or to 
promote the interests of individuals or companies that 
contributed to the campaign fund of the party in power.
<P>
	The Sub-committee of the Standing Committee on Industry 
examined this bill and heard many witnesses. I very carefully 
read the majority and minority reports, and I fully agree with the 
dissenting report submitted by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The business of government must be as transparent as 
possible, so that public policy reflects the common good of the 
people and not the interests of powerful lobbies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians and Quebecers agree on the need to put an end to 
the confidence crisis in the population regarding their institu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12138"> 12138 </A></B>
<P>
tions. However, after one and a half years in power the Liberal 
government has not been able to increase its transparency.
<P>
	In September 1994 the media showed the lobbyists 
multiplying their meetings with officials before the tabling of 
Bill C-43 in a last attempt to curb its influence on their 
activities. Some lobbyists have even threatened to pursue the 
government if the new law forced them to disclose their political 
alliances.
<P>
	In the case of intense lobbying regarding Bill C-43 the lack of 
transparency had prevented the population and parliamentarians 
to know the scope and the nature of lobbyists' actions. It was a 
strange situation; the lobbyists succeeded in influencing the 
very bill which was to limit their own influence. Considering 
these facts, the need for transparency has never been more 
evident.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This having been said, I acknowledge that this bill contains a 
number of improvements to the system regulating lobbyists. 
However, we have to recognize that the commitments in the 
Liberal Party's red book are considerably watered down in this 
legislative text, which could not prevent troubling events such 
as those surrounding the privatization of the Pearson 
International Airport in Toronto.
<P>
	The government finally agreed yesterday with considerable 
reticence to having a Senate committee investigate this dubious 
transaction. However, I doubt that this committee controlled by 
the Conservatives and the Liberals will clarify the situation 
entirely, since both parties were involved in this matter. It is 
interesting to note that Fred Doucet, a former executive 
assistant to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, received $2 million 
as a lobbyist in this transaction.
<P>
	On May 16, 1994, I had occasion, during a debate on Bill 
C-22, to denounce the privatization of terminals 1 and 2 of this 
very profitable airport by the Conservative government, just two 
weeks prior to the 1993 federal election. It was a scandalous 
contract with all the appearances of the political patronage and 
manipulation that characterizes the end of a government's term 
of office. Even Mr. Nixon, whom Mr. Chrétien appointed to 
investigate the matter, said that the public was entitled to know 
all the details of the agreement.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I request unanimous consent to continue my 
speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to allow 
the member five more minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> I thank all my hon. colleagues. The Bloc 
Quebecois had called for a royal commission of inquiry into one 
of the greatest scandals of Canadian public life; the Liberal 
government refused.
<P>
	Bill C-43 shows the government's considerable lack of 
courage to regulate the activities of lobbyists. We should not be 
shy or timid in this issue because what is a stake is the integrity 
of our democratic institutions and people's trust in their leaders. 
There should be no compromise. Last June, the Prime Minister 
said that measures promoting transparency, including Bill 
C-43, would give the federal government unprecedented 
transparency. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
<P>
	I would like to salute the labour movement for its excellent 
contribution to this debate. The Canadian Labour Congress, on 
behalf of its affiliated unions and the FTQ, representing 2.1 
million members, presented a good brief on this issue to the 
sub-committee on industry. It was signed by Robert White, 
president, Dick Martin, secretary-treasurer, and Nancy Riche 
and Jean-Claude Parrot, executive vice-presidents. They 
maintain that banning lobbying, even if it was possible, is not 
the solution. A way must be found to ensure that the 
government's decisions are never ``bought'' and that they never 
appear to be the result of lobbying.
<P>
	Unions themselves lobby in favour of their membership. But 
unlike professional lobbyists, the labour movement has never 
hidden what it expects from the government. As a matter of fact, 
instead of hiding its views, it tries to make them as well known 
as possible. This has nothing to do with individuals or 
corporations trying to use their connections to open doors for 
others for a fee.
<P>
	The CLC does not dispute the provisions in Bill C-43 which 
require labour organizations to register as organizations, not as 
individuals. It is willing to submit a detailed annual report 
providing information on its lobbying activities: legislative 
proposals, bills, resolutions, regulations, policies, programs, 
grants, contributions and other fiscal privileges.
<P>
	One example is unemployment insurance. The labour 
movement is critically interested in this question, especially at a 
time when the government is trying to dismantle the system 
which is supposed to protect workers when they lose their jobs.
<P>
	Bill C-43 deals mostly with the individual or the organization 
which lobbies the government, but the behaviour of government 
officials is also very important. We should widen the scope of 
the Criminal Code provisions to prohibit the offer of money, 
gifts or other advantages to a senior official or any employee, 
with the intent of influencing his or her decision.
<P>
	The time limits stated in the conflict of interest and post- 
employment code for public office holders should be longer.
<P>
	The rules applicable to lobbying should be effective and well 
known. For that we have to ensure that the people have access to 
information, without geographical or financial barriers. 
Therefore, all the data should be available in all public libraries.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12139"> 12139 </A></B>
<P>
	To conclude, I believe that we have to restrict the activities of 
lobbyists in order to bring about a greater openness in the 
decision making process of the government, and in order to 
avoid that the wealthiest enjoy better access to decision makers 
through lobbyists.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If he wishes, the hon. member will be 
able to speak for ten minutes next time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> In view of the excellent co-operation, I wonder 
whether it would not be possible to dispose of this bill now. I 
think that the debate is over.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is still a ten minute question and 
comment period. Is there unanimous consent to continue with 
this bill and to proceed with the division on this question? Is the 
debate over?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider funding 
cultural organizations on a multi-year basis in order to promote their stability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Motion M-213 which I tabled and 
which was voted on deals with the funding of government 
organizations, particularly Telefilm Canada, the National Film 
Board and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. We know the 
dilemma of these organizations, which do not know what their 
budget will be from year to year. For a long time, they have been 
asking funding on a multi-year basis.
<P>
	It is almost ridiculous to have to beg the government for this, 
especially because, when it was in the opposition, it had 
requested it, and, during the election campaign, it undertook to 
follow through with this in its red book. It had even defended the 
very existence of these organizations. Is is a known fact that the 
government drafts its budget for one year and that associations 
draft theirs for two or three years; it is therefore understandable 
that these organizations would want to enjoy the same rights and 
to have the opportunity to draft their budgets based on 
multi-year funding.
<P>
	Therefore, this motion asks the government to thoroughly 
reflect on this today and to undertake to acquiesce to these 
organizations' request, that is, multi-year funding with a 
guarantee of no cuts.
<P>
	Let me say that the motion tabled today was based on 
misgivings. Drafted last January, even before the cuts in the last 
federal budget were announced, the motion was based on the 
suspicion that the finance minister intended to deeply cut the 
budgets of national cultural organizations and mainly, as I said 
earlier, the CBC, Telefilm Canada and the National Film Board.
<P>
	On February 27, a dark day for Canadians, we learned that the 
budgets of the CBC, Telefilm Canada and the National Film 
Board would be cut by 4, 4 and 5 per cent respectively in the next 
fiscal year.
<P>
	In the case of the CBC, this means, according to various 
interpretations we received during the last months, a cut of $44 
million in 1995-96. According to information given by Tony 
Manera, its former chairman, the CBC will lose $350 million 
during the next three years. This is no longer a weight loss diet, 
this is a shock treatment.
<P>
	When he was appointed, Mr. Manera was promised a fixed 
budget for the coming years, after the dramatic cuts the CBC had 
gone through under the Conservatives.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	We can see that things have a habit of never changing. Liberal 
policy is determined by the same senior officials or based on the 
same principles that private interests must be served before the 
national interests of Canadians. It is exactly the same policy. 
Yesterday, I sat on the finance committee where I asked experts 
if, not having known that there had been a change of 
government, they would have guessed, simply by comparing 
budget speeches concerning Bill C-76, that a new government 
was in office. These experts answered no, adding that the 
policies are exactly the same as those of the Conservatives.
<P>
	In the end, there is no real policy change. The only difference 
is that the whiners that were sitting on this side are now across 
the way, behaving like a lot of sheep, as their predecessors did. 
The best example is the member for Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> And Glengarry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> And Glengarry. I also remind my colleagues 
opposite that it is precisely on this issue of the lack of funds for 
the CBC that Mr. Manera resigned. An hour before the budget 
was tabled, Mr. Manera was given by the deputy minister of 
finance a report explaining the extent of the catastrophe. But to 
conclude that Mr. Manera's resignation was tied to these cuts 
was too big a step for the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the 
only one to be blind to the fact.
<P>
	In fact, I would have a piece of advice for the heritage 
minister. Judging from the way he answered our questions, 
which he is apparently no longer allowed to answer-during 
question period today for instance, his colleague the Minister of 
Industry kept answering in his place-and from the stares he has 
been getting from all his colleagues recently every time he gives 
a clumsy  answer, I sincerely hope that he did not get rid of his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12140"> 12140 </A></B>
<P>
driver's licence because he will be needing it before long, when 
he is a backbencher again.
<P>
	As the CBC and other cultural agencies undergo drastic cuts, 
the minister continues to deny the cuts and keeps on parroting 
official figures. He reminds me of a bankrupt businessman who 
persists in denying any financial difficulty, when the trustee is 
already on the premises preparing an inventory of his assets. If I 
had a piece of advice to give the heads of the CBC, it would be to 
choose their friends more carefully, given that the minister 
claimed to be a friend of the CBC.
<P>
	I would like to remind my hon. colleagues, and the heritage 
minister in particular, of the advantage, for our national 
institutions, of the multi-year financing these agencies have 
been crying out for many years. This kind of financing over two 
or three years would allow such agencies to better plan their 
production and distribution activities on a medium term basis. It 
would put an end to this chronic uncertainty which undermines 
the work of full time creators and freelancers as well as those 
responsible for controlling costs.
<P>
	In addition, multi-year financing would promote the 
development of the imaginative and sound solutions required 
for these agencies to be well managed. More importantly, it 
would give creators a better insight into how the federal 
government feels about them. Instead of seeing creators as 
dreamers who are incapable of managing a budget and therefore 
have to be subsidized in a piecemeal fashion, multi-year 
financing would reflect the respect the federal government has 
for them and for their contribution to society.
<P>
	Perhaps the minister no longer has any use for these 
institutions in this time of great progress in the communications 
industry, as he tells the House automatically when fielding 
questions from the opposition. But if there was ever a time when 
high standards and a strong educational content were required 
and had to be maintained, it is now. We do not need long studies 
to tell us that. All we have to do is look at the Internet to 
understand how important it is that new technologies be 
monitored and subject to standards, which are often lacking in 
the private sector.
<P>
	On these networks, you can learn, for example, how to make 
bombs and other scientific experiments, which means that this 
knowledge is now made available to one and all.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to remind the minister and his 
colleagues of their 1993 election promises, although I could go 
on and on for hours without convincing this government that it 
should pay attention to our artists' cries for financial help and to 
the justified requests by national organization executives for 
multi-year funding. In response to a Canadian Conference of the 
Arts questionnaire, the Liberals had vowed to develop a national 
cultural policy in consultation with the provinces  during the 
first few months of their mandate to enable them to face the 
challenges of the 21st century. The Liberal Party of Canada 
made this commitment in writing to the Canadian Conference of 
the Arts and promised to include it in their famous red book, 
which has now become a blue book.
<P>
	These commitments were clearly spelled out in the red book, 
but have now been completely forgotten. The Liberals also 
promised at the time to provide stable multi-year financing for 
our cultural institutions, both in the red book and in the letter 
and document sent to the Canadian Conference of the Arts.
<P>
	In the cultural sector as in other areas, we see how the 
government can say one thing and do another. During the 
election campaign, it promised artists a better future, although it 
never really intended to keep its word. That is typical of both the 
Liberal Party of Canada and the Liberal Party in Quebec. That 
was demonstrated in 1982 when the government reneged on its 
referendum campaign commitment to carry out comprehensive 
constitutional reforms. Promises were also broken with respect 
to political party financing and unemployment insurance. After 
taking office, the Liberals, who used to tear their shirts in 
opposition, went ahead with UI reforms. I say reforms but I 
should really use the word cuts. These cuts were much deeper 
than those for which they criticized former Minister Valcourt. 
The Liberals also cut health care and social programs.
<P>
	This is not the Liberal Party, but a party which has two 
different tunes: one which was used during the election 
campaign to get elected, and one which is used now that the 
Liberals are in office. The latter is very conservative; it is void 
of any long term objectives; it is based on a band-aid approach 
and it occasionally tries to alter the facts, whether in the context 
of an international fishery dispute or a trip abroad by the Prime 
Minister. But it never had a global vision for arts and culture, 
social programs, Canada's foreign policy, or deficit control. No 
global policy.
<P>
	The government uses a piecemeal approach. It uses the 
Liberals' approach, who-after 10, 12 or 15 years in office-left 
the country with the worst deficit among G-7 members, with 
Italy. By the time they were ousted in 1984, the Liberals had 
managed to raise the deficit from 13 to 38 billion dollars. We are 
now feeling the effects of that deficit and this is why we must 
make cuts. But even now, the government is not using the right 
approach. It does not try to ensure the survival of vital 
organizations like the ones I mentioned and which I would call 
national cultural organizations.
<P>
	I hope that these comments and the motion will be supported 
by government members, who have the opportunity, in the case 
of a motion like this one, to vote freely. They are not bound by 
the famous red book which their party shelved after only 12 or 
18 months in office. Liberal members have an opportunity to 
express their views. They have an opportunity to support 
Canadian  creators. They have an opportunity to show cultural 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12141"> 12141 </A></B>
<P>
organizations that they are prepared to take a look at their valid 
claims. The time has come to do so.
<P>
	During the hour allotted for this debate, I want to give Liberal 
members an opportunity to tell us to what extent they are 
prepared to co-operate with opposition members, to fulfil their 
election promises as well as the commitments they made to 
these groups when they were in opposition. They can do so by 
ensuring multi-year funding to these organizations.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I anxiously await their response, particularly with regard to 
their commitments and respect for creators and for Canadian 
cultural organizations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure my colleague, the member for Richelieu, will 
appreciate what I have to offer. I am hoping he will pay attention 
because I think he will be delighted with the message I will 
present to him and to his colleagues.
<P>
	He has recognized the dilemma that has long faced Canada's 
guardians of our cultural identity, how to carry out long term 
projects successfully when funding is awarded on an annual 
basis.
<P>
	Government understands this dilemma. In the interests of 
finding better ways to do business, the government made its 
commitments in the red book, which the member for Richelieu 
has mentioned, by promising multi-year funding to cultural 
organizations.
<P>
	This is in accord with the government's overall plan to make 
Canada more fiscally responsible and economically sound. The 
government's commitment to cultural organizations is also a 
reflection of the desire that all Canadians have to see that good 
business practices become the norm throughout government.
<P>
	The program review we referred to announced in the 1994 
budget was undertaken to ensure the government's diminished 
resources are directed to the highest priority requirements and to 
those areas where the federal government is best placed to 
deliver services.
<P>
	This review was a comprehensive and rigorous examination 
of all federal programs and activities, including those of a 
cultural nature. Its central objective was to identify the federal 
government's core roles and responsibilities and provide 
modern, affordable government.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance announced in the 1995 budget that 
based on the program review there would be budgetary 
reductions to ensure the government meets its commitment to 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of the gross domestic product in 
1996-97.
<P>
	Cultural agencies in the Canadian heritage portfolio were part 
of this exercise. Agencies like the Canada Council, the four 
national museums and the National Archives, to name a few, are 
now working to implement these reductions and set their 
courses for the future.
<P>
	Across Canada there is a wide diversity of cultural 
organizations operating at all levels and covering the full range 
of activities that make our Canadian culture something to be 
proud of. There are in great number museums, theatres, 
symphony orchestras, art galleries and dance companies all 
showing the face of Canada to us and to others. They are all 
worried about their survival. Why? The tradition of funding on 
an annual basis has greatly impeded their ability to carry out 
interesting, innovative and creative projects over the long term. 
It is good business sense to plan ahead but a virtual impossibility 
if there is no notion of the kind of income that will be 
forthcoming.
<P>
	The current reductions have taken their toll on everyone but 
the cultural organizations like areas of government and other 
sectors of the country are doing their best to contribute to the 
success of the government's fiscal strategy.
<P>
	Under these circumstances it makes sense to give cultural 
agencies and organizations as much assistance as possible by 
enabling them to plan their futures with a greater degree of 
confidence and with the added stability that comes with 
multi-year funding.
<P>
	In the February 1995 budget it was announced that the 
government intends to implement a new expenditure 
management system. Its objectives are to take responsible 
spending decisions to deliver the programs and services 
Canadians need and can afford and to meet the required fiscal 
targets. Moreover, this system will foster a more open, 
responsive and accountable budget process. This is what all 
Canadian taxpayers are expecting from us, greater 
accountability for the money we spend.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	In the face of fixed or declining budgets and the need to adjust 
to changing circumstances through reallocation, we need a more 
flexible system to manage our expenditures. With three-year 
business plans federal cultural organizations can propose a more 
strategic multi-year perspective to their management. Cultural 
organizations can prepare departmental outlook documents that 
will be available to the House standing committees. These 
documents will explain any significant shifts in an 
organization's priorities and initiatives over a three-year period 
while remaining consistent with government wide objectives 
and fiscal targets established in the previous budget. Committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12142"> 12142 </A></B>
<P>
members using these forecasts will be in a better position to 
review and report on future expenditure priorities.
<P>
	Multi-year forecasts will be based on resources allocated in 
the federal budget and will set out the strategies to be pursued to 
adapt to the fiscal and policy environment. The forecast will 
explain significant resource shifts in terms of priorities and 
associated initiatives of the organization over a three-year 
period. It will describe new directions, evolving priorities and 
objectives for the period.
<P>
	There is no question in my mind or anyone's mind that our 
scarce resources can be stretched a lot further if we choose the 
method of working over the long term. This is a better use of our 
cultural dollars. We would be foolish to reject it.
<P>
	Our cultural organizations, whatever proportion of the 
population they serve, are too important to our national identity 
to be allowed to sink into oblivion. Our cultural organizations 
are the caretakers of the rich treasures of our past and of our 
creative efforts; the very stuff that keeps minds, hearts and souls 
together. Our cultural organizations teach us about ourselves 
and let others learn about Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	The motion being debated today, one that affirms the 
importance of our cultural organizations, is vital for all 
Canadians. By recognizing the value of our cultural 
organizations, by keeping them living and viable institutions we 
show our belief in ourselves.
<P>
	Multi-year planning is essential if our precious cultural 
organizations are to continue to be a vibrant part of Canadian 
society. We must help them to gain the stability they need to 
continue to function well as the best reflection of Canada's 
cultural identity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Bloc motion that, in the 
opinion of the House, the government should consider funding 
cultural organizations on a multi-year basis in order to promote 
their stability.
<P>
	However, it should be noted from the outset that before we 
start considering multi-year funding we should be examining 
the appropriateness of our present commitment to cultural 
funding.
<P>
	This opportunity also permits me to set the record straight 
with respect to the Reform Party's position on Canadian cultural 
industries and artists. There seems to be a perception that we are 
unconcerned or even disinterested in Canadian culture. That 
really is a simplistic criticism of our policy.
<P>
	Our policy is clear and concise. We are simply suggesting and 
encouraging less government involvement in the funding and 
promotion of the cultural sector. This has been our message 
firmly and consistently since the early days of this Parliament. 
What we want to see is less government involvement.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	We promote the idea that the cultural community be given the 
tools necessary to flourish in an open, competitive, and 
changing marketplace. That includes less government 
intervention, less taxation, and less regulatory control, which 
will ultimately permit competition, not strangulation. Our 
approach recognizes that a Canadian cultural policy must be 
sustainable in a world of rapid technological change, one which 
fosters an environment in which individuals are free to choose. 
We need to ensure that the industry can make it on its own. This 
can and should be done through less regulation, less taxation.
<P>
	We were elected with a mandate from our constituents to 
bring to this public forum their commitments and concerns, and 
we will not be intimidated by special interest groups. We do not 
support the concept of stable multi-year funding to 
organizations, which should be receiving the funding through 
the private sector and not through the federal government.
<P>
	Albertans are demonstrating that they are willing to support 
the arts without massive federal assistance. So perhaps it is time 
that this government start to re-evaluate the way in which it is 
dealing with the cultural sector. This attitude change in Alberta 
has been perpetuated by the fact that shrinking budgets in all 
areas of the economy demand that we seek new innovative and 
creative ways of accessing funds, including the cultural sector.
<P>
	Big Rock Breweries from Alberta is leading the way as a 
private sector supporter for the arts. Last year Big Rock 
provided over $1,000 to over 40 different arts groups. It views 
its cultural support as a wise business practice and not as a 
charitable donation. Thanks to the support of Big Rock, groups 
like the Alberta Theatre Project and the Muttard Public Art 
Gallery are thriving. Albertans indeed are leading the way in 
private sector support for the cultural sector. I applaud Big Rock 
for showing just what the private sector can do if left alone by 
various levels of government.
<P>
	I think it is also important to illustrate at this time a few 
examples of why it is essential to bring back accountability to 
these cultural organizations. These examples will illustrate that 
not only does the Liberal Party not have a cultural policy, but the 
government's funding of these groups is indeed in need of 
reform.
<P>
	For example, the artist Stephen Ellwood, an American who 
came to Canada because we give more money to artists than does 
the U.S., threw $300 in nickels, or 6,000 nickels in total, off a 
building and others were discarded in the street. This was to 
make a politically artistic statement. All this money is at the 
expense of the Canadian taxpayer, thanks to the Canada Council. 
If that is not government spending run amok, then I do not know 
what is.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12143"> 12143 </A></B>
<P>
	Do not get me wrong; I truly believe in the freedom of 
expression. However, I do not believe Canadian taxpayers 
should be left on the hook for every political and artistic 
problem we encounter.
<P>
	The Canada Council needs to be overhauled in its granting 
practices to ensure greater accountability as to how funds are 
distributed. It is time we looked at the current structure of the 
Canada Council to ask how it can continue to exist as we know it 
today.
<P>
	Thanks to the Canada Council, the Liberal government is not 
even addressing the promises made in this year's budget 
regarding government accountability and reducing government 
spending. So I would like to thank Mr. Ellwood on behalf of all 
Canadians for pointing out the hypocrisy of this Liberal budget.
<P>
	Another example of poor cultural policy was when the CRTC 
removed the American country music television network from 
Canadian airwaves. Canadian country artists used to be seen in 
32 million homes around the world. But in retaliation for this 
decision, CMT now refuses to play Canadian artists' videos, 
restricting their airplay to Canadian homes only.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Promoting Canadian culture by closing our borders is like 
trying to mix oil and water. Canadian artists themselves 
denounced this decision, yet it was allowed to continue.
<P>
	How does the government expect to promote Canadian 
cultural exports and allow for more consumer choice? It is 
unclear. Until this type of question can be answered, we should 
not be securing any multi-year funding to any cultural 
organization. This government seems to be moving toward a 
policy of protectionism in the cultural industry rather than one 
of a free market.
<P>
	In typical Liberal fashion we are now seeing a flip-flop 
regarding our cultural policy. One day the government is 
restricting choice and competition in the country music 
industry. The next day it is opening up the doors for its Liberal 
friends in Power Corporation and their American buddies to set 
up satellite networks across the country.
<P>
	Through the direct to home satellite debate the government 
has attempted to deflect criticism by portraying the Reform 
Party as anti-competition. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. The government has also said that we should not criticize 
the process. Wrong again. This can be clearly seen in the direct 
to home process. The only thing that has been clear in all of it is 
that Canadians are paying the price for the government's lack of 
a coherent cultural policy that favours true competition.
<P>
	If the government truly wants competition, why will it not 
live up to its commitment to release a comprehensive cultural 
policy? I think the answer is clear: it does not have one.
<P>
	I am also quite concerned that this debate is grinding down 
into a Quebec and English Canada issue. That is not the issue 
today. The issue we are looking at is entrenching 
multiculturalism funding and the fact that we as a nation cannot 
afford it. We are looking at a nationally enforced bilingualism, 
and we cannot afford it. We also cannot afford the funding of 
special interest groups.
<P>
	This government's cultural policy is so misdirected that the 
Secretary of State for Multiculturalism in a recent interview 
stated eloquently that we have no national culture. I would like 
to take this opportunity to respond to that statement.
<P>
	Most Canadians believe, as Reformers do, that we must 
uphold the rights of citizens and private groups to preserve their 
cultural heritage using their own resources but are opposed to 
any taxpayer funded multicultural programs. The Reform 
concept of culture is that as Canadians we believe we have 
something others do not. Collectively we see ourselves as a 
tolerant, peaceful and independent people.
<P>
	Canadian culture is not stagnant. Rather, it is in a constant 
state of metamorphosis. The difficulty is that we continue to 
debate what our self-concept is. We need to stop struggling with 
our self-image and accept who we are.
<P>
	Visually, our culture is an array of images, finely integrated 
and ever changing. Visual symbols such as the maple leaf, the 
uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and hockey 
connect us to one another at the deepest level of our 
consciousness. This is our Canadian culture. It has nothing to do 
with money or cultural groups, but has everything to do with us 
as Canadians.
<P>
	We should not forget that Canadian culture has been around 
since our nation's conception and will certainly outlast this 
Parliament and even the next Parliament. It will do so simply 
because it is in our hearts and in our minds. It is what makes us 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today in response to private member's 
Motion M-213 put forward by the hon. member for Richelieu, 
which proposes changing the funding practice with respect to 
cultural organizations to a multi-year schedule.
<P>
	The need for multi-year planning is necessary for two very 
important reasons. First, it reflects a desire on the part of all 
Canadians to see the implementation of good business practices 
throughout government. Second, it ensures that our cultural 
organizations will remain vigorous and accountable.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Canada has many cultural organizations, covering the full 
range of all the activities that make our Canadian culture a vivid 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12144"> 12144 </A></B>
<P>
and living experience. We have museums, theatres, symphony 
orchestras, art galleries, and dance companies, all there as a 
reflection of Canada's heart and soul and all striving to keep 
their heads above perilous waters.
<P>
	Why? Because they have traditionally been funded on an 
annual basis, greatly impeding their ability to carry out plans for 
the long term. It is good business sense to plan ahead, but a 
virtual impossibility if there is no notion of the kind of income 
that will be forthcoming.
<P>
	Government understands this dilemma. The government 
made its commitment to better business practices in the red book 
by promising multi-year funding to cultural organizations. This 
is part of the government's plan to help make Canada more 
fiscally responsible and economically sound.
<P>
	The 1994 budget announced that a program review would be 
undertaken to ``ensure that the government's diminished 
resources are directed to the highest priority requirements and to 
those areas where the federal government is best placed to 
deliver services''.
<P>
	The program review was a comprehensive and rigorous 
examination of all federal programs and activities, including 
those of a cultural nature. Its central objective was to identify 
the federal government's core roles and responsibilities and to 
provide modern, affordable government.
<P>
	In the 1995 budget the government announced reductions 
based on the program review exercise, reductions to ensure that 
it meets its commitment to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of 
gross domestic product in 1996-97. Cultural agencies in the 
Canadian heritage portfolio were part of this exercise. Agencies 
like the Canadian Museum of Civilization, the National Library, 
and the National Arts Centre, to name only a few, are now 
working to implement these reductions and set their courses for 
the future.
<P>
	The current reductions have been a tough bullet to bite, but the 
cultural agencies, like other areas of government, are doing their 
best to contribute to the success of the government's fiscal 
strategy. Under these circumstances, it only makes sense to give 
cultural agencies as much assistance as possible through this 
difficult period by enabling them to plan their futures with a 
greater degree of confidence.
<P>
	In the 1995 budget it was announced that the government 
intends to implement a new expenditure management system. 
Its objectives are to take responsible spending decisions to 
deliver the programs and services Canadians need and can 
afford and to meet the required fiscal targets. Moreover, this 
system will foster a more open, responsive, and accountable 
budget process.
<P>
	This is the criterion that Canadians are demanding we apply: 
greater accountability for the money we spend. In the face of 
fixed or declining budgets and the need to adjust to changing 
circumstances through reallocation, we need a more flexible 
system of expenditure management.
<P>
	Cultural organizations, through the preparation of three-year 
business plans, can take a more strategic, multi-year 
perspective to their management. Cultural organizations can 
prepare outlook documents that will be available to the House 
standing committee. With such documents in hand, committee 
members will be better informed and better able to review and 
report on future expenditure priorities.
<P>
	These multi-year outlooks will be based on resources 
allocated in the February budget and will set out the strategies to 
be pursued to adapt to the fiscal and policy environment. The 
outlook will explain significant resource shifts in terms of the 
priorities and associated initiatives of the organization over a 
three-year period. It will describe new directions, evolving 
priorities, and objectives for the period. It is good to reiterate 
that this outlook document will be developed by the cultural 
agency itself.
<P>
	There is no question that working for the long term is a more 
feasible method of making the best use of scarce resources. If 
this is a better way to stretch our cultural dollars, then we should 
go ahead with it.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Our cultural organizations, whatever proportion of the 
population they serve, are too important to let die for lack of 
foresight. Our cultural organizations are a precious entity within 
the Canadian identity. They are the caretakers of our rich past, 
the caretakers of our creative efforts, the food that nourishes the 
mind and the heart and the soul.
<P>
	Our cultural organizations allow us to see ourselves and let 
others see us and know us as Canadians. The motion we are 
discussing today speaks to our belief in the necessity of cultural 
organizations. It is an important one for all Canadians. By 
affirming the value of our cultural organizations, by keeping 
them living and viable institutions, we are affirming our belief 
in ourselves.
<P>
	In my view we have no option but to encourage multi-year 
planning for our cultural organizations. We must ensure they can 
maintain their stability in an uncertain world and have the 
opportunity to become the best possible reflection of Canada's 
cultural identity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>To close the debate, I give the floor to 
the hon. member for Richelieu.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
can certainly understand my amazement at those comments by 
two members of the governing party, the Liberal Party. I have no 
difficulty with the position of the Reform Party, because it is 
true to its platform, to its  vision-which I do not share at 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12145"> 12145 </A></B>
<P>
all-on the involvement of government in the survival of the 
cultural organizations mentioned in my motion.
<P>
	But the contradictions in the rhetoric of the two Liberal 
members are stunning. They deliver a quasi-philosophical 
lecture on art, culture and the need for art in our society. They 
say that these national organizations are essential because they 
are our very soul, the mirror of our society, the expression of our 
way of thinking, and the path to our future. In fact, our artists 
will help us assert our identity.
<P>
	They serve us some rhetoric and they say that yes, multi-year 
funding would be better. Of course financing over two or three 
years would be better. They even say that it was promised in the 
electoral platform. That is the Liberal Party perspective. 
However, what are they doing in fact? They are destroying those 
agencies. They slash their budgets.
<P>
	The former CBC president did not resign on a whim. He was 
solemnly promised that there would be no cuts and then they 
announced cuts of $44 million on one side and $350 million on 
the other. Now the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is unable 
to fulfil its important mission, particularly in French Canada.
<P>
	Now we are told in a wishful kind of way: ``Oh! God, would it 
not be nice to have multiyear funding. It would be better to plan 
in order to insure the survival of these nobles agencies''. But 
look at what your minister is doing, your government is doing, 
look at the campaign promises, look at your track record after 
one year in office. These agencies have been massacred; it is 
worse than what the previous government did, which you 
denounced when you were in the opposition.
<P>
	It is hard to believe one's ears. The government is abandoning 
these cultural agencies on an economic level, through its 
February 27 budget, and through the policies, set puppet-like, 
by the Canadian heritage minister who later on said that he is a 
friend of the CBC. With friends like that, the CBC does not need 
enemies. We are told that the government will continue to 
respect these agencies. We are told that it would be in their best 
interest to have three year budgets. For years now, they have had 
only three or five year budgets.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Every time they have to deal with a government that 
demolishes their policies or makes cuts out of the blue. Now, has 
this government forgotten to cut in the right places? For 
instance, it has not cut the tax havens of those who finance its 
party. How many billions find their way to the Bahamas every 
year, to banks where they do not even declare the interests they 
accrue. Yet, a single piece of legislation would be enough to 
control all that money that is being drained out of the country 
and all those people who pay no income tax.
<P>
	Why not deal with that instead of going after our cultural 
organizations? There was also mention of family trusts. We 
examined organizations like the other place,  which costs 
taxpayers $50 million a year. What purpose does it serve? Is it a 
large dormitory, a day care centre? What is it exactly? Could we 
not make some cuts in there? The government is considering 
giving a half a million dollar party to announce the appointment 
of a new governor general. Why? Should we not instead leave 
this money to the organizations that make up the identity of our 
two founding nations and to the creators who are, in fact, the real 
soul of a nation?
<P>
	No, it is not the answer I get to a motion as direct as this one, a 
motion that every organization was demanding, a motion that, in 
my mind, goes without saying. Whether an organization is 
economically, socially or community oriented or whether it is a 
public institution, it needs to know where it is heading and how 
much money will be available. That is just what we are asking 
the government. We want them to tell us that, for the next three 
years, we can rely on a fixed budget, a budget that will not 
change according to the mood of the finance minister, or 
according to the mood of the Canadian heritage minister or, with 
regard to copyright, for example, according to the mood of the 
industry minister.
<P>
	We are asking for some planning with normal and formal 
commitments, which will then be adhered to. But the reply is: 
``Yes, this is fine in theory, but the fact is, we have to cut''. I will 
conclude by saying that this motion, that I thought could get 
unanimous approval from all the members and from all the 
people who believe in planning, is getting approval only in 
theory. But in fact, as far as the money granted these 
organizations is concerned, the government is doing exactly the 
opposite of what it committed itself to doing in its red book and 
in its policy statements.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
weeks ago I raised with the Minister of Finance the question of 
an inheritance tax.
<P>
	I refer to that now very well quoted StatsCan report that 
examined the basic causes of the accumulated debt of the 
country and found that 44 per cent of the debt was the result of 
the compounding effect of a record high interest rate or 
monetary policy. Fifty per cent of the debt was the result of 
forgone revenue due to a series of  tax concessions. One could 
call a number of these tax loopholes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12146"> 12146 </A></B>
<P>
	A member of the government, when he wrote to the 
Department of National Revenue recently, asked whether 
someone entertaining clients as a business person, whether their 
hotel expenses, a massage at a fitness club, a dinner at a posh 
restaurant, the cost of an escort service, night club shows, floor 
shows, dinners including $200 bottles of wine and a cruise on 
the river, would be included as a legitimate tax deduction.
<P>
	The report back from the revenue department said yes, they 
would be, including the escort service. It was suggested the way 
the escort service was described ought to be changed, that they 
were essentially tour guides, body guards or interpreters. To 
describe them to be for sexual purposes would not be considered 
acceptable by Revenue Canada but they could be considered 
under these other categories.
<P>
	The point I was making was if so much of our debt is as a 
result of the number of tax loopholes, why do we not close the 
loophole of the inheritance aspect?
<P>
	I pointed out to the Minister of Finance that virtually every 
OECD country, with the exception of two, has an inheritance tax 
for those people who inherit large amounts of money. I am not 
talking about a home or a family farm or a family business. I am 
talking about someone who receives an inheritance, let us say, in 
excess of $1 million. Virtually every country in the world would 
ask that a tax be paid on that vast inheritance. We could consider 
a ceiling of $1 million.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance spoke around the issue. In this 
desperate time when we are seeking to find ways and means of 
eliminating the deficit and the debt, when every other country in 
the world virtually has a tax on the inheritance of large amounts 
of money, why would we not?
<P>
	It is fair to say that the primary benefactors of this tax 
loophole are the very wealthy, people who inherit $20 million or 
$50 million through their families at the time of death. We do 
not have that tax.
<P>
	I asked the Minister of Finance to explain why we would not 
have such a tax at a time when we are cutting back on every 
social program imaginable, every environmental program 
imaginable, on health care, on post-secondary education, on 
vocational training and so on. I have yet to receive an answer.
<P>
	Perhaps when I sit down the person responding on behalf of 
the government will clarify why Canada is rather unique in this 
aspect and has chosen not to tax those individuals that inherit 
vast amounts of money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the introduction of an 
inheritance tax would be a very complex way of raising a 
relatively small amount of additional tax revenue. In fact, based 
on OECD experience, an  inheritance tax would contribute less 
than 1 per cent of federal tax revenues.
<P>
	This revenue potential is small compared to the high 
administrative and compliance costs that it would entail since 
another tax collection operation would have to be established. 
This would require measures to obtain and verify information on 
wealth transfers at death, as well as complex rules to capture tax 
planning in order to avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	Moreover, Canada already has a tax system which derives 
considerable revenue from wealth holders through the taxation 
of capital gains at death, property taxes and certain taxes on 
transfers of property. Revenues from property taxes in Canada 
are higher than the combined revenues from property and wealth 
taxes in all other OECD countries with the exception of the 
United States.
<P>
	Rather than introducing a new tax that would be very complex 
and add a significant tax compliance burden, the budget 
introduced a number of tax measures which affect high income 
Canadians. An example of such a change on the personal income 
tax side is the elimination of tax advantages that flow from the 
establishment of family trusts.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALTRADE">INTERNATIONAL TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just recently I raised a concern I have regarding the 
United States embargo on the island and the people of Cuba.
<P>
	Tonight I would like to deal quickly with the Torricelli, the 
Helms and the Burton bills and amendments which are affecting 
drastically the trade relationships between Cuba and other parts 
of the world. The United States of America through these bills is 
having a direct impact on a great number of institutions and 
trading practices involving a great number of countries.
<P>
	We know that the United States is one of the great countries of 
the world, a country that I and many people envy for its spirit 
and for its energy. We know that it has corralled and harnessed 
this energy and spirit and the resources to become one of the 
greatest nations in the history of mankind.
<P>
	These bills are also among the greatest that have been created 
by the human mind, practically 99 per cent pure; so pure they 
could be used for classical examples in sociology classes, social 
political classes, political science classes, psychology classes, 
communication classes and so on. All over the world, 99 per 
cent pure propaganda.
<P>
	It is mind boggling when we read what these bills contain. 
These bills pose restrictions and controls not just on individuals 
but on corporations, financial institutions, even the United 
Nations. Through these bills the American government is so 
intent on controlling its people to prevent them from trading 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12147"> 12147 </A></B>
<P>
with Cuba and also those in other countries who might be trading 
partners with the United States.
<P>
	That means we will suffer terribly because of our relationship 
in our trading practices with Cuba. As a result that will affect our 
manufactured products of sugar and so on that we trade with the 
United States.
<P>
	The United States is interfering through these bills with the 
suspension of Cuba's membership in international organizations 
plus using many more tactics. Since 1962 there has been an 
embargo imposed on this island. However, even though these 
people have been rationed on every single purchase since those 
years, the spirit of revolution has prevailed and the people are 
survivors.
<P>
	If they were dissatisfied to the point where a revolution would 
take place to overthrow Castro, it would have taken place many 
years ago. The bill tells us the acts of the Castro government are 
a threat to international peace. I do not know what that would be 
called. However, it is a threat to international relationships. It 
jeopardizes all relationships and all the bills we have formulated 
and passed over the many decades. It is country that classifies 
itself as our best friend.
<P>
	I went to Cuba. It is amazing what those people have done 
under unbearable conditions and how resourceful they are. It is 
probably the best educated population in the world, no doubt 
about it. They have sent 20,000 doctors all over the world, 
chiefly to third world countries. No other country can match 
that. That is a threat to peace?
<P>
	Cuba has the finest genetic research centre. It has probably 
the finest cardiac centre in the world. Is that a threat to peace? 
When the Chernobyl incident took place the Cuban government 
took in over 35,000 victims at no cost to them. It built a huge 
resort to keep children and families in dozens of beautiful homes 
at no cost to the victims. That is a threat to peace?
<P>
	What did Canada do for these victims? What did the United 
States do? What did other countries of the world do for these 
people? Nothing.
<P>
	As I said, the spirit of revolution prevails-

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. member's time 
has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as currently drafted 
these bills would clearly adversely affect Canadian trade and 
economic interests if they were passed into law.
<P>
	Not only do their provisions violate U.S. obligations under 
NAFTA and the World Trade Organization, but they are also 
inconsistent with generally recognized principles of 
international law. The proposed import prohibitions on sugar 
and sugar containing products are a particular concern. If 
enacted, they could affect Canadian exports to the tune of $500 
million a year.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is strongly opposed to the 
measures in these bills and we are vigorously conveying 
Canadian concerns to both the administration and Congress. The 
Minister for International Trade has repeatedly raised our 
concerns with the U.S. trade representative, Mr. Kantor.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs has also made it clear that, 
while Canada and the United States may share similar long term 
goals of democracy and economic reform in Cuba, Canada has 
no intention of agreeing with U.S. attempts to impose its Cuban 
embargo through secondary boycotts on third countries.
<P>
	Ambassador Chrétien has written to members of Congress 
urging them to oppose the bill. Other governments also share our 
concerns and we are maintaining close contact with them in 
order to co-ordinate responsive efforts.
<P>
	Earlier this week, the U.S. administration's response to 
Congress on this bill was released. We were pleased to see that 
the administration has taken into account Canada's concerns. In 
particular, the U.S. administration opposes the provisions in the 
bill that would impose an import prohibition on sugar and 
sugar-containing products.
<P>
	Finally, we expect the administration will put strong pressure 
on the U.S. Congress to ensure that the legislation is modified.
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
