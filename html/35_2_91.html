	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-307, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act (polling hours), 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, today I would like to discuss my 
private member's bill, Bill C-307, an act to amend the Canada 
Elections Act (polling hours). This bill provides that every polling 
station on election day will close at the same time regardless of the 
time differences across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As you know, Canada is a large country where distances 
sometimes make things a lot more complicated, in spite of new 
technologies and means of transportation.
<P>
	The fact is that when British Columbians are waking up, 
Canadians living in St. John's, Newfoundland, are having lunch. 
The time difference is a major problem for all those who travel, and 
more so for westerners on election day.
<P>
	In British Columbia, results from the Atlantic region are in just 
after 4 p.m., while those from Quebec and Ontario are known an 
hour later. In British Columbia, where the population is much 
smaller than in eastern and central Canada, this means that voters 
always feel excluded from the federal election process.

	Many British Columbians feel they are second class citizens. 
They feel alienated. They have felt alienated all along. The other 
western provinces have the same problem, although not as much as 
British Columbia.
<P>
	It is not right that such a large part of Canada is left out of a 
process that touches all of us and determines the future of our 
country. For this reason I have tabled a bill that provides that every 
polling station on election day will close at the same time 
regardless of the time differences across the country.
<P>
	The current elections act gives the following provisions: Section 
79(3) provides that elections be held on Monday or Tuesday. 
Section 109(5) requires that polling hours be from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
across the country. Section 324 carries exceptions for 
constituencies with two or more time zones. Section 160 asks that 
ballots be counted immediately after closing of polls. There is no 
provision for delay. Section 328 says that it is an offence to publish 
election results in any area before voting ends in that area.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	In my bill changes would occur in the hours of voting. They 
would increase from 11 to 12 and the times would be as follows: 
B.C. from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Alberta from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Ontario and 
Quebec from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; the maritime provinces from 11 
a.m. to 11 p.m.; and Newfoundland from 11.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.
<P>
	After discussions with the Chief Electoral Officer who asked that 
the hours not be increased from 11 to 12 because of increased costs, 
I am proposing that we vote for 11 hours as it is done today and that 
voting from Ontario to the maritimes be from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
and from 11.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. in Newfoundland. In this case 
British Columbia would receive the Atlantic Canada results around 
6 p.m. or 6.30 p.m. which would be acceptable. What is 
disconcerting is getting the Quebec and Ontario results before the 
closing of the polls in British Columbia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Generally speaking, this proposal is acceptable. We know that, in 
Ontario and in Quebec, 10 p.m. is not very late in the evening. A lot 
of people start relaxing at this time. However, my colleagues from 
the maritime provinces tell me that 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. is too late 
in Newfoundland.
<P>
	If this bill is referred to a committee today, we will have an 
opportunity to review it and make appropriate changes if necessary. 
There is a lot of opposition to the idea of voting at the same time 
and not counting votes until all polling stations are closed, because 
those working in polling stations located in eastern Canada would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5710"> 5710 </A></B>
<P>
have to wait for a long time. Moreover, we do not want to stop the 
publishing of results, something which is clearly an offense under 
the act. The problem comes up every time an election is held.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Only two bills have been presented in the past to change the 
system. In 1982 Bill C-113, on staggered hours, was tabled and 
went only to first reading. In 1988 Bill C-79, to establish the 
prohibition of election results before polls are closed, was tabled 
and did not make second reading.
<P>
	Complete staggered hours across the country would not solve the 
problem. What we have to achieve is to have all of the results from 
B.C. to Quebec, including the territories north of those provinces, 
announced at the same time, that is, after 10 p.m. Only the 
maritimes and Newfoundland would be allowed to announce 
results earlier, after the closing of polls in those provinces.
<P>
	In 1989 the Lortie commission recommended changes to the 
voting hours. In 1991 the report of the special committee on 
electoral reform recommended that we vote for 10 hours and that 
those hours be staggered. This solution would not solve western 
Canadians' sense of alienation and lack of participation. I do not 
think that people who reside in the central and eastern provinces 
and in the territories are aware of the difficulty western Canada 
faces at every election.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It must also be realized that British Columbia is experiencing the 
fastest growth in the country and that its population accounts for 13 
per cent of Canada's overall population. The only poll on the issue 
was held in 1990. Seventy per cent of those who took part in it said 
voting hours were a problem, including 41 per cent who considered 
the problem to be a serious one that had to be corrected. As well, 50 
per cent of the participants were in favour of making changes to the 
system, with 29 per cent strongly supporting such changes.
<P>
	Yesterday, delegates at the Liberal convention voted 
unanimously in favour of such changes. As you can see, there is a 
general consensus. We realize that Canadians care for their 
country's well-being and for each other. I spoke to a lot of people 
regarding this issue, and the vast majority of them support the idea. 
Even newspapers and media people are in favour of this change, 
and I am grateful to all those who reacted positively to the idea.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> stated: ``Think of how western voters will 
feel if for once they can go to the polls at dinnertime without 
knowing Ontario's vote has determined the winner. From time to 
time Parliament is faced with legislation which is inherently 
sensible''.
<P>
	Some people may think that 10 p.m. is too late, but remember 
that in British Columbia we will only be able to vote until 7 p.m.
<P>
instead of 8 p.m. That is the difficulty of administering a country 
that goes from the Pacific to the Atlantic to the Arctic. Remember 
that this difficulty presents itself only every four to five years and 
Canadians are able to adjust themselves to these kinds of changes.
<P>
	I hope this bill will continue to be a lucky one and that we can 
give it royal assent before the next election. On election day I am 
sure people in the western provinces would celebrate and would 
feel a part of this big country of ours when at night in front of the 
TV they are informed of the election results at the same time as 
people in the rest of Canada. For the first time in the history of this 
country they would then feel that they count.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if you were to seek it I believe you would find 
unanimous consent to change the reference of Bill C-307 to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs instead of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to conclude by thanking 
all those who supported me, who encouraged me and who provided 
advice regarding this bill.
<P>
	I also ask hon. members to give me their support to refer this bill 
to a committee at the earliest opportunity, for a more in-depth 
review of this important issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on Bill C-307, which the hon. member for 
Vancouver-East just moved for second reading.
<P>
	But first, I want to point out that today is the first day that people 
everywhere in Canada and in Quebec are wearing, just like the 
members of this House, a lapel poppy to pay tribute to all those 
who served in the armed forces during the first and the second 
world wars, during the Korea War and even during the first wars of 
the Empire, including the Boer War at the end of the previous 
century.
<P>
	Whatever their origins, these people were sent wherever they 
were needed to defend democracy. In my native parish of 
Sainte-Claire de Dorchester, there were people who had fought the 
Bosporus and Dardanelles war and who vividly remembered that 
experience throughout their lives up until their deaths. I met and 
still meet with veterans who served during the second world war 
and in Korea and who are still very proud of the duties they carried 
out.
<P>
	Those who never came back deserve, of course, all our 
admiration and those who fought and were lucky enough to come 
back know they did world peace a huge favour. Some mothers lost 
their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5711"> 5711 </A></B>
<P>
sons, some wives lost their husbands, some brothers and sisters lost 
their brothers and even their sisters.
<P>
	So, of course, today, all the members of this House spare a 
thought for those in our families, in our communities, and in all of 
Canada, who fought to defend the values they believed in.
<P>
	We have taken over, in a more peaceful fashion, but may the 
example they have set guide us in the debates we hold and the 
decisions we have to make.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Regarding Bill C-307, I had the privilege to hear the 
explanations given by the member for Vancouver-East. Obviously, 
when polling hours were set, we did not think that Canadians would 
be able to get the results over the radio immediately via another 
country. We did not think that a television network such as CNN 
could broadcast the results instantaneously throughout the world. 
We did not think that results would be available on Internet.
<P>
	These technological developments mean that just a few minutes 
after polling stations close in St. Anthony or Maryston, 
Newfoundland, the results are available to Canadians via foreign 
countries, even though they cannot be announced in Canada under 
the Canada Elections Act. They are available in Langley, British 
Columbia, in Surrey, in North Vancouver, in Calgary or anywhere 
in Canada.
<P>
	Instantaneous communications have rendered the provisions of 
the Canada Elections Act obsolete and they have to be revised. In 
this sense, the official opposition, concerned with what goes on 
from coast to coast, supports in principle the bill introduced by the 
member for Vancouver-East.
<P>
	To make a comparison, everybody in this House certainly 
remembers the all important hockey games we used to have many 
years ago between Canada and Russia. We got the result on the 
news before we could watch the game on television. What was the 
use of watching a hockey game when you already knew the result? 
Even when the CBC, Radio-Canada and private broadcasters held 
back the results in response to public pressure, people took to their 
telephones and always managed to find out who had won a game in 
international competitions.
<P>
	The magic of modern communications has made it easy to obtain 
results, even though the law technically prohibits it. It is therefore 
time to amend the provisions of the Canada Elections Act so that 
voters in different time zones voting to elect the same Parliament 
may cast their ballot on a footing that truly feels equal, not just one 
that is theoretically equal. Voters in Vancouver, Calgary, Saskatoon 
and Winnipeg all have a right to feel that their participation in the 
Canadian democratic process carries the same weight as that of any 
other citizen.
<P>
	The United States is having the same problem, as we are now 
seeing. There has been much talk in the western states about 
whether legislation should not be standardized so that results are 
not known ahead of time.
<P>
	Political analysts who have looked at several presidential 
elections in the United States have shown that there was a snowball 
effect at play in presidential wins, particularly in the 1980 election. 
This was noted not only in the selection of the president, but also of 
congressmen, with eastern results coming in quickly and western 
voters apparently staying home in droves or voting with the tide, 
thus creating a snowball effect. This effect is not necessarily 
desirable.
<P>
	The hon member for Vancouver East was saying earlier that, in 
Quebec and in Ontario, 10 p.m. was not particularly late in most 
municipalities, that in fact there was still quite a bit going on at that 
time of night. There will perhaps be a small problem in the Atlantic 
provinces, because there is still a one and a half hour difference 
with Newfoundland, but these are questions that are worth looking 
at in committee, and that must not used as excuses to block the bill 
at second reading.
<P>
	Thus, in the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, where we are now in the process of looking at Bill C-63, an 
act to amend the Canada Elections Act, which was referred to us 
after first reading I might note, we could probably wrap up our 
examination if Bill C-307 was referred to committee fairly rapidly.
<P>
	With this in mind, and in order to make our contribution to the 
debate and show our understanding of the problem associated with 
the existing Canada Elections Act, we will be supporting the bill at 
second reading and following its progress in committee attentively.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> On debate, the 
hon. member for Vancouver North.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, that 
is North Vancouver. My constituents get quite upset when they hear 
it come out the wrong way.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	This bill does attempt to address the irritation felt by western 
voters when they learn from the Ontario and Quebec results which 
party will form the new government. In that respect I guess C-307 
has a lot of appeal.
<P>
	Of course, irritation when the election results come out is really 
only a small part of the overall irritation felt in the west in 
connection with what happens here in Ottawa, or what is run from 
Ottawa, symptomatic of terrible things to come starting with 
election night.
<P>
	Election night is the night when Canadians gather together in 
front of the television in order to watch the  results to see what 
party will be the next government. Frankly, it is extremely 
frustrating to be in front of the television, to have the end of the 
media 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5712"> 5712 </A></B>
<P>
blackout and see the 7 p.m. results being announced from Ontario 
naming the next government barely before our polls even close.
<P>
	In any case, political junkies, if we can call them that, all have 
friends in Ontario, Quebec and further east and by about five 
o'clock B.C. time they are busy calling their friends to find out the 
first results. Quite often in B.C., if we are honest about it, we really 
do know what is happening before the media blackout comes off.
<P>
	Whether or not this spreading of the message by word of month 
has an effect on the voting patterns is impossible to tell. Obviously 
we cannot rerun an election to test it under different conditions. 
Therefore it is impossible to tell whether changing voting hours or 
some leakage of results have any impact whatsoever.
<P>
	The remedies proposed in Bill C-307 do go some way forward in 
dealing with the problem of western voter frustration of the release 
of election results. However, like all of the other proposals 
suggested over the last few years, Bill C-307 is not really the 
perfect answer. For example, although some eastern Canadian 
results will still be available prior to the closing of the polls in B.C. 
the rest will be delayed. This leads me to the conclusion that one 
form of frustration presently felt in the west will simply be 
transformed into a different form of frustration for eastern voters 
who will now have to wait up until quite late to begin seeing the 
meaningful results.
<P>
	Perhaps it would be easier to critique this bill indirectly by 
referring to the various solutions that have been suggested over the 
years by past commissions and study groups. These are not in any 
particular order but I will number them just for reference. The first 
suggestion is that all of the polls across Canada open at the same 
local time of, say, 8 a.m. and close at the same local time of 7 p.m., 
with the counting of the votes deferred until all the polls are closed.
<P>
	The problems identified with that sort of solution are that the 
scrutineers, the returning officers and their staff would probably 
have to remain in a lock-up for several hours, particularly in 
eastern Canada, in order to wait for the polls to close everywhere 
before they could begin counting and releasing the votes. It could 
possibly be in the wee small hours of the next morning in eastern 
Canada before that could happen. The average voters in those areas 
would probably start to complain that they could not wait up so late 
and would not find out who the government was until they got up in 
the morning. That would be a legitimate complaint with that 
suggestion.
<P>
	The second suggestion uses the same opening and closing hours 
as the first, but with all of the vote counting deferred until the 
beginning of the next day in the west. Counting would then take 
place and the results would be released simultaneously all across 
the country.
<P>
	The problem with that is that one has to ask whether the 
scrutineers and other staff would have to be retained in a lock-up
<P>
overnight. Would the ballot boxes have to be removed to 
somewhere secure in order to make sure there was no ballot 
tampering before the next day? Either way, this method would 
probably cause major disruption to commerce throughout the 
country for the next day because all the those people who are trying 
to watch the results or who are working within the system to count 
votes or deal with the other aspects of the election would not be at 
work. Frankly, it would appear to be a major disruption.
<P>
	The third suggestion proposes staggered hours across the 
country so that the polls open and close simultaneously. That is 
similar to what was proposed in Bill C-307. Frankly, we do not 
know whether the convenience factor of the polls being opened at 
certain hours encourages or discourages people from voting. We 
are well aware that there is legislation requiring employers to give 
employees time to go and vote but in practice we all know that a lot 
of people wait until after work. For example, in B.C. they do not go 
to the polls until 5.30 p.m., 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.
<P>
	In addition, on the problems mentioned earlier regarding that it 
would probably then be the wee small hours before eastern 
Canadians would know the results, it would just transfer the 
frustration from the west coast to the east coast and so it is not 
really a solution.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The 1991 royal commission on electoral reform and the 1993 
special committee on electoral reform both recommended 
staggered opening and closing hours at the polls as the best way to 
address the issue. I am sure they spent a bundle of money coming 
to their conclusions.
<P>
	It is almost a shame we are not discussing royal commissions 
and special committees today because we could probably get in 
some good shots about the amount of taxpayer money wasted on 
some of these projects. More often they appear to be simply a way 
of postponing decisions rather than actually finding sensible 
solutions.
<P>
	In addition to the taxpayer funded political commissions that 
have worked on this in the past, the Chief Electoral Officer has also 
proposed a solution. That solution would involve the bridging of 
time zone differences by combining modified staggered polling 
hours, which sounds complicated but is not too complicated, with 
special provisions for the counting and deferral of the release of 
results after closing of the polls. I sense from the speech made by 
the member for Vancouver East that these solutions could be 
amendments to this bill.
<P>
	Under this system, the results from eastern Canada would still be 
available prior to the close of the polls in B.C. but only by about 
half an hour. It would involve about 36 seats and would not have a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5713"> 5713 </A></B>
<P>
major impact on the results, and so it is probably not a bad 
compromise.
<P>
	There would be a significant alleviation of the time zone effect, 
with the results in eastern Canada still being available right before 
11 p.m.
<P>
	I support this bill's going to committee following today's debate. 
It appears to be a non-partisan issue. We are all prepared to talk 
about it to see if we can find meaningful ways to make this 
legislation work, which I certainly support.
<P>
	However, I would like to bring one point forward. It is a very 
large unanswered question which we did not have to deal with in 
the past. I will illustrate with an example. On October 12 an 
election was held in New Zealand. The official results were 
released poll by poll on the Internet. Anybody could dial up from 
anywhere in the world to see them, as I did.
<P>
	I discovered that along with the official results, some unofficial 
results were being posted presumably by the various riding 
associations. This will become a major problem-if we call it a 
problem-in the future. All the media blackouts in the world will 
not mean a thing if various riding associations, unofficial or not, 
can just put results on the Internet. There is the potential for hoax 
results to be put on the Internet in an attempt to affect election 
results.
<P>
	That is an issue we will have to deal with eventually. It may well 
be that the only way we can deal with that is to simply not release 
any results until a set time. I am not presupposing what the answer 
would be but I suggest the issue should be looked at in committee.
<P>
	One way of reducing the effects of counting delays, which would 
allow for closing of polls more closely together, would be to 
encourage the use of electronic voting methods. I will be 
introducing a private member's bill to the House on Wednesday 
regarding initiative and referendum. There is a provision in that bill 
to permit electronic voting methods to be used.
<P>
	For example, touch tone technology is well researched now and 
has been proven to work. One way we could reduce the counting 
time is with instant tallies done electronically. I hope the 
government side will recognize the inevitably of having to move 
with technology by moving toward those solutions in the long run.
<P>
	In the long run new technology may actually come to the rescue. 
It may help us to overcome this problem. Just as one portion of 
technology is interfering with our ability to block results, another 
set of technology may help us to overcome the problems.
<P>
	Although many different proposals have been put forward over 
the years, like those identified in Bill C-307, none of them has been 
perfect and none of them has been adopted. Bill C-307 also suffers 
from the problem of not being perfect but we could hardly expect it 
to be perfect considering all the problems involved in getting it to 
work.
<P>
	On balance, it is probably the best opportunity we will have 
during this Parliament to at least go part way in addressing the 
existing concerns. For that reason I am supportive and I would urge 
other members to support this bill's going to committee before 
second reading.
<P>
	The issue crosses partisan lines. There is every reason to believe 
we can work together to put it into an enactable form. I urge 
members to support the bill.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise very briefly to address Bill C-307. I consider this an important 
proposal, an important piece of legislation that apparently has the 
support of the government and all parties. In light of this 
unanimity, as a private member I thought it was more important 
than ever to put on the record my reservations about this bill.
<P>
	This bill is to address, as I understand it from the member who 
proposed it, two problems. One problem is people finding out in 
western Canada the results of elections in eastern Canada before 
the polls have closed. In other words, knowing what the election 
results are, which could influence the vote. The second is 
addressing the problem of western alienation. On the first count, 
there are some valid concerns. That is the reason the House is 
looking at this legislation.
<P>
	For example, in the last election it would be pretty easy to guess 
that had more westerners known the results from Quebec, it might 
well have influenced their vote in terms of the choosing of the 
official opposition. No doubt, with modern computer technology, 
these results will become more and more known before the polls 
are closed in western Canada. That is a valid concern.
<P>
	However, I want to express my own objections and, more than 
objections, it is an insult to suggest that this is a serious attempt to 
address western alienation. Westerners often find out that 
Parliament has already been elected before the polls close in their 
riding. Our system is structured such that governments can be 
elected without the support of anybody in western Canada, and can 
rule this country without any input from westerners no matter what 
order the votes are counted in.
<P>
	The cry of government members who are in trouble in the west is 
that the whole problem is the counting of votes. Let me use a 
specific reference. In the 1980 federal election, shortly after I 
relocated to western Canada, the federal Liberal Party got itself 
elected in eastern Canada by running on a platform of 
expropriation of western resources. That is how it got elected.
<P>
	It got elected by getting a majority of the seats in Ontario and 
Quebec with virtually no representation whatsoever in western 
Canada. It then proceeded to govern the country, making massive 
changes to western industry and the resource base without any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5714"> 5714 </A></B>
<P>
input whatsoever from western Canada. It did that on the basis of 
how our system of government operates. If the votes had been 
counted first in the west and later in the east, or at the same time, it 
would have made no difference whatsoever to that.
<P>
	It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that the counting of the 
ballots was the problem in that instance. It was a problem of the 
system of government and the actual policies pursued by the 
federal government vis-à-vis western Canada.
<P>
	My colleague from North Vancouver has outlined in great detail 
and very confidently the deficiencies of this proposal as well as the 
deficiencies of alternatives. I congratulate him for that.
<P>
	I want to add, however, one additional concern I have once again 
as a westerner about this proposal. The staggered hours as modified 
by the chief electoral officer means that the voting polls would 
close very early in the evening in western Canada.
<P>
	Those of us who have worked in many elections know that the 
evening hours are the heaviest voting hours anywhere in the 
country. What this proposal does which worries me the most is 
restrict the access of westerners to the polls far more than it does 
other Canadians because it impacts the hours when they are most 
likely to vote. This is a serious concern. I hope the committee will 
look at the reservations of the member for North Vancouver and 
consider some of the options available.
<P>
	That is all I want to say. I want to make it very clear in this 
atmosphere of unanimity that there are serious reservations about 
this bill. I want them on the record.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> The House is now in session. I am going to hear a 
point of order from the hon. whip of the Reform Party.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Tuesday, October 22 the member for Wild Rose brought to your 
attention a matter that occurred at the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs. It was a serious matter regarding a 
breach of Standing Order 114. It was suggested that because it 
appeared to be an inadvertent act, the issue could be resolved at 
committee.
<P>
	I brought the issue back to the committee because, as whip of the 
party, I was the one who applied Standing Order 114. When I 
applied the standing order on behalf of my caucus I had certain 
expectations.
<P>
	I am aware that committees are masters of their own 
proceedings. I have experienced and have been frustrated by some 
internal majority supported rules in the past. What is comforting is 
that the rules of the House take precedence over the rules of the 
committees. This lends some predictability and some protection, 
particularly for those of us in opposition.
<P>
	The problem arose on Monday, October 21. The member for 
Wild Rose was substituting on the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs and attempted to table a motion at that committee 
meeting. He was told that he could not do that. The reason given by 
the chair was the fact that he was only a substitute. The chair based 
her reasoning on an internal rule where 48 hours' notice is required 
to move a motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5715"> 5715 </A></B>
<P>
	I refer you to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation No. 766(1). It 
describes the status of a non-member. It states that they can 
participate, but ``they may not vote, move motions nor be a part of 
any quorum''. Voting, moving motions and being a part of a 
quorum is a privilege enjoyed by a permanent member.
<P>
	However, it is the nature of the work of members of Parliament 
to be out of Ottawa on occasion, or to have commitments in the 
House while their committee is meeting. A procedure has always 
existed to allow for other members to substitute for permanent 
members. In our present standing orders this procedure is covered 
under Standing Order 114. The relevant section of the standing 
order that I applied reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At any time-the Chief Whip of any recognized party may effect substitutions by 
filing notice thereof with the clerk of the committee, having selected the substitutes 
from among all the Members of his or her party-and such substitutions shall be 
effective immediately they are received by the clerk of the committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	This procedure is effective because the substitute is given the 
full status of a permanent member while the substitution is in force. 
That full status means the authority to vote, move motions and be 
part of quorum.
<P>
	The chair of the committee argued that the member is only a 
substitute for the day and therefore could not table the motion. Mr. 
Speaker, if you cannot table a motion at this committee you cannot 
move a motion. If you cannot move a motion then you are 
breaching the authority granted the substitute under Standing Order 
114. In other words, the committee has redefined the status of a 
substitute.
<P>
	Not only is a standing order diminished but a longstanding 
practice is being ignored. Unlike the House where unanimous 
consent is required by a private member to table a document, at 
committee a member can table anything he or she wants. A 
member can table a document, a letter or a motion. Considering 
that a substitute has the status of a member while signed in, that 
substitute can then table a document, letter or motion.
<P>
	There was concern about whether or not the member for Wild 
Rose would be signed in for a subsequent meeting to move his 
motion, provided he was allowed to table the motion. It is not a 
matter for the chair of that committee to decide or even speculate 
on that. It is up to the party whips with the authority granted to 
them under Standing Order 114 to determine the status of their 
members who attend. It is the House that determines the 
membership and outlines of procedure and authority for the 
substitutes, not the chair or the committee majority. That is up to 
the House in its rules. Such a decision by the chair or by that 
committee to say that they pre-empt the standing orders of this 
House borderlines on contempt.
<P>
	The chair of the justice committee also argued that because 
another member could table and move a motion on behalf of the 
substitute that no harm was done.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you were once a chairman of a committee and you 
know full well it is not uncommon for a small opposition party not 
to have a permanent member present at a meeting. There are often 
substitutes representing a party at committee. That is commonly 
done. Sometimes this is due to the business a committee is dealing 
with and the wide variety of interests within a particular caucus. 
Sometimes, as I pointed out to the chair of the committee, someone 
will be substituted in a committee week after week in order to fulfil 
the role that the party has asked the member to fill and to reflect his 
or her interest in the subject matter.
<P>
	Under these circumstances my party would be unable to table a 
motion and therefore be unable to move a motion. The committee 
is telling the House and every party whip of the House that no 
longer can they just send substitutes to a committee in order to be 
functional, they now have to ensure that a permanent member is 
present.
<P>
	Before this internal rule we could send whomever we determined 
appropriate in order to fulfil the requirements of our party and our 
caucus. We did so under the authority of the House. What has 
happened to that authority? The justice committee has dictated a 
new criteria for party whips. Standing Order 114 does not mean 
what it once meant and the tail is wagging the dog.
<P>
	On June 16, 1994 there was a similar case regarding Standing 
Order 114. The chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs allowed a member who was not legally signed in to move 
motions, vote and be part of quorum. Although he was aware of the 
irregularity, he continued to allow the member to participate as a 
substitute.
<P>
	The matter was brought to the House the next day by the member 
for Prince George-Bulkley Valley. The member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley questioned the chair's primary 
responsibility to ensure that the committee operated under the rules 
established by the House of Commons. Although, Mr. Speaker, you 
rarely rule on proceedings of a committee, this case was a clear 
breach of Standing Order 114.
<P>
	In your ruling, Mr. Speaker, you said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the matter now before us, I must conclude that this is serious enough to require 
the intervention of the Chair because it concerns a fundamental right which belongs 
to the House and not to the committee, namely the right to establish the membership 
of a committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	You went further, Mr. Speaker, and stated that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it is a tradition of this House that committees are masters of their own 
proceedings, they cannot establish procedures which go beyond the powers 
conferred upon them by the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="5716"> 5716 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	We are in the same situation today. This time a member was 
legally substituted in, but was denied the privileges of that status 
under Standing Order 114.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, when I brought this matter to the committee, as you 
asked me to do, the chair upheld the rules of the committee over the 
rules of the House. Your last ruling regarding Standing Order 114 is 
clear. The committee has no business interfering with the right of 
the House to establish the membership of a committee. It has no 
right to diminish the status of a substitute member and it has no 
right dictating to the party whips membership requirements in 
excess of what is already in our standing orders.
<P>
	Standing Order 114 gives a substitute the authority to table, vote, 
move motions and be part of quorum. The committee, in the case I 
have cited, has gone beyond the power conferred on it by the House 
by denying a substitute the right to table and move a motion.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to make a ruling on this to clarify 
the matter. I have gone to the committee as you have requested but 
I have not received satisfaction there. I think it is obviously a clear 
contravention of your previous ruling and the rules of the House.
<P>
	Could I please ask you to rule on this so that our members and all 
party whips will know where they stand on this. It is a serious 
matter which I believe you will take in the seriousness in which it is 
offered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
the same point of order, I want to apprise the House that this is the 
first instance that this matter has come to my attention. I fully 
understand that my hon. colleague, the Reform Party whip, to the 
best of his ability and with the facts as he knows them, is defending 
the interests of his colleague, the member for Wild Rose. I think his 
intention is to defend the best interests of committees in general.
<P>
	However, I submit as a point of verification that in the justice 
committee the member in question in that most recent incident 
referred to by my colleague from Fraser Valley East, the member 
for Wild Rose, is an associate member.
<P>
	I would also like to inform the Chair that the two members of the 
Reform Party, who for lack of a better expression I will refer to as 
full members of the committee, were present at the committee at 
that time. Under those circumstances and possibly there were 
others, I certainly understand the Reform Party whip raising this 
matter at this time.
<P>
	I only wish I had known about the matter previously. I would 
have been in a better position to give a better argument to sustain 
what I believe to be the standing rule of the House, which to a great 
extent, of course, is the  principle that committees are masters of 
their own destiny.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I recognize, as do all members, if that should be 
infringed on, I certainly would respect any decision you would 
make in that area in the best interests of the House and our 
committee structure. I will leave that matter in your most capable 
hands at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. whip of the Reform Party for 
bringing this to my attention once again, and the intervention of the 
government whip today.
<P>
	I will take this matter under advisement and I will, first of all, 
inform myself of what transpired in the committee. I will inform 
myself of the precedents, notwithstanding that the whip of the 
Reform Party has outlined the case which seems to be very well 
researched. I take the point that there are other people who were at 
the committee who could have moved that motion.
<P>
	I believe the crux of the matter, if I can put it in these words, is 
that we are asking ourselves, does the committee have the power, 
the right, to make a decision which would supersede a decision of 
the House?
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	That is the case which I believe the whip of the Reform Party is 
trying to make. Did that occur? I intend to inform myself and I will 
get back to the House with a decision on this matter. I am sure the 
House will give me a little bit of time so that I can satisfy myself 
that whatever decision I make will be for the betterment of the 
functioning not only of the committee but also of the House of 
Commons. I will get back to the House at an early time.
<P>

	The House resumed from October 23 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation of commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in the debate today on Bill C-29 outlining the 
government's actions on methylcyclopentadienyl manganese 
tricarbonyl, commonly referred to as MMT.
<P>
	We must be clear from the outset that the government's interest 
in this legislation is our commitment to the environmental, health 
and protection elements of the bill. We have made this commitment 
to Canadians and we intend to make good on our commitment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5717"> 5717 </A></B>
<P>
	When we looked around we asked ourselves how we can most 
effectively ensure that we protect our environment. We must come 
to one conclusion. The answer is we must do what we can to 
prevent pollution. As legislators Canadians expect us to ensure 
that their safety and the environment are maintained. I would 
suggest to my colleagues that this is accomplished in C-29.
<P>
	All of us here in this place and Canadians all across the country 
are concerned about maintaining our environment. When we think 
of air pollution we think of automobiles as being a major 
contributor to air pollution. In fact, autos and all forms of 
transportation are the leading source of air pollution. It stands to 
reason that to impact on air pollution, if we are seriously taking 
action on this, we must focus on the automobile. Bill C-29 does 
that.
<P>
	The auto industry, which represents 21 domestic and offshore 
manufacturers, is convinced that MMT has an adverse effect on the 
operation of vehicle pollution control components including the 
sophisticated onboard systems. The industry is adamant that the 
government must take quick and decisive action to ensure that 
MMT free fuels are available to Canadian consumers. The auto 
industry is so concerned and convinced of the detrimental effects of 
MMT that it is conducting a $10 million test program in the United 
States in order to obtain definitive evidence in support of this 
position.
<P>
	Bill C-29 represents a prudent approach to ensure that Canadian 
consumers and the environment are protected in the view of 
uncertainty of the long term impacts of MMT on the advanced 
emissions control technology such as onboard diagnostics that are 
being introduced in our cars and will be in widespread use in the 
very near future.
<P>
	The automakers have indicated that if MMT remains in 
Canadian fuels, they would take action ranging from disconnecting 
onboard diagnostic sensors to the removal of sensors and decreased 
warranty provisions for our consumers. General Motors has 
already advised us that certain onboard diagnostic systems in the 
1996 models have been disabled.
<P>
	The onboard diagnostic systems in autos are designed to permit 
cars to operate more efficiently and in a more environmentally 
friendly manner. If the systems fail or are disarmed because of 
MMT in the fuel, there is an overall harmful impact on Canadians 
and our environment. The public must be confident that the 
government is doing all that it can in order to protect citizens and 
the environment.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment task 
force on cleaner vehicles and fuels estimates that health benefits of 
up to $31 billion over 23 years would result from introducing 
cleaner fuels and more stringent emissions standards into the 
Canadian  marketplace. We can readily see the need for decisive 
action, action that will reduce air pollutants and ensure efficient 
operation of vehicles. Bill C-29 has that as its goal.
<P>
	The EPA in the United States has expressed concerns on the lack 
of data relating to the use of MMT in gasolines and therefore 
advocates a cautious approach to the use of these additives in fuels. 
Unless MMT is banned in Canada, our consumers will be 
inconvenienced by frequent and unnecessary visits for vehicle 
maintenance and will encounter warranty problems.
<P>
	Over the years, Canadians have taken pride in setting an example 
for our international colleagues on a number of fronts. In the case 
of environmental issues we should not be overly influenced by 
unnecessary threats of our neighbour to the south. We have worked 
for and earned respect worldwide on issues on health and the 
environment.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues in the House that we not shy away from 
taking a leadership role on this issue. The removal of MMT from 
fuels will provide an opportunity for the introduction of ethanol 
and other substitutes which could be an important element of a 
broader based national energy policy. Such a policy would be 
consistent with our commitments in the red book as well as an 
Agriculture Canada policy paper to eliminate MMT from gasoline.
<P>
	Just two weeks ago I attended a ground breaking ceremony for a 
new ethanol facility in Chatham, Ontario. That event marked a 
win-win situation for all parties involved in the development of 
that initiative. The ethanol plant in Chatham will be a $153 million 
facility producing 150 million litres of ethanol fuel each year. It 
will allow Canadian farmers, manufacturers and distributors to 
fulfil Canadian consumer demands and it will provide a safe, clean 
burning fuel additive to our markets. It will be a success story for 
our government, industry and consumers.
<P>
	We must continue to pursue an alternate fuel policy. Our national 
biomass ethanol program does just that. Our actions to eliminate 
MMT from Canadian fuels will improve our environment, address 
health concerns and provide options for alternate fuel additives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to participate again in the debate on Bill C-29, an act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial 
purposes of certain manganese-based substances. Its purpose is to 
ban the use of manganese-base substances, including MMT.
<P>
	This is a highly controversial bill, even among ministers and 
government Mps. The cabinet is not unanimously in favour of it. 
The majority of provinces are also opposed. As well, it involves a 
serious conflict between two major industrial sectors: the automo-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5718"> 5718 </A></B>
<P>
tive manufacturers and the oil industry. The former maintain  that 
MMT is harmful to their products, and forces them to adopt 
mechanisms and practices which could result in purchasers having 
to pay more for their vehicles. The latter are opposed to the banning 
of manganese in unleaded gasoline, and contest the legitimacy of 
the arguments used by the other group.
<P>
	I object to the way automotive manufacturers are blackmailing 
the government and the consumer, with their threat of a $3,000 hike 
in price and restricted warranties if this bill is passed.
<P>
	The petroleum industry claims MMT reduces nitrous oxide 
emissions by as much as 20 per cent. Moreover, a study 
commissioned by the Council of Ministers of Environment, 
Canada, estimates that the refineries would require $115 million in 
capital and $50 million yearly in additional operating costs to get 
rid of MMT in Canada. This would also mean a hike in gasoline 
prices. In addition, results of tests by the Ethyl Company in the 
USA contradict the arguments of the automobile manufacturers.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	In my opinion, the proposal to ban MMT has no environmental, 
economic or legal justification.
<P>
	This bill is not in line with Canada's obligations under trade 
agreements such as NAFTA and those relating to interprovincial 
trade. This past September, the U.S. Ethyl Corporation indicated its 
intention to lodge a complaint calling for $200 million U.S. in 
damages from Canada under the appropriate sections of NAFTA 
for the damages sustained by its Canadian subsidiary. This 
multinational also claims that its reputation has been tarnished by 
the comments of the Minister of the Environment on MMT.
<P>
	As for interprovincial trade, by prohibiting the marketing of 
manganese-based substances, this bill violates federal-provincial 
trade agreements. It also constitutes an unacceptable intrusion by 
the federal government in this area. In fact, almost all provinces are 
opposed to this bill. Last May, even the Quebec National Assembly 
passed a unanimous resolution, supported by the opposition, asking 
the government to postpone the passage of this bill.
<P>
	So it is hard to understand why the government insists on 
sending this bill through the House, a bill that, by the way, was 
criticized by the Minister for International Trade. In a letter sent to 
the environment minister seven months ago, the Minister for 
International Trade maintained that banning the importation of 
MMT would be contrary to Canada's obligations as a member of 
the World Trade Organization and NAFTA. There was no 
justification for health or environmental reasons, considering the 
scientific evidence available. He went on to say, and rightly so, that 
he was afraid this would lead to another trade dispute with the 
United States.
<P>
	Premier Romanow of Saskatchewan sent a letter to the Prime 
Minister of Canada on September 16, in which he said that the 
legislation was in no way justified at this time. He added that, 
according to the scientific data available on MMT, there was no 
indication that environmental benefits would accrue as result of 
this legislation, and they found it difficult to let the refineries or 
consumers foot the bill.
<P>
	At the present time, there is very little justification for banning 
the addition of MMT to unleaded gas. I may remind the House that 
from the economic point of view, this bill is a costly one, especially 
in terms of jobs lost, if we consider the threat to the viability of 
many refineries, including some refineries in Quebec.
<P>
	This is in addition to the economic problems arising from the 
resulting violations of trade agreements with North America and 
the Canadian provinces. This bill contains a number of legal 
shortcomings, which may have major consequences for Canada's 
reputation and economy. How can we expect American businesses 
to be interested in penetrating the Canadian market, when the 
Government of Canada interferes with the way they do business or 
fails to observe its trade agreements by passing bills like C-29?
<P>
	As far as the environment is concerned, the evidence has shown 
that removing MMT does not increase air pollution, nor is this 
substance harmful to public health.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	A research program funded by the Quebec Department of 
National Resources, the Natural Sciences and Engineering 
Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Petroleum Products 
Institute has made it clear that the contribution of manganese from 
MMT sources is negligible, compared with other industrial and 
natural sources; highway traffic only has an indirect effect on the 
percentage of manganese in the atmosphere by recirculating dust 
particles near roads and streets.
<P>
	In conclusion, there is every reason to object vehemently to Bill 
C-29, which creates problems from the economic, environmental, 
social, commercial and legal points of view. For all of these 
reasons, I am very much opposed to Bill C-29.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there seems to be some 
confusion about exactly what we are debating here today. The title 
of Bill C-29 is to regulate the interprovincial trade in and the 
importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese based 
substances.
<P>
	This is not about protecting the environment. It is not about 
members of Parliament making technical decisions beyond their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5719"> 5719 </A></B>
<P>
competency and it is not about this House acting as refereebetween two extremely powerful lobby groups.
<P>
	This bill is related strictly to international and interprovincial 
trade, what can be traded and what cannot. Why, therefore, is this 
bill being brought forward by the Minister of the Environment? 
This makes no sense at all.
<P>
	The Liberals have been opposed to the North American Free 
Trade Agreement in the past but now they are its strongest 
supporters. If Bill C-29 is passed, there is going to be trouble with 
our trade partners in the NAFTA agreement. There will be a 
dispute. This government could save itself embarrassment. It could 
save the country embarrassment by dropping this whole bill 
completely.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade agrees with what I have 
said. He is very concerned about the possible passage of this bill. 
He fears for the reputation of Canada in the international trading 
community.
<P>
	I wish to read for the record a letter that the Minister for 
International Trade wrote to the Minister of the Environment on 
February 23, 1996:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Sergio:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I understand that you are considering the reintroduction of Bill C-94 in the 
upcoming session. My department continues to have certain reservations concerning 
this measure, which I wish to draw to your attention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the original arguments favouring the ban on MMT was that the United 
States already prohibited its use as a petroleum additive. Recently the U.S. Court of 
Appeal overturned the U.S. ban. This has effectively removed harmonization 
arguments in support of Bill C-94. Indeed, since adding MMT to petroleum products 
is now permissible in the U.S., harmonization would now be promoted by 
introducing no new Canadian regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An import prohibition on MMT would be inconsistent with Canada's obligations 
under the WTO and NAFTA: (1) it would constitute an impermissible prohibition on 
imports, particularly if domestic production, sale and use is not similarly prohibited, 
and (2) it could not be justified on health or environmental grounds given current 
scientific evidence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The United States trade representative-is monitoring the situation closely. There 
is the possibility that the United States could mount a challenge, either on USTR's 
own initiative or pursuant to a Section 301 petition; Ethyl Corp., the American 
producer of MMT, has indicated that it most certainly intends to file such a petition. 
Also, Ethyl Corp. may try to advance an argument that such a ban would be a 
measure tantamount to expropriation of Ethyl's investment in Canada. Thus, Canada 
may also be susceptible to an investor-state challenge under Chapter 11 of the 
NAFTA.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There has been heated debate surrounding the exact effects of banning MMT. The 
claims of the automotive and petroleum industries conflict markedly, with little 
common ground between them. Testing is only now starting in the United States, 
with unambiguous results some years away.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In view of the Presidential and Congressional elections this year, American 
politicians are particularly sensitive to any foreign initiative which might injure their 
domestic industries.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In conclusion, let me stress my department's belief that Bill C-94 should not be 
re-introduced as it could have many adverse implications for Canadian trade, 
without compensating environmental benefits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	It is signed by the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	I am sure the House is aware that Bill C-94, to which this letter 
refers, is the precise equivalent of Bill C-29 which we are debating 
here today.
<P>
	In view of this, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words after the word ``that'' be deleted, and the following substituted 
therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House declines to give third reading to Bill C-29, An act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese based substances, since the bill fails to address the impact of the import 
prohibition on certain manganese based substances on international trade.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The amendment is acceptable. The debate is now 
on the amendment.
<P>
	I inadvertently skipped over a speaker. I am going to try to catch 
up as we go along. I am going to recognize the hon. member for 
Durham and then, depending on who stands, we will go from there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
mind being looked over but I do not want to be overlooked.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to speak today on Bill C-29, the MMT 
legislation and the amendment thereto. Also, I would like to 
congratulate the Minister of the Environment for having the 
intestinal fortitude to reintroduce the bill before this legislature.
<P>
	In Durham on a clear day, as the song goes, we can see forever. 
On a clear day in the summer sometimes we can see the CN Tower. 
This summer we saw less and less of the CN Tower as Toronto 
became smogged in.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	People want to take responsibility for the environment and they 
want to do it in a number of different ways. Our automobile 
industry is addressing the real concerns people have about how the 
can take responsibility for the vehicles they drive and indeed in a 
lot of other industries as well. We have seen this in various areas, 
the packaging of products and so forth.
<P>
	The automobile industry has been very responsive to the desire 
of people to have a clean and safe environment by a number of 
initiatives. It is moving toward alternative sources of fuel. We had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5720"> 5720 </A></B>
<P>
discussions in this House about the use of ethanol in our gasoline 
and there are other environmentally sensitive fuels available. In my 
riding General Motors is a major manufacturer employer  and has 
been a leader in developing these kinds of technologies for its 
vehicles.
<P>
	Recently I was surprised to learn that onboard diagnostic 
systems, which are state of the art, allow people to understand how 
their vehicles are performing relative to the pollutants.
<P>
	Many years ago when catalytic converters were first introduced 
people said ``how do we get them off our cars because they are 
affecting our fuel consumption?'' People's attitudes have 
completely changed. Today that is not the attitude of a common 
person. People want to find out how they can be part of the 
solution, not part of the problem.
<P>
	The automobile companies have wisely in their marketing 
systems realized this and that is why these onboard diagnostic 
systems exist. They give them the ability to know that their 
vehicles are performing as best they can and are not polluting the 
environment as much as possible with our current technology.
<P>
	General Motors is disabling certain aspects of its onboard 
diagnostic systems for one very important reason. Manganese 
based fuel additives cause an 80 per cent residual within engines. 
As a consequence it creates a situation where the onboard 
diagnostic system does not work. Here we have a company which 
is recognizing the desire of people to have a safer and cleaner 
environment and producing technology to do that but which is 
unable to basically maintain that because of some of the fuel 
additives allowed in our gasoline.
<P>
	There is an ongoing debate about manganese additives but it is 
the residual build-up within the engine that then turns around and 
basically makes the onboard diagnostic system not work. Part of 
that process is that if a catalytic converter is not working properly it 
should be replaced. People want to know that and those people 
want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.
<P>
	This legislation addresses that very real concern the average 
person has. I am surprised at the opposition to this from both 
opposition parties. I heard one of the Bloc members talk about 
bringing investment to this country. Some of the biggest investors 
in this country are the car manufacturing companies. In Ontario 
one out of six people can trace their jobs directly to automobile 
production. I am surprised that the Block has taken the position it 
has because similarly we have a significant plant in Sainte-Thérèse, 
Quebec that is also very interested in dealing with the desires of 
people to control the environment.
<P>
	I was pleased to see Maureen Kempston-Darkes, president of the 
Canadian division of General Motors, announcing that her 
company and other car makers will introduce leading edge 
pollution control technologies to further reduce smog-causing 
emissions from automobiles.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	They are not going to continue with that kind of research and 
development, they are not going to continue with those kinds of 
solutions to pollution if they do not get the assistance through 
people like us who will ban the use of MMT as a fuel additive. 
Clearly those vehicles are not going to perform up to their 
expectations as long as they have these components within the 
gasoline they produce.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am very supportive of the MMT legislation, the 
banning of MMT. I believe the people of Durham desire to see 
alternate fuels and other technologies that companies like General 
Motors will develop to reduce fuel emissions and to create a 
cleaner air environment not only for us but for generations to come 
after us.
<P>
	I look forward to the passage of this bill in all due haste.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in this House to reiterate that the Bloc 
Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-29.
<P>
	In fact, after listening to our government colleagues' speeches 
this morning and the previous speeches at second reading, we are 
more convinced than ever that every one of us should at this 
time-I repeat, at this time-vote against Bill C-29.
<P>
	This bill is aimed at prohibiting the importation into Canada of 
and the interprovincial trade in MMT, without any serious evidence 
that it is harmful to health or the environment. It is also in flagrant 
violation of NAFTA, and we should be particularly careful with 
this.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is therefore opposed to this bill at third 
reading. We stress that we will always oppose Bill C-29 as it now 
stands, because it is unacceptable for a Minister of the 
Environment to try to legislate on international trade. We will not 
support the roundabout way in which the Minister of the 
Environment is using legislation to ban the importation of and 
interprovincial trade in a product under the pretext that this product 
is harmful to health and the environment.
<P>
	If the Minister of the Environment is really convinced that MMT 
is dangerous, he should also ban the manufacturing and use of this 
product. This bill prohibits the importation of this product, but not 
its use and manufacturing. Yet, according to their fine rhetoric, 
MMT is harmful to people's health. In that case, why are we still 
allowed to use and produce it?
<P>
	Frankly, Bill C-29 is not aimed in the right direction. On the 
contrary, it still allows the use and production of MMT, but only 
within a province's borders.
<P>
	Some Liberal members have accused us of not being concerned 
with the environment and Canadians' health. You know this is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5721"> 5721 </A></B>
<P>
true. Like all the members of this  House, the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois are very concerned with the well-being of Quebecers 
and Canadians alike. That is why we have asked that the 
government give us clear and irrefutable proof that MMT is 
harmful.
<P>
	Without doubting their word, we would like them to prove their 
point, which they have not been done. I will explain it to some 
extent in my remarks. When a serious study is available, we will be 
able to make an informed decision. But so far, the Minister of the 
Environment and his colleagues have not provided any real reason 
or hard facts in support of their claim.
<P>
	At this stage of the debate on Bill C-29, the government has yet 
to demonstrate the need for such legislation or its merits, which 
suggests to us that the real reasons for wanting this bill passed are 
of a purely commercial and electoral nature.
<P>
	Like his predecessor, the Minister of the Environment is 
favouring corn producers in western Canada and especially those in 
Ontario. By banning MMT, whose sole producer is Ethyl, the 
minister is ensuring that the only alternative to MMT will be 
ethanol, since fuel without additives is not foreseeable in the short 
and medium term.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	For the Minister of the Environment like for Machiavelli's main 
character in <I>The Prince</I>, the end justifies the means. It has been 
clear to us for quite a while already that the minister really cares 
much less than he says about the environment and the health of 
Canadians and cares much more about pleasing western and 
Ontario corn producers, who he hopes will vote Liberal in the next 
election.
<P>
	Ignoring every recommendation made by his colleagues in this 
House, not only Bloc Quebecois and Reform Party members, but 
also the Minister for International Trade, the Minister of the 
Environment continues crusading against MMT, but we must 
recognize that he has a very small army behind him.
<P>
	To achieve his end, he is prepared to sacrifice millions of dollars 
in financial compensation to Ethyl, an American company, which 
filed notice, on September 10, to claim $276 million Canadian in 
damages from the Canadian government for presumably breaching 
the provisions of NAFTA. While his government boasts about 
making job creation its number one priority-they said it over and 
over during the weekend-the minister is prepared to sacrifice jobs 
in the oil industry.
<P>
	He would even go as far as to subject Canadians to yet another 
hike in the price of gas. Of course, nothing is too costly when one 
wants to please a lobby.
<P>
	Despite all opposition, the environment minister and the Liberal 
government will probably get Bill C-29 passed. However, the 
government's modus operandi  regarding this issue confirms once 
again the lack of judgment of some of its members.
<P>
	When will the Liberal government finally act in a responsible 
and serious manner, as we have been asking, since, once again, the 
government's action does not make sense.
<P>
	We tried to put three short questions to the government. Why 
prohibit a product which, in the opinion of Health Canada, does not 
pose any risk to the health of Canadians? Unless I am mistaken, 
Health Canada is a Canadian organization. As I said about 
Statistics Canada in another speech, if the government is not 
pleased, it simply removes the chairperson and replaces him or her.
<P>
	Why prohibit the importation and interprovincial trade of such a 
product, rather than its production and use? If it is so harmful to 
one's health, then we should prohibit its production and use.
<P>
	Why violate a trade agreement which we duly signed and run the 
risk of having to pay a compensation of $276 million Canadian, if 
not more? These are the same Liberals that used to be passionate 
about free trade agreements. Historically, Liberals have been free 
traders and they should know free trade agreements very well, or at 
least respect them.
<P>
	These are the three short questions the environment minister and 
his colleagues should have answered in earlier speeches. But they 
did not do so, first because there is no rational answer to these 
questions, but also because, once again, they simply do as they 
please. The Liberal government does not care at all about the 
opinion of Canadians, who protested in large numbers against Bill 
C-29. As with many other issues, the government turns a deaf ear.
<P>
	This is a shame. In its present form, Bill C-29 is inappropriate 
and we have a duty, as members representing Quebecers and 
Canadians, to oppose this legislation. A number of stakeholders 
from various areas, including six provincial governments, 
vigorously oppose Bill C-29. I join my voice to theirs to invite all 
members of Parliament, including Liberals, to vote against this 
legislation.
<P>
	The government must do its homework and table a proper and 
rigorous bill.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to table an amendment to the amendment 
of the Reform Party to Bill C-29. I propose, seconded by the hon. 
member for Laurentides:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``and particularly, the impact of the said Bill on trade between Canada and the United 
States''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, the amendment to the 
amendment is in order. We will therefore continue debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5722"> 5722 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to say a few words today about the 
amendment to Bill C-29 which was recently put forward by my 
colleague from Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The intent of the amendment is to delay the passage of the bill. In 
other words, that it not be read a third time until the government 
adequately addresses the pending import prohibition on certain 
manganese based substances and the impact of that on our free 
trade agreements which currently exist. The Reform Party clearly 
sees a problem with that.
<P>
	I would like to begin my comments by referring to some key 
facts about MMT. I noticed there have been a lot of suppositions 
put forward from both sides of the House during this debate and a 
lot of innuendo flowing in this place about this subject.
<P>
	MMT is a gasoline fuel additive which boosts octane in gasoline 
and increases the efficiency of gasoline production. MMT has been 
used in almost all Canadian unleaded gasolines since 1977. 
Canadian motorists have travelled more than an estimated trillion 
kilometres using gasoline treated with MMT. MMT is the only 
available gasoline additive in Canada that is capable of reducing 
nitrogen oxide emissions, NOx, by as much as 20 per cent.
<P>
	Removing MMT from gasoline will increase nitrogen oxide 
emissions. Nitrogen oxide emissions cause urban smog. A ban on 
MMT would have the equivalent effect of adding 1 million cars to 
Canadian roads by the year 2000.
<P>
	Two recent studies have concluded that the removal of MMT 
would increase Canadian nitrogen oxide emissions by 50,000 to 
60,000 tonnes annually. This would violate Canada's international 
treaty agreement signed in Montreal in 1988 promising to freeze 
nitrogen oxide emissions at the 1987 level.
<P>
	Test results from the Environmental Protection Agency in the 
United States, the largest approved fuel additives testing program 
in history, demonstrate clearly that contrary to claims by the Motor 
Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, MMT in Canadian gasoline is 
fully compatible with new on board diagnostic systems.
<P>
	Automakers have experienced significant difficulties with the 
certification of on board diagnostic systems in the United States 
and the U.S. EPA has stated in the federal register that automobile 
manufacturers have expressed and demonstrated difficulty in 
complying with every aspect of the OBD requirements and that 
such difficulty appears likely to continue into 1996 and 1997 model 
years.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The United States EPA and the California Air Resources Board 
have recently changed their regulations to allow for certification of 
vehicles that do not comply with OBD-II requirements.
<P>
	Often in this debate the talk is about automobile emissions but 
no one on the other side of the House talks about the emissions 
from the refineries during the production of gasoline. MMT allows 
Canadian refiners to use less intensive refining thereby decreasing 
refinery emissions of carbon dioxide as well as nitrogen oxide and 
sulphur dioxide. It also enables refiners to reduce the aromatic 
content of gasoline which reduces emissions of benzene. I just add 
that for clarification to the viewing public.
<P>
	A lot of facts have been presented to parliamentarians from all 
parties on this subject. Sometimes it seems that the debate, as was 
referred to by my hon. colleague when he presented his 
amendment, often strays quite a bit from the intent of the bill or 
what the bill actually does. What the bill does is it places a ban on 
the interprovincial transport or the international importation of the 
product MMT. That is all it does.
<P>
	It is said that if we do not do this that possibly it will be harmful 
or that it will be potentially harmful, or that it will potentially gum 
up the onboard diagnostic systems of new automobiles. In their 
speeches hon. members across the way have used words such as 
``maybe'' and ``might''. If we are going to base the requirement of 
legislation on the hypothetical, which is what we are doing with 
this piece of legislation, then I will pose a hypothetical question 
myself.
<P>
	If we in this place are going to ban products in Canada, which is 
what is going to be accomplished with this ban on the 
transportation of MMT, every time we think there is a potential for 
harm, how many lawsuits will the Government of Canada have to 
face? Ultimately how many millions of dollars will the taxpayers 
of Canada have to pay just because we feel there is some potential 
for a problem down the road? That is the thrust of what I wish to 
add to the debate today.
<P>
	Everyone in the riding I represent is well aware that I have 
spoken a number of times on this subject over the last year and a 
half as have many colleagues on both sides of the House. The point 
was made recently that members from both sides are reaching the 
point of exhaustion on this subject. I do not know how much more 
can be said about it.
<P>
	That is why we are continually concerned that no matter how 
many points are made on the side opposing this piece of legislation, 
we see that C-94, which was put forward in the previous session of 
Parliament, has been brought back to the House as Bill C-29 which 
we are debating today. We find that no amendments were made, 
despite all of the debate in this place and all of the points  raised on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5723"> 5723 </A></B>
<P>
the part of opposition members of Parliament who tried to bring to 
the attention of the government the very real concerns out there and 
the economic impact this is going to have on industry and jobs.
<P>
	The government says it is concerned about jobs and the 
continuing high number of unemployed and underemployed in this 
country of ours. Yet this government has brought in this piece of 
legislation unamended from the previous session. It is in virtually 
the same state as it was when Parliament prorogued in January of 
this year.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I have to question what we are doing in this place. We bring 
forward points which are then ignored with no reference and 
legislation is continually forced through this House of Commons 
because one party enjoys a majority. It really brings into question 
the whole issue of how Canada is governed and what effect and 
impact debate in this Chamber ultimately has upon legislation.
<P>
	With that, I will close. Of course, as the seconder of the 
amendment I am in total support of it. This government must 
properly address the concern which, as my hon. colleague noted, 
was raised in a letter from the hon. Minister for International Trade 
to his counterpart, the Minister of the Environment some time ago, 
about what impact this legislation will have on our trading partners 
and how they view our commitment to the free trade agreement. 
Until that is properly done and until the study is completed, this bill 
should be set aside.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Before 
continuing, I would just like to remind members that the debate is 
now on the subamendment of the official opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is an honour for me to rise in this House and speak to Bill C-29, 
which seeks to prohibit the use of manganese based products in 
leaded gasoline in Canada. It goes about it very indirectly, by 
prohibiting interprovincial trade and importation from the United 
States, where the product is manufactured by Ethyl Corporation.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is therefore to prohibit the use of 
manganese based products in leaded gasoline. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois are opposed to this bill, in its present form anyway, for a 
number of reasons.
<P>
	First of all, it is interesting to note the emphasis of government 
officials on the risk to the environment of products such as MMT. 
You may have noticed that the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Agriculture spent almost eight minutes of his ten 
minute speech speaking about the risks and dangers of this additive 
in leaded gasoline, when this is simply not true. Nowhere in North 
America has it been shown that the use of manganese based 
substances in leaded gasoline is dangerous to the environment. 
There is not a shred of evidence.
<P>
	Furthermore, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has 
already argued to have this product banned in gasoline, saying that 
it was a risk to the environment, when this is not the case. Agency 
spokespersons have not been able to prove it. And not only is it not 
dangerous for the environment, but, if this product is now 
prohibited in leaded gasoline, then there really is a risk of creating 
a problem for the environment. According to studies, this 
manganese based product reduces emissions of nitrogen oxide that 
creates the greenhouse effect. This is a dangerous gas that is 
harmful to the environment. It creates a greenhouse effect, with 
disastrous consequences that, in some cases, are even world wide 
in scope.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	By banning the use of manganese-based products in leaded gas, 
we run the risk of increasing the greenhouse effect. Emissions of 
nitrogen oxide may increase by as much as 20 per cent. The 
government or its representatives cannot truthfully say they want to 
ban the use of products like MMT because they are harmful to the 
environment. The evidence proves the exact opposite is true.
<P>
	For instance, we are told that MMT may cause problems for car 
owners because it may lead to deterioration of the exhaust system, 
which is also clearly unfounded. There is no real reason, no 
sensible reason for reaching that conclusion.
<P>
	This product does not create a specific hazard for cars, but in 
addition, if MMT is removed from leaded gas, this may actually 
increase the price of cars and the price of gas and also have a rather 
negative impact on the oil companies, especially in Quebec, 
because they will have to change their equipment as a result of the 
ban on MMT. This bill, which aims to ban the use of 
manganese-based products in leaded gas, has a whole series of 
negative effects.
<P>
	Why should the government want to pass a bill, and ulterior 
motives are a factor, by banning not the product itself, because it is 
not in itself harmful, but the interprovincial trade in or importation 
from the United States of the product? Why does the Liberal 
government insist on doing so, although there is every indication 
that not only would this be harmful to the environment but it would 
also have a negative impact on the entire oil industry and the 
automotive industry in Canada, in addition to the loss of jobs?
<P>
	Banning interprovincial trade in this product constitutes an 
intrusion in provincial jurisdictions. That is why six provinces are 
opposed to this bill. I repeat, this constitutes a federal intrusion in a 
provincial jurisdiction. Banning the importation of this product 
from the United States may put Canada in a very uncomfortable  
position with the U.S., because that would violate NAFTA. If this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5724"> 5724 </A></B>
<P>
bill is passed, Canada will be sued for damages to the tune of $200 
or $300 million. Considering the current deficit, this is no time for 
the government to open the door to legal action.
<P>
	So why is the government so stubborn, despite all the negative 
effects this bill may have on the environment and the automotive 
and petroleum industries, despite the predicted loss of jobs and 
possible legal action by the United States and the provinces? I will 
tell you why. The reason is they have decided to create an ethanol 
industry in Ontario, to create jobs in Ontario at the expense of the 
other provinces, at the expense of Quebec and at the expense of the 
entire country.
<P>
	Sure, the government has the power, and so it can go ahead and 
develop an industry that is not harmful as such, and I certainly 
agree there is something to say for the production of ethanol and 
the use of this product as an additive to unleaded gas. It could be a 
bonus for farmers.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	But doing it in such a roundabout way reminds me, as a 
Quebecer, of the Borden line, of how the federal government in 
1963 managed to move most of the oil refineries into Ontario 
through a similarly roundabout approach. Montreal lost four out of 
six, no wonder Montreal is badly off. In those same years, in 1965, 
the government managed to concentrate the entire automotive 
industry in Ontario. You will not that Quebec has virtually no 
automobile industry. It is all in Ontario.
<P>
	These unfortunate examples demonstrate how, once again, this 
Liberal government is attempting to concentrate its efforts on 
Ontario, despite the fact that there are a number of reasons not to do 
so, as in the case for Bill C-29.
<P>
	It is patently obvious that removal of this product as an additive 
to unleaded gasoline will have a strong negative impact on the 
environment, on the automotive industry, on the petroleum 
industry. It can mean job losses, and a lot of hassle for the 
government in the form of lawsuits from the U.S. and the other 
provinces. This is, in my opinion, bad politics, and is the reason 
why we in the Bloc are opposed to Bill C-29, at least as it stands at 
present.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today at third reading of Bill C-29, an act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial 
purposes of certain manganese-based substances.
<P>
	This bill has been debated in this House for quite some time, 
having been introduced as Bill C-94 during the previous session. 
Although it survived a challenge to the Liberal government's work 
when the House was prorogued last winter, this bill is the perfect 
example of  the absurdity and lack of logic guiding cabinet, and 
especially its leader's lack of rigour.
<P>
	As I pointed out, the government allowed dozens of bills to die 
on the Order Paper when the House was prorogued. Yet, Bill C-94 
survived to become Bill C-29. This is totally absurd. Enough 
pressure was exerted during the first session for the government to 
abandon this bill, which, in fact, does not in any way respond to the 
concerns of the industry, the public, or the various interest groups.
<P>
	This bill is highly controversial in form as well as content. As far 
as form is concerned, the government may be using the noble 
precepts of public health and environmental protection to pass a 
bill that will benefit only the ethanol industry. I will get back to this 
outrageous aspect of the bill a little later at the end of my speech.
<P>
	First, I would like to go back to the substance of Bill C-29, 
whose main purpose is to ban the addition of MMT to unleaded 
gasoline. I find it unacceptable for the party in power to be 
shamelessly spending taxpayers' money in order to pass a bill that 
not only does not respond to public concerns, but also knowingly 
creates a conflict situation in which Canada could be sued for close 
to $300 million under NAFTA.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The situation is quite simple. The government and the 
automotive industry want MMT banned as a fuel additive because 
MMT may impair the operation of emission control devices. It 
does nothing of the kind, at least not according to American, 
Canadian and European scientific studies published to date. There 
is no legislation attesting to the harmfulness of MMT as a fuel 
additive.
<P>
	This goes to show that there must be more obscure and possibly 
more partisan reasons pushing the government to have this bill 
passed, even though the Prime Minister boasts about not having 
been involved in any scandal.
<P>
	Let me explain briefly the basis for my remarks. This move to 
ban the importation of MMT, and especially its trade, has more to 
do with protectionism than with the public interest, unless it is 
merely motivated by financial consideration or else support for and 
contributions to the Liberal Party's election fund. Personally, I 
have no problem endorsing this view, given the very real 
motivation the former Minister of the Environment may have, 
benefits the current incumbent may also be entitled to, incidentally.
<P>
	They are using scare tactics in saying that adding manganese to 
fuel is harmful to our health and to the environment. In this respect, 
the U.S. Court of Appeal has ruled against banning MMT, because 
it was not established that MMT presented a public health risk.
<P>
	Incidentally, our American neighbours are much more cautious 
than us when dealing with environmental issues.  Therefore, if the 
U.S. court of appeal ruled, as regards EPA's challenge concerning 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5725"> 5725 </A></B>
<P>
MMT, that the use of this product cannot not be prohibited in the 
United States, I fail to see why we should prohibit it here in 
Canada.
<P>
	Even the EPA, which is well-known in my riding of Frontenac 
because of the asbestos dispute, made no attempt to challenge this 
ruling, since the evidence to support such a move is so weak and 
disorganized. This suggests that such a restrictive measure under 
NAFTA can be supported by the industry providing the substitute, 
namely ethanol. The automotive industry is also involved in this 
attempt to prohibit MMT, even though it does not lead the group 
lobbying the Liberal caucus.
<P>
	One wonders about the principles and especially the integrity of 
some cabinet members, given that the former environment minister 
is from a region that produces ethanol, while the current minister is 
also from Ontario. Indeed, one wonders about the real motives of 
the environment minister. Obviously, an industry as rich as the 
ethanol industry can be very generous during an election campaign. 
We are all aware of current economic conditions.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	But there is more. We are at third reading of Bill C-29, whose 
impact is so major that it is now a source of dissension within the 
Liberal caucus. Bill C-29 directly contravenes several NAFTA 
provisions. Worse still, Canada faces a potential lawsuit that could 
reach close to $300 million. In fact, the Minister for International 
Trade has already told his colleague, the environment minister, 
about the peculiarity of this situation. Yet, nothing seems to detract 
the minister and his acolytes from their objective.
<P>
	Since my time is running out, I will conclude by stressing the 
danger, for Canadian Parliament, to pass Bill C-29. The official 
opposition will strongly oppose this legislation, so that, if it is not 
defeated it can at least be amended so as not to be implemented 
throughout the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
following on my colleague, I will speak today to Bill C-29, which 
the government attempts to sell with three main reasons.
<P>
	First of all, it comes right out and tells us that manganese 
represents a serious danger to public health. The second reason it 
gives is that it could result in extensive damage to antipollution 
systems in vehicles. The third reason it gives is that this bill 
provides an opportunity to harmonize our policies with those of the 
United States. These are the three reasons given for the bill.
<P>
	In my opinion, the government has only one real reason for 
introducing this bill. It is a question of protectionism. We know 
that the product that will  replace manganese is ethanol. This bill is 
an attempt to protect ethanol producers in Ontario and western 
Canada. This, in my view, is the real reason why the government 
has introduced this bill.
<P>
	We must not forget that in 1994 the then environment minister 
and the then health minister positioned themselves with respect to 
this bill. These two ministers put forward a development program 
designed to protect ethanol.
<P>
	Once you have a program, you are talking about money invested. 
This program has a 70 million dollar budget. There is no turning 
back; significant funds have been committed. Naturally, the major 
factories are going to be in Ontario and western Canada.
<P>
	However, the government is also forgetting that there are 
important social costs associated with this bill.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Considering the present economic situation, it would be 
irresponsible to ignore the additional costs that would result if this 
bill were passed. The petroleum industry mentioned that it would 
cost $7 million in Quebec alone to bring about the necessary 
changes. Imagine the millions of dollars it would take across 
Canada. And someone will have to pay for all this. In the end, it 
will be the gasoline consumer.
<P>
	The petroleum industry tells us that automatically, people will be 
laid off. Today, with the level of unemployment we have in Canada, 
we cannot afford to let any industry proceed with lay-offs. The 
order of the day should as follows: put people back to work and let 
them feel proud of themselves once again. We cannot afford 
lay-offs in this industry.
<P>
	And what about damages of $275 million being sought by Ethyl 
Corporation, an American company that produces manganese? 
This company alleges that NAFTA has been violated. Do we have 
so much money in this country that we can afford to take this 
lightly? Has the Minister of the Environment consulted his legal 
advisors? At a time when the government is making cuts in social 
programs and health care, this is a very serious matter. If the 
government is in such a hurry to spend its money, I suggest it 
consider how many jobs it could create with that money.
<P>
	The House will agree that if this bill is passed, it will be a very 
expensive proposition. So it is rather irresponsible to go ahead with 
this bill. Furthermore, the government should take the advice of the 
provinces and act on that advice. Of course we all know the federal 
government has no respect for the provinces. This has been a long 
standing rendition.
<P>
	And in this bill, the government is true to form. We all know that 
six provinces out of ten vehemently oppose this bill. They are 
calling for nothing less than its rejection. Interprovincial trade is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5726"> 5726 </A></B>
<P>
threatened, so the  provinces have some say in the matter. However, 
as we all know, the government's attitude is centralist.
<P>
	In committee and on second reading, we in the Bloc Quebecois 
tried to have this bill postponed. We urged the government to wait 
until various studies had been concluded before making a decision, 
and to consult those who had something to say about the bill and to 
listen to these people. That is how important the matter is.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	We do not need the kind of consultations we had with the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans a few months ago, who did not 
take the process seriously.
<P>
	I think that the impact on health and the environment is too 
serious for us to accept this bill. The minister should go back to the 
drawing board, let more people have their say and also wait until all 
the studies are in before coming back with a new bill. That is why 
the Bloc Quebecois will vote against this bill on third reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Madam 
Speaker, had the Government members accepted the wise 
amendment proposed by my colleague for Laurentides a while ago, 
we would no longer be involved in this debate, or at least not for a 
while.
<P>
	In the light of the scientific data available in this sector, it 
seemed obvious that we were lacking certain fundamental 
information before going ahead with adoption of this bill. Despite 
the fact that the government has not called for such scientific 
studies, it is determined to move ahead, thus placing the opposition 
parties in the position of having to vote against it, despite the fact 
that the initial positions, at least as far as the Bloc is concerned, 
were not so black and white. We were saying that we were not 
categorically against the use of MMT, but did believe that scientific 
proof was lacking, and it seemed only logical to demand such proof 
before going any further. That, unfortunately, proved impossible.
<P>
	It must be understood that the MMT being referred to is, quite 
simply, an additive in the production of gasoline for cars. The 
refineries use additives to raise the octane level. Lead is an additive 
and, in its case, there was proof some time ago that it was a health 
hazard. The refineries therefore replaced lead with another 
additive: manganese or MMT.
<P>
	It is hard to understand the government position, since there are 
studies underway at this time, preliminary ones at least. The first 
outcomes of these are not as alarmist as the government would 
have it. The government is not basing its alarmism on any scientific 
study whatsoever.
<P>
	In the first part of this debate, the government side was often 
heard saying: ``If we continue to use MMT, Canada will be a 
minority of one, for Europe is not using it.'' Why is it not in use in 
Europe? Simply because they are still making lead-based gasoline. 
Two additives are not necessary, only one, and since Europe has not 
yet got  rid of lead in its gasoline, naturally it is not using MMT. 
The day that it does get rid of lead, however, European companies 
may be forced to start using MMT, unless some other product is 
discovered.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The oil companies are not dead set against MMT. They are 
simply asking for proof that it is harmful to people's health and the 
environment. Bill C-29 is really anachronistic because not only is it 
not founded on demonstrable data, but it is also out of sync with the 
times.
<P>
	What does Bill C-29 do? It does not ban the use of MMT, but its 
importation. Let us keep in mind that, not too long ago, the 
Canadian government and the U.S. administration signed a free 
trade agreement specifically aimed at eliminating trade barriers 
between the two countries. Mexico joined the treaty a little later. So 
banning the importation of MMT goes against the spirit, at least, of 
the free trade agreement with the U.S.
<P>
	But Bill C-29 is also anachronistic for another reason. When we 
signed the free trade deal with the U.S. a few years ago, the 
Canadian government stated that, once the problem of liberalizing 
trade between Canada and the U.S. was settled, interprovincial 
trade barriers should come down. So what does Bill C-29 do? It 
bans interprovincial trade in MMT. Second anachronistic element: 
it recreates a barrier after such vigorous condemnation of 
interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	Finally, since this bill seems somewhat strange and violates the 
international and interprovincial rules we gave ourselves, why does 
the government insist on going ahead? It gave us two reasons. It 
claims that MMT is harmful to people's health. If that were true, it 
could have-with or without this bill-added MMT to the list of 
toxic products, and that would have been the end of it. But that is 
not what it did.
<P>
	It also claims that it is harmful to the environment based on a 
ruling by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which did 
ban the use of MMT at one point. However, this ruling was 
appealed, and the agency lost its case. In some American states, the 
use of MMT has become acceptable again.
<P>
	Not only have the health and environmental reasons not been 
clearly demonstrated, but according to Ethyl Corporation, which 
produces MMT, eliminating this product would increase nitrous 
oxide emissions by close to 20 per cent, which, of course, would 
have a disastrous impact on the environment and therefore on 
Canadians' health.
<P>
	If not for health or environmental reasons, why would the 
government insist on going ahead? We think that the government 
was pressured by two lobby groups. First, the auto industry, which 
claims, without ever having proven it, that the use of MMT would 
adversely affect antipollution devices.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5727"> 5727 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	But it has never been demonstrated that it was. Instead of 
substantiating its claim, it took the much easier route of simply 
asking the government to prohibit the interprovincial trade in and 
importation of the product, making it a non-issue.
<P>
	The second lobby that probably got involved is that of an 
emerging industry, namely the ethanol industry. I am not saying 
that there is something wrong with using ethanol. What I am saying 
at this time is that, with the science available, we are probably not 
in a position to safely assume that replacing MMT with another 
additive like ethanol will not create other problems. We would, of 
course, have to see what goes into producing ethanol. If it is 
derived from grains, then we can argue that pesticides and chemical 
fertilizers may have been used, for instance. If it is made out of 
wood chips, there would be another problem.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will remain opposed to 
Bill C-29.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill 
C-29 the this government is set to pass exemplifies its ad hoc 
approach to environmental management. Indeed, Bill C-29 has 
been introduced at a time when nothing has been clearly 
established, when the so-called scientific opinion is divided.
<P>
	As we know, the scientific approach is based on rigour, critical 
thinking, analysis, precision and objectivity. The least we can say 
in this case is that Bill C-29 is based on considerations of interest 
instead of reason.
<P>
	What is this bill all about? Bill C-29 prohibits the commercial 
use of MMT, which is, as we know, a manganese-based substance 
added to unleaded gasoline to increase its octane level, thereby 
making car engines more efficient. The bill also regulates the 
interprovincial trade in and importation for commercial purposes 
of certain manganese-based substances.
<P>
	At this stage of the debate, we must recognize that there is water 
in the gas line. Opinions are in fact mixed on the relevance of 
prohibiting or allowing the use of MMT. Some, like the Minister of 
the Environment and his predecessor, are for banning 
manganese-based products because they suspect MMT of being a 
health risk and impairing the operation emission control systems 
on cars.
<P>
	At the time of this bill's tabling, they also wanted this bill passed 
to harmonize Canadian legislation with that of other countries, the 
U.S. in particular. As for Ethyl Corporation, the only company 
producing and exporting MMT to Canada, it believes that, on the 
contrary, the use of MMT results in a decrease of up to 20 per cent 
of emissions of nitrogen oxides harmful to the environment. These 
emissions are responsible for urban smog.
<P>
	As for auto makers, they claim manganese adversely affects the 
smooth functioning of new antipollution devices in cars. To this, 
those who support the use of MMT reply that the findings of 
scientific studies on this issue are contradictory and that the 
problems are due primarily to other factors.
<P>
	Oil companies now support the use of additives. According to 
them, manganese reduces the consumption of crude oil, increases 
the octane levels in gasoline, improves engine performance and 
reduces polluting emissions. We also know that ethanol could 
become a substitute for manganese. The ethanol industry is located 
in western Canada and in Ontario, primarily in the region 
represented by the Deputy Prime Minister, which would therefore 
benefit from another market.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	This is where the problem lies. Remember the announcement 
made last year by the former environment minister and Deputy 
Prime Minister about a $70 million investment program to develop 
ethanol. We are going full speed with nothing to guide us, except 
the interests of some. Beyond the diverging opinions and studies, 
some facts remain.
<P>
	In 1994, the health department conducted a review of these 
issues. The conclusions reached by Health Canada stress that 
exposure to manganese does not pose a threat to the health of 
Canadians and Quebecers. In fact, had the results been different 
and had MMT been proven to be toxic, Health Canada would have 
prohibited its use. And, given the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, we would not be here debating Bill C-29. 
Everything would have been just fine.
<P>
	Second, everyone, including those who oppose the use of MMT, 
agree that this product helps reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, 
even though results of studies may vary. Some talk about a 20 per 
cent reduction, while others say it is 5 per cent. According to others 
still, prohibiting the use of MMT could trigger an increase in 
emissions of nitrogen oxides equivalent to having one million 
additional cars on the road by the year 2000. Who is right? Which 
of these estimates is correct? We still do not know.
<P>
	Third, this bill will generate costs of several million dollars. It 
will, among others, result in enormous costs to the oil industry, 
which will have to start making gasoline free of MMT. Once again, 
consumers and taxpayers will be footing most of the bill.
<P>
	Finally, there is another factor of no small importance 
concerning the development of the situation in the United States. A 
November 1995 ruling by the District of Columbia Court of Appeal 
recognized that MMT was not harmful to health or to antipollution 
systems in vehicles. Because of this ruling, MMT can be 
reintroduced in the United States.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5728"> 5728 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment and his predecessor have thus 
been deprived of one of their main arguments, harmonization with 
U.S. policy. Now that MMT has been authorized in the United 
States, Bill C-29, prohibiting its importation, will constitute a 
unjustified protectionist measure, contrary to the free circulation 
of goods, the cornerstone of NAFTA. For it is indeed the 
importation of and interprovincial trade in MMT that is the focus 
of Bill C-29.
<P>
	Thus, Bill C-29 will allow national production of MMT and its 
sale and use within a province. If this product is as harmful as the 
government claims, why authorize it? The policy is obviously 
inconsistent.
<P>
	By prohibiting international and domestic trade, the government 
is contravening NAFTA and once again trampling on provincial 
jurisdiction. Despite the Minister for International Trade's warning 
to the Minister of the Environment last February, the latter is 
pushing ahead with Bill C-29. The result is that, last September 10, 
Ethyl Corporation in the United States issued a notice of its 
intention to file a complaint under the Free Trade Agreement and to 
seek compensation from the Canadian government of, get ready, 
almost $300 million, money that may be thrown out the window 
because of the pigheadedness we are seeing.
<P>
	While the Liberal government is slashing budgets as never 
before, it is knowingly gambling with the public purse. This is not 
right. At the very least, government members should think about 
what they are doing and put a bit of manganese or ethanol into their 
arguments, in order to boost their credibility rating.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to comment on another aspect of this bill. 
Unintentionally, I imagine, the member for York-Simcoe, in a 
speech in November 1995, gave the Bloc Quebecois another reason 
to be critical of the inflexibility of Canadian federalism.
<P>
	Commenting on an American court ruling in favour of MMT, the 
member for York-Simcoe said, and I quote: ``30 per cent of the 
United States will continue with the ban on the use of MMT in 
fuel''.
<P>
	In Canada, the federal government alone decides what additives 
will be allowed in gasoline. Despite strong opposition by six 
provinces to Bill C-29, the Minister of the Environment has his 
mind made up and is refusing to listen to his provincial 
counterparts. In a country that claims to be the most decentralized 
in the world and in light of the supposedly new flexible 
federalism-Plan C, you never know-this attitude is astonishing.
<P>
	The reasons given by the environment minister for banning the 
importation of MMT no longer stand up. Whether for reasons of 
health, damage to antipollution systems, environmental issues, or 
harmonization of Canadian and U.S. policies, Bill C-29 fails on all 
counts.
<P>
	The current debate proves that there are a number of questions 
outstanding. But the federal government is charging full steam 
ahead, preferring expediency to any serious logic. There is no 
doubt that this government is running on empty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would permit questions except we are running a 
little short. What I propose to do is take that very first question 
from the government whip right after question period. He will be 
the first one I go to. I could not afford to not go there.

for that small first step in order to begin. Yet such as step is there 
for the taking.
<P>
	This week marks the fifth anniversary of Israeli airman Ron 
Arad's joining the ranks of soldiers missing in action. He is not 
alone. There are a host of other MIAs who have been awaiting 
release since 1982. Their families have been calling for their 
liberation but to little avail.
<P>
	It is time that their captors heeded the expressions of concern on 
their behalf forwarded by the global community and, in particular, 
by Canada. On a humanitarian basis, their release is long overdue. 
Moreover, such action would contribute substantially to peace 
initiatives since the release of MIAs would represent a powerful 
confidence building measure.
<P>
	From a social and political perspective the return of MIAs makes 
sense. Canada should generate a chorus of like minded countries to 
urge Iran, Syria and others capable of affecting the repatriation of 
MIAs to act without delay.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
delegates at the national Liberal convention held in Ottawa this 
past weekend have achieved a consensus on a number of important 
issues.
<P>
	It should be noted that our government's deficit reduction 
strategy has received overwhelming endorsement from convention 
delegates. Diversion tactics such as tax reductions, as attractive as 
they may be in the short term, would jeopardize the government's 
fiscal health.
<P>
	Liberals from all over the country have chosen to support a 
strategy that will lead to the complete elimination of the deficit by 
the turn of this century. That is how we will ensure job creation, 
sustainable social programs and real economic recovery.

	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this past weekend Liberal delegates from across Canada 
assembled in Ottawa for the 1996 biennial convention. Convention 
delegates were united in their support and encouraged the 
government to stay the course for continued success in deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	The government is on track to meet or better its deficit target of 
$24.3 billion or 3 per cent of GDP this current year; $17 billion in 
1997-98 and in 1998-99 the deficit target is $9 billion or 
approximately 1 per cent of GDP. This means it will no longer need 
to go to the financial markets for new borrowing requirements.
<P>
	Interest rates are as low as they have been in 30 years. Inflation 
is under control and the government's number one priority of job 
creation is working as business and industry create thousands of 
new jobs across Canada.

	We will be faced with new challenges that we will accept and 
overcome as we have to date while building a better tomorrow for 
all Canadians.

Speaker, in their typically arrogant way, last weekend, the Liberals 
wrote their own report card on their so-called brilliant performance 
since the Grits' return to Ottawa.
<P>
	The Liberals gave themselves a score of 78 per cent, after getting 
elected on a platform of jobs, jobs, jobs and doing nothing since; 
after promising in 1993 to abolish the GST and finding nothing 
better to do than have the Deputy Prime Minister temporarily 
resign and then apologize for having failed to fulfil their

	One year to the day after the Quebec referendum, there is no

At their convention over the weekend, the Liberals swept aside the

being one of the key elements in ensuring we can eliminate

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THECONSTITUTION">THE CONSTITUTION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not comment. The Liberal convention was pretty 
rough this weekend. I will not go further than that, in order to stay 
within the rules.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has spent the past few days applauding his 
own performance as Prime Minister. He even said that he had done 
enough for Quebec, as far as his referendum promises were 
concerned.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
How can he explain the Prime Minister's statement about having 
done enough as far as his referendum commitments are concerned, 
when the majority of Quebecers are dissatisfied with his job, a 
majority which includes the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, the 
leader of the Conservative Party, and some of those who backed the 
Prime Minister in his referendum promises and now admit he has 
not delivered the goods?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has, through a resolution 
of this House, recognized the distinct character of Quebec. It has 
adopted legislation conferring regional vetoes. Since the throne 
speech, it has launched a vast program of reform, affecting areas as 
diverse as mines, forests, social housing, manpower, and social and 
economic union.
<P>
	This is a very significant reform, and we are still open to all truly 
concrete suggestions the opposition or any other political party in 
Canada might make to us with a view to pursuing our efforts to 
improve Canadian federation, which is already one of the best there 
is in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, before the minister starts calling for suggestions from 
anyone, I have one to make to him: let him just meet the 
commitments the Prime Minister has made to people. If the 
government met its commitments, this would already represent 
huge progress, in everybody's eyes. That is my suggestion to the 
minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said that, now the referendum is a thing 
of the past, it is no longer necessary to always be on the same 
wavelength, with the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party in 
particular. How, then, can the minister explain to us what he means 
in this statement, other than that, now that the promises have had 
their desired effect-winning-it is no longer important to follow 
up on them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental  Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, following up is what is important. That is what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5733"> 5733 </A></B>
<P>
Quebecers and other Canadians have done together since this 
federation was created, one of the best known countries in the 
world, not only for its quality of life, but also for its values of 
tolerance and openmindedness.
<P>
	What absolutely must not be followed up on, is the destructive 
project represented by the opposition. This is a project which 
would bring deep divisions, not just between Quebec and Canada, 
but between Quebecers themselves. Quebecers understand this, and 
the numbers turning away from this project represented by the 
opposition are increasing by leaps and bounds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to remind the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs that the circus is over now. He is no longer in the Liberal 
three-ring circus, but back in front of the House of Commons. 
People want answers, not dissertations on the meaning of the 
federation and of Canada and of continuation of the opposition's 
project. For heaven's sake. Let us have an answer then.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has once again tried to get the rest of Canada 
to swallow the idea that the Quebec question can be solved with a 
spoonful of sugar. Does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
realize that the Prime Minister's commitments of this weekend on 
the question of the distinct society within the Constitution are 
merely an illusion, an illusion which serves to mask the emptiness 
of their constitutional position?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, once again, what is the emptiness are we talking 
about, when we enjoy the finest quality of life in the world, one 
envied, by not just millions but billions of people who would dearly 
love to share our emptiness with us, that emptiness which 
Quebecers and other Canadians have worked together to build? 
Will they turn their backs on that to launch into a project fraught 
with uncertainty, a project that is ill-defined, a project that is aimed 
at division and not at the open-mindedness which Quebecers and 
other Canadians have within them and wish to preserve for 
themselves and their children?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here is 
the Prime Minister's new strategy: he has his party adopt a 
resolution on a vague concept of distinct society which he will trot 
out across the country, saying it means nothing to English Canada 
and means a lot to Quebec, and all this for the sole purpose of 
fostering illusions among the electorate. This is so vague, it is just 
playing for time by lulling people to sleep. It is just a way to save 
the ship once again until the next election.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs admit that this 
resolution on distinct society is just another way  to gain time and 
get through the next election without having to explain that they 
have done nothing and once again run an election campaign on the 
basis of so-called promises of change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, our federation is changing, it is changing for the better 
and in such a way that it will be able to provide Canadians with a 
better quality of life. It is changing because we now have the lowest 
interest rates ever, a low inflation rate, and we are creating jobs.
<P>
	It is changing in that it is clarifying the roles of various levels of 
government, to have a federal government that is strong in its 
particular jurisdictions and provincial governments that are strong 
in theirs, and a strong partnership between these two levels of 
government.
<P>
	This federation is also changing in that it recognizes the place of 
Quebec in the federation, through a resolution adopted in this 
House or as expressed in a resolution by the Liberal Party of 
Canada adopted on the weekend, whose purpose is to convince 
Canadians that recognition of Quebec in the Constitution would be 
one of the fundamental values of Canada, something Canadians 
could do in full confidence.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in that 
case, what explanation does the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs have for his comments on the weekend, when he said that a 
distinct society involves no concrete or specific powers for 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that was never mentioned. Does the hon. member 
know what Meech Lake said about this? ``Nothing in this section 
derogates from the powers, rights or privileges of Parliament or the 
Government of Canada, or of the legislatures or governments of the 
provinces, including any powers, rights or privileges relating to 
language''.
<P>
	Canadians in the other provinces would not be sending more 
power, money or privileges to Quebec but a joyous signal, a 
positive signal to show how much they want Quebecers to remain 
in Canada and, by their distinctness, be part of this great Canadian 
diversity.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister says that Liberals will have to fight arrogance, 
overspending, overconfidence and complacency.
<P>
	It is a losing battle. The unemployment rate is hovering around 
10 per cent and yet the Liberals claim that they have kept their 
promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. Just  in case we had any doubts, the 
Liberals now have sent out 1.4 million flyers entitled ``Integrity in

<HR>
<B><A NAME="5734"> 5734 </A></B>

This is arrogance in action, certainly not integrity.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. However, I am not sure 
who to ask over there today. Wasn't that a party? How can the 
Prime Minister even imagine that he has kept his promise on jobs, 
jobs, jobs?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the applause and the welcome. I hope I will get equal 
applause after my answer.
<P>
	The facts speak for themselves: since this government took 
office, more than 600,000 new jobs have been created; the 
unemployment rate has gone down by some 2 per cent. There is a 
lot more to do but we are going to do it because we are keeping and 
will continue to keep our commitment to help create jobs for 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
they talk about 600,000 jobs gained, they never seem to say how 
many hundred thousand jobs have been lost since this 
government's inaction.
<P>
	While we are on the topic of Liberal arrogance, let us take a look 
at the government's record on health care funding. Surely that 
answer will not be quite as easy.
<P>
	At the Liberal love-in over the weekend, the Prime Minister tried 
to downplay his government's cuts to medicare by saying that it 
was simply a squeeze. I do not know how he could call that a 
squeeze. It seems it was a choke hold with a body slam thrown in. 
The Canadian Medical Association-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not think I heard a question, but I know it is 
coming.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will hear it now. Will they admit 
that $3 billion of cuts in health care is hardly the Liberal way? Will 
they admit they have gone too far with their slashing? Will this 
government commit to putting more federal money back into 
health care, as it promised in the sixties?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is one for the record books. The party that wanted to wipe out 
medicare and privatize it is today calling for the preservation of 
medicare. I am glad its members realize the importance of it and 
have come around to supporting this key Liberal commitment.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, each 
hospital in this country that has empty beds should have a banner 
over it saying: ``This brought to you by the Liberal Government of 
Canada''. That is shameful.
<P>
	I am surprised the Prime Minister will not make any firm 
funding commitments because in his keynote speech on the 
weekend he seemed all too eager to get back to his free spending, 
big government Liberal roots.
<P>
	The real reason why the Prime Minister rejects any talk of tax 
relief is that he would rather spend taxes than cut taxes. The best 
way to create jobs in this country is to balance the budget and lower 
taxes through smaller government.
<P>
	Why will they not give Canadians some tax relief, not tax 
increases?. Why is it that Liberals always think a dollar in the 
hands of a bureaucrat or a politician does more good than a dollar 
in the hands of the Canadian taxpayer where it belongs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I can ask my hon. friend why the Reform Party always thinks that 
Canadians doing things together through government is worse than 
not working together to have a better country. Surely having a 
better country through a sound fiscal framework as well as 
government doing things for all Canadians is better than the 
Reform approach of slash, burn and destroy.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to Statistics Canada, since the Liberals took 
office in Ottawa, federal investments in Quebec have constantly 
been decreasing, going down from 19.7 per cent of total Canadian 
investments in 1993 to 15.4 per cent this year. Normally, Quebec 
should have been entitled to one quarter of federal investments.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister, who bragged this past weekend 
about what he had in store for Quebec, explain this decrease in 
federal investments in Quebec since he took office?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is making a somewhat selective use of 
data. The fact is we just announced a number of federal investment 
initiatives in Quebec, and particularly in Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	These include an investment announced last week in the 
aeronautical industry; an investment in the Mitel  plant, located in 
Bromont; an investment in the biotechnology institute, at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5735"> 5735 </A></B>
<P>
national research centre, and the maintaining of the space agency, 
among others.
<P>
	Given that almost 41 per cent of tax credits for research and 
development are claimed in Quebec, these sectors are well 
supported by the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did not get the meaning of my question. Since 
the Liberals took office, public investments in Quebec have 
decreased, in relation to the rest of the country. Federal investments 
have decreased in Quebec in the last three years. This is what we 
are saying.
<P>
	The Prime Minister tells us this is related to the bidding process. 
Maybe once or twice, but after 15 years one begins to wonder. This 
is systematic discrimination.
<P>
	This is what my supplementary is about. Does the Prime 
Minister or the Minister of Industry find it normal that, for the past 
15 years, again according to this recent study by Statistics Canada, 
federal investments in Quebec have accounted for only 16.4 per 
cent of federal spending, instead of 25 per cent, thus resulting in a 
shortfall of close to $4 billion for Quebec? This is a lot of money 
and a lot of jobs that the Liberal government, and its Conservative 
predecessor, deliberately refused to create in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am always disturbed by the representations made by 
regional parties in the House. They seem to believe that each 
investment should be equally divided among all the provinces.
<P>
	Does the hon. member think it would be better if the investment 
announced last Monday regarding Canadair were divided equally 
between all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Maybe he could explain that at the economic 
summit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Does he think all tax credits for research and 
development should be divided? Should all the networks of centres 
of excellence be divided fairly among the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> It would interesting to discuss this at the economic 
summit. For one thing, they like to get federal money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> To say that this idea was really not based on

<P>
	Here is the story. Disposable income is down $3,000 per family, 
1.4 million Canadians are out of work, another 1 million have 
stopped looking for work, 2 million are underemployed and one in 
four workers is worried about losing their job.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that his unwillingness to shrink

taxpayers and job creators is the real reason he and his government 
are failing to fulfil their promise to create jobs, jobs, jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

already stated we have created 700,000 jobs in the private sector.
<P>
	Let me read a commentary on the Reform Party's policy from 
Dr. Ruth Getter, chief economist of the Toronto Dominion Bank: 
``What the government has done with its restraint that it has put in 
place is really quite remarkable and we have got this kind of 
environment in the economy that is ready to take off. If at this point 
you say cut even more so you can cut taxes, it is not clear to me that

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The rapidly escalating conflict in eastern Zaire between Tutsi 
rebels and the Zairian army is on the point of culminating in a 
human catastrophe far worse than that in Rwanda in 1994. More 
than one million Rwandan refugees have been cut off, and 500,000 
of them are fleeing the country.
<P>
	With aid workers forced to leave the area and the planned airlift 
to rescue refugees in danger of being called off, can the minister 
give an update on the situation and indicate what his government 
intends to do to help avoid a repetition of the 1994 tragedy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I share the concerns expressed by the hon. member. As 
she says, it is a very serious problem. At this time, we are 
supporting the report by the U.N. Secretary General calling for 
diplomatic mediation efforts.
<P>
	The secretary of state for Latin America and Africa, Mrs. 
Stewart, is in Africa to attend a meeting of the coalition of African 
countries. She is representing Canada's position in favour of a 
peaceful solution.
<P>
	We are also ready to respond to requests for assistance from 
international organizations. There have been no requests to date, 
but we are ready to respond should any arise.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
American government recently tried to persuade African countries 
to set up a permanent force to come to the assistance of African 
civilians in the event of war. Although this suggestion has, for the 
time being, been given a chilly reception by African countries, does 
the minister intend to try to argue for the creation of such a force, 
which would be one way of helping to resolve the present crisis?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there have been some very good examples in the past few 
years of regional groupings of African countries coming together to 
organize peace forces.
<P>
	The proposal by Secretary Christopher is one that we have 
discussed directly with officials in the United States and with 
African countries.
<P>
	Again, we have indicated that we are prepared to assist if the 
African countries themselves agree to some kind of standby force 
or representation in the central African region. We have a number 
of ways in which we can support, through training and through the 
work of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre. At the present time we 
provide assistance to a number of institutes for conflict resolution 
and strategic studies in South Africa and Cairo. Others are engaged 
with the OAU.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	I certainly agree with the hon. member, if we could work out 
some way in which the African states themselves could respond. 
They have an economic boycott which in part has been successful. 
Clearly the situation in Zaire has the potential for a major disaster. 
Unless the international community responds with a degree of 
resolve unlike what we showed in Rwanda, we could be facing a 
very grave problem.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a cynical 
attempt to get elected, the Liberals promised in the red book not to 
withdraw from the health care field. The Prime Minister finally 
admitted this weekend that he had had to squeeze medicare.
<P>
	How does a squeeze of $3 billion a year to federal transfers for 
medicare reconcile with that Liberal red book promise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member ignores the fact that 
the health ministers of the provinces and territories of Canada had 
asked for a commitment from this government, a commitment 
which it made and lived up to, to stabilize funding and to give 
funding that people could address on a secured basis. They asked 
for a cash floor which is over $11 billion and with which they are 
extremely happy. They have stable funding for the next five years 
at an average of $26.1 billion, gradually to go higher by 1998.
<P>
	I think that is what the provinces and the territories were looking 
for in order to stabilize health care expenditures and health care 
systems. We delivered on that promise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary talks about stable funding but it is 
something from a stable that we got instead.
<P>
	Reform however has a fresh start on medicare. When the budget

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5737"> 5737 </A></B>
<P>
care and education by $4 billion.  That is not stable funding for 
medicare; that is increased funding for medicare.
<P>
	Simply put, will the Liberals take another page from the Reform 
Party platform and restore the funding for medicare?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we would take the member a little 
more seriously if he was not so interested in making light of the 
affair. If he had looked at what we have done in the last two 
budgets, he would already have seen that there is a provision for 
increasing spending by 1998. I wonder which page is taken out of 
whose book.
<P>
	I do not know how we are going to go on from the point that the 
member opposite is suggesting that first we slash the system so it 
cannot function and then we give it an injection of cash. We prefer 
a more responsible approach, the one we have outlined in budgets 
past and in the current budget. That is the right way and we are 
going to continue with that.

<P>
	Recently, the Minister had a meeting with Philips Electronic in 
the Netherlands to discuss investments this company might make 
in Canada. Meanwhile, Investment Canada and Polygram, a 
subsidiary of Philips, were negotiating the terms of Polygram's 
entry into the Canadian film distribution market. However, 
according to Canada's policy on the film industry, Polygram does 
not have the right to enter the Canadian market.
<P>
	In this context would the Minister of Industry not agree that he is 
sending a message to foreign investors that Canadian cultural 
policies are negotiable?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, this is an odd question. Does the hon. member think that 
the people of Quebec or the National Capital Region, or Edmonton, 
Vancouver or other parts of the country, if they could get about a 
billion dollars invested in the semi-conductor sector, would not 
want the Minister of Industry to approach companies that would be 
able to make that kind of investment? It is very important for us to 
attract investment.
<P>
	As for Polygram, I did not discuss the matter with Philips, and it 
was not on the agenda at our meeting.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, obviously we would never object to the billions of dollars 
of investments to which the minister refers, unless they are 
intended for his riding. We might have some questions in that case, 
but if they go anywhere else, they will be most welcome.
<P>
	However, one wonders why not the minister but Investment 
Canada is negotiating Polygram's entry on the Canadian film 
market, although it does not meet any of the requirements in this 
respect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, an application has been filed with Investment Canada. No 
decision has been made as yet, and I do not want to discuss the 
matter because the decision is still up to the minister.
<P>
	I may add, as I said in Bromont a few days ago, that there are 
probably five or six locations here in Canada where we have the 
industrial base for a semi-conductor industry. One was in Quebec, 
in Bromont.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member this: Is she not interested in the 
fact, on behalf of her party here in the House of Commons, the 
Canadian government is doing everything it can to try and find a 
base to create a genuine semi-conductor industry here in Canada? 
That is the real issue. They have no industrial policy other than 
asking for subsidies, as the hon. member did earlier. To us, it is 
more important to look for international investment.

all on a government credit card. Then she signed an expense form 
claiming that these expenses were ``incurred on official business''. 
The Prime Minister said this was only a small mistake and 
shrugged it off saying: ``She paid it back in weeks or days''.
<P>
	My question is about the guidelines on this issue. In the part 
where the guidelines give ministers permission to use government 
charge cards for personal use, how long do they have to pay it 
back? Is it interest free? Do they have to pay it back even if no one 
ever finds out?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

already answered that question last Thursday, and the answer 
remains the same: government travel cards should be used only for 
official government business. Whenever they are used for other 
purposes, all personal expenditures must be fully reimbursed. This 
is the case here, and I must point out that all but one payments was 
made even before the access to information request.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor has been consulted, and conversations 
have taken place with the member involved. As a result, all 
personal expenditures have been reimbursed. The hon. member has 
agreed not to use government credit cards in future for anything 
except government business.

	My question was on the guidelines. Are the guidelines on 
personal use of government credit cards clear? How long do 
ministers have to pay back personal expenses? Is it interest free? 
Do they have to always pay it back or only if somebody finds out 
about it? Those were my questions before and I still want answers.

<P>
	Last week, the Minister of National Defence made an excellent 
suggestion, when he said that General Boyle should not be singled 
out. We agree that his case should be the basis for a new policy of 
transparency, like the one adopted in Quebec, and that the minister 
should therefore release the amount of the generous separation 
payments made to General Boyle with taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Since he refuses to disclose the total amount awarded General 
Boyle in separation pay, will the minister at least tell us how much 
General Boyle has received in discretionary benefits from the 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
benefits and other amounts paid to individuals by the Government 
of Canada in such transactions represent personal, privileged 
information covered under the Privacy Act. This act clearly states 
that personal information must not be disclosed without the 
consent of the individual concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
remind the minister that this does not apply to discretionary

	I would also like to remind the minister that the government is 
using taxpayers' money to make these separation payments. What 
the people want and have the right to know is how much was paid 
to General Boyle.

the separation package paid to General Boyle?

the individual in question is still before the courts. This is certainly

<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are talking again about the accountability of the parole board, the 
bungling of its decisions. Harvey Milne was deemed to be a 
dangerous offender but this minister's handpicked parole board set 
him loose so he could again prey on young children.
<P>
	Canadians need a guarantee that this man will never again make 
victims of our children. Will the solicitor general move 
immediately so that repeat violent offenders are locked up for life 
with no parole?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of

	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to debate 
this motion. I have sent a letter to the Prime Minister, I have sent a 
copy to the government whip and I have talked to the nominee for 
the position of Acting Speaker.
<P>
	I made the Reform Party's position very clear on this. We are 
looking for an opportunity for the government to live up to its 
promises. I have nothing against the hon. member whose name has 
been put forward. We all know he knows the rules of the House as 
good as anyone. We all know in committee his reputation is to be 
fair and even-handed. We appreciate that.
<P>
	During the election campaign the Liberal Party campaigned on a 
red book promise. The nominee for the position of deputy speaker 
co-authored a paper that was quoted in the red book as the way 
things should be run here in the House of Commons. In that red 
book it says that two deputy speakers should be appointed from the 
opposition parties.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member will remember that report because it came on 
the heels of the 81st report of the Standing Committee on House 
Management, which was presented in the 34th Parliament in 1993. 
That report dealt with presiding officers. It also recommended that 
two deputy speakers be appointed from the opposition benches.
<P>
	During the last couple of days we have been subjected to the 
Prime Minister's tally of how many promises he actually kept. He 
says that he has kept 78 per cent of the promises. That is the same 
number which described the scratchy old records that the House 
leader may at one time have listened to.
<P>
	In the 1993 election 198 specific promises were made by the 
government. Government members say 197. Maybe this is the one 
they want to forget. They promised to reform the institution of 
Parliament. One of the reforms was that two of the deputy speakers 
would be appointed from the opposition benches.
<P>
	I do not have the years of experience which the hon. House 
leader has. He has been here for more than 30 years. The Prime 
Minister has been here for more than 30 years. The hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands, who has been nominated, has been 
here forever. He thinks he has been here forever, but he has been 
here for a good long time. The former whip of the party, now a 
minister of the crown, has been here for a long time. They all 
signed their names to the document which said  that two of the 
deputy speakers should be appointed from the opposition side of 
the House.
<P>
	We had the 81st report of the Standing Committee on House 
Management which was presented in the 34th Parliament. They 
were a part of that report. They took part in that debate. The 
suggestions were theirs. In that report they suggested that this is the 
way it should be done.
<P>
	During the weekend the Prime Minister said there were several 
promises which he has not yet been able to keep, but they are 
promises in progress. They will be completed at the earliest 
possible date.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Squeezed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> He will squeeze the truth out of them.
<P>
	This is not an ``if, and or but'' question. This is not a question of: 
I wonder what the Liberal Party meant? It is absolutely crystal clear 
that two deputy speakers should be appointed from the opposition 
benches.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands co-authored the report 
which suggested that should be the case. The Prime Minister signed 
the red book promise which said that will be the case. The Prime 
Minister said that he would honour the red book commitments 
which have not yet been completed as soon as possible. That was 
on the weekend. I was at the convention to hear that.
<P>
	The first opportunity to complete one of those promises is today. 
Today the government can say: ``We are about to complete more of 
our promises. Today is the day that we put our money where our 
mouth is''. What is it he said? We do not just talk the talk, we walk 
the walk. To use another analogy, this is where the rubber meets the 
road.
<P>
	Suddenly a position is open in the House of Commons. It is a 
very important position. Mr. Speaker, you had the best of health 
before they took your best of health away, in a sense. Your good 
right hand man is now the government whip. We appreciated his 
work in the Chair. We always supported his work, but he is no 
longer here. Now there is a vacancy.
<P>
	The symbolism of this comes down to the integrity of the Prime 
Minister, the promises made during the election and the promises 
made by the proposed deputy speaker. The hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands has a decision to make in the next few 
minutes or in the next few days. What is his response to a specific 
proposal that he himself proposed, that he himself endorsed, that he 
himself submitted as the red book position, the Liberal Party 
position on how deputy speakers should be appointed?
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	What the member for Kingston and the Islands said, and I know 
him to be an honourable man, was that the position should not go to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5742"> 5742 </A></B>
<P>
a government member. Those  are his words. It should not go to a 
government member. It should go to somebody on this side of the 
House.
<P>
	The conundrum facing the member for Kingston and the Islands 
now is a serious one. All of a sudden, talking the talk and walking 
the walk and doing what is right not only in Canadians' minds but 
following through on the promises made by the governing party, 
suddenly 24 hours after the Liberal convention is shut down we 
find out that promises are like the Prime Minister's imaginary 
friend, they do not really mean anything and they do not really 
exist.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the motion we are debating at this time is symbolic 
of the non-partisanship that you have shown toward this House. 
The position of deputy chairman is an extension of yourself. It is an 
opportunity, as the member for Kingston and the Islands 
recognized in his report, to show that your position, Mr. Speaker, is 
not partisan but is open to all members of the House. Not only that, 
it has been promised as kind of a balancing act to show that very 
thing.
<P>
	At the convention that I sat through on the weekend there were a 
lot of shoulder strains. A lot of Liberals were patting themselves on 
the back and tore ligaments in their shoulder. At a convention, that 
is their right to do that. They can pat themselves on the back all 
they like.
<P>
	The Prime Minister says ``we will not demand your vote, we will 
not buy your vote'', although Bombardier would perhaps question 
that, ``but will earn your vote because you will watch us and you 
will see us fulfil the promises that I have made''.
<P>
	What is one of those promises? The very first thing that the 
Prime Minister can fulfil, acknowledged as an unfulfilled 
promises, is the appointment of the deputy speaker. It will be the 
test.
<P>
	I do not want to politicize your position in the chair of course, 
Mr. Speaker. I do not want to politicize the deputy chair, or 
compromise his or her position. The Chair absolutely has our 
respect. I should not say it has nothing to do with you, as I do not 
want to cut you out of the picture, but the argument here has 
nothing to do with your position which, of course, is without 
disrepute. It is held in the highest esteem.
<P>
	However, the promises of the Liberal Party of Canada and the 
promises of the Prime Minister are at stake. Think of that. When 
someone does not fulfil a promise and fills a role in the deputy 
chair's position, a very important role, and that person gets to that 
position in spite of a promise by the Prime Minister to the contrary, 
what message does that send? It sends the message that the 
promises of the red book are hollow, the promises of the red book 
are only expedient, the promises of the red book whether they are 
30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent are more of an accident of 
birth than they are of a grand design.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	If the Prime Minister pushes ahead with this appointment, the 
member for Kingston and the Islands will have to take a serious 
second look at his acceptance of his position. He needs to do some 
soul searching on this issue.
<P>
	I spoke with the hon. member at the Liberal convention, and he 
knows this. I told him this was going to come up if his name came 
forward. I told him exactly where this was going: ``Your name has 
been talked about here in the hallways and it may or may not come 
up in the debate. But if it does, this is what I am going to say''. I 
told him because he has been so outspoken on this issue.
<P>
	It is not enough just to speak about it. He put together a report. 
He argued persuasively on a position, basically saying this role 
should not go to a Liberal, it should go to the opposition. It was so 
persuasive that I have quoted it back to him on several occasions.
<P>
	I said that the hon. member, the hon. House leader and the Prime 
Minister have the experience and they have collectively endorsed 
the 81st report of the Standing Committee on House Management 
and have appended their own report to the Liberal red book saying: 
``This is what we will do when we form government. We will give 
the deputy chairman of the committee of the whole to the 
opposition parties. You can count on it. You can rely on us. You can 
trust us. You can know that we will not deviate from our red book 
promises''. It is now bunk, bunk, bunk coming from the 
government side.
<P>
	It is not ``if the GDP exceeds 3.3 per cent we will consider this 
option''. It is not one of those promises. It is not a promise that we 
will somehow have a rolling target on deputy speakers. None of 
that. As far as I know we are not going roll all four positions 
together and call it the Canada health transfer subsidy. We are not 
going to do anything like that. This is just a cut and dried promise, 
succinctly put in the red book, appended, which says ``when we 
form government we will make sure that the opposition party is 
represented in the chair with not one but two deputy speaker 
positions''.
<P>
	If I had put together a report in a learned study as the member for 
Kingston and the Islands had done and said that it was my opinion, 
so take it for what it is worth, I think the government would say it 
was an interesting thought, that it will look it over and maybe refer 
it to a procedure and House affairs committee and maybe study it, 
as opposed to precedents of other Parliaments of the world''. Who 
knows? Study it until time ran out.
<P>
	I did not submit the idea. It is not my idea. It did not come from 
the official opposition. It did not come from the Reform Party. It 
did not come from the independents. Where did it come from? 
From the member for Kingston and the Islands, the very member  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5743"> 5743 </A></B>
<P>
who is being nominated today in contravention of everything he 
has written about that position.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I would not want to use the word hypocrisy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> I do not want to get into mud slinging or name 
calling in any way.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	However, the principle that is involved here is one that will cast 
aspersions where they should not be, on the most neutral position in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	I am not sure whether the member for Kingston and the Islands 
shaved this morning, but if he had looked in the mirror today he 
would have seen someone who said ``what is happening here today 
is wrong''. That is what he said-not me and not the official 
opposition. The House leader knows it. He signed that paper too. 
The Prime Minister knows it. He says he is going to walk the walk, 
talk the talk and do what is right. This is not right.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the government has chosen to do this. There 
have been no consultations, no words, not a second and not a 
minute of consultations with the opposition parties. It has not even 
asked the opposition parties whether they are comfortable with this 
neutral position.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know you earned your position in a sense 
because all members of this House voted for your position. You 
have the support of the entire House.
<P>
	However, on this issue not only has the government broken a 
promise, but there has been no consultation and no discussion. It 
has not been referred to any committee. There has not been a slate 
of names put forward. There has not in any way been an attempt to 
keep the promises the Prime Minister made during the election 
campaign.
<P>
	Whether it was 60 per cent or 78 per cent of the promises made, 
it is dropping, dropping, dropping. It is now 68 per cent, 58 per 
cent, wherever. When the government intentionally breaks the 
spirit and the letter of its own book, its own law, then it has in 
essence broken its trust with the Canadian people.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by striking out ``Peter Milliken'' and substituting 
``Daphne Jennings''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have an amendment on the floor by the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East and seconded by the hon. member 
for Lethbridge. Procedurally the amendment is acceptable.
<P>
	The debate will continue and it is on the amendment. I am going 
to go to the parliamentary secretary to the House leader.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr.  Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague's comments regarding 
our friend from Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands has had a lifelong 
interest in this place.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> You weren't even here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> If the hon. member wishes to participate in the debate, 
perhaps she could wait until a courteous time and let me finish my 
comments.
<P>
	As I said, the member for Kingston and the Islands has had a 
lifelong interest in Parliament. He knows the rules. He is fair 
minded. He is experienced.
<P>
	I find it somewhat amusing in the presumption the chief whip for 
the leader of the third party has made in his comments in that there 
has been some reference to the red book. Perhaps the hon. member 
is not familiar with the fact that there are 24 months left in this 
government's mandate.
<P>
	The decision to move the motion which the government House 
leader moved was given in view of what was in the best interests of 
this House. I listened with great interest to the fact that the member 
felt we should not want to politicize this. He said that we do not 
want to cast aspersions upon the character of the member for 
Kingston and the Islands. He said that we need experienced 
members.
<P>
	When one reads the resume and sees the background of the 
member for Kingston and the Islands, it will be seen that he is one 
of very few members who would adequately best serve the interests 
of the House. Perhaps we could familiarize our colleagues in the 
House, including members of the third party and indeed all 
Canadians with what our friend from Kingston and the Islands has 
done.
<P>
	It is important to know that this individual was educated at 
Queen's University, Oxford University and Dalhousie University. 
When most young Canadians were involved with different 
activities, he was involved with parliamentary procedure. He has 
taken it as a lifelong interest, an interest that many Canadians have 
looked at with great admiration.
<P>
	As a new member of the House, I came to this place with an 
appreciation for the importance and integrity of the Chair. What 
strikes me as being very important, Mr. Speaker, is that members 
look to the team that needs to support you in your activities. It 
becomes very important for us to look to experience, to integrity, to 
leadership-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> To look at the Liberal Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> -to look at the Liberal Party. Thank you very much 
for that.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands is fair minded.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5744"> 5744 </A></B>
<P>
	When Canadians view the fact that we mean what we say when 
we put forward commitments from the red book and the 
appendices to the red book, we have already stood the test of 
public opinion.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I find it a little sad that the members from the third party came to 
this place telling Canadians and all members that they wanted to do 
things a little differently. Frankly, their interventions today 
demonstrate that they are doing things a little differently. They are 
coming forward and attacking the integrity of the process which 
they do not like because it does not serve their interests, it is not 
self-serving.
<P>
	The former parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader, the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, has served 
this House well. He has served as the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader. He has served as the chairman of the 
procedure and House affairs committee. He has served in many 
capacities, in many committees, and has served the interests of this 
House, which is the member's first love as many members of the 
Reform Party have acknowledged.
<P>
	I encourage members of the third party to view this appointment, 
this nomination and this motion with the spirit in which it was 
given. If they have a complaint about certain aspects of the red 
book, I encourage them to stay tuned. There are 24 months left in 
the mandate of this government. There are many months left for the 
remaining 22 per cent of the promises that will continue to be met 
as they relate to the red book.
<P>
	I urge members not to use up government time or House time for 
this matter. Canadians have other issues they want debated. There 
are bills that need to be passed. I strongly urge that members 
reconsider their amendment and that they consider supporting the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
hate to say that the hon. member who just spoke has missed the 
point, but he has missed the point.
<P>
	There is absolutely no doubt about the qualifications of the 
member for Kingston and the Islands. I mentioned that repeatedly 
in my speech. I realize he is a student of the parliamentary system. 
I understand his interest in it. I understand his qualifications. But 
the number one qualification he has is that he is a Liberal and the 
Liberal Party promised that the number one qualification should be 
that the position should go to an opposition party member.
<P>
	On a point of clarification, I would like the member to admit up 
front that I have not, nor has anyone in our party said anything 
about the member for Kingston and the Islands to suggest that he is 
not technically qualified for the job. What we have said is that it 
does break a promise in a book appended to the red book which 
said  that the position should go to somebody from an opposition 
party. That in essence is the argument.
<P>
	We want to straighten out the matter. First, we have not been 
picking on the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. That is 
not the issue. Second, the promise was explicit. I could read the 
promise to him but he has no doubt read it himself since it was a 
promise. That of course is the nub of the debate today and the 
argument comes down to that. Does the member believe that that 
promise should be fulfilled?
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, before I give a direct and succinct answer 
to the question, it is important to go back to something my hon. 
colleague just said. He said that the number one qualification of the 
member for Kingston and the Islands is that he is a Liberal. That is 
not true. The member for Kingston and the Islands has been 
proposed because of his experience, because of his interest in this 
place, because of his knowledge.
<P>
	The other point is that the hon. member said there was a promise 
broken. As I said in my speech, there are 24 months left in this 
government's mandate and there are 24 months left in which to 
complete the balance of 22 per cent of the promises that have not 
yet been addressed or that are still in progress.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member for Fraser Valley East is somebody 
who is fair minded. I believe he should be intellectually honest 
enough to recognize the reality of what in fact has happened.
<P>
	In answering the hon. member's question, the number one 
qualification for the member for Kingston and the Islands is his 
integrity, experience, fair mindedness, his appreciation for the 
House and his lifelong interest in this place.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> And he is a Liberal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> If because he is a member of the Liberal team 
disqualifies him, then there are a lot of Canadians who would be 
disqualified because there are a number of Canadians who support 
the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I do not believe we should be conducting the way we do business 
in this House based on popularity. We should do it based on tough 
decisions that are being made, important decisions and decisions 
that are right. The right decision is being based on the experience 
and fair mindedness of a member in this place who can serve the 
interests of the House. That member is the member for Kingston 
and the Islands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
two issues I would like to touch on.
<P>
	First, I would like to reiterate what my colleague for Fraser 
Valley East mentioned. Not once in his speech did he say anything 
derogatory about the member for Kingston and the Islands. The 
member for Fundy-Royal should be aware of that and he should 
acknowledge that  we are not casting aspersions on the member. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5745"> 5745 </A></B>
<P>
worked with the member on the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs. He was chair of that committee and I did find 
him to be fair. Should he become deputy chair, I would not have 
any problems with that.
<P>
	Second, for all the glowing comments the hon. member for 
Fundy-Royal made, he should clear up this issue that we are not 
picking on the individual's character and integrity. It is impeccable 
and he would be a fine deputy chair. There is no question.
<P>
	However with all those glowing compliments, with all those 
glowing remarks and all the experience that the member has-and 
those are the grounds upon which the Liberal government wishes to 
put his name forward-why does the member not go one step 
further and accept the advice of the member for Kingston and the 
Islands, to accept the high degree of intelligence, accept the high 
degree of thought and effort that he put into this idea as to who 
should be deputy chair? Should it or should it not be a member 
from the opposition parties? Should it not be a member from the 
official opposition? Should there not be a second deputy chair from 
the third party?
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	That is what the member for Kingston and the Islands put 
forward. With all his years of experience, with all his knowledge 
and integrity and honesty, he said that was what the government 
should do. It is signed with the signatures of the Prime Minister, of 
the House leader and of the former whip. All of these people have 
recommended that the two deputy chairs be appointed from the 
opposition benches.
<P>
	Why does the member from New Brunswick not recognize that 
comment? Why does the member from New Brunswick not 
acknowledge that it is a promise which was made? It is a promise 
that should be kept. He knows it is a cop out to say that we still 
have 24 months left. Why does he not just admit it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Calgary Centre has asked 
a question. The question that I hear him asking is: Were there 
certain issues that were raised in the red book which relate to the 
Chair? That is how I understand the question. The answer is that 
there was an appendix to the red book which contemplated 
changing the way this place does business.
<P>
	We have lived up to a lot of those promises. There were issues 
regarding greater participation by members of Parliament, 
changing the way the committee system works, referring bills to 
the standing committees after first reading in order for members to 
have greater involvement in legislation.
<P>
	In replying directly to the member for Calgary Centre, it is 
important to reiterate the fact that there are 24 months left on this 
mandate. I hear them saying they do  not believe this promise will 
be kept. All I can say to them is stay tuned.
<P>
	Seventy-eight per cent of our promises have been kept. The other 
22 per cent is in progress. I look forward to the day when we 
campaign in the next general election, when we put our stock on the 
table and let Canadians decide whether they feel our promises have 
been kept.
<P>
	I know that the integrity of the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands is not questioned by any member of the House. What 
members are questioning is the process. I know that all members of 
the House share my interest in supporting the motion for the 
member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government House leader is a very experienced man, 
so I am sure he is not surprised to see his motion give rise to what I 
would call very interesting discussions.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the official opposition will vote against the 
amendment of our friends in the third party for a very simple 
reason: If this House did break with tradition and decide to appoint 
a Deputy Chair who is not a government member, it is clear to me 
that this Deputy Chair should come from the official opposition. I 
am convinced that our colleagues from the third party can only 
agree with our arguments.
<P>
	We, however, feel sorry to have to do this. The government party 
is just emerging from a convention where everything was 
hunky-dory.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I imagine that during the convention there was no discussion as 
to whether or not the government should keep its promise to fulfil 
an important responsibility and appoint an opposition member to 
assist the Chair in carrying out one of its most basic, if not its most 
basic duty: the orderly conduct of House business and, ultimately, 
good governance.
<P>
	Of course, there was no question about this, but it would have 
been a good idea to appoint an opposition member as the new 
Deputy Chair.
<P>
	We will also vote against the motion. Yet, we will do so with 
regret. We will do so as a matter of principle because everyone of 
us recognizes that the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
has but one flaw: he is not a member of the official opposition. He 
has excellent judgment. He is well mannered. Every time he had to 
assume committee management responsibilities, he met the 
expectations of both government and opposition members.
<P>
	I can assure the man who will likely be the next Deputy Chair 
that he will, of course, have our co-operation because we are 
confident he will be do a very good job of moving House business 
along.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>That François Langlois be appointed Deputy Chairman of Committees of the 
Whole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Hon. members, we have an amendment to an 
amendment by the hon. member for Laval-Centre, seconded by the 
hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie. In my opinion it is not in 
order because it is not an amendment to an amendment but an 
alternative amendment. There is a difference. For these reasons, 
this amendment is not admissible at this time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to make a brief comment because this is an issue that has come up 
before. There is no question that the House is not dealing with the 
credentials of the nominee.
<P>
	The issue has to do with the status of an appendix that was 
included in the red book, a report which was authored in part by the 
nominee. The report included a recommendation. I had an 
opportunity to speak with the member earlier about the wording. It 
was suggested that the positions may be filled by opposition 
parties. I asked why it was parties and he explained to me that if 
there was a small official opposition it might be appropriate to look 
to a third party.

	The results of the last election came as a surprise to many 
Canadians and certainly were unknown to members of the House at 
the time this report was written. The fact that a party reflecting a 
position that Canada should separate became the official opposition 
put the context of that report in a much different light than the 
member's report may have indicated.
<P>
	I am assured that the Reform Party would be the first to object if 
the government were to nominate a member of the Bloc to fill this 
position.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. whip of the Bloc. Although it is 
true there are 24 months in the mandate, does the member 
understand that it would probably be inappropriate, given the view 
of Canadians at this time, to appoint a member of the official 
opposition as a speaker of this House?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe there is an 
elementary rule in this House that the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker 
and the assistant deputy speakers are people who must remain 
neutral, and I think it is really too bad that the hon. member 
opposite should question our ability to be logical and consistent as 
a servant of this House, referring of course to our position on the 
Constitution.
<P>
	I find it rather difficult to understand this attitude, and I would 
like to give the hon. member the assurance that  as 
parliamentarians, members of the official opposition have 
exercised their duties with a great deal of professionalism, and I am 
convinced that one of our members will be perfectly able to take on 
the role of deputy speaker of the House, although this person is as 
firm a sovereignist as I am.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we 
listen to the arguments put forward by the Liberal Party in the 
debate on this motion, we find that the arrogance sometimes comes 
out which we should not have in the House. I refer to the comments 
by the member for Fundy-Royal who said that we should not be 
attacking the process of appointing this particular person. Surely 
when motions are made in the House we are entitled to debate 
them. For them to even insinuate that we should not be debating a 
motion I find rather offensive to the democratic process.
<P>
	He went on to say that we should not be using up House time. 
Again, I find it rather offensive that he would be opposed to using 
House time to debate a motion.
<P>
	I would like to quote from the annotated Standing Orders of the 
House of Commons, page 19, regarding precedents for this: ``The 
members appointed to the position of Chairman, Deputy Chairman 
and Assistant Deputy Chairman have almost always come from the 
government side of the House. The only exceptions came in the 
13th, 29th and 31st Parliaments when in each case an opposition 
member was appointed as Chairman''.
<P>
	It does not say a member of the official opposition. It just says an 
opposition member was appointed as chairman. There is real 
precedence for the point we are trying to make.
<P>
	I would also like to quote from the Liberal red book that has been 
waved in our faces so often over the last three years. Let me quote 
from Reviving Parliamentary Democracy; the Liberal Plan for 
House of Commons and Electoral Reform.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mounting criticism of the House of Commons and its proceedings reflects the 
frustration of citizens and parliamentarians alike with the continuing failure of 
Parliament to address effectively the problems that face us.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadians, including those who are elected to serve in Parliament, expect the 
House of Commons not merely to discuss openly the problems of the nation, but also 
to advance solutions. They expect the Commons to explore Canada's problems 
rationally and to establish policies for resolving them. These expectations are not 
being met.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House of Commons must take immediate steps both to enable itself to do 
what it is supposed to do and to be seen to be doing it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5747"> 5747 </A></B>
<P>
	For the member for Fundy Royal to say that in three years they 
have fulfilled 78 per cent so give them two more makes a mockery 
of the red book where it states that the House must take immediate 
steps.
<P>
	Let us again talk about the red book's statement concerning 
familiarity with Parliament. Let me quote the Liberal red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce the 
level of partisanship, when the Speaker is from the government party, two of the 
junior Chair officers should be from the opposition, so that the four presiding officer 
positions are shared equally by government and opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would again like to point out that in that quote there was 
nothing about official opposition, just opposition. If I may go on to 
quote again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the most significant results of the McGrath round of procedural reforms 
was the decision that the Speaker should be elected by secret ballot by all members. 
This has gone a long way toward assuring members of the independence of the 
presiding officer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The three deputy Speakers, however, remain in effect government appointees. As 
a consequence, when one of the junior officers is in the Chair, his or her 
independence and authority is less well established. Their authority would be greatly 
enhanced and the non-partisan nature of the Chair greatly augmented if the British 
practice of alternating the Chair positions between government and opposition were 
adopted. Thus, if the Speaker were from the government party, the Deputy Speaker 
would be from the opposition, the next officer from the government and so forth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The red book talks about electing the Speaker. You, Mr. Speaker, 
have done a marvellous job in the independence and integrity that 
you have upheld so well in this House. We would like to see that 
your colleagues in the Chair would enjoy the same independence 
and integrity without being tainted by being appointed by the 
government shall we say.
<P>
	It was for that very point the Liberal red book promise was to 
alternate Speakers by secret ballot, next from the opposition, then 
back to government and so forth, simple, and it said it should be 
done immediately. Here we are three years later and the 
opportunity has presented itself today.
<P>
	By the looks of it we are going to have division on this 
appointment which is unfortunate because the process that is being 
proposed is flawed and the process that is being used flies in direct 
opposition with what the Liberals proposed at election time. I 
would suggest to the member for Kingston and the Islands that 
should the amendment lose and we vote on this particular position 
that he seriously consider whether he does enjoy the confidence of 
the House.
<P>
	This is unfortunate because he does have the qualifications and 
as an individual member of this House he enjoys an excellent 
reputation. However, if there is division in putting him in the Chair, 
then we have  concerns about the perception of integrity, 
impartiality and independence if this is forced upon us. The 
perception is important if we are to ensure the integrity of this 
House. That is why I would think that the member for Kingston and 
the Islands would seriously consider whether he does enjoy the 
confidence of the House in the chair's position if he were voted in.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	That is why the Liberal government should acknowledge the 
policy it wanted to introduce immediately and should support a 
nominee from this side of the House, which is the motion before us 
right now. It would ensure that its promise is upheld.
<P>
	The person we have nominated, the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, has integrity, has a long experience of public 
service, perhaps not all of it in this House. She is a person of 
competence. While she may not have had years of experience here, 
I am quite sure there have been others who have had the privilege 
of sitting in the Chair as having been appointed to that position who 
have not had years of experience in this House and they have 
performed quite adequately. Therefore I have no fear whatsoever in 
saying that the member for Mission-Coquitlam would perform 
admirably in the Chair as well.
<P>
	I suggest that the government seriously consider now that there 
is opposition to its nominee, that its proposal which was supposed 
to be implemented immediately can be implemented now. I am 
quite sure there would be no problems with the appointment of the 
hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague's intervention and he 
certainly put his points across in a very clear manner. My 
comments deal with some comments that were made during this 
debate.
<P>
	Earlier the hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore was 
heckling our hon. whip when he was trying to speak. She was 
asking which page of the red book we were referring to. Obviously 
for someone who ran on that red book and the promises contained 
therein, I would have expected that she would have known that we 
were actually referring to an appendix to the red book, a report that 
was appended to the red book.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> You always have to find someone to attack.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> My hon. colleague 
referred to the actual committee report.
<P>
	The hon. member is insistent on heckling still. We are going to 
try to figure out at some point if she actually does know what is 
contained in the red book which she ran on but perhaps that will 
have to be on another day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5748"> 5748 </A></B>
<P>
	At this point it is very clear from the intervention made by my 
hon. colleague what we were referring to. It actually is a promise, 
much to the consternation of Liberal members, another broken 
promise.
<P>
	I also refer to a comment made by the hon. member for 
Mississauga South. The only defence he could come up with for 
this appointment was that somehow the Liberal members who put 
forward the report that suggested the two deputy speaker positions 
should be from the opposition, that somehow that was done before 
the election. There were such astounding results in the election 
with the election of Bloc Quebecois members as well as Reform 
Party of Canada members that somehow it negates the commitment 
made in the red book to have the two deputy speaker positions 
actually filled from the opposition. He was looking for some little 
avenue that he could use to get out of the commitment made in the 
red book.
<P>
	I wonder if my hon. colleague would like to comment on that. 
The only excuse the government can use is so pathetically weak: 
that we simply cannot allow a separatist member to be a deputy 
speaker. It is pretty pathetic to have to use that as an excuse for 
breaking a promise.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
comment by my hon. colleague.
<P>
	The Liberal government in the red book did not give any 
qualification regarding their point number 10, the independence of 
the Chair. There was no qualification in the fact that it said: ``The 
House of Commons must take immediate steps both to enable itself 
to do what it is supposed to do and to be seen to be doing it''.
<P>
	That was before the election. That was the policy that those 
people ran on. The Canadian people elected them on this and their 
other policy of jobs, jobs, jobs which was trashed along the way as 
well.
<P>
	Regardless of the fact that we ended up with an official 
opposition who are separatists and of course we felt there was no 
way that the separatists should have been the official opposition. 
Again, this government had the right to choose after the election. It 
could quite easily have chosen a party that was represented in five 
provinces, that had 2.5 million votes and ran candidates in 
practically every province in the country versus a provincial party 
that only was represented in one province and that wants to break 
up this country. However, the government appointed that party as 
the official opposition.
<P>
	That aside, there was no qualification. There was nothing said in 
the election that the government would break a promise under 
certain conditions. The government was quite emphatic that this 
red book is the plan. This past weekend the Prime Minister was 
waving the results of the plan and talking of 78 per cent 
accomplishment.
<P>
	This is one promise that the Liberals said they were going to 
implement right away after the election. They had an opportunity 
to implement it right away after the election when the Speaker and 
the deputies were initially appointed. If I may be so bold, the 
government had an opportunity to fulfil their election promise 
when you, Madam Speaker, received the appointment to the Chair.
<P>
	Now we have the same debate once again and once again the 
government is going to break the promise that it said it would 
introduce immediately. That is why my colleague is upset. That is 
why the people in this House are upset. That is why unfortunately 
we have got partisanship on this motion. It is quite unfortunate.
<P>
	The independence of the Chair is fundamental to the governance 
of this House. That is why, if the subamendment is defeated and the 
member for Mission-Coquitlam does not take the position and the 
main motion is then debated and voted upon, I would hope that the 
member for Kingston and the Islands would withdraw his 
nomination.
<P>
	We do want to ensure the integrity of the Chair, which you 
occupy, Madam Speaker. To quote from pages 18 and 19 of the 
Annotated Standing Orders:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The names put forward have met with opposition only on rare occasions. In 1911, 
the choice of Mr. Blondin, a Quebec nationalist, as chairman, was hotly debated-</BLOCKQUOTE>
It was suggested again today that a member from the Bloc would 
be hotly debated too. It goes on further:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-while in 1918, one member objected to the appointment of Mr. Boivin, a Quebec 
member who had opposed conscription. On only one occasion however, in 1962, 
was a motion to appoint a chairman ever brought to a recorded vote. In fact, in most 
cases the appointment passed with only a few laudatory comments about the 
nominee's special capacities for the post.</BLOCKQUOTE>
We have had laudatory comments about the member for Kingston 
and the Islands which I would support as well.
<P>
	The point is partisanship, because the government has abused the 
process which has entered into the debate. The principle has not 
been upheld. Democracy has not been upheld. The policies on 
which they were elected have not been upheld. That is why we 
should have new nominees or we should elect the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, would the hon. 
member for St. Albert comment on a comment made by the hon. 
member for Fundy-Royal who said we are wasting the time of the 
House by debating this very clear matter of principle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, the point is this House debates 
democracy. We are here to uphold democracy, to talk about 
principle and to challenge the government's point of view. For the 
member to stand up and say we are wasting the House's time

Madam Speaker, I thank members of the House for their 
unanimous consent.
<P>
	As chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I 
have the honour to present the third report of this committee.
<P>
	This report deals with the famous question of what was called 
family trusts, in which the committee examined Chapter I of the 
auditor general's report of May 1996. This report reflects the 
opinion of the Liberal majority within the committee, and includes 
dissenting opinions by the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, 
as well as a supplementary opinion by the Liberal member for 
Brome-Missisquoi.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that, in my capacity as a member 
of the Bloc Quebecois, I subscribe to the dissident minority report 
by the members of the Bloc Quebecois, particularly the following 
recommendation: that a special commission of inquiry independent 
of the government be struck, with the mandate of fully 
investigating all of the events surrounding the decision of 
December 23, 1991, and the subsequent use of this tax loophole by 
other rich Canadian families.
<P>
	In closing, pursuant to Standing Order 109, the committee is 
asking the government to table a comprehensive response to the 
report.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I see 
the humour in this situation in listening to members of the third 
party, listening to hot air coming once again into this Chamber.
<P>
	We are talking about promises and I recall the leader of the third 
party rising in this House and calling this Parliament one without 
precedent. He called the make-up of this Parliament one without 
precedent. They told us they were going to do things differently. 
Canadians and members of this House know that they broke that 
pledge. It is reflected in the opinions of Canadians when they are 
asked what they think of members of the third party.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	If there were intellectual honesty in the motion proposed by 
members of the third party they would support a member of the 
official opposition's filling the position. That is not what they 
proposed. They proposed that one of their members should fill the 
position of deputy chair.
<P>
	I would like to respond to the hon. member for St. Albert. We 
had an election for the chair of the public accounts committee. That 
position has by tradition gone to a member of the official 
opposition. I recall how vigorously they opposed and filibustered 
to stop that appointment from taking place. Now they are standing 
in the House talking about what they would like to be done. They 
are not dealing with reality.
<P>
	Let me repeat that if there were intellectual honesty in their 
position they would be talking about a member of the official 
opposition's filling the position.
<P>
	There is no question that the member for Kingston and the 
Islands is an excellent choice. He will serve the House well. He will 
serve Canadians well. He will carry out his duties in a very judicial 
fashion.
<P>
	Clearly there is no question that if members of the third party 
had any intellectual honesty they would not have been self-serving 
and would have suggested that the position be filled by a member 
of the official opposition.
<P>
	Canadians know that those members have been lusting after the 
status of official opposition. They have had opportunities. They 
have campaigned across the country in byelections. They said to 
the electorate in different constituencies: ``We are the Reform 
Party. Elect us to Parliament so we can become the official 
opposition''. They have gone to the electorate across the country 
time and time again. The electorate has said no, and with good 
reason. It is because of the string of broken promises, promises 
they did not fulfill when they got to the House  of Commons. I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5750"> 5750 </A></B>
<P>
disappointed, along with many other Canadians, that they have not 
fulfilled those promises.
<P>
	I applaud the nomination of the member for Kingston and the 
Islands. He will serve the House and Canadians well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the member 
very eloquently talked about keeping promises. It is very 
interesting that when you are in the government you are able to 
fulfill your promises, if you will.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	It would be wonderful if the member would listen to the 
question, as he is often not even in his seat as the commentary is 
unfolding. Would the member support the Reform Party motion if 
we called for a member of the official opposition to occupy the 
position of deputy chair?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Madam Chair, I would like to thank my hon. 
colleague for agreeing with me about the hypocrisy of their party's 
position in putting forth one of their own members and then 
making the kinds of arguments they have.
<P>
	As I said before, the motion to appoint the member for Kingston 
and the Island is an excellent motion. I said that he would serve the 
House and Canadians well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I noted that the hon. member for Waterloo declined to 
answer the question from my colleague from Macleod. He did not 
make any attempt to actually answer the question, which does not 
surprise me.
<P>
	This member referred several times to remarks about intellectual 
honesty in referring to the Reform Party of Canada. Somehow he 
feels that because we put forward the name of one of our members 
to occupy the position it means that we are dishonest and that we 
should put forward a name of a member from the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	If he had taken the opportunity to actually read the appendix to 
his own Liberal red book at some time over the last four years, he 
would have found that this proposal put forward by four members 
of the Liberal caucus, one of whom is the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands, states: ``In order to enhance the 
independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce the level of 
partisanship, when the Speaker is from the government party two 
of the junior chair officers should be from the opposition so that the 
four presiding officer positions are shared equally by government 
and opposition''. That is the promise, the recommendation, the 
proposal.
<P>
	We note that it does not say official opposition. It says 
opposition. The last time I checked we remain an opposition party, 
perhaps for another year. However, at the whim of the Prime 
Minister we will be the government.
<P>
	The hon. member also said that he was appalled that the Reform 
Party said it was going to do things differently when it ran for 
Parliament. He obviously does not feel that opting out of the MP 
pension plan is different. I would ask the hon. member for Waterloo 
if he opted out of the pension plan. That is where he could have 
shown some leadership to his constituents of Waterloo on an 
important issue. However, he has declined to do so.
<P>
	We could go on like this all evening. I would argue quite strongly 
that we have kept our commitment and we are doing things 
differently. One thing we are doing differently is standing on 
principle, which is something unknown to Liberal members of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Madam Speaker, there were a number of questions 
asked. I will respond to four of them.
<P>
	The member said I did not answer the question. I made an 
observation on intellectual dishonesty. I said that is what was 
coming from the Reform Party by way of what it proposes to 
accomplish. That was an observation and I make that same 
observation again.
<P>
	I have already said that I support the nomination of the member 
for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	Second, he made reference to the appendix of the red book.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Let me commend the hon. member for reading the indexes of the 
red book. I presume he must have read the main body of the red 
book also where we talk about not pitting region against region, not 
pitting Canadians against Canadians. We take a national 
perspective, recognizing that this country has diversity in its 
population, diversity in its culture, diversity in its make-up. The 
member should go back and re-read that part of the red book. Once 
he finishes that part of it, we will talk about its appendices.
<P>
	The other issue that he talked about is opting out of MPs' 
pensions. A promise was made in the red book. That promise was 
we would set an age limit before members of Parliament could 
collect a pension. We went beyond that and lowered the payouts in 
the pension plan. We went beyond what we said in the red book. 
Those members from the third party should be applauding the 
government because we did what we said we would do. As a matter 
of fact we went beyond it.
<P>
	Let me also say that, in terms of fourth issue he raised, the matter 
of principle, on this side of the House we do not need lessons in 
principle from members of the third party. They would pit regions 
against regions, Canadians against Canadians. They would do 
anything to become the official opposition. They stood in the 
House, aiding and abetting the Bloc during the referendum when, 
on this side of the House, we were trying to keep this country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5751"> 5751 </A></B>
<P>
together. We do not need lessons from members of the third party 
on the issue of principle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, for the hon. member to suggest that the Reform Party is 
aiding and abetting the separatists in the House is absolutely 
ridiculous.
<P>
	Surely to goodness after three years Canadians understand which 
party it is in this place that is assisting the separatists, the Bloc 
Quebecois, to break up the country. It is certainly not the Reform 
Party of Canada. It is the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	Every time we turn around in the House, it is supporting the 
motions of the Bloc. It allows the Bloc to be not only the official 
opposition-it supports its cause that way-but on every single 
standing committee in this place, including the standing committee 
on national defence of Canada.
<P>
	The Liberals support the separatists to be the alternate chair 
positions on committees. It is absolutely astounding that the 
member for Waterloo would stand up and accuse us of aiding and 
abetting the separatists. It is his party that continues to do this on an 
ongoing basis day after day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Madam Speaker, I never cease to be amazed by the 
interpretations of the members of the Reform Party and also how 
twisted their arguments become. A minute ago, they asked me if I 
would support a member of the Bloc for the position of deputy 
speaker. I said in my statement that I support the member for 
Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	I told them that if they were intellectually honest and consistent 
in their position, they would have nominated a member of the 
official opposition. Then they ask me if they nominated a member 
of the official opposition, whether I would support it. I said: ``No, I 
am consistent, I support the member for Kingston and the Islands''. 
The opposition members then turn around and accuse me of 
supporting positions in committees that tradition dictates they 
hold.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	It is not good enough for members of the third party to be lusting 
for power and lusting to be the official opposition. There is a way to 
do that. They had the opportunity during the byelections. They 
have to win those byelections. They have to do that the old 
fashioned way, by earning it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
I begin my comments on this issue, which I think the members on 
the government side are slowly starting to forget, the member for 
Waterloo talked about intellectual honesty. If he wanted to be 
intellectually honest he would have answered the question of my 
colleague from Macleod when he asked whether the member for 
Waterloo would or would not support a member from the Bloc 
Quebecois as a deputy chair. He refused to answer and squirmed 
around it.
<P>
	When someone talks about intellectual honesty and expects it, 
why would that person not simply answer a question yes or no? 
That was not a question that required a five minute conversation off 
topic.
<P>
	The essence of this motion moved by the House leader of the 
government is the independence of the Chair. The person whose 
name has been put forward is also a person who has impeccable 
qualifications, is extremely qualified to sit in the position of a chair 
and who has worked for years in understanding the standing orders 
which are the rules of this House that speakers in the chair must 
apply when rendering decisions.
<P>
	A lot of times, because of a lot of issues and the partisan nature 
of politics in this country, there are divisive issues and ideas and 
people need to have rules. The standing orders are there for us to 
follow. When we step out of line the Chair must rule.
<P>
	This individual is the member for Kingston and the Islands. It is 
his name that was put forward by the House leader of the 
government. However, the issue is linking the two, the individual 
himself and the independence of the Chair.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands has said that he 
believes in secret ballots for the election of Speakers because in 
that way all the members of the House can then enhance the respect 
and any of the rulings by the Speaker of the House.
<P>
	Furthermore, the member for Kingston and the Islands was on a 
committee when in opposition which wrote the Liberal plan for the 
House of Commons and electoral reform that was titled ``Reviving 
Parliamentary Democracy''. The opposition members of that 
committee were the current Minister of Health, the Minister of 
Labour, the member for Kingston and the Islands whose name has 
been put forward to be the deputy chair, and the former party whip, 
the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who is now also a 
cabinet minister of francophonie and intergovernmental affairs. 
These people have worked hard to earn their positions. They had 
ideas in opposition and even though politics is part of that 
sometimes we can find agreement.
<P>
	In this case the Reform Party agrees with a lot of the democratic 
reforms that have been put forward by the Liberal members when 
they were in opposition. They now have an opportunity to do the 
things they fought for and believed in so hard in opposition.
<P>
	While in opposition the Liberals said that this House was 
dysfunctional. They came forward with 18 recommendations, all 
the way from committees, taxation, new rules for question period 
so that it would have some meaning. They suggested things like 
limiting the questions and the answers, telling the government side 
to answer questions. The joke around here is that this is not  answer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5752"> 5752 </A></B>
<P>
period. It is question period, so they do not answer. There are a lot 
of good ideas in this document.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Reformers are not bringing this forward to put the member for 
Kingston and the Islands down. It is brought forward to 
compliment the member for Kingston and the Islands and to say 
that his ideas and his suggestions, especially this one, have a lot of 
merit.
<P>
	He is pushing for the independence of the Chair. That is 
important. When the battle is heated we do not want any partiality 
to be a part of the decision of the Chair. Therefore it is very 
important. The fact that the McGrath round of procedural reforms 
decided that the Speaker should be elected by secret ballot has gone 
a long way toward assuring members of the independence of the 
presiding officer. Here is the important point. We are talking about 
deputy chairs.
<P>
	``The three deputy speakers, however, remain in effect 
government appointees as a consequence. When one of the junior 
officers is in the Chair his or her independence and authority is less 
well established. Their authority would be greatly enhanced and the 
non-partisan nature of the Chair greatly augmented if the British 
practice of alternating Chair positions between government and 
opposition were adopted''. It does not say official opposition. It 
says opposition, as my colleague from Prince George-Peace 
River mentioned.
<P>
	Thus if the Speaker were from the government party, the Deputy 
Speaker would be from the opposition, the next officer from the 
government and so forth, back and forth like that.
<P>
	This is the principle we believe in. This is a concept that will 
further and help guarantee the independence of the Chair. The fact 
that the person who made this recommendation, who signed this 
proposal, is now the person being put forward it seems to me that 
we should have an election for that position. We should put his 
recommendation into practice. Rather than having the deputy chair 
we should have one member from an opposition party as deputy 
chair and not all of them from the government side.
<P>
	This is the government's last opportunity to implement this 
recommendation, to keep one of its red book promises so that it 
becomes part of the glowing statistics about which the Prime 
Minister has been telling us. Now is the opportunity to do this. It is 
probably the best thing that a politician can do and accomplish in 
his or her career in politics. It is to bring about systemic change, to 
bring about changes in the system rather than just changing the 
faces.
<P>
	How can people respect politicians and the functions of this 
House if nothing really changes but only the faces are changed? 
Here are the very people who are recommending something that we 
would support given the opportunity to actually make one of the 
deputy chairs come from the opposition parties and the government 
does not do it.
<P>
	I would like to recommend to the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands that he now has the opportunity, as my colleague from 
St. Albert put forward, to say to his government because he 
authored this, because he is a man of conviction, because he has 
integrity, this is an opportunity. I know he would like to be in the 
Chair. I know he would like to have the experience. I know that it 
would be a great sacrifice on his part. The suggestion is why does 
he not withdraw his name. Why does he not give a speech on this 
issue? He has not spoken yet. Why does he not address this issue 
and say that he believes in that report. To help the Prime Minister 
keep one more promise why does he not recommend that a name 
from the opposition be put forward? That is the way to decide this 
issue.
<P>
	That would be a way to help the government keep a promise. It 
would be a way to help restore integrity and honesty to the system 
of politics. It would be a way for this member to bow out of a very 
embarrassing situation.
<P>
	The excuse from the current deputy House leader is that the 
government has 24 months left to keep its promises. Does that not 
fly in the face of credibility when everybody knows that there is 
going to be an election as early as possible in the spring or by June 
or as late as October of next year? That is not 24 months.
<P>
	Talk about intellectual honesty which the member for Waterloo 
so proudly defends. There are a lot of discredited comments 
coming from the government side.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	This is what is wrong with what is happening here. Once again 
we are continuing the form of patronage which does not take into 
consideration commitments and principles that the government 
believed in when in opposition.
<P>
	The opportunity to change the system which is before the 
government is also before this individual. There is nothing worse 
than to see the government side hide behind excuses, to see the 
government side flip-flop on issues. The list of broken promises is 
pathetic on its part but a benefit to us.
<P>
	We are happy and proud of the fact that the government stole a 
lot of our ideas which are part of our platform. We are proud and 
happy with the fact that when in opposition the Liberals were 
against NAFTA and free trade. We told them, we argued and we 
even had to vote holding our noses for another Conservative 
government just to get free trade for Canada because their former 
leader, John Turner, was against it. Now they sing and praise the 
virtues of it. The very last vote the government had when in 
opposition was on NAFTA and all the front benches voted against 
it. All of them voted against it; not one voted for it and now all they 
do is praise the virtues of it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hypocrisy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> That is hypocrisy.
<P>
	We know about that infamous promise on the GST. The Deputy 
Prime Minister even quit saying that she had failed to keep her 
promise. She ran again and got re-elected. It is an admission that 
the government failed on that promise. But the Prime Minister will 
not admit that. The Liberals have not got rid of the GST or scrapped 
the GST.
<P>
	I do not want to go on talking about broken promises because I 
could debate that for another two hours. I will spend a little more 
time on this motion.
<P>
	The preface of Beauchesne's sixth edition states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The election of the Speaker-has given the Members their own Speaker in a 
process that was designed to take the choice of Speaker away from the Prime 
Minister and give it to the entire House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What is good for the goose is good for the gander. The member 
for Kingston and the Islands as the gander-to-be would not have a 
problem with this notion. He is a parliamentarian, as I said earlier, 
and one of the authors of the Liberal report for reviving 
parliamentary democracy where they promised to elect two of the 
chair positions from the opposition benches, two of the junior 
member positions.
<P>
	This nomination was moved by a cabinet minister, the deputy 
House leader. A chair officer is not the puppet of the government 
but an officer of this House. The person sitting in that chair, 
regardless of party and regardless of stripe, is not working for the 
government side. The position is to be neutral. The position 
involves the application to the best of his or her ability the rules of 
the House which are found in the standing orders, and they are no 
longer a Liberal member or a Reform member or a Bloc member.
<P>
	However, we do not have the opportunity to have a Bloc member 
or a Reform member in the Chair. It is all from that side, which is 
what we are trying to debate today. We should endorse the 
recommendations of the Liberals when they were in opposition.
<P>
	How does it look to have this nomination coming from the 
government side, from the Prime Minister's office, just like a 
patronage appointment to some government board, just like a 
patronage appointment to the Senate where we have had 18 
Liberals appointed?
<P>
	How obvious is it when the Prime Minister appoints someone to 
the Senate and says: ``I will select and I will appoint a person who 
defends our party''. Is the purpose of the Senate, to defend the 
Liberal government? He admitted that, he said that. That is a 
paraphrased quote but it is pretty close to what he said.
<P>
	We want competent people on all the 3,000 boards and 
quasi-judicial boards. And yes, a lot of those people will be 
Liberals. There is no question about it. But do they all have to be 
Liberals? Are there no former Conservatives or Conservative 
supporters who could serve on one of those 3,000 boards? Are there 
no people who voted for Reform who could serve on one of those 
boards?
<P>
	I agree with the principle of putting those people into positions 
on boards who have an identification or who have a rapport or who 
understand the government's intent. I do not have a problem with 
that. When the Prime Minister says that a lot of people voted for 
Liberals, so therefore there should be a lot of people on those 
boards who are Liberal, I agree.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	However, at the very same time when he says that, the logic 
inherent in that is what about those people who did not vote for 
Liberals who are also competent and who also have the right to 
run? Therefore the composition should not be 99.9 per cent Liberal 
and .1 per cent other parties.
<P>
	They mentioned names like the current president of the CBC and 
a former Prime Minister who is living in a $3 million mansion in 
Beverley Hills protecting Canadians down there. They take two or 
three appointments to lift it to a level of integrity and to say ``see, 
we do pick members from other parties''.
<P>
	This government and this Prime Minister are guilty of duplicity 
and hypocrisy. I would hate to have to add the member for 
Kingston and the Islands to that list because he will have to sit with 
cabinet ministers and make recommendations for democratic 
reform.
<P>
	They are in power. They have the right and the opportunity. 
There are no ifs, ands or buts. Nobody is going to complain. In fact, 
they have the encouragement and the endorsement of members to 
do this. There would be unanimous consent to have an opposition 
member as one of the junior speakers. That would be supported. 
Will the government do that? I do not think so. Will it keep that 
promise? I do not think so.
<P>
	Now that I see my favourite cabinet minister opposite shaking 
his head, the new minister of defence, saying ``you are right, Jim, 
we are not going to change'', I know it will not happen. This man is 
a man of his word. He is one person who has kept his promises. He 
is one person who has done what he said he would do. I know that 
he can hold his head up high as a cabinet minister. I have so much 
respect for him that if he ever ran for leader, rather than the current 
finance minister, I might support him.
<P>
	There is a solution to this problem. I cannot do it in the form of a 
motion, an amendment or an amendment to an amendment to a 
motion. I do not want to waste the time of the House in doing that. 
However, I would like to recommend for the government's 
consideration after this subamendment is voted on and defeated, 
after the amendment is voted on and defeated, and before we vote 
on the motion, that the member for Kingston and the Islands 
actually request that the government to do this. This is his moment 
in history. This is his chance to bring about systemic change on 
principles which I know the Liberals believe in. I do not understand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5754"> 5754 </A></B>
<P>
why they will not follow through with it. It is not something major. 
It will not shake the earth. It is a step forward.
<P>
	The recommendation I have is this. Prior to the vote on the final 
motion, why not allow the two opposition parties to each put 
forward a name and have an election? We can have an election on 
the two names put forward by the two opposition parties, one from 
the Bloc and one from Reform. The House could vote for the junior 
deputy chair position. It is, after all, a junior position. It is, after all, 
following the principles of democracy. We want to retain the 
independence of the Chair.
<P>
	If we follow the model we used to elect the current Speaker of 
the House, we are helping to endorse that independence. We are 
helping to encourage and foster systemic reform and systemic 
change which is of benefit to everybody. It is an opportunity for the 
current Minister of Labour, the current Minister of Health, the 
current Minister for International Co-operation and the Minister 
responsible for Francophonie, and the member for Kingston and 
the Islands to hold their heads up high, to boast, to brag and to tell 
their constituents that they actually brought about a change in the 
House of Commons which shows that it is independent, that it is 
fair, that the form of debate we have is healthy and that the Chair is 
not prejudiced, even though all the appointments after the election 
of the Speaker are made by the government side.
<P>
	It is very important for the government to think about what it is 
doing. This is an opportunity for it to do something correct. It 
would restore honesty and integrity. It would allow us to help the 
government keep a promise and to show that it is not always 
partisan and that sometimes we can work together to bring about 
positive and constructive change for the good of everybody.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows: the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester-trade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I found my hon. colleague's comments very enlightening; 
suggestions for the Liberal government that make a lot of sense.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence is agreeing with me that his 
comments made a lot of good sense. I am sure he is referring 
specifically to the comments made about himself. I wonder if he 
would comment further on the intervention that was made earlier 
today on this very important subject. The debate we are having, as 
impromptu as it is, cuts to the very essence of why we are in this 
place.
<P>
	If we cannot have an independent Chair in this place it begs the 
question why are we here. What is the purpose if we cannot assure 
that it is a fair and honest debate and we have Chairs with integrity? 
Certainly that has been the case in the past, we expect that in the 
future and we do not question that with regard to the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre put forward a very strong 
case that perhaps the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
should review his decision to let his name stand for this position in 
light of being a co-signer and co-author of this report.
<P>
	As a citizen of this country I have seen too often in the past MPs 
of the old traditional parties in this country, the Liberal Party of 
Canada, the Progressive Conservatives and the New Democrats, try 
as hard as they can to bring about systemic, substantive change to 
the system of government in Canada. We are all aware of them. 
What we see time and time again is that at some point when their 
party becomes government those reforms fall by the wayside. They 
become mere voices in the wilderness crying out for change. Time 
and time again substantive change simply does not happen.
<P>
	Contrary to what the hon. member for Fundy-Royal said earlier 
when he chastised our whip for wasting the time of the House, for 
wasting taxpayer money, if the government would have elected to 
consult with opposition members prior to springing this motion on 
us we would not be in this debate today. It is the government that 
decided to foist this on us rather than consulting the opposition 
members. This runs contrary to red book promises of more 
consultation between all parties in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Would the hon. member for Calgary Centre take a moment to 
give us his opinion on whether this is truly a waste of money to be 
debating this issue in the House today? I feel so strongly about this 
as a matter of principle. I do not see that we are wasting time. If we 
cannot debate this type of issue in this place, then anything else we 
debate is really pointless.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. 
colleague, the member for Prince George-Peace River, for the 
question. The answer to his question is that this is not a waste of 
time. This is very important. It is an issue that tackles the very 
essence of government and of politicians.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	We are talking about integrity. We are talking about trust. We are 
talking about believability. When you knock on doors and ask 
people to vote for you, you stand for something. You have pride, 
you have principles, you  have goals and you have objectives. You 
tell people that you stand for these things. You tell them that you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5755"> 5755 </A></B>
<P>
would do these things if you were government. What frustrates me 
is that once they get elected, once they get here, they do not deliver 
on what they promised. They will not do what they said they are 
going to do.
<P>
	This is what frustrates the Canadian voter. This is what frustrated 
me when I just voted and did not participate in the system. 
Government is really controlled by a very few people. Very few 
people participate in our political system, therefore there is a lot of 
opportunity and chances for people to get here without much effort. 
When they do get here, the system lends itself toward a democratic 
dictatorship. We freely elect a dictator every four to five years.
<P>
	We need some protection and control against that. This House is 
the place where that is done. This House is where the government is 
held accountable and responsible. Members are questioned on their 
competence and integrity. Therefore, accountability, integrity and 
competence are things for which we look and make sure they are 
adhering to them.
<P>
	The Prime Minister makes all these patronage appointments. We 
call it patronage because there are 3,000-plus positions to which 
the Prime Minister can appoint people without review. Yes, we can 
object to them when the names are put forward. It appears that 
every leader who is the head of a government appoints those people 
who either have made the biggest contributions or who have 
worked the hardest on somebody's campaign or who have had long 
term, outstanding commitments to that party or who was a 
candidate and did not get elected.
<P>
	What is hypocritical about the current Prime Minister is this. If 
that is the system and that is the way the game is played, fine. 
Incompetence will surface and that person will eventually be fired.
<P>
	When you are in opposition and you are the leader of the 
opposition like he was for so many years, when he says on this side 
of the House that Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is making 
patronage appointments, that he is only appointing his hacks, his 
supporters, his contributors. Stop. When you get to that side, you 
should not be doing the same thing. He did not change it. This is 
part of politics as well. It is an opportunity for the member for 
Kingston and the Islands and this government to have one member 
from the opposition side as a deputy chair. We could have another 
election on it. This shows that Reform is committed to systemic 
change.
<P>
	The member for Waterloo brought up the question of intellectual 
honesty. The standing orders say that we are supposed to be given 
48 hours' notice for a motion to be presented. We were not. They 
say that we are wasting taxpayers' dollars. They are dictating to us 
who goes where, what happens and when. Therefore the who,  
what, why, where and when should not just be at the whim of the 
government. It should be subjected to opposition commentary.
<P>
	That is why there are rules in the standing orders that we should 
get notice of what is going on. This government has invoked 
closure more times than the previous government that it criticized 
for doing it five times. This government has done it 19 times 
already. We still have a year to go. According to the member for 
Fundy-Royal, there are two more years to go before we have 
another election. They have all that time to keep all these promises. 
I am practising the finance minister's style. I need that pen.
<P>
	He goes: ``Another thing, Madam Chair, I want to tell you about 
this government. I want to tell you about the policies I made. I 
didn't raise taxes. I know the tax base has gone up. I know I have 
reduced exemptions. I know I raised excise taxes. They are up. I 
have not raised taxes. We have done this through sound 
government. We have done this through good government. The 
members on that side don't know what they are talking about''. 
Then they all clap and cheer.
<P>
	The issue is about patronage. The issue is about partisan politics. 
This is an opportunity to take partisan politics outside of it. We 
have to be partisan. We have to fight for those goals and ideas that 
we each believe in, even if we disagree.
<P>
	That chair, the position that you are sitting in, Madam Speaker, is 
a very important one. We have not questioned anybody who has 
been in that chair so far. They have applied the standing rules to the 
best of their ability. What we are saying is that here is a chance to 
improve the system a little more.
<P>
	I know the member for Kingston and the Islands would make a 
good chairperson. I saw him work in the committee on procedure 
and House affairs. That is not the issue. The issue is this. He said 
that he believes that the junior chair should be held by a member 
from the opposition. Therefore, here is his opportunity to help us 
implement his plan and guarantee the independence of the Chair, 
not only talk the talk but walk the walk or do the thing that they 
should do which is right for Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
make my comments reflective of my party. I did hear from a 
member opposite that Reformers are intellectually inconsistent.
<P>
	I remember when this position was open to you, Madam Chair. 
This exact debate went on at that time. We discussed the 
independence of the Chair. We discussed whether or not the 
commitment which was made in the red book should be kept. That 
commitment is extremely important.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5756"> 5756 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Oh, yea. How come you never agreed to do it, 
Grant or Jay or whatever your name is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> There seems to be a fair amount of chatter 
in the House, Madam Speaker. I wonder if you might instruct the 
loudmouth from Halifax to quiet down.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> That is 
definitely unparliamentary language and is not acceptable. Would 
you please excuse yourself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, back to the independence 
of the Chair-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Would the 
hon. member for Macleod please withdraw his words toward the 
hon. member for Halifax?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, I would be happy to 
withdraw.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Well done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, back to the independence 
of the Chair. As you will recall, this debate took place. We asked 
for and continue to ask for a member of the opposition parties to sit 
as deputies in the Speaker's chair. I suppose it will take another 
government to come in from the opposition that really intends to 
keep its promises for that to take place.
<P>
	If the independence of the Chair was important in opposition, 
why is it not important now? I speak to a lot to the youth in high 
schools. Those kids have become cynical about the whole political 
process when they hear promises made in opposition which are not 
kept in government. How many promises have not been kept? We 
could give a litany of those promises which have not been kept. But 
this one for sure has not been kept.
<P>
	How would Reformers be different? What could I say to a 
youthful high school student in Cobourg, where I was last week, 
about how could they be certain Reformers would keep their 
promises? We have made a host of promises in our new platform 
launch. For instance, we have promised that once the budget is 
balanced $4 billion will be returned to health care and education.
<P>
	A high school kid would ask: ``Why should I trust you? Why in 
heaven's name would I listen to you? You are just saying that to get 
elected and once you are elected, you would break your promises''. 
Reformers have a guarantee on our promise which is very specific. 
We believe and will institute a promise which is so important to the 
kids across the country that I am going to say it as plainly as I can. 
Reformers would submit to the Canadian public the right to be able 
to fire a liar. That is as plain and as clear as I can state it. A promise 
made in the fresh start campaign which is unkept will enable the 
Canadian public to fire the liar.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	The example I use in my high school class is one that relates 
directly to them. I say to them, during the election campaign I, the 
member for Macleod, decide that there needs to be a restoration 
facility for old Camaros in a building that is currently unoccupied. I 
found money from Japan. The Japanese love our old cars. They are 
going to come over here and provide the money for this facility. 
This facility, motor work, upholstery work, painted body work, will 
all provide jobs for the high school students in this school. There 
will be advertising and some tourism. We have calculated very 
accurately that the total numbers of jobs will amount to 217. There 
is also enough money in this promise to build a small hotel near the 
abandoned and unoccupied old airport. That hotel would provide 
for the purchasers of that Camaro a place to stay. They want to 
come over and view their very own cars that go through the 
restoration process before they take delivery of it. This involves 
another 30 or 40 jobs.
<P>
	There will be a spinoff from that. There will be bus tours that 
will go from this facility and travel around the country. I promise 
all these things if I am elected: Camaro restoration facility. We will 
be there for sure.
<P>
	Oh boy, they scrub their hands and say: ``Finally somebody 
thinks about the kids''. They elect me and five minutes after 
election I say: ``Ah, sorry kids, the money ran out. The Japanese 
investors walked away. This is the hardest thing I ever had to say to 
you as my electors, but I cannot keep my promise''.
<P>
	I ask the students: What should happen to that politician? It does 
not take them 15 micro seconds to answer: ``Fire the liar. Recall. 
Turf him out. Boot him''. They look right at me and say: ``You had 
better not make that kind of promise''.
<P>
	Here we have that kind of a promise. ``In order to enhance the 
independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce the level of 
partisanship, when the Speaker is from the government party two 
of the junior Chair officers should be from the opposition''. I will 
state publicly that I would vote for a member of the official 
opposition as a matter of principle on this issue. This is not a matter 
of partisanship.
<P>
	I was very pleased to first come into Parliament and have the 
Speaker of the House elected. I considered that to be a significant 
step forward in the democratic process. I was reasonably pleased to 
see this commitment of the Liberals in opposition to take these 
steps when in government.
<P>

-evidence if we had individuals from the opposition as deputy 
chairpersons.
<P>
	How long will it take to have promises kept? I suppose it will 
take only as long as the Canadian public will put up with the sort of 
unkept promises that we have had. How much spin can the 
government put on the red book when its members say that 78 per 
cent of the promises have been kept? I have gone over the major 
promises in the red book. Let me list a few of them. The jobs, jobs, 
jobs one I think is difficult to pin down. There have been some jobs 
from the infrastructure program, temporary jobs though they were.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about a few of the other things: stable funding to the 
CBC, not kept; day care spaces for Canadians, not kept; medicare 
protection, $3 billion per year in provincial transfers dropped, not 
kept; on and on they go, major promises, not minor promises.
<P>
	This one I suppose could be called a minor promise. It is so easy 
to keep. Simply accept a member of the opposition in the position 
of deputy chair. I repeat, for those individuals who say no politician 
will keep their promises, recall is the method to assure that 
happens. If a politician does not keep his or her promise we should 
be able to fire a liar.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member's speech. I heard him mention 
the sort of related topic of when the budget is balanced the promise 
that Reform had made to restore funding that the Liberal 
government has cut for medical programs, medicare. I know that is 
a major concern to Canadians. It is slightly related to what we are 
talking about today. I would really like to get a clarification on that 
from the member. It is something important that Canadians want to 
hear.
<P>
	I know they are disappointed and upset with the long waiting 
lists in medical centres today. It is very difficult to get an operation. 
I have a friend who waited about 18 months for an operation. This 
all stems from a failure to keep a promise to protect an industry that 
is very important to Canadians, just as is the failure to keep this 
promise today regarding the junior chairs.
<P>
	I ask the member if he could expand a little on this aspect of 
restoring faith in a system that has been destroyed by broken 
promises from the other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to explore that a little further. The reason I came to 
Parliament was that medicare as far as I was concerned was under 
some stress. I did pay attention very closely to the promise and 
watched the funding reductions for medicare.
<P>
	Reformers have quite a different view of deficit reduction. We 
believe deficit reduction must have a purpose. That purpose is to 
support and promote the most important social programs that we 
have, medicare being number one, post-secondary education being 
number two. As we reduce those funds down to zero and get the 
interest payments settled down so that they are no longer an 
oppressive burden, cutting things like the MP pension plan and 
transfers to favourite businesses of the government, we can provide 
more money for medicare.
<P>
	The promise is straightforward and a promise that Reformers 
will keep. When the budget is balanced we will put $4 billion of the 
lost money back into medicare and post-secondary education.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues across the way who have not kept their 
promise on medicare to adopt that. Put that money back into 
medicare. Take a page out of the Reform Party fresh start book. 
Medicare is more important than partisan considerations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I had the opportunity to work with the member for 
Macleod in the health committee for a year and a half. We carried 
out a number of studies. As I recall at that time, to follow up on his 
comments that he just made about our health care system, how 
valued our medicare program is to all of us in Canada, how dear it 
is to the Liberal government and the Liberal members of this place, 
we will continue to protect that and those principles that go with it 
in every form, in every manner. We have exemplified that time and 
time again in this House.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	However, I recall a few months ago when the hon. member for 
Macleod suggested that it was quite okay to have a two level 
system in this country in health care, that it was okay to have 
system in which those who had a fat wallet could get the best 
service and those with no money in their pocket could get no 
service at all.
<P>
	It is gratifying this afternoon to hear the hon. member for 
Macleod now say that he agrees with our medicare system and 
wants to support it. That is a move in the right direction. That is the 
first move in the right direction for that party and for the member 
for Macleod. I am delighted to hear him say that.
<P>
	I would ask him to comment on what has caused him to move to 
this great revelation where he has suddenly realized the tremendous 
benefit of the health care system and our medicare system 
regardless of how many dollars Canadians have in their pockets. Is 
the hon. member for Macleod aware of the agreement that was 
made a year ago in the budget where the provinces were guaranteed 
the amount of transfer for social programs and health care and 
where through 1998 those increases will start to go forward and 
where this is exactly what the provinces asked for and what they 
wanted? I ask the member to comment on that. I am delighted to 
see the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5758"> 5758 </A></B>
<P>
revelation of this member and this party in this House on medicare 
in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, it is nice to get some 
praise from my colleague across the way.
<P>
	Let me go back to the original promise from the Reform Party on 
medicare. Our original promise was deficit reduction that would 
not take a penny from medicare. As the deficit got worse, in our 
taxpayers' budget we projected $1.5 billion from the Canada health 
and social transfer, which the Liberals brought in as an obfuscation 
measure in my view, over three years, while my colleagues cut $4.3 
billion over two years.
<P>
	As the deficit reaches the point where it gets to zero, as we are 
able to take those funds that are currently going into interest 
payments, as we shrink government down to a lean and mean 
government rather than a fat, bloated government, we will be able 
to preserve medicare. Reformers simply say to our colleagues let us 
see them trim down the government so that we can save this 
program.
<P>
	They say their program will produce an increase of funds for 
medicare. How much? How many dollars? Reformers have found 
$4 billion per year to put back into medicare and post-secondary 
education. Their promise is a paltry promise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I know time is short for questions and comments but I 
have a question for the hon. member.
<P>
	Earlier the hon. member for Waterloo accused Reformers of 
supporting the Bloc Quebecois and I endeavoured to point out that 
the Liberals have been supportive of the separatists over the past 
three years in this place. We can clearly show that on a number of 
fronts.
<P>
	Could the member elaborate further on his comment that in the 
interests of non-partisanship he is prepared to support a member 
from the Bloc Quebecois over a Liberal to the position of deputy 
chair? The member for Calgary Centre suggested that there be a 
full election. He suggested that there be one name put forward by 
the Bloc, one name put forward by the Reform Party and that the 
House be allowed to decide who the new deputy chair would be.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, that is an excellent 
suggestion. It is one which I believe most members of the House 
would say is a step toward the democratic process.
<P>
	Should there be a partisan consideration? There should not. The 
Chair should be independent, and a free, open and democratic 
election would be ideal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, what is wrong with the House of Commons is 
very well displayed by what is going on in the debate today.
<P>
	When we came to this place in 1993 over 200 members of 
Parliament were new. At that time we did something which all of us 
remember well. We were all on the list for potential Speakers of the 
House. In order not to be on the list of eligible Speakers we had to 
indicate so and our name would be taken off the list. It was open to 
any member from any party with any tenure.
<P>
	The reality is for the most part the members with tenure in this 
place, members who had been here in previous Parliaments, were 
the most logical candidates to run for the position of Speaker of the 
House. Therefore it was only logical when the voting took place 
that we were voting for Liberal members.
<P>
	It was a rather exciting evening in this place because the ballot 
went to three votes. There was a tie ballot after the second vote. It 
was a very exciting time. We made a choice and we have all lived 
with that choice. The Speaker who was selected that evening is the 
Speaker we still have today. We have all been very comfortable 
with the choice we made that evening.
<P>
	Now we are discussing the appointment of a deputy chair. Why 
should deputy chairs be arrived at in any different form than the 
Speaker? That is the core of the question. If deputy chairs are 
strictly government appointments, then we are demeaning this 
place.
<P>
	I would like to endorse the comments of the member for Calgary 
Centre. An appropriate vehicle in the current circumstances would 
be to have a nomination from the Bloc and a nomination from 
Reform. There is one vacancy. We could have an election. That 
would be consistent with the recommendation that was made. It 
would enhance the non-partisan nature of the Chair.
<P>
	The British practice has been mentioned, which alternates the 
Chair positions between government and opposition. Thus, if the 
Speaker were from the government party, such as is the case now, 
then the deputy speaker would be from the opposition, the next 
officer would be from the government, and so forth.
<P>
	The government knows that this debate is going on in the House 
today. I hope there is someone who is empowered to make a 
decision other than the nominee who was announced. It was 
assumed, from all signs, that his appointment would be 
immediately adopted by this House.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	Who is making an issue out of this? The Reform members are. 
Why are we making an issue out of this? I have explained some of 
the background. Time after time in this House of Commons the 
Reform caucus has done its job. Reform has done its homework 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5759"> 5759 </A></B>
<P>
and is  representing the interests of Canadians. We are representing 
due process, or what we see due process should consist of.
<P>
	We have heard time after time that we are the third party. 
Government members take great delight in calling us the third 
party. As an MP from British Columbia, I know what a struggle it is 
to represent all interests in this Parliament.
<P>
	I believe in the last Parliament there were 43 or 44 members of 
the New Democratic Party in this House of Commons. I have 
talked to some of those members and I know what a difficult time 
they felt they had in this environment to get their message out. 
Under the circumstances Reform has done quite well in that regard. 
I make that point because an effective opposition in this place is 
very important.
<P>
	There was a recommendation by an opposition member at the 
time in developing party policy which then became a government 
policy document. It was enlightened and would lead to one subtle 
movement toward creating a more non-partisan and better 
Parliament. We are seeing an attempt to cripple Reform and the 
opposition at every turn because the government feels threatened. 
This is quite inappropriate. There is a singular focus on Reform in 
this case because it is recognized as the only party that can replace 
the government.
<P>
	Will the government accept the amendment the Reform Party 
has put forward today? I have a great concern that it will not. Why 
would I say that? Because the signs and symptoms are all there.
<P>
	We have all had experiences at the committee level. I have been 
through elections and consistently I have seen that no Liberals have 
voted for adoption of a Reform vice-chair to any committee and all 
Liberals have supported vice-chairs from the Bloc.
<P>
	In my last experience with an election in committee, at the time 
of the nomination of a Bloc vice-chair, I asked that the Bloc 
vice-chair explain his position on the northern Cree in Quebec 
should the PQ make a unilateral declaration of independence. That 
was a litmus test as to the suitability and appropriateness of 
whether or not that Bloc member should qualify as vice-chair. In 
response the Liberals said that it was irrelevant and voted against 
making it a debatable motion.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	The government has shown on many occasions that it does not 
want to share and it does not want to consult. I endorse the idea put 
forward by the member for Calgary Centre that we have elections 
from the opposition. We will see how that stacks up for this deputy 
chair position, a non-partisan election, a free vote.
<P>
	Why is it whenever the Liberals are held to debate on an issue, 
that if they know they cannot win based on the  logic of the debate, 
they turn it into a procedural debate? That is what they did in 
committee when I brought forward a motion for debate about the 
northern Cree in Quebec. There was no attempt or any desire to 
upset the Bloc or to upset the Quebec agenda but rather than debate 
the issue, a procedural argument was brought in so that debate 
could be avoided.
<P>
	If government members cannot turn it into a procedural debate, 
they turn it into a personality issue. We have seen that in the debate 
we are having today. Or they turn it into a partisan issue; we have 
seen that in the debate today; or fill in the blank. We just saw 
another fill in the blank which was to turn it into a medicare issue. I 
am puzzled as to how that relates to the election of a deputy 
speaker, but that is where we ended up in this debate.
<P>
	Two-thirds of the members were new to this House in 1993. We 
have fallen a long way from that heady idealism of 1993. I would 
like to see us move forward. I would like to see this amended 
motion or some other compromise adopted, such as the one put 
forward by our member for Calgary Centre. We should not put 
ourselves in the position of entrenching that it will be done the way 
it was done before because that is the way it has always been done. 
That seems to be where the government is coming from at this 
moment.
<P>
	If we look at western democracies, when Canada has a majority 
government it has every potential of having all the signs and 
symptoms of an elected dictatorship. We do not have the checks 
and balances of other western democracies. Looking to the south of 
us, the U.S. president is given a veto power. That is done for a 
reason. It is because they have a Congress and a Senate which act 
quite independently. They do not have the entrenched party 
discipline system we have seen from the old parties in Canada. It is 
a two-edged sword. In the United States, this has a tendency at 
times to handcuff the government but on the other hand, it makes 
the government more responsive.
<P>
	What implication does it have for Canada? The major 
implication it has for Canada is that the party that forms the 
government has an even larger onus placed upon it to fulfil its 
election promises because we do not have all those other checks 
and balances. This was recognized very early by the Reform Party. 
It is why we set out such a detailed platform document prior to the 
last federal election.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	I believe it was that document which led to the development of 
the red book by the current government. The Liberals had to have a 
platform to respond to our platform. We are seeing that all over 
again in the lead up to the 1997 federal election. Reform now has 
its fresh start platform. We are setting the agenda and we are going 
to see the Liberal Party once again do the same thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5760"> 5760 </A></B>
<P>
	My point is, this is a singular contributing reason why it is so 
important that government-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I heard the 
hon. member say earlier that the debate was going off track. I am 
wondering how his comments relate in any way to the motion 
before the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, in these debates we give 
members as much latitude as we possibly can. I know that the hon. 
member is going to tie in all his remarks and make his debate very 
coherent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the reason this is all so important is 
that it is very important that the government meet its promises. It is 
an election promise which is still outstanding. We want the 
government to fulfil its promise.
<P>
	In summary, I wish to endorse the idea put forward by the 
member for Calgary Centre that we have an election for the 
position of deputy speaker based on names put forward by the 
opposition generically.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
North Island-Powell River raised a very relevant point in his 
presentation in relating what is happening here today to what 
happens with regularity in committee. That is the collusion of this 
government with the official opposition to cause vice-chairs to be 
selected by appointment, and there is no other word for it other than 
appointment, rather than by election. We want the position under 
discussion today be an elected one. We also want all other 
important functions outside of the House, in committee, done by a 
fair election, preferably by secret ballot.
<P>
	Does the hon. member for North Island-Powell River think that 
would be practical?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of things that could be 
done by committee. In the transition, I am sure some things which 
are now done by appointment would be laborious for a committee. 
However, once everyone recognized the ground rules, that all 
parties would have access to all information relating to those 
appointments, then I think it could be a very smooth process.
<P>
	What could be better in terms of ensuring that blatant patronage 
is taken out of the appointment process than ensuring that all 
parties have a chance to blow the whistle on an individual if there is 
a problem? In the long run it would be in the interests of the 
government because it would lead to better appointments and it 
would also bring buy-in from all political persuasions in terms of 
who the appointed people were.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore yes, I think democracy is hard work. We all know that. 
However, this is a major move forward in terms of responsive 
democracy if we could make the kind of changes that my colleague 
has suggested.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the speech by the member for North 
Island-Powell River and the point he raised regarding democracy. 
I compare that to the point raised by the member for Fundy-Royal 
earlier on this afternoon, complaining about using House time to 
debate this motion.
<P>
	There seems to be a fairly stark contrast between the concept of 
democracy on this side of the House and the concept of democracy 
on that side of the House. I think we believe in the concept that we 
debate the issues, we come to a conclusion, we vote and we apply 
the best exercise of our judgment.
<P>
	On that side of the House members seem to say: ``Let us crack 
the whip, everybody toe the party line and that is how we arrive at 
decisions on votes in the House''.
<P>
	My question for the member for North Island-Powell River is 
as a parliamentarian and not as a politician. I think this afternoon 
we are speaking as parliamentarians who are debating a motion 
regarding occupying the chair which you sit in, Mr. Speaker, during 
your absence. It is a very important role that the person would play. 
We as parliamentarians should be very much concerned about the 
decorum of this House and how we represent our constituents from 
one side of the country to the other.
<P>
	How does the member for North Island-Powell River feel or 
think he would feel when he talks to the people in his constituency 
and tells them that this place where we protect democracy, this 
bastion of democracy and free speech, has been eroded by the 
process that has gone on here this afternoon where we have had to 
stand up and argue for a policy proposed by the Liberal government 
and on which it ran in the last election and said ``if you elect us we 
will deliver this''?
<P>
	All we are asking is that the Liberals fulfil their commitment. 
Yet we have had the complete and absolute refusal on their part to 
acknowledge this.
<P>
	Also, how does the member feel, not as a politician but as a 
parliamentarian, back in his constituency when he is talking to his 
constituents and the people of Canada asking if this House is being 
debased or is this Liberal government really upholding the 
traditions of democracy in this land?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, how do we separate ourselves in this 
Parliament from the democratic process and talk of ourselves in 
terms of the political process? I believe that my colleague's 
opening comment is probably the most appropriate. I believe that 
the Reformers in the House have a very different view of 
democracy than the other members in the House. Perhaps it is one 
of the main planks in our platform.
<P>
	I have been constantly amazed at how some of our fundamental 
tenets, things that underpin us philosophically and resonate back 
home, are still denied  by the old parties in the House. There is still 
a complete misunderstanding among many members in the House 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5761"> 5761 </A></B>
<P>
as to what a free vote actually means to a Reform member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	In terms of discipline, we heard my colleague talk about 
cracking the whip. We have a much different view of discipline as 
well. When it comes to the fundamental principles of democracy, I 
do think we are talking about what appears to be a small item here, 
when we are talking about deputy speakers. It is not a small item. I 
have talked and I am sure every one of my colleagues has talked 
about the behaviour of the Speaker or deputy speaker in various 
circumstances that have happened over the last three years in this 
House. Certainly not in your case, Mr. Speaker, but yes, there have 
been some concerns about individual decisions or postures or 
behaviours of various deputy speakers.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	There are times in this House when there are not firm guidelines. 
There is free speech in this place and the deputy speaker does set 
the tone when the Speaker is not in the chair. It is of fundamental 
importance that the deputy speaker have all-party support in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
curious that with the comments my colleague just made I am sure 
that he concurs with me that there is the issue of settling disputes 
from time to time and the impartiality of the Speaker. In this case 
that is not the issue with respect to the member we are talking 
about.
<P>
	What we are talking about here I believe is the issue, the most 
fundamental principle, that this government made a promise and it 
is not keeping the promise. That is what this debate is about. This is 
a pivotal point in this Parliament, that the government once again is 
not keeping its word.
<P>
	The issue of the member for Kingston and the Islands, as my 
colleague has said, really is not the issue. The member himself is 
not the issue; the principle is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad one of my colleagues was 
listening so closely to the way in which something may have been 
interpreted by someone reading <I>Hansard</I> .Yes, indeed, I fully 
concur with my colleague's statements that we are not talking 
about the calibre or qualifications of the member from the Liberal 
Party who has been nominated. We are talking about the issue of 
deputy speaker appointments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are debating two 
things simultaneously today. Primarily and foremost of course is 
the matter of the appointment of the Deputy Chairman of 
Committee of the Whole, but we are also discussing and have 
discussed at some length the failure of the government to support 
and live up to a promise which is contained in the famous red book.
<P>
	There are some members opposite who have read it. There are 
some who, we found by their own admission today, have not. 
Nevertheless, this is the holy bible of the Government of Canada, 
Le petit livre rouge du président, s'il vous plaît. I would refer to it 
as the red book of musings, a list of promises to be kept if 
convenient and ignored if inconvenient.
<P>
	The other day we heard that 78 per cent of the promises in this 
infamous document have been kept.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	I had a rather interesting conversation on the day the 
announcement was made with a very devout Liberal. I use the word 
devout advisedly because every time the Prime Minister's name is 
mentioned in this lady's presence she genuflects. Her exact words 
were: ``My, but it must be nice to be able to write your own report 
card''. That statement was made by a Liberal.
<P>
	Let us forget about this fraudulent red book for a moment and 
consider the public position of the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands. He wrote a very scholarly report in which he 
recommended, without reservation, that two of the deputy speakers 
be chosen from among members of the opposition. There is no 
equivocation about that. That was his professional opinion. I would 
submit that it was a very sound opinion.
<P>
	I have seen the hon. member sitting opposite. When this 
particular matter is raised he laughs quite openly. His head is rolled 
back and his hands are out. He finds it hilarious. I would submit 
that rather than taking this as a big joke, perhaps he should be 
reconsidering his contradictory position and withdrawing his name 
for consideration for this appointment.
<P>
	It has been suggested by members opposite that if the 
government did accept the recommendations of the member for 
Kingston and the Islands and appointed someone from this side of 
the House that they would be duty bound to appoint a separatist 
because they form the official opposition. I do not know where that 
idea comes from. Certainly there is nothing in the standing orders 
which would suggest that it would have to be done that way. As a 
matter of fact, they have already bestowed an awful lot of 
positions, benefits, goodies, whatever you want to call them, on 
their dear friends in the official opposition by appointing every 
single committee vice-chair from that particular caucus.
<P>
	Rather than get into a cat fight over that particular issue, I have a 
modest proposal, which is made on the assumption that the 
amendment we are now debating will be defeated. The government 
can do anything it wishes in the House. If our amendment is 
defeated and if the member for Kingston and the Islands will 
reconsider his contradictory position, my proposal is that this 
appointment should be from one of the smaller groups in the 
House. My modest proposal-and I hope it is not out of order-is 
that consideration be given to the member for Yukon. I think that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5762"> 5762 </A></B>
<P>
would be acceptable to all and sundry, certainly on this side of the 
House.
<P>
	That is not a motion. If it were it would be out of order. However, 
if we did that it would eliminate the taint of blatant patronage.
<P>
	Speaking of patronage, since we have veered rather steeply into 
that area in this debate, I find it rather interesting that both my 
Liberal opponent in the 1993 election and his campaign manager 
have received very lucrative appointments to federal boards. How 
does that square with the red book of maybes, or the red book of 
possibilities?
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	I hope the government and particularly the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands will give some thought to what I have said 
today. My proposal is made in all sincerity. If lightning strikes and 
the heavens fall and our amendment is actually accepted by this 
House, then my proposal will become redundant and will be of no 
importance. Since I do not expect that to happen, I wish that in 
order to instil a little more democracy in this place and a little more 
respect-
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NOTICEOFCLOSUREMOTION">NOTICE OF CLOSURE MOTION</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I 
wish to give notice that with respect to the consideration of the 
motion now before the House, at the next sitting I shall move, 
pursuant to Standing Order 57, that debate be not further 
adjourned.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The notice of motion is in order. I notice on my 
clock that 60 seconds have elapsed. The member will have those 
extra 60 seconds. The hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia on debate.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="APPOINTMENTOFDEPUTYCHAIRMAN">APPOINTMENT OF DEPUTY CHAIRMAN</A></H4>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, the 60 seconds do not matter 
because I was just winding up my speech.
<P>
	In all sincerity I hope the government will give some 
consideration to my suggestion that someone who is totally neutral 
be appointed to the position and that that someone be an 
independent. Perhaps it would be the person I suggested or perhaps 
someone else. If such a procedure were followed, it would at least 
do away with the acrimony and would give greater respect to the 
office of deputy chairman.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the presentation of my hon. colleague from Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia, the hon. minister made an 
intervention which called for the extension of this debate at the 
next sitting of the House. This intervention is quite interesting in 
that there are no Liberal members presently debating the issue.
<P>
	It is interesting because we on this side of the House view this as 
a matter of principle, that the Liberal government would bring 
forward an appointment at this time after three years in office 
without even paying any attention to its own promise. Then it turns 
around and tries to convince the Canadian electorate that it has 
done everything humanly possible to live up to the expectations of 
the Canadian public, the expectations that the Canadian public had 
following the Liberal government's election in October 1993.
<P>
	It is very disturbing to me that the Liberals consider this issue to 
have no importance, that they will not even rise in this place to 
debate this issue with Reformers. It is very disturbing. One of my 
hon. colleagues points out, probably correctly, that it is simply 
because there are no arguments. There is nothing they can say to 
defend their position which runs so contrary to their own red book 
promise.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague put forward as an alternative a proposal that 
should our amendment to this motion for an appointment to the 
deputy chair's position be defeated, as I am quite sure it will be, 
perhaps the government would look beyond the partisanship of 
appointing someone from the official opposition, from the Bloc 
Quebecois, or from the Reform Party of Canada, and look at the 
option of appointing one of the independent members.
<P>
	It is certainly a very generous gesture on the part of my 
colleague to call for that consideration. However would the 
member consider the suggestion, in light of what the hon. member 
for Calgary Centre suggested earlier, that if our amendment were to 
fail, the government's first option be to have an open, honest and 
clear election for that position with the only candidates coming 
from the opposition ranks? Of course that would include the 
independents as well. They could submit names and have an 
election for that position rather than an appointment. Would he 
consider that as the first option, with a fall back position of the 
government appointing someone from the ranks of the 
independents?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, my generosity is exceeded only 
by my eloquence and I do appreciate the comments.
<P>
	I have to accept what has been said by the hon. member for 
Prince George-Peace River. Certainly, the ideal would be to have 
an election, as has been suggested by several members during this 
debate. However I deal with realities. I know the government does 
not like elections for anything. In this instance, if it could make an 
appointment that would be more palatable on the basis of 
non-partisanship, it would be a compromise. Certainly, if I had my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5763"> 5763 </A></B>
<P>
druthers, I would like to see the position filled by an honest free 
election, preferably by secret ballot.
<P>
	With respect to the matter of the parliamentary secretary and the 
request to extend debate, I hope he did that so that the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands will have the opportunity to stand and 
explain at great length and in great detail the contradictions 
between his position while in opposition and his current position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wanted to double check with the member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia to make certain that he agrees 
this debate is not about the qualifications or the standing of the 
member for Kingston and the Islands. This debate is not about his 
ability to fill the chair in place of the Speaker. We all know he is a 
very decent chap.
<P>
	During the summertime, he took a ride on the Rocky 
Mountaineer Railway on the west coast from Vancouver to 
Kamloops and beyond. He probably thinks he understands the west 
now as a result of that trip. We all know he is a very decent chap. 
He gives wonderfully enthralling speeches here in the House. We 
really do like him.
<P>
	I would like the member to actually confirm that this is not an 
attack on that member but that this is really a strike-out for the 
fulfilment of a promise made by the government and a strike-out 
for democracy.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I would never dream of 
attacking the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. In fact if 
he does reconsider his contradictory position on this issue, we 
would continue to enjoy his presence on the other side of the 
House. If he does accept the position in the end, we will miss him 
terribly. He is a man who adds a little bit of spice-I might say 
frivolity but I will not-but I am not attacking the member for 
Kingston and the Islands in any guise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today's debate arose from a situation the government created. It 
was the straw that broke the camel's back when the government 
failed to give the customary 48 hours notice of the motion it 
brought forward regarding the junior chair. If the government had 
not done that today, we would probably not have had this 
opportunity to talk about the broken promise that we have on the 
other side.
<P>
	I would reiterate that this is definitely not an attack on the 
member for Kingston and the Islands, although by his own 
admission in this House he does not read the bills. Perhaps if he 
were the Speaker it would be an opportunity for him to read the 
bills, to follow every debate in great detail and to assist us with his 
knowledge of the rules.
<P>
	If it had not been for the fact that the government had failed to 
keep a promise and then exacerbated the situation by not giving 48 
hours notice, we would not be discussing this situation today.
<P>
	The plain fact is it is a real mystery to the majority of Canadians 
why this government continually supports or seems to act in ways 
that support the official opposition instead of recognizing the 
contribution that is made by the Reform Party of Canada which 
represents a greater number of provinces and a greater number of 
interests across the country. There is a good case to be made for 
having a member from the Reform Party as one of the deputy 
speakers. It would be a good idea to put it to a vote in this House.
<P>
	I know it is not the motion before us, but support seems to be 
gathering as we go through this debate today to have an election as 
we did for the Speaker. Because it was done by a secret ballot, 
whoever was elected through that process would have no idea who 
cast the ballots that elected him or her and it would be guaranteed 
to be impartial. Because of that, he or she would rely upon a good 
relationship with the members in this House to retain that position 
in to the future. I strongly support the idea of an election and I hope 
we will move to that, if not in the short term, certainly in the long 
term.
<P>
	I refer to the report ``Reviving Parliamentary Democracy: The 
Liberal Plan for House of Commons and Electoral Reform''. In 
fact, the member for Kingston and the Islands was one of the 
authors of the report. I have it here and I know I cannot use props so 
I cannot hold it up. I quote from a passage on page 9 which is 
headed ``The Independence of the Chair'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10. In order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce 
the level of partisanship, when the Speaker is from the government party, two of the 
junior Chair officers should be from the opposition, so that the four presiding officer 
positions are shared equally by government and opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That position is actually supported by the member for Kingston 
and the Islands.
<P>
	It is a shame that this government has not put itself in the 
position of keeping this promise. It is very disturbing and if the 
government had not irritated us by failing to keep this promise, we 
would not be in this debate today.
<P>
	Perhaps in the long run it will turn out for the best because it has 
brought attention to the issue. The government side has been 
unable to put up any speakers to counter the arguments. It has been 
incapable of defending its position and it has now done the 
disgusting thing of moving notice of closure on this discussion. 
The government is going to close us down so that we cannot have a 
decent debate on the issue. Frankly, the government members do 
not want to discuss it.
<P>
	We have heard about the terrible reputation of the Mulroney 
government in moving closure and closing down debate in this 
place. This government that talked  about more free votes, talked 
about appointing junior chairs from the opposition, has moved 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5764"> 5764 </A></B>
<P>
closure four times as often as the Mulroney government. It is 
striking out for new records in that respect.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister loves to claim during question period that he 
is only adhering to the well established traditions of parliamentary 
democracy. Maybe he has not bothered to take a look at what is 
happening in other parliamentary democracies in the 30 years he 
has been here. He is still working under the same rules he learned 
30 years ago.
<P>
	If he had bothered to take a little look when he was on one of his 
trips to the U.K., he would have noticed that it is quite common in 
the mother of Parliaments for members to vote with members on 
the opposite side. It happens a couple of hundred times a year. 
There are no penalties for that. People do not get tossed out of 
caucus. It is one of those things that has developed as Parliament 
matured.
<P>
	Unfortunately the Canadian Parliament is mired in the old ways 
of doing things. It has not caught up with the information age. It 
really is one of the most backward institutions in the world today.
<P>
	As many members know, I am from New Zealand and there have 
been dramatic changes there in the parliamentary system. It would 
not be faced with a debate about filling junior chair positions from 
the opposition benches. In New Zealand the government 
introduced the initiative and referendum. It has a mixed member 
proportional system of electing members and it has really shown 
creativity in adapting the parliamentary system to the information 
age.
<P>
	Meanwhile, here in Canada we remain mired in the ways of the 
past, in what the Prime Minister likes to call tradition. ``More free 
votes'' he said. I guess if we had one he could say that he had 
fulfilled his promise of more free votes. I do not think that is what 
the Canadian people thought he meant by more free votes. 
Certainly it has been a major disappointment.
<P>
	I write a weekly column for a newspaper in my riding, the <I>North 
Shore News</I>. I had already put together the material for next week's 
report. It is just by pure coincidence that it dealt with promises that 
had been made by this government. It is very appropriate that I 
raise it today.
<P>
	The promise that has been broken today by refusing to allow the 
appointment of a junior chair from the opposition benches is just 
one of a long list of broken promises. My colleague for Kootenay 
East actually put together a list of the top 10 broken promises. I 
think it is probably appropriate that there be some exposure of 
those right here in this Chamber.
<P>
	Obviously number one on the top of the list would be the jobs, 
jobs, jobs promise which is in chapter 1 of the red book. Instead of 
jobs, jobs, jobs we are stuck with 1.4 million unemployed, 500,000 
Canadians looking for work, youth unemployment at 18 per cent or 
higher, and polls showing one in four Canadians to be worried 
about the security of their jobs.
<P>
	Second on the list from the member for Kootenay East is 
preserving and protecting medicare. We have already heard some 
discussion in the debate today about the tremendous cutbacks there 
have been in the transfers in support of medicare across the 
country. Meanwhile, members of the government stride around the 
country saying what a wonderful job they have done, paying lip 
service to the protection of medicare while they busily cut the 
funding, creating longer wait lists, probably creating the possibility 
that people die while on those waiting lists.
<P>
	If we look at the figures, by the 1998-99 fiscal year the present 
government will have cut $7 billion from social transfers to the 
provinces, completely contradictory to the promises made on page 
74 of the red book.
<P>
	It is just like the promise made about appointing deputy or junior 
chairs-broken promises. As much as the Liberals try to say they 
have kept their promises, even the ones we can kind of give them 
some credit for keeping, are only kept in a sort of halfway manner.
<P>
	When they talk about keeping their promises on the debt and 
deficit, if we really look deeply we would find that they have cut 
the heart out of some programs in order to give the appearance of 
making progress, while at the same time increasing our total debt 
by almost $100 billion in three years.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shameful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> That, frankly, as one of my 
colleagues says, is shameful. They are trying to deceive the public 
into thinking that things have been achieved and promises have 
been kept when they really have not.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	One of the favourite promises was to scrap, kill and abolish the 
GST. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister made 
good use of that on the campaign trail. Boy, did they whoop that 
one up. When they were asked how would they do it, they just said: 
``Wait till after the election. Do not ask me now. Ask me after the 
election''. My goodness they did not take long to break that 
promise.
<P>
	Now we have this unsuccessful attempt to have every province 
buy into a scheme to harmonize the GST with the PST and create 
all sorts of new distortions and dissatisfactions like the tax on 
books. We are faced now with all manner of new problems instead 
of curing the basic problems that are there with the most hated tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5765"> 5765 </A></B>
<P>
in Canada, the GST. That just came from yet another broken 
promise of this government.
<P>
	I know there is one here that strikes a cord with a number of 
people in my riding. One of the broken promises is stable 
multi-year funding for the CBC. What a joke.
<P>
	The Reform Party was attacked during the 1993 election for 
telling the truth about the subsidies to the CBC and the need to cut 
some of the fat out of that organization. What happens? The 
government says it will never cut a thing, and cuts much more than 
the Reform had ever said it would cut. How the government gets 
away with breaking these promises I do not know.
<P>
	Promise number six was to renegotiate NAFTA, red book, page 
24. Two months after taking power the Prime Minister signed 
NAFTA. Thank goodness he did. If we had not had free trade 
helping this country stay afloat we would be in deep trouble today. 
However, the Liberals made a promise and they did not keep it.
<P>
	Then we have-my goodness, this is a hot one that we have had 
fun with the last couple of weeks-a code of conduct for 
politicians, red book, page 95. There has not been a new code. The 
Prime Minister only uses his secret ministerial guidelines when it 
suits him to do so. In the U.K. the guidelines are made public. In 
fact the whip of the Reform Party had a copy of the guidelines from 
the U.K. in the House just a week or so ago. It is a large book that 
sets out all of the rules to which ministers of the crown have to 
adhere in order to be ethical. What a change it would be here if we 
had something like that.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister wants to claim that he is keeping with the 
traditions of parliamentary democracy, let him produce his ethical 
guidelines for ministers. Let the public read them so that everyone 
can understand what is happening on that side of the House.
<P>
	Then we have number eight, appointments based on competence, 
red book, page 92. I do not want to embarrass anybody by naming 
names in the House. I know there are a lot of people can identify a 
couple of hundred Liberal patronage appointments. I know the 
member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia mentioned 
this amazing thing that happened in his riding. Two people who 
were Liberal supporters suddenly were qualified to take up 
amazing jobs on parole boards and receive wonderful rewards for 
their loyalty to the Liberal Party. We see that happening right 
across the country. It happens in my riding. Liberal supporters are 
being rewarded with blatant patronage appointments.
<P>
	The number nine promise was more free votes with which I 
already dealt earlier. I should mention the red book page number in 
case there is anybody out there who has not used the red book for 
firewood yet. They can read it on page 92. The Prime Minister has 
only permitted one free vote in three years-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> That was prearranged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> That was prearranged, yes, 
thank you very much to my colleague for reminding me.
<P>
	The number ten promise was that the Liberals would eliminate 
trade barriers between the provinces, red book, page 22. We know 
that those have not been eliminated. In fact, those trade barriers are 
still costing the economy between $6 billion and $10 billion a year.
<P>
	We are back at the beginning again. A situation developed today 
because the government did not keep its promise. Despite all the 
hoopla at its convention during the weekend, despite all the 
resolutions that were rammed through so fast that we all got wind 
burn, as mentioned by the whip, we are debating an issue that is 
very important. It is related to democracy in this House.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	We really should object to this closure motion that has been 
moved. We should request that the government stand up and 
support democracy and allow a member of an opposition party to 
be appointed as a junior Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
found the member's comments in reference to this amendment 
quite enlightening. It is always good to hear the performance of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Non-performance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Or the non-performance, as pointed out. I think the 
member for Vancouver North expressed it quite well in outlining 
all the broken promises.
<P>
	I too had an opportunity to look at point No. 10 which was the 
reason for this debate today. Point No. 10 deals with the 
independence of the Chair and the reduction in the level of 
partisanship. Those are certainly worthy statements to make.
<P>
	I also looked a little further. As the member for Vancouver North 
mentioned, in the early part of the Liberal red book it states that 
mounting criticism of the House of Commons and its proceedings 
reflect the frustration of citizens and parliamentarians alike with 
the continuing failure of Parliament to address effectively the 
problems that face us.
<P>
	Here we have a statement in the red book with some definite 
outlines which the Liberals say they are going to change. 
Unfortunately, as the member for Vancouver North outlined, they 
are not going to do that. They have already fallen short on their 
promises and it has only been three years.
<P>
	In the Reform Party's platform we outline two visions of 
Canada, an old vision and a new vision. The old vision is about the 
Liberals and the Conservatives and how they like big government, 
how they like to spend, how they like to increase taxes and how 
they like to feed the big spending machine that was created by 
them.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5766"> 5766 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like the member for Vancouver North to outline the new 
vision of Canada that Reformers would like to see. I would 
encourage him to give in as much detail as possible the new vision 
that we see for Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member for North Vancouver has one minute left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish I could 
do this in one minute. The fresh start platform of the Reform Party 
of Canada is worthy of at least a 20 minute speech. It is really 
unfortunate that I am not going to have enough time to do that. If I 
can relate it to one thing the member mentioned, it is this whole 
issue of partisanship and the need to get rid of that. Part of the 
Reform vision of Canada is getting rid of the partisanship. We want 
to appoint people based on their skills and competence with open 
tendering and a much more open style of government.
<P>
	Partisanship leads to waste and to the sort of situation that we 
saw last week with an $87 million interest free loan being given to 
a company like Bombardier with billions of dollars in assets and 
quite capable of funding itself. Eighty-seven million is a tiny drop 
in the bucket to Bombardier. It is totally ridiculous to have a 
situation like that going on. It is being done clearly for partisanship 
reasons. Everybody in the country can see that is the reason. There 
simply is no need for it. Reform would put an end to that.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRADE">TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the United States through the Helms-Burton bill 
is seeking to expand its embargo against Cuba to other countries, 
including Canada, by alleging so-called rights to United States 
property in Cuba. The United States is holding itself up as the 
censor of potential foreign investment in sectors which may 
include former United States property.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	The United States believes that the property formerly owned by 
United States citizens cannot be freely used in Cuba and that it 
truly belongs to those who live in the United States and is not and 
will not be the property of the present Cuban government and will 
at some time be renegotiated back to the American people.
<P>
	It claims, moreover, that international law requires the 
Government of Cuba to pay top, adequate and effective 
compensation.
<P>
	A constituent of mine, Dr. Tarjei Tennessen, has done some very 
extensive research for me and this is why I have brought this 
question before the House.
<P>
	There is no United States property in Cuba as far as international 
law is concerned. Ownership of such property was transferred to 
the Cuban people through a process of nationalization in 
conformity with international law, which was carried out through 
expropriation by exercising the power of article 24 of the Cuban 
constitution of 1940 and the corresponding articles of the 
fundamental law of February 7, 1959.
<P>
	Moreover, the property of the United States in Cuba was 
liquidated under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1964 
of the Cuba program of the United States Foreign Claims 
Settlement Commission and converted into bonds.
<P>
	We have been criticized unduly for coddling Cuba and for being 
soft on the Cuban communist regime.
<P>
	The document in this research indicates that the Americans are 
bullying countries for trading, openly and fairly, with Cuba, that 
they are using external legislation over extraterritorial matters 
which were settled very legitimately some years ago through 
international law.
<P>
	In the months following the triumph of the revolution of 1959 
the United States government began harassing the country in open 
opposition. The nationalization of United States property began 
again in 1960 in response to continuous attacks on Cuban economic 
targets, combined with United States domination of all basic 
sectors of activity in the country and the need, as the Americans 
suggested, to consolidate the new economic, political and social 
process in Cuba.
<P>
	In 1960 the president of the republic and the Prime Minister 
acted to provide jointly, through resolutions, the nationalization by 
expropriation of property in Cuba belonging to natural or juridical 
persons having the status of United States nationals.
<P>
	The transparency of the procedure instituted by the Cuban 
authorities is not only recognized by international law courts in the 
United States itself, but it has been confirmed by the validity under 
international legislation of the Cuban nationalization process in 
law suits brought forward by United States nationals.
<P>
	I would suggest that Cuba negotiated in a transparent and open 
fashion the very timely payment of compensation through lump 
sum agreements concluded and implemented with Canada, France, 
Spain and Switzerland. Also, agreements were reached with other 
countries.
<P>
	This open, transparent nationalization of property by Cuba is 
what the question is today. I ask the Minister for International 
Trade are we soft on Cuba. Are we condoning a communist regime 
in Cuba or are we trading in an open and competitive fashion?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5767"> 5767 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with a great 
deal of pleasure that I rise to address this question on behalf of 
the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	The question of the Helms-Burton legislation has been before 
Parliament and indeed before the court of world opinion for the last 
number of months. It is clearly the position of the Canadian 
government, supported by the European Union, the Mexican 
government and a number of international forums that this is an 
extraterritorial application of U.S. law, that it is inappropriate and a 
fundamental breach of international conventions and international 
law.
<P>
	The member raised some very interesting points and the 
government would agree with the points she has raised. Number 
one is that it is up to an individual state whether it expropriates or 
nationalizes property. Indeed in the past and in the present day even 
in Canada we have cases where the Canadian government or the 
provinces or their creatures, the municipalities, can expropriate 
under the Expropriation Act.
<P>
	What is at issue here is not whether expropriation is legal and 
should be undertaken, it is whether proper compensation has been 
done.
<P>
	The issues the hon. member raised are correct. The United States 
government has followed a 30 year path of isolation with Cuba. 
That simply has not worked. We have gone a different path.
<P>
	In 1980 the Canadian government settled on behalf of Canadians 
any outstanding issues of compensation for expropriation. Most 
countries have done that. The U.S. has simply refused to do it.
<P>
	At the end of the day, it introduced legislation which is in and of 
itself a violation of international law. I would agree with the hon. 
member opposite and would say to her that the actions that the 
Canadian government has taken are to protect the interests of 
Canadian companies which find themselves challenged or 
potentially threatened by this extraterritorial application of U.S. 
law.
