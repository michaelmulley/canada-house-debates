<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRECLEARANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (for the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs)</B> moved that Bill S-22, an act authorizing the United 
States to preclear travellers and goods in Canada for entry into 
the United States for the purposes of customs, immigration, 
public health, food inspection and plant and animal health, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to speak today on 
Bill S-22, the preclearance act which was introduced in the House 
yesterday.  This is a good news bill for Canada and Canadian 
travellers.  It is a key element in Canada's efforts to modernize 
our border with the United States while at the same time 
maintaining Canada's sovereignty and protecting the rights and 
freedoms of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before explaining how this bill does exactly that, I will 
briefly tell members what preclearance is and how Canadians have 
and will benefit from these services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preclearance was introduced in Toronto in 1952.  It is currently 
operating at the Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, 
Ottawa and Montreal airports.  It allows U.S. border control 
officers working in Canadian airports to determine whether people 
and goods can enter the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1974 Canada and the United States formalized this arrangement 
under the air transport preclearance agreement, but this did not 
spell out the powers of U.S. preclearance officers in Canada and 
was not given force through implementing legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year is the fourth anniversary of the Open Skies Agreement 
and the 25th anniversary of the 1974 Air Transport Preclearance 
Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two agreements have worked hand in glove to transform air 
passenger travel between Canada and the United States. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, travelling from Canada to the United States was 
long and arduous because the airlines were often prevented from 
providing efficient routings by the outdated air agreement. 
Because of open skies, some 60 U.S. destinations can now be 
reached non-stop from 19 Canadian cities and many more can be 
reached by convenient connections at U.S. hubs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parenthetically, I should point out that in transporter traffic, 
since the open skies agreement has come in, Canadian carriers 
dominate that market.  Canadian carriers carry more passengers in 
the transporter market than do U.S. carriers.  That is a 
testament to the efficiency of Canada's various airlines. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was preclearance important to this success?  Because many of 
those 60 U.S. destinations do not have an adequate level of 
customs and immigration inspection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At airports with inspection services, passengers who are 
precleared in Canada do not wait in line for customs and 
immigration services upon arrival at U.S. airports and thus 
enjoy shorter connection times with onward flights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that travellers could be precleared by U.S. inspection 
agencies in Canada helped make Open Skies work. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the signing of the open skies, air traffic has increased 
39%.  That is quite a remarkable achievement.  It has risen from 
13.5 million passengers to 18.7 million.  Compared to 1994, about 
2.6 million more business travellers and tourists arrive in 
Canada from the United States by air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. preclearance operations in Canada have operated efficiently 
for over 40 years.  In 1997, of the 8.5 million passengers 
processed at U.S. preclearance sites, less than .002%, a 
minuscule amount, were denied entry into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have four major objectives for border co-operation:  access 
for our friends, families and business partners in the United 
States and the promotion of tourism; facilitate goods to ensure 
access to the United States market; protect Canadians from 
international crime and its effects; and ensure Canadian 
sovereignty and protection of our rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act does contribute to these four objectives and gives 
Canada a crucial building block for the 21st century. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major changes have occurred since 1974.  The 1982 charter of 
rights and freedoms granted Canadians new individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Border processing of persons and goods has evolved as a result 
of the rapid increase in border crossings and the adoption of 
new technology.  Traffic has risen dramatically, as has the 
number of routes.  The need for efficient and effective 
processing is essential in an era of just-in-time delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act, which is modelled on existing preclearance schemes in 
Europe, will allow Canada and the United States to modernize and 
apply new innovative approaches to border management. 
It will be accompanied by amendments to the 1974 Canada/U.S. 
Preclearance Agreement which will reflect the new legislation 
and other safeguards agreed to by Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Preclearance Act will update and clarify the legal status of 
U.S. preclearance services at Canadian airports.  It will 
provide legal authorities to protect travellers' rights, while 
countering illegal activities under Canadian law.  Finally, it 
will provide the legal basis for other border facilitation 
initiatives by air and other modes of transportation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will provide a structure for the preclearance regime 
and it directs enforcement.  The bill represents roughly two 
years of negotiations with the United States government that was 
really a balancing act which required marrying the legal regimes 
of our two countries.  It allows all of us to be satisfied that 
our own rights are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the officials in the Departments of 
Foreign Affairs, International Trade, Revenue Canada, Justice and 
my department have worked very hard at crafting these compromises 
to ensure these basics rights that we all respect and expect are 
protected in the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preclearance scheme we have before us is really a hybrid 
which maintains the supremacy of Canadian law but allows the 
United States to administer certain civil and administrative 
matters in designated areas that pertain to the entry of persons 
and goods to that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary objectives for us during negotiations was to 
safeguard Canadian sovereignty.  I do not think there is a member 
in this House who would disagree with that priority.  We think it 
has been accomplished in a number of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement is entirely reciprocal.  The charter of rights and 
freedoms and all Canadian laws will apply in the preclearance 
area, so let us not pay attention to those naysayers who somehow 
say that it is an erosion of Canadian sovereignty. The charter of 
rights applies everywhere in Canada and it will certainly apply 
in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All criminal matters will be dealt with by Canadian law 
enforcement officers.  There will be no enforcement of American 
criminal law.  In the case of conflict of laws, Canadian law 
overrides American law and that is the way it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strip searches are a rather unpleasant part of customs duty and 
enforcement will be done only by Canadian officers. Canadian 
police officers will be available at all preclearance sites to 
ensure that these goals are attained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. preclearance officers will not, I emphasize they will not, 
have immunity from criminal prosecution.  The American government 
will be liable for civil actions, personal losses or property 
damage claims against American officers in the course of their 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the charter applies exclusively to the action of 
governments, the intent of the legislation is that the charter 
would apply to U.S. officers' activities because their actions 
would be authorized by the act and would occur on Canadian soil. 
Travellers would also have full rights under the Canadian bill of 
rights and the Canadian Human Rights Act. The American government 
agrees with the application of the charter to U.S. preclearance 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main job of a preclearance officer is to determine whether 
travellers and goods are to be allowed entry into the United 
States.  The act would grant a preclearance officer the authority 
necessary to make that determination.  The administration of U.S. 
law would be limited to those dealing with customs, immigration, 
public health, food inspection and plant and animal health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the provisions of those laws that are directly related to 
the admission of travellers and the importation of goods to the 
United States will be administered.  These border control laws 
can only be applied in preclearance areas or in transit areas 
which will be designated by the Government of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also requires airlines to provide limited personal 
information about passengers from third countries passing 
through Canada, if the passengers wish to use in transit 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information will be subject to the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights.  Advance 
information will not be provided for travellers originating 
their trip in Canada and bound for the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All aspects of this preclearance regime will be fully reciprocal 
with the United States. 
Canada will not proceed with enactment of this legislation until 
an amendment to the 1974 agreement has been signed between the 
U.S. and Canada which guarantees reciprocity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has not established preclearance in the U.S.  However, we 
have agreed to consider requests by San Francisco and Anchorage, 
Alaska, to establish Canadian preclearance services in their 
airports. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some amendments were passed in the other house which addressed 
concerns with respect to the false declaration and the 
introduction of a review process which ensures that a traveller 
is knowingly making a false statement and which provides for a 
review within five years of the legislation coming into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often we are criticized for introducing bills in the other 
place. 
Bills of this nature which deal with such technical matters and 
fundamental issues of law are well suited to be introduced in the 
other place.  Senators have taken the time to thoroughly debate 
and discuss this bill and they have made amendments which we feel 
are very sensible.  I would like to thank my colleagues in the 
other place for their work on the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill ensures that a traveller can refuse to answer a 
question and can leave the preclearance area unless an offence is 
suspected.  Mere suspicion is not sufficient grounds to conduct a 
search.  The legal standard that must be met is that reasonable 
grounds must be there to suspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Travellers will be put on notice through signage and brochures 
that they have rights and obligations in seeking entry to the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental principle of the bill is that Canada and the 
U.S. wish to ensure the integrity of our border operations.  We 
do not want preclearance sites to become the preferred routing 
for organized crime and we will not permit that.  To prevent that 
illegal activity on Canadian soil, we have to ensure that 
travellers who are reasonably suspected of committing a crime can 
be prevented from leaving the area while it is determined an 
offence has been committed. This principle we believe is 
consistent with Canadian operations at our airports and land 
borders and with Canadian jurisprudence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon passage of legislation, in transit preclearance operations 
will be extended in Vancouver, and will be implemented in 
Toronto and in Montreal's Dorval Airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calgary Airport will be eligible for in transit preclearance no 
later than January 1, 2001.  Other Canadian airports with 
current U.S. preclearance programs, such as Edmonton, Winnipeg 
and Ottawa, subsequently will also become eligible for in 
transit preclearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The successful implementation of an in transit pilot project at 
Vancouver Airport, introduced after the Prime Minister's visit 
to Washington in 1997, has demonstrated the benefits of this 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act paves the way for in transit preclearance in other 
airports.  This will provide passengers, travelling from Asia 
and Europe to the United States, better and quicker air service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, in transit passengers were obliged to pass through 
both a Canadian and U.S. inspection process, often requiring two 
visas and a much longer connection time.  The new in transit 
arrangements will eliminate the Canadian inspection process and 
encourage international passengers to use Canadian air carriers 
and airports for their travels to and from the United States. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not anticipated that there will be an increase in refugee 
claims as a result of this particular initiative.  The pilot 
project in Vancouver has resulted in only one refugee claimant, 
one out of about 100,000 passengers using these in transit 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preclearance act is intended to be the basis for agreements 
between Canada and the U.S. for other modes of transport as well. 
As trade and travel between our two countries continues to grow 
in leaps and bounds, the government intends to enter into 
discussions and negotiations for air cargo, road, rail, marine 
and ferry preclearance.  All good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad my friend from Winnipeg—Birds Hill is in such a good 
mood.  He will be speaking on the bill and I know he will 
wholeheartedly endorse the government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will clarify U.S. authorities and protect 
travellers' rights under Canadian law and safeguard Canadian 
sovereignty.  There will be a uniform regime in place at 
preclearance sites and border entry points to counter illegal 
activities across our shared border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues on the other side to give their full 
and rapid support to a bill that we consider to be a priority so 
that those airports I mentioned can put the necessary 
arrangements into place and we can give better service to 
Canadians and other travellers using Canadian airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will increase economic activity, it will be good for the 
airlines and it is good for our relations with the United States, 
all without compromising Canadian values and the integrity of 
Canadian law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his comments.  I will say 
right off the bat that the Reform Party supports this bill, even 
if it does come from the Senate.  Some worthwhile things come 
from there and we are debating one of them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-22 is an act to establish the reciprocal agreement 
between Canada and the United States allowing U.S. customs 
inspectors to operate in precleared designated areas as 
established by the minister.  The goal is primarily to allow a 
freer flow of goods and travellers into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from Vancouver where the test case was done, it is 
certainly a great benefit to any of those who have been 
travelling into the United States over the last few years.  A lot 
of us remember getting off airplanes in San Francisco, Los 
Angeles or even Hawaii after five hours in an airplane and 
standing in long lineups waiting to be cleared.  It was a 
disaster. Canadians in the west are very pleased that the test 
was there and that it will be going right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the more exciting things in this bill, as the minister 
has just said, is that we are going to study in Anchorage and San 
Francisco preclearing Canadians or others coming into Canada. 
That is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned the people in transit coming through 
Vancouver and that only one has asked for refugee status, which 
is a pretty good record.  It is a commendable record and 
certainly has speeded the service up.  It has helped Canadian and 
foreign airlines increase business in the Vancouver airport which 
is great.  It means more money for Canada if those planes land 
here, fill up here and the crews stay here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an interesting aspect of preclearing when coming into 
Canada.  A large number of people who come into Canada ask for 
refugee status at airports at our own customs and immigration 
facilities.  Certainly if we get into preclearance, those numbers 
will be greatly reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government gets on with its study quickly and does 
preclearance for all major locations coming into Canada, 
especially some of those in Asia and the U.K.  I think it would 
certainly benefit all Canadians if we had that type of 
preclearance coming into Canada.  For anybody who arrives at 
Vancouver International Airport now at certain times of the day 
when there is between 500 to 800 people in lineups, it can take 
an hour and a half to get through the clearance after having 
spent 8 to 13 hours on an airplane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sooner we look at this preclearance ourselves the better. It 
will benefit the travellers who will not have to stand in long 
lineups when they arrive in our country.  It will also benefit 
our immigration process.  People who land in Canada and their 
passports are missing and they say they are refugees get to stay 
here and go through a process that takes five to seven years. 
That is not acceptable to most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is such a good one.  We are talking about television 
and we hope that when this bill goes to committee the meeting can 
be televised.  Then all Canadians could see the great benefits in 
dollars this bill is going to bring to Canadians by allowing them 
this freer access up and down.  It certainly would be a great 
bill to start the televising of committees which we have been 
discussing in the House over the last few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year 8.5 million people were precleared from Canada going 
into the U.S.  That is a significant amount of our population. 
Certainly with this bill it is likely to increase a little bit 
over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of Canadians who will be quite excited when they 
read today that their travel is going to be made easier.  I know 
those in British Columbia, many of whom will go through San 
Francisco when coming back in, will be quite happy that they will 
be able to get off the airplane in Vancouver and go straight home 
because they will have been precleared at the other end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we will find out when we get into committee when we are 
going to start these test cases.  I know it will be a very 
popular move in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that the minister has laid out pretty well what 
is in this bill.  I could go on for a lot longer on some of these 
issues, but I will sit down right now and get this bill through 
and into committee and make sure it becomes law as quickly as 
possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we are 
debating Bill S-22. Far from being controversial, this piece of 
legislation will make things easier for a number of travelers. 
It is in keeping with what has been done so far with regard to 
customs preclearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 8, 1974, the government of Canada and the government of 
the United States of America entered into an agreement on air 
transport preclearance. The purpose of that agreement was to 
speed up and facilitate trade between the two countries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-22 goes along the same line, but is aimed at broadening 
this statutory authority, on a reciprocal basis, to facilitate 
cross-border movement by other means of transportation. To this 
end Bill S-22 authorizes the United States to administer in 
Canada provisions of American law related to the admission of 
travelers and the importation of goods into the United States, 
except for criminal law. It is important to note that criminal 
law is excluded from this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration of such provisions of American law in Canada 
will be subject to Canadian law, including the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Bill of Rights and the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill provides that the government may, by order in 
council, restrict the scope of these provisions if, in its 
opinion, the United States do not accord Canada the same 
privileges. There is therefore an element of reciprocity in this 
agreement aimed at facilitating movement, both ways. If ever 
this was not the case, the bill contains provisions allowing the 
government to rectify the situation by order in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has allowed U.S. federal inspection services to preclear 
air passengers on its territory since the 1950s. 
Preclearance refers to the measures by American federal 
inspection services in relation to travellers and goods leaving 
Canada for the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others have already pointed out, these measures were made 
official in 1974 with the Agreement between the Government of 
Canada and the Government of the United States on Air Transport 
Preclearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that agreement, there are now preclearance services 
affecting some 8.5 million passengers at the following Canadian 
airports: Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, 
Ottawa and Montreal, of course at Dorval. 
However, since that agreement was signed, there have been 
certain changes in Canadian law, particularly the introduction 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  As well, there 
have been changes in border procedures because of the rapid 
increase in cross-border traffic and technological advances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official powers set out in Bill S-22 and the changes to the 
1974 agreement would make it possible to exercise more 
appropriate control over the present border situation,  while at 
the same time protecting travellers under Canadian law. 
American federal inspection services would be in a position to 
examine and seize goods and apply certain monetary penalties 
under American border control legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American legislation would be administered only in designated 
preclearance areas and would be subject to the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms and other applicable Canadian 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No provision of American law that would be criminal under 
Canadian law may be administered in Canada.  Criminal matters 
must be dealt with by Canadian authorities under Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, international passengers travelling to the 
United States from a Canadian airport with preclearance services 
must go through Canadian customs and immigration services before 
going to an American preclearance officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preclearance in transit planned for Canadian airports with 
approved services would enable passengers from third countries 
to pass directly through American preclearance services, thus 
undergoing a single inspection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In transit preclearance services have been in operation since 
June 1997 in Vancouver international airport as a pilot project. 
Furthermore, if in transit preclearance services were 
operational, airlines would be obliged, before entering Canada, 
to provide preclearance officers with specific information on 
those of their passengers going on to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been agreed that the provisions of this bill would be 
matched with reciprocal provisions on the American side so that 
Canada may preclear in the United States within the context of 
American customs and immigration laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, that is not a problem. 
There is only one small concern at this point, with respect to 
the transfer of information the airlines will have to provide. 
I know the minister referred to this in his speech.  Obviously, 
some care must be taken to ensure the airlines provide 
information on passengers in accordance with the provisions of 
privacy legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as this is done properly for this part of the bill, the 
rest will only make the lives of travellers easier and improve 
cross border travel.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, there is no doubt that we will support this 
bill, which, be it said in passing, has already been discussed 
and debated in the other House.  Although it is certainly not 
our first choice and we might question its existence, much of 
the work has been done on this bill from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues to support it, but to be careful, 
because it involves a reciprocal agreement.  We must make sure 
that the Americans act as effectively as us, in putting all the 
measures necessary in place. 
If everything goes well, it will not be necessary to rely on the 
provisions of the bill that provide for the use of an order to 
restrict the scope of this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming everything goes well, this legislation would make life 
simpler for travellers, given the increasing volume of business 
between Canada and the United States and, in the case that 
concerns us, between Quebec and the United States. As members 
know, the United States is now Quebec's main trading partner. A 
lot of goods are being traded and many individuals must travel 
to the United States to do business. Many companies with 
multiple interests have facilities or do business in Quebec, in 
Canada, in the United States and elsewhere in the world, and 
transit through our country and, in this case, often through 
Dorval airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concludes my remarks on Bill S-22. I will be very interested 
to hear what other members have to say. I ask everyone to 
support the bill, while being vigilant concerning the 
confidentiality of the information that will be transmitted by 
airline companies, so as to prevent any abuse. The private 
nature of that information is a concern to many people, in this 
era of modern technology and massive transfers of personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process must not lead to abuse. It must be implemented in 
compliance with our own laws to avoid, for example, situations 
such as the one in which the Minister of Human Resources 
Development found himself, with the cards distributed to 
travellers to obtain information on employment insurance 
recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though public opinion may support such a measure, we must 
still comply with the law. In this particular case, there was a 
problem and the courts strongly condemned the practice, from the 
point of view of its compliance with Canadian law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Transport referred to me earlier as the member 
for Winnipeg—Birds Hill.  I understand his reason for doing 
that.  Many years ago when he and I were younger members of 
parliament I was the member for Winnipeg—Birds Hill and his 
riding probably had a different name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by registering our usual objection to bills originating 
in the Senate.  We feel that there is no good reason this bill 
could not have come first to the House of Commons where it would 
have been considered by the appropriate committee and the good 
amendments made by the Senate would have been made by the 
committee instead.  It is always a mystery to us why some of 
these bills end up coming to us from the Senate instead of going 
to the Senate from the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface, in many real aspects, the provisions of this 
bill have a lot of merit.  If processes at the border points and 
at airports in particular could be expedited, it is very hard to 
argue against that at a practical level.  Nevertheless, there 
were a lot of concerns expressed by immigration lawyers and the 
Canadian Bar Association, as well as others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not my particular area to critique, but after brushing 
up on it this morning I understand that a lot of these concerns 
were addressed by the government by way of amendments being made 
in the Senate.  We commend the government for being open to 
amending its own legislation and for not being its usual 
pigheaded self when it comes to legislation. 
I attribute this to the open-mindedness of the Minister of 
Transport and we look forward to more open-mindedness on his part 
in respect of this bill and other legislation for which he might 
be responsible.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some remaining concerns about the bill having to do 
with privacy protection, which the member of the Bloc put on the 
record just minutes ago.  There are concerns having to do with 
the power of U.S. authorities to detain people and a number of 
other concerns that the government still has to address.  If the 
government can dispel those concerns, fair enough, but it was a 
legitimate concern in the first place which many Canadians had 
that this would be a further application of U.S. law on Canadian 
soil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say further because we in this corner of the House tend not to 
see this in isolation but to see it as a part of a growing trend 
where, bit by bit, Canadians become more subject to laws which 
are not of their own making; that is to say, not made in their 
own parliament.  I am thinking, of course, of the effect of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and other agreements on our 
ability to determine our own policies in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have certainly seen an awful lot of that lately, thanks to 
chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, whereby 
the Canadian government is now being repeatedly sued on various 
grounds by American companies which have more rights in Canada 
than Canadian companies.  They can sue the Canadian government, 
while Canadian companies only have access to domestic courts. 
Thanks to chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
American companies have access to domestic courts in Canada, but 
when that route fails them, if they do not have a leg to stand 
on, as is often the case, they can then continue to harass 
Canadian policy makers and Canadian polity, if you like, via the 
investor state dispute settlement mechanism that exists courtesy 
of the NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, in respect of our larger concern, it is timely 
that this bill should be debated this morning because we note 
that the Canadian ambassador to the United States made a speech 
this week wherein he talked about the possibility of a customs 
union between Canada and the United States and further 
codification in areas as yet unspecified in our relationship with 
the United States.  I hope that shortly I will be able to get a 
copy of that speech and perhaps learn more of the detail of what 
our ambassador had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It ought to raise in our minds whether what we see before us in 
Bill S-22 is part of a larger agenda or trend toward the customs 
union and other ways of further integrating Canada with the 
United States, which I think would be of concern to a great many 
Canadians.  It certainly would have been of concern to the 
Liberal Party of Canada when the Minister of Transport first 
joined it.  It does not appear to be of concern to the Liberal 
Party now because it has been responsible for one of the biggest 
acts of integration, which is a polite way of putting it, 
vis-à-vis the privatization of the CNR, and its coming into 
American ownership at the level of about 60% of that vast 
Canadian infrastructure, as well as various other things such as 
going back on its position on the NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this would still be of concern to many Canadians, even 
if it is no longer of concern to the Liberal Party.  Of course 
the Liberal Party is in government and what it is or is not 
concerned about is very significant.  It does not appear to be 
concerned about the continuing and deepening integration of 
Canada with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what we are to make of this speech by Raymond Chrétien, 
the nephew of the Prime Minister. 
Is he flying a kite for the government, a trial balloon or 
whatever metaphor one chooses?  Is this something the government 
has in mind and has asked its ambassador to the United States to 
put into the public domain to see what kind of attention or 
criticism it attracts?

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is not doing that for the government, what is he doing?  I 
thought it was the role of ambassadors to put forward the 
position of their government.  If he is not actually acting under 
instruction from the government then I would submit there is at 
least a good argument that he is overstepping his bounds as an 
ambassador by putting forward the notion of a customs union. 
Perhaps the minister or somebody else would like to say a word 
about just what the ambassador was doing when he made this 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard for us to separate Bill S-22 and see it only in the 
very practical dimension that the minister asked us to view it 
in.  Certainly from this very practical dimension it has a lot of 
merits.  There are concerns that exist about the bill itself and 
for that reason it would be appropriate for it to go to committee 
as soon as possible.  Let us have a good look at it from the 
point of view of the House of Commons to see if we can address 
some of the outstanding concerns. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is 
interesting about Bill S-22 is that there is unanimity on it here 
in the House.  A very good job was done on it in the other 
place, particularly the amendments by two honourable senators, 
one of which was to put in a 5-year limit after it takes effect, 
after which the minister can undertake a review. This is a very 
wise move, and we thank the senators and the government members 
for having accepted the change, which I feel is a very important 
one.  Any concerns there might be will be verified and 
verifiable after the legislation has been in place for five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go back over everything other members have said this 
morning on Bill SS-22.  Essentially, it is a very solid bill, and 
one that modernizes what has been done for some years in the way 
of airport preclearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some concerns, however.  Looking at a bill like this 
one, one can conclude that there is not really any preclearance 
in the U.S. for Canada and elsewhere.  As someone put it to me, 
“With the Canadian preclearance areas for the U.S., it is as if 
the Americans were trying to protect themselves, by controlling 
arrivals into their country from outside their country”.  How 
reassuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads them to say “If ever there are any problems, they are 
not on our territory, so this will make it easier to handle 
arrivals of people in the United States”.  This is true. 
One can put a negative slant on it, that is to say that the 
Americans are using Canadian airports to have control over what 
enters the United States, be it men, women, children or goods. 
If there is a problem, at least they are not on American soil. 
The law is very clear. Canadian law and the Charter prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True, we are helping the U.S. authorities, but we are helping 
even more Canadians and Quebeckers who travel to the United 
States. A number of us travel to the United States on a regular 
basis. Preclearance and intransit areas greatly speed up entry 
into the United States upon arrival on U.S. soil on the other 
side of the border. One does not have to wait for hours.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a problem, at least with preclearance one is still 
on Canadian soil. The minister referred earlier to this whole 
issue of sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian travellers have a certain guarantee. But, as I said 
before, there is also a guarantee for the U.S. that, should 
there be a problem, it will be dealt with outside of their 
territory. This legislation helps people living in Quebec and 
Canada, while also helping U.S. authorities control the movement 
of men, women and goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, as I mentioned before, Bill S-22 updates and 
implements a system that already exists in the context of the 
global economy. 
There is a desire to facilitate passenger travel.  However, 
extreme caution must be exercised.  Many very interesting 
questions were raised during the proceedings of the Senate 
committee.  I hope that the House committee will also review the 
bill fully.  The Americans must ensure reciprocity with respect 
to their legislation on preclearance and intransit areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the bill is clearly a step in the right direction.  We will 
see this in the future.  Although the minister told us that very 
few refugee applications were made at Vancouver Airport during 
the preclearance and intransit areas pilot project, only one in 
fact, all parliamentarians must realize that other applications 
will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be an increase in such applications in the future. 
Depending on the international context, or preclearance and 
intransit areas, many refugee applications will be made right 
here in Canada.  Will Bill S-22 be blamed?  That is always a 
possibility, but I think such applications could be attributed 
to the situations people face in their own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to pay tribute once again to the work 
done in the other Chamber.  There are some exceptionally 
talented individuals there who are responsible for seeing that a 
bill as important as this one can begin or end its journey here. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to be able to make a few comments on this very 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the opportunity for Canadians to engage in a little of 
streamlining to reduce costs a bit.  I think I would be in favour 
of that as would thousands and thousands of taxpayers who today 
are facing the taxpaying deadline.  They realize they have less 
and less money for themselves because the government keeps taking 
more and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-22 has a plan in it to streamline some costs.  Passengers 
who are merely travelling through Canada to another destination 
would not have to go through Canadian customs.  I think we would 
applaud that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a small concern which some people may not even notice. It 
is Bill S-22 instead of Bill C-22.  For those who know the way 
things work around here, the S means that the bill was started in 
the Senate.  Usually we would expect a bit of a debate from a 
Reformer on whether or not the Senate is justified in bringing in 
such a bill.  I will surprise the House today by saying that I 
believe the Senate is justified in bringing in such a bill.  The 
question at hand is not whether the Senate is justified in doing 
this but whether we could improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in high school many years ago we had a fine class 
motto which I have used all my life: “Good, better, best, never 
let it rest until your good is better and your better best”. 
That is an excellent plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good that the Senate should take a piece of legislation 
such as this, do some study on it, and realize that it is good 
for the different provinces in the country.  There is nothing 
wrong with that.  That is good.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be better?  It would be better if the Senate were 
elected.  Then when it did something like this there would be no 
need to question the legitimacy of what is being done.  There 
would be no reason to question whether or not Canadian taxpayers 
and Canadian citizens are represented since the senators would 
have been elected by the very people they are purporting to 
represent.  That would be better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be best?  It would be best if the Senate were a true 
triple E place where it would not only be elected but would have 
equal representation in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The member still has 17 minutes left in his 
speech.  As today is Friday, I thought we might be able to 
recognize a few more members on statements.  I thought 
we could go to Statements by Members now and he would have the 
full flush the next time.

wish to acknowledge the determination of Mr. Paul Glover.  In 
September 1993, two teenagers viciously assaulted him.  He 
suffered very serious injuries from multiple kicks to the face. 
His facial bones were literally separated from his skull. Last 
Friday in Vancouver, Paul won a civil judgment in excess of 
$60,000 against the two who are now in their early twenties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul Glover has paved the way for victims of violent young

court.  Paul has shown that teenagers who cause harm to others 
cannot escape their civil liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat coincidental that at a time when parliament is 
considering the role of victims in the criminal justice system, 
Paul Glover has advanced the cause in the civil courts. Canadians

Ishkanian, who worked free of charge, a debt of gratitude.  Soon 
I hope to see more victims of young thugs follow Paul's lead in 
pursuing their own civil remedies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest and perhaps the most

Canadians went to sea, unprepared but ready to fight, and they 
fought.  They fought with courage and they fought with pride, 
under horrible conditions and the vagaries of a cruel sea, 
because they knew that the freedom of our nation was at stake. 
Over 5,000 Canadians paid the ultimate price and never returned 
home.

necessarily Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This month, the auditor general looked at the first two programs 
being implemented under the social union, the national child 
benefit and the employment assistance program for persons with 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among his comments, he found that the NCB failed to make a 
reduction in child poverty a measurable goal of the program.  He 
also noted that success for the EAPD will be measured by counting 
participants, not by determining the increase in employment or 
employability of disabled Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good enough for the social union to claim success 
because it spent a pile of money.  Success should be measured by 
the increase in the quality of Canadian lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the House and all Canadians will watch the evolution 
of programs implemented under the social union like hawks to 
ensure that the benefits go to needy Canadians, not to 
bureaucrats and politicians for clever sleights of hand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1995 to 1998, Mike Harris has cut taxes 69 times, including 
a 30% cut in income tax rates.  This was the largest tax cut in 
Ontario history and the first real increase in take home pay for 
the average Ontarian. 
These cuts produced the dramatic result of 540,000 new jobs being 
created in Ontario in under four years.  That is more new jobs 
than the combined populations of London, Kingston and Sudbury. 
This puts Mike Harris's Tories ahead of schedule in their 
five-year plan to create 725,000 new jobs.  Most of all, the 
Harris government's efforts to improve the province's fiscal 
management means more money for education and health care for all

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have to check very carefully to test the veracity of 
the press reports in question.  If they are accurate it is very 
encouraging, but in the meantime I do not think we can let up the 
pressure.  We want to make sure that these press reports 
accurately reflect the position of the Yugoslav government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, through its Minister of Foreign Affairs, is actively 
pursuing diplomatic initiatives.  Our foreign minister had two 
useful meetings this morning with Russian foreign affairs

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

important and valued member of the NATO alliance, as well as of 
the UN security council.  I do not think this is something we 
would do totally by ourselves.  Obviously our foreign minister, 
who is in the area, will want to do everything possible to see 
what can be done to bring about a solution to the current matter, 
which involves very much the agreement of Mr. Milosevic, not just 
to have a UN force, which is something Canada has always been 
interested in, but also to adhere to fundamental principles.  Mr. 
Milosevic's ignorance of them or failure to abide by them is the 
reason we have undertaken—

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to assess the accuracy of this press report.  If it is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians 
are paying the highest personal income taxes in the G-7 and it is 
getting worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian taxpayer will pay $2,020 more in 1999 than 
in 1993.  Those are Department of Finance figures.  These 
taxpayers are feeling the pain.  They know their bottom line is 
way down, thanks to this tax hungry Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On today's royal pain day the taxpayers want relief.  Is there 
some preparation <I>R</I> on the horizon?  Why will the government 
not relieve the pain? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows, the government has reduced taxes by $16.5 
million over the next three years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the real issue, the real agenda which the Reform Party 
has, is not simply tax reductions, it is to pay for those tax 
reductions by gutting the social fabric of the country. 
Therefore, I would ask the hon. member if he shares the view of 
the member from Okanagan who said yesterday that the $11.5 
billion that we put into health care was irresponsible spending. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
irresponsible since the government took out $21 billion.  It is 
totally irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 2.5 million Canadians have been dragged, kicking and 
screaming, into higher tax brackets.  While the rates go down, 
they move people into another category and they end up paying 
more.  Over 840,000 low income families in poverty have been 
added to the tax rolls so that they now can pay taxes too.  That 
brings the government another $10 billion.  Why will the 
government not show some compassion for these poor Canadians who, 
unlike hockey players and some certain shipping companies, cannot 
earn their income— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no better definition of an oxymoron than the 
Reform Party talking about compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the hon. member had an opportunity when he 
stood in the House to correct the member from Okanagan and he did 
not do that.  Is he now saying that it is Reform Party policy 
that spending on health to the tune of $11.5 billion is 
questionable spending, that it is irresponsible?  Is that the 
Reform Party position?  It is very clear that is exactly what 
they stand for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Without saying that we are in favour of changing our existing

<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a copy of the speech.  Perhaps I could provide a 
copy of it to the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that he did say “What about a customs union?”  He 
is not just anybody having a chat in a coffee shop; he is the 
Canadian ambassador.  I ask again, is that the position of the 
Canadian government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also referred to the economic value of our water resources. 
This is the ambassador of a country that is committed to a ban on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

repairing the terrible damage inflicted upon the Canadian economy 
by the government of the party of which he is now a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Tories increased taxes some 38 times when 
they were in office.  Yes, as a result of that Canadian taxes are 
too high and, as a result of that, in the last budget and in the

his hands on the $30 billion surplus in the federal public

the surplus. Public servants will receive all the benefits that 
they were promised under the act. They will even get additional

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Finance stated in the House, “There 
will be no government interference in the investment of CPP funds 
and that is what the Canadian people want”.  In light of the 
fact that the CPP investment fund is now investing some of its 
revenue in Imperial Tobacco through Imasco and Imperial Tobacco 
is targeting young people to addict them to cigarette smoking, I 
want to give the Minister of Finance one more chance in the House 
today.  I ask him whether he thinks that Canadians want their 
pension funds invested in industries that are deliberately 
targeting young people to addict them to the smoking of 
cigarettes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated yesterday, the CPP investment fund is 
investing in the stock exchange indexes.  That is the course of 
action it will be following for the foreseeable future until such 
time as it builds up a larger fund and until further decisions 
are taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the question of young people smoking, the Minister 
of Health has laid out a very clear program to deal with that. It 
is the course we are following.  It is education.  There is no 
doubt that the government must do everything in its power to 
discourage young people from smoking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in section 53 of the Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board Act it states, “The governor in council may make 
regulations regarding those investments”.  Further on it says 
that the investments will be reviewed every three years and the 
minister may make regulations and recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the act and that the minister has flexibility, will 
he take this opportunity and recommend the ethical screening of 
CPP investment funds so investments like the investment in 
Imperial Tobacco will not occur in the future and addict people 
to the smoking of cigarettes?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

not be government interference in the investments.  I am sure if 
he takes a look at the investment policy of the Ontario teachers 
pension fund, if he takes a look at others where there is large 
scale union involvement, he will find that these pension funds 
invest for maximum return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ethical investment funds and this is certainly open to 
the fund.  We are saying it is very important that there not be

means that the ridings of Fundy—Royal, Charlotte and Saint John 
will have approximately 200 fewer jobs to offer their youth.  All 
this when students are already graduating with an alarming 
$30,000 of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this is the disconnected test of reductions in

after the April 30 deadline that they will not have to pay 
penalties and interest charges. These Canadians can explain their 
unique circumstances to Revenue Canada and establish suitable

there has been replaced with red tape.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> The 
Government of Canada has a continuing strong commitment to the 
implementation, and where possible, the ratification of 
Internaltional Labour Organization, ILO, core conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the authority to ratify an ILO convention is 
exclusively federal, the implementation of most ILO conventions 
falls under both federal and provincial jurisdictions, given the 
division of powers over labour matters under the Canadian 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason the longstanding practice in Canada, as regards 
ILO conventions which fall under both federal and 
provincial/territorial jurisdictions, like Convention 98, has 
been to ratify only if all jurisdictions concur with ratification 
and undertake to implement the convention's requirements within 
their respective jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Convention 98, there is a high level of 
conformity in Canada to the convention's major principles, which 
include protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and 
workers' and employers' interference in each other's affairs, 
and the encouragement and promotion of voluntary collective 
bargaining. However, Canada has not ratified Convention 98 because 
there are some divergencies between the convention's requirements 
and the Canadian situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main obstacle to ratification is that, with the exception of 
the armed forces and the police and “public servants engaged in 
the administration of the state”, Convention 98 does not provide 
for any exclusions from collective bargaining rights. However, in 
Canada, a number of jurisdictions exclude some other types of 
workers, such as agricultural workers and certain professionals, 
from their collective bargaining legislation. This has been 
interpreted by the ILO as not being in compliance with 
Convention 98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials of the labour program of Human Resources Development 
Canada have recently sought further clarifications from ILO 
officials concerning Convention 98's requirements, with a view to 
initiating a re-examination of the potential for Canadian 
ratification of Convention 98, in consultation with the provinces 
and territories as well as the social partners.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about the very first letter of the bill.  It is 
Bill S-22.  The first letter is <I>S</I>, which stands for Senate. 
I said that we should really improve this.  This is something 
that is long overdue.  It is too bad that we on this side, every 
time this happens, have to remind the government that what we 
have is a failed part of democracy, and that is because the 
Senate is not elected.  There is no excuse for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said during the 1993 election campaign, and I 
have said it so often that I know it by heart, that “Within two 
years of being the government we will have an elected Senate”. 
He promised as Prime Minister, “I can make that happen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of castigating him for a broken promise, which I would 
be slightly tempted to do, I would rather put it on a positive 
note.  Quite clearly, before 1993, our Prime Minister was 
convinced that it was a good idea or he would not have said it. 
It is a good idea in his mind.  It is certainly a good idea in 
the minds of Canadians.  There is no reason in the world for this 
not to happen.  All he has to do is appoint to the Senate, 
without any constitutional change, the people who are chosen by 
the electors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta, for example, we had a Senate election.  Two people 
were democratically chosen by the people.  They are ready to 
serve the next time there is an opening for the province of 
Alberta. All the Prime Minister has to do is say that when the 
vacancy becomes available “I will appoint the person who the 
people have chosen”.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is a 
compromise, but at least the people serving in the Senate would 
be the choice of the people rather than the political choice of 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister wants to take this reasoning to the 
ultimate, if he feels that he can better choose who is to 
represent Alberta or any other province in the Senate, then why 
does he not do it for MPs?  Why do we have elections for members 
of parliament?  Why do we not just let the Prime Minister appoint 
whomever he will, in whatever riding.  We would have nothing but 
Liberals in the House.  Would that not be wonderful? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately <I>Hansard</I> does not indicate sarcasm, so let 
the record show that the member was dripping with sarcasm when he 
made that statement.  That way it will appear on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will rest my case there.  I would be very pleased to support 
the bill if it came from an elected Senate with the full 
legitimacy of what we know and understand to be democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, once again I must deplore the fact that 
all private members' bills selected in the draw are not declared 
votable items in the House.  This is a real lack of democracy and 
it allows the government to sweep issues under the rug that it 
does not want to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been working on this bill, the firearms law sunset act, 
since 1994.  I first introduced the sunset clause as an amendment 
to Bill C-68 during the debate in the spring of 1995.  This bill 
was first introduced in the House as Bill C-351 on September 28, 
1995 and then again as Bill C-357 on December 2, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most disappointing to put so much effort into a piece of 
legislation and to have it die after one hour of debate in the 
House.  This is a situation that must be rectified if we are ever 
to have any chance of our constituents' legislative initiatives 
being given their rightful consideration in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the rash of recent shootings, both here and in the 
United States, more and more people are clamouring for tougher 
gun control laws.  What we need, and what the people really want, 
is effective gun control laws.  As we have seen with Bill C-68, 
the Firearms Act, tougher does not equal effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-278 would rectify the government oversight by 
implementing a process that would ensure that only gun law 
provisions that were proven to be effective by the auditor 
general would remain the law of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I do not know how any member of the House could 
logically argue that they support ineffective gun laws.  While 
there may be arguments opposing the legislative process and the 
wording of this bill, I would be absolutely amazed if anyone in 
the House will be brave enough to argue against this principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People arguing against this bill will have to argue that they 
support gun control laws even if they do not work, no matter how 
much they cost and even if another measure might work better.  I 
am not arguing that gun control laws are unnecessary, only that 
police time and resources should be spent on measures that get 
the best bang for our bucks.  That is exactly what Bill C-278 is 
designed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for seconding my bill on November 
7, 1997 when I reintroduced this firearms law sunset act in this 
session.  That day the House leader and the chief justice critic 
for the Conservatives said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues of justice and public safety transcend partisan party 
lines.  These (Firearms Act) regulations are not about public 
safety—it is just another tax. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just another tax.  We want effective measures and that is 
what this bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a sunset law.  I want to point out to the members 
exactly what that means.  Robert D. Behn wrote this explanation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of the sunset law is that every government program 
should periodically terminate, and continue only after an 
evaluation and a legislative vote to reestablish it.  The 
objective is to replace the assumption that every program 
automatically continues unless there is a vote to terminate it, 
with the assumption that every program automatically terminates, 
unless there is a vote to continue it. 
Consequently, sunset laws are designed to ensure meaningful 
program evaluation, to introduce the possibility of termination, 
to merge duplicative programs and rationalize program structure, 
and to eliminate conflicts and competition between programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By shifting the burden of proof from those who would terminate a 
program to those who would renew it, the advocates of sunset laws 
hope to create an incentive for individual agencies, and the 
government as a whole to improve. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That quotation says it better than I could.  I think we have to 
very carefully listen to what was said.  That is what I hoped to 
achieve in drafting the firearms law sunset act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would provide a five year sunset provision on all gun 
control measures which means that the measure would be 
automatically repealed unless the auditor general has reported 
that it has been a successful and cost effective measure to 
increase public safety and reduce violent crime involving the use 
of firearms.  That is, in essence, what the bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report has to be considered by a committee 
representing broad interest in the firearms community and the 
committee report must be presented to and concurred in by the 
House or the sunset provision will take effect automatically at 
the end of the five years.  That is what the bill provides for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides safeguards to allow parliament the time 
necessary to make amendments to allow ineffective gun control 
measures to expire without affecting the parts of the legislation 
that are effective at fighting firearms crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make our society safer.  We want to pass laws in 
parliament that are effective.  We need sunset provisions so we 
can focus on what works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the total opposite of the ill-conceived Bill C-68, 
the Firearms Act, that was passed into law on December 5, 1995 
and prematurely brought into force on December 1, 1998.  Bill 
C-68 will guarantee that gun control laws are costly and 
ineffective.  Whereas my bill will guarantee that every gun 
control law has to be both successful and cost effective in 
saving lives and reduce the criminal use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of Parliament want gun control measures that reduce 
violent crime they will support this bill.  If members of the 
House want gun control measures that improve public safety and 
save lives they will support the bill.  Finally, if MPs want gun 
control measures that not only reduce violent crime involving 
firearms, but also want the most successful and most cost 
effective methods for achieving these goals, they will support 
the bill.  If the MPs have an open mind and look at the bill, I 
cannot see how they could not support it.  Hopefully, they will 
have an open mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year the government passes hundreds of new laws but seldom 
repeals any.  Should every bill passed by parliament not come 
with a built in sunset clause which would automatically repeal 
any measure that is not working or is not cost effectively 
achieving its stated objective?  How much could we save the 
taxpayers of the country if we had that clause built into every 
bill?  That is our job as parliamentarians.  It is fundamental 
that we make sure that the laws of the land work. If they do not, 
we should get rid of them.  They cost the taxpayers a lot of 
money because there is bureaucracy that is put in place to track 
these measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bureaucrats who depend on costly, ineffective government 
programs for their jobs will hate the bill.  Ministers who are 
more intent on building empires and retaining their status at the 
cabinet table will hate the bill. 
Conversely, taxpayers who are footing the bill and the general 
public who have to pay even higher taxes for this bureaucratic 
bungling and inefficiency will love the firearms law sunset act.

support of that, I hope the attitude I detect on the other side

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to 
debate the bill after hearing the rhetoric and simplistic 
interpretation of the member opposite.  I think his true goal was 
to do what he could not do when he tried to develop support 
against gun control legislation in the country.  The member knows 
that more than 80% of Canadians support gun control.  This is a 
very silly piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Is the parliamentary secretary imputing motive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the parliamentary secretary 
is perhaps suggesting reasons why the hon. member made the speech 
he did.  It seems to me it is a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government is firmly 
opposed to Bill C-278 for a number of reasons.  The bill proposes 
that we repeal the new firearms legislation without giving it any 
reasonable time to work.  The Reform Party would propose 
sunsetting an act 11 months after it becomes fully effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice already has in place a carefully 
considered plan for evaluating the new law's success and 
achieving its objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-278 ignores the accomplishments made in the first few 
months of the new Firearms Act. Canadians can already see the 
positive impact of Bill C-68.  Canadians continue to strongly 
support the government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about what the Firearms Act has already 
done.  Members will see that it has already been effective.  The 
government is confident that within a reasonable time after the 
new firearms law has been fully implemented its effectiveness 
will be even more demonstrable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time ever, the new law requires instant background 
checks before any gun sale can proceed.  As of the end of 
February of this year, more than 4,700 checks have been conducted 
as part of gun sales or transfers.  Of these checks, almost 7% 
were flagged for investigation.  In other words, more than 325 
potentially dangerous gun sales were referred for further 
scrutiny.  Examples of these cases include people with past or 
recent histories of violence, break and enters, theft or drug 
involvement, or people who were trying to acquire guns that they 
were not licensed to purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the cases caught by the new system was that of an 
individual from Nelson, British Columbia who tried to purchase 
several firearms over a two week period.  The individual had a 
firearms licence but the background check showed numerous prior 
convictions and several recent incidents involving spousal abuse, 
uttering threats and drug activity.  The individual's firearms 
licence was suspended pending further investigation and the sales 
were refused.  On two subsequent occasions, the individual tried 
again to purchase firearms.  This time his licence was revoked 
altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of situation the new system was designed to 
control.  Everybody in the House should share the goal of keeping 
firearms out of the hands of potentially dangerous individuals. 
In this early case the system demonstrated its effectiveness 
every time the individual tried to buy a gun.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 85 license applications have been refused for public 
safety concerns.  It is through results like this that the 
Canadian public knows the new gun control program introduced in 
Bill C-68 will make the homes in their communities and their 
communities as a whole much safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choices laid out today are clear.  If Bill C-278 were to 
become law and all Canadian gun laws were sunsetted, Canada would 
be left with no licensing, no registration, nothing.  Why would 
the Reform Party risk this?  Is it because its hidden agenda is 
to let everyone own powerful guns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look around at the rest of the world and see that the 
control of firearms is something the entire world is seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, unlike members opposite, is committed to 
promoting public safety.  It is clear that the Firearms Act 
already has had an impact.  The government is confident all 
assessments will demonstrate that the system enhances public 
safety once full implementation is completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville really want to allow 
anyone unrestricted ownership of fully automatic guns?  We know 
that the Reform Party continues to fight firearms control.  The 
National Firearms Association and the National Rifle Association 
must be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about specific parts of the bill.  The member 
opposite would have the auditor general and his office evaluate a 
major public safety program in just a few months after it came 
into force.  The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville is 
unrealistic.  There is no way that the auditor general and his 
staff could complete a thorough study in the time set out.  It is 
simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not minimize the need to evaluate laws.  We heard months 
and months of testimony on Bill C-68.  We listened to what 
Canadians told us about gun control.  We made sure that the law 
would be effective.  We built in an assessment program.  We will 
make sure that any glitches are ironed out, that any opportunity 
to make the law even better is exercised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that when any new law comes into force we need 
to allow a certain amount of time before we can assess its impact 
and its effectiveness.  Individuals need to adjust to new 
requirements.  Law enforcement agencies need to adjust to new 
responsibilities.  The judiciary needs time to consider the law's 
meaning and intent as cases are presented.  It takes time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act is no different.  To assess its effects on 
public safety, on the incidence of violent crime and on cost 
effectiveness, we have to allow time for the act to be fully 
enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should be pleased that a full evaluation process 
with an appropriate timetable is consistent with Treasury Board 
guidelines and is already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the former minister of justice appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs during those months and 
months of testimony, he spoke about the evaluation process.  He 
stated that the Department of Justice would be monitoring 
experience with registration and licensing to determine what 
improvements could be made and to make that information available 
to parliament and to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evaluation plan calls for assessments of the extent to which 
the operational elements of the Firearms Act, part 3 of the 
Criminal Code and their associate programs have been implemented 
and whether their objectives are being achieved.  It also calls 
for an implementation evaluation.  This should begin one year 
after the program launch and its findings will be submitted one 
year later.  This exercise will be carried out by key federal 
partners and the results are to be consolidated with overall 
evaluation of the Canadian firearms program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-278 is a simplistic, unrealistic piece of legislation, 
but I would be remiss if I did not point out one thing.  In the 
member's bill he supports the sentencing guidelines that the 
government introduced in Bill C-68, so he has found something 
good to say about our law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will 
not be able to support the bill introduced by the Reform Party, 
first of all because we see it somewhat as a head on attack on 
the philosophy and the purpose of Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to commend my colleague, the 
hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, who successfully sponsored 
this bill on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. I also want to remind 
the House that the Bloc Quebecois supported the philosophy of 
this bill, although we did have some concerns about the 
legislation. 
We were concerned about some administrative details and wanted 
to make it easier for hunters, especially in terms of the 
issuing of permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the help of my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm, who is well 
known for his exactness, especially by members of his own 
caucus, we brought forward some 15 amendments to improve on the 
bill, four of which were approved by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make myself very clearly understood. We do not believe 
that increased gun registration and control under this bill, to 
show where these guns are to be found throughout our society, 
will help to fight crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, however, we believe these are significant 
steps that, coupled with other legislation, can make access to 
firearms more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to sensationalize or make facile connections, but 
I think the time is right for us, as parliamentarians, to debate 
these issues. Unfortunately, we have all seen and been affected, 
beyond partisanship, by what happened in Colorado and more 
recently in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this should reinforce our conviction that, as 
parliamentarians, we must take action to make it more difficult 
to have access to firearms. Let us not forget that one of the 
objectives of Bill C-68 was and still is to deal with the whole 
issue of safe storage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble figuring out how asking people to take certain 
measures for the safer storage of their rifles, shotguns and 
handguns could be a violation of their fundamental freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is making connections and saying things with 
respect to an issue like firearms that do not have a great 
impact on people. Canadians do not expect us to ban hunting or 
to prohibit gun collectors from having access to their 
collections. That is not what it is about. It is about taking 
measures to ensure that guns are handled and stored safely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, we need a national firearm registry so that 
when police officers are called somewhere in the community, to 
someone's home, they know ahead of time whether or not there 
might be firearms on the premises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely believe there is nothing outlandish in this 
legislation. But we are not fooled. We know full well that what 
the Reform Party wants is, for all intents and purposes, that 
Bill C-68 be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as 1995, they started plotting against the bill. We 
cannot agree to this, no more than we could agree to the 
creation of more red tape that would have made life complicated 
for hunters in certain communities. This is why the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm introduced a number of amendments making the 
bill more practical than it was before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it very clear, I want to stress how moderate, how 
reasonable the four main provisions of the bill seems to us. Mr. 
Speaker, you are our focus on Fridays. I am sure our fellow 
citizens who are watching want to know what Bill C-68 is about. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly highlight the four main thrusts of Bill C-68. It 
amends the Criminal Code to provide for stiffer sentences—this is 
called sentencing—for certain serious offences involving the use 
of a firearm, such as murder or kidnapping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe lawmakers must deter criminals from using a firearm 
while committing an offence. In legal terms, this is called 
aggravating circumstances. The Bloc Quebecois agreed with this 
provision in Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is the Firearms Act, the purpose of which is  to 
separate from the Criminal Code the administrative and 
regulatory aspects relating to permits and registration. This 
was done because we believe it is important for police forces to 
know when someone has firearms.  The reason for this is the 
extremely high risk of violence that exists when a person owns a 
firearm, one that is not present with the possession of any 
other type of item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is a new licensing system. The permit authorizes 
acquisition of a firearm and the purchase of ammunition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, no doubt the most controversial aspect, and the one the 
Reform Party was opposed to, while we were in agreement with it, 
is of course the mandatory registration of firearms of all 
kinds, including shotguns and hunting rifles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there is the structure.  But, here again, I repeat, I do not 
think this is a bill that threatens basic freedoms. This leads 
me to talk about organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a political party, we believe that organized crime is a huge 
organization and that there is no one way of getting rid of it. 
Naturally, we know that there are different levels of organized 
crime and that certain conditions foster the proliferation of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, generally, three. First, there must be some wealth in 
the society.  It is clear that Canada and Quebec meet this 
criterion. 
Organized crime also needs a society that has communication 
networks, airports, railways, highways, etc. In other words, it 
must be possible to connect quickly with another continent 
because, as we know, organized crime is a global reality. It is 
a fact of globalization, as the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean 
would put it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime also proliferates in a society with 
bureaucracies, charters and legal guarantees that often result in 
delaying tactics being used in relation to court proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is a very present reality in the Canadian 
society. It is estimated that the underground economy is an 
industry that generates close to $20 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a connection to be made between registering firearms 
and our desire, as parliamentarians, to fight against organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is up, I reaffirm the Bloc Quebecois' support for 
Bill C-68's underlying philosophy.  We believe that gun control 
is desirable. We are not prepared to support the Reform Party 
bill before us today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today with a heavy heart to speak to Bill C-278. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The events that took place in Taber, Alberta, have shocked 
Canadians with the realization that brutal violence and killing 
is not limited to the United States.  Even more shocking is the 
fact that the corrupting effects of an increasingly violent 
society have now forever altered our schools, once safe places of 
learning.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of this tragedy we must attempt to maintain reason. 
Horrific events such as the shooting in Taber often provoke the 
knee-jerk reaction of demanding stricter gun control laws.  As a 
member of the Progressive Conservative Party I can state that we 
support gun control.  However, tragedies such as the shooting in 
Taber provoke the government to act on emotion, not on logic. 
Emotional responses to tragic situations lead us to ineffective, 
irresponsible legislation like Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 was drafted in response to society's demand for a 
tougher stand on crime.  Instead of dealing with the issue of 
crime in a meaningful way, the government took the easy way out 
in touting Bill C-68 as the answer to its concerns.  Bill C-68 
has done nothing to prevent crime and has only led to 
discriminatory practices toward law-abiding gun owners by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have committed to sensible gun control 
legislation that did not discriminate against long gun owners by 
forcing them into expensive, time consuming and fundamentally 
flawed gun registration.  By doing this the government would not 
have need for an escape clause bill that would allow it to 
correct bad legislation every five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party supports Bill C-278 as we feel it provides for the 
expiry of Bill C-68 after five years.  Yet it will be five years 
during which law-abiding responsible gun owners will suffer due 
to Bill C-68.  Since the cause of gun owners is not a popular one 
among Liberals, it is easy for the government to ignore their 
concerns and produce regionally popular although universally 
ineffective gun control legislation like Bill C-68.  This has 
been especially true since the crisis in Ottawa on April 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals came to power in 1993 they have tried to 
paint themselves as champions of justice and protectors of the 
public interest.  In doing so they have promoted gun control 
legislation through basic simplistic terms which play on the 
fears of a public fearful for its own safety.  For example, the 
Liberals will promote their anti-gun legislation by stating 
“guns kill people”, “guns make people fear for their safety”, 
and “if we get rid of guns our problem will be solved”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems to conveniently ignore the fact that guns 
do not kill people.  Enraged individuals in need of counselling 
kill people.  The government does not want people to know that 
handguns, not long guns, are the weapons of choice for most 
criminals.  It has neglected to remember that the majority of 
long gun owners are responsible gun owners and law-abiding 
citizens.  Thus upon looking at these Liberal champions of 
justice, it is abundantly clear that Liberal gun legislation does 
little to stop the real criminals and infringes upon the 
individual rights of responsible Canadians to own long guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are already trying to amend the ineffective Bill 
C-68.  Whether it is Bill C-278 or the old Bill C-68, the fact 
remains that the Liberal government's position on gun control is 
in constant flux.  The most recent Liberal gun control 
legislation provides a great opportunity for Canadians to tell 
their elected representatives to get rid of Bill C-68 before the 
five year period has passed.  Although Bill C-278 is a good idea, 
Canadians should not have to wait five years to get rid of 
ineffective legislation that does not take into account the 
opinions of constituents across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government seems only to be concerned with the 
opinions of its supporters who live primarily in urban Ontario. 
This only reaffirms the Progressive Conservative Party's 
consistent position concerning gun control.  Whether it be the 
position taken by our former leader, the Hon. Jean Charest in the 
last parliament or during the last election; the position of our 
party throughout the debate on the old Bill C-68; or our position 
under our new leader, Mr. Clark, the unwavering opposition to any 
ill-conceived long gun registration is clear. The focus here 
should not waver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gun control debate is about long guns.  It is about shotguns 
and rifles.  It is against hunters and sportsmen.  The Liberal 
government has continually failed to make legislative provisions 
for long gun owners.  Thus I argue that Bill C-278 should be 
passed to allow for the removal of Bill C-68 in five year's time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would rather see the removal of Bill C-68 immediately.  Yet, 
as they say, good things come to those who wait and thus we will 
be patient and place the PC Party's support behind Bill C-278.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key commitments of the justice critic to the 
constituents of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough—and it was mine 
as well—was to continue to oppose repressive Liberal gun control 
legislation.  Such legislation is ineffective and an unproven 
mandatory gun registration.  The legislation concentrates on and 
targets law-abiding citizens as opposed to criminals who would be 
using firearms.  Bill C-68 does not affect the root causes of 
crime.  Thus it is hoped that Bill C-278 will eventually correct 
this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-278 is very timely.  We heard the cries of thousands and 
thousands of law-abiding gun owners that assembled on the Hill 
before Christmas.  There appears to be some opposition to what 
the government is attempting with its repressive gun control 
legislation.  Our justice critic had the opportunity to 
personally meet with a number of representatives from 
organizations in his province of Nova Scotia and in my province 
of New Brunswick, individuals such as Tony Rodgers of the Nova 
Scotia Wildlife Federation, to review the negative impact which 
has already resulted from ineffective gun control legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses in the province of New Brunswick and like businesses 
in other provinces will be extremely and negatively affected by 
the implementation of continuing gun control legislation because, 
as we know, it will force businesses to subject themselves to an 
extremely bureaucratic, cumbersome registry system that will not 
impact on the criminal use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, and it is a proven fact, that Canada already has one of 
the toughest gun control laws in the world.  The Liberals have 
tried to further that by adding burdensome registration fees 
which amount to nothing more than a tax.  I might add that the 
Liberal government and its well intentioned allies have attempted 
to sell their issues on gun control as a question of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have made it an issue of black and white: 
proponents of bills such as a Bill C-68 support gun control 
whereas opponents of such bills oppose gun control.  That is 
completely untrue.  Let us make that perfectly clear.  I do not 
think there is anyone in the House, anyone in the opposition who 
opposes gun control per se.  Gun registration is about 
ineffective Liberal legislation and its effect on law-abiding 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firearm owners and I meet on a regular basis.  They are some of 
the most responsible in handling guns and the most responsible 
and supportive of effective measures when it comes to the 
handling of firearms.  If we want to do something specifically 
aimed at those who use guns for criminal purposes, let us toughen 
up the code sections.  Let us toughen up the response of the 
courts to those who use firearms in a criminal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It came to light last spring that the statistics used by the 
government to justify the mandatory registration of firearms were 
seriously flawed, according to the commissioner of the RCMP. 
Words like exaggeration and misuse of statistics were then met by 
the reply of the Minister of Justice that it was simply a 
difference of methodologies.  This seems to me to be a convenient 
excuse for the government to dismiss the facts it does not like 
to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fact the government conveniently ignores is that under a 
Conservative government Canada adopted tough gun control 
legislation through Bill C-17, which was passed through 
parliament in late 1991 and came into effect over subsequent 
years.  In fact the government played a part in implementing some 
of those pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the previous gun law applicants were required to obtain 
firearms application certificates which are called FAC licences. 
They were required to take a gun course, undergo police checks 
and wait up to 28 days.  Handguns were considered restricted 
weapons and owners were required to have ownership permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Handgun permits were only issued to certified gun collectors and 
sport club members who were taking part in shooting competitions. 
Private ownership of most military assault weapons were banned or 
restricted.  Those wanting to hunt were required to take 
mandatory hunting courses or required to take firearm handling 
safety courses.  The previous laws also included stringent 
storage and transportation regulations, making it an offence to 
breach these regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let us not continue to target law-abiding 
citizens with ineffective and indecisive legislation. Let us in 
fact target criminals.  It will be a long and roundabout manner 
of doing so, but I suggest that by supporting Bill C-278 we can 
continue to point out the problems with Bill C-68.  This 
continued debate will hopefully lead to the removal of Bill C-68 
in the next five years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is rather sad that we are still debating horrible 
legislation which was passed in 1995.  It is a debate that never 
ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are in grave economic difficulties and the 
country is fighting an undeclared war, whenever I go back to my 
constituency and visit the coffee shop or walk down the street 
people still ask what we will do about the idiotic registration 
law.  It never dies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I diverge a little from my colleague who has proposed the bill, 
although I support it.  The time the studies should have been 
made was before the bill was passed, not after the fact.  We had 
a bill that was based on prejudice, public hysteria and 
deliberately falsified data.  It was all brought together under a 
closure motion.  That was one of the blackest days in the House. 
It is something for which democracy is paying dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve said that he did not 
see anything in the bill that would affect the civil rights of 
Canadians.  I wonder if the right to entry and search without a 
warrant and the right to seize lawfully owned private property 
without compensation constitute no threat to the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said some studies should have been done before the legislation 
was passed.  I took the initiative to do something in this 
regard.  I did a very detailed study of the crime statistics over 
a 20 year period for the northern tier states of the northwestern 
U.S. as opposed to the Canadian prairie provinces of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought, as a resident of southern Saskatchewan, I would find 
that the rates of homicide in those two rather different 
jurisdictions would be more or less equal.  I discovered to my 
surprise that the homicide rates in those northern tier states 
were actually lower than in our three western Canadian provinces 
where we have had gun control of a sort since 1976. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those northern tier states they call it gun control because 
they have a law on the books in Montana that says you cannot take 
your machine gun away from your own property.  It is wide open 
and yet their homicide rate is lower than ours and has been for 
the last 20 years, if one takes the average of those northern 
states and of our western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, when I was doing this study, I discovered that 
North Dakota has historically had a homicide rate of 1.2 per 
100,000 people.  Maine, another state adjacent to Canada but not 
included in my study, also has that 1.2 per 100,000.  That is 
roughly the same order of magnitude as the homicide rates in 
Japan where private ownership of firearms is virtually banned. 
One can make what one wants of that.  It is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, in that great land to the south the 
jurisdiction of the District of Columbia has what is probably the 
toughest regulations governing firearms of any jurisdiction in 
the western world, far tougher than we have in Bill C-68, and yet 
its homicide rate is astronomical.  It is 80 per 100,000 per 
annum. 
That is like a war zone and yet they have these extremely 
rigorous control of firearms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>New York City is another example. Both state and city laws 
control firearms.  Yet the homicide rate there is more than 10 
times what it is in the wide open states of North Dakota, Montana 
and Idaho. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of study that should have been performed 
relative to the Canadian experience before we got involved in 
this hysterical pursuit of a magic fix to do away with crime in 
this country, but it was not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years there have been several academic studies made of 
this particular question, most notably by Dr. Manzer at Simon 
Fraser University, Dr. Lott at the University of Chicago, and Dr. 
Kleck from the school of criminology at Florida State University. 
These academics have all agreed and determined that the existence 
of a law requiring the registration of firearms has no particular 
effect, either detrimental or beneficial, to the prevalence of 
murder in any society.  These are eminent academics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not want to consult academics, it would 
have been worthwhile had the government listened to rank and file 
police officers rather than to the national association of police 
chiefs when it went for police input.  Some very good polling has 
been done by the Saskatchewan Federation of Police Officers of 
its members.  It was discovered that lo and behold 75% of them 
are opposed to the legislation in Bill C-68. Ninety-one per cent 
of serving RCMP officers in Saskatchewan are opposed to the 
legislation.  These are the people who are out there on the front 
lines every day.  These are not the political policemen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a phone call not too long ago from an RCMP sergeant whom I 
know fairly well. He said, “There is a whole bunch of people 
milling around my office today.  I have this big lineup at my 
door”.  I asked what the problem was, what was going on. He 
said, “All the Hell's Angels in town have come around and they 
are trying to get their possession and acquisition certificates 
and they all want to get them on the same day”. Perhaps there 
was a little hyperbole in the man's statement, but I certainly 
got his message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment 
quoted what she referred to as the positive impacts of this 
legislation.  She should go back and take a look at this 
legislation and all previously existing legislation because 
background checks have been a fact of life in Canada for many 
years.  It is not something that was brought in with Bill C-68 
and she should know that.  To say that there has been a positive 
effect from this new legislation is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time she set up quite a number of straw men.  She 
said something about the people who are supporting this bill 
wanted to decontrol the private ownership of automatic weapons. I 
reread the bill immediately after she said that to see if I could 
find some reference of that nature and I am sorry, but it is not 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville is asking is that 
after five years from January 1 this legislation be revisited, 
that some proper studies be made of its effectiveness or lack 
thereof, and that the government then act upon those studies to 
determine whether or not the $50 million a year that this is 
going to cost us is a sensibly directed expenditure, if it is 
going to do any good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous studies I have mentioned certainly suggest that it 
does no good at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a brief comment from Professor Kleck who 
incidentally until 1976, according to his biography, was very 
skeptical to say the least about the right to gun ownership. 
He is a criminologist.  He said that it was a sort of visceral 
reaction on his part to think that if there were fewer guns, 
there would be less crime.  However, when he did his academic 
research, and he has been doing research like this for 20 years, 
here is what he said—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the hon. member has run 
out of time.  I know that there are other members who wish to 
speak in the debate.  I am afraid I am going to have to terminate 
his speech at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to be making only a brief couple of comments.  My colleague 
from the Reform Party has permitted me to split some time here, 
so I am grateful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment 
did point out one valid issue which is that it takes a little 
while for legislation, whatever the topic is, to actually have 
any kind of effect.  I would argue that the government never let 
Bill C-17 make a positive effect in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 is a bad news bill because it makes no sense to 
register the long guns of innocent deer hunters, duck hunters and 
farmers.  The law enforcement officers in society today would 
rather have the $300 million plus that is going to be spent for 
better law enforcement initiatives than the arbitrary 
registration program in Bill C-68, which the Progressive 
Conservative Party and this hon. member definitely oppose. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my comments 
will also to be very short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to focus on what this bill actually says instead of much 
of the talk that has been going on here on the issue of gun 
control itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill is a very important one.  It says in 
the desire of Canadians to prevent the deaths and accidental 
deaths that come from improper use of firearms and also the 
criminal use of firearms, that Canadians, especially this week, 
demand and deserve that their money be spent where it is going to 
be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's private member's bill focuses on it very well. It 
says that this bill should automatically expire after five years 
unless it is proven effective in doing the job. In other words, 
this is an issue which is certainly part of being a good steward 
of the taxpayers' money, but it goes much beyond that. It says 
that where we spend that money we want the job to be done right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should not be a Liberal in the House who would hesitate to 
vote for this bill.  Surely they too would want to cause the fast 
expiry of any bill or any procedure which is proven ineffective. 
That is what this bill says about gun control, or whatever it is 
called.  It is not really gun control.  Right now it is a gun 
registration system. The control element is essentially 
non-evident in what the Liberal government is doing.  The bill 
before us today is simply calling for that to be evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House this.  If there is empirical evidence of 
the effectiveness of what the Liberals are doing, I will vote for 
it.  But if there is empirical evidence that it is ineffective, 
as we on this side suspect it will be based on scientific and 
statistical evidence, then I want to see that bill gone. I want 
the taxpayers' money to be spent and I want the government to be 
doing that which is truly effective in stopping the criminal 
misuse of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot state this strongly enough.  We were all shocked and 
horrified this week, as people in Ottawa were several weeks ago, 
by the blatant gunning down of innocent people by another person 
with a gun.  Of course we want to stop that.  How we wish those 
people had not had a gun.  But is the result of that that we are 
simply going to confiscate all the firearms?  I really have a 
problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make sure that we are enacting effective legislation. 
I would urge all members to vote in favour of this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has misrepresented what this bill does in 
the comments made that this bill will only give a few months for 
us to scrutinize firearms regulations.  It clearly says in the 
bill that there are five years for the auditor general to assess 
the legislation. Then the government went on to defend Bill C-68 
that it passed almost four years ago claiming it was effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments made by the Liberals, if in fact they are true and 
we listened to them, should be open to the examination of the 
auditor general, an impartial party.  The argument made by the 
government was that it was keeping firearms out of the hands of 
criminals.  If that is true, why not let the auditor general 
examine these laws and determine if it is true?  That is only 
common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP did not participate in the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois went on and spent much time arguing against 
my bill describing the problem of organized crime.  My question 
for the Bloc Quebecois is what is there in Bill C-68 that will 
affect organized crime in any way, except perhaps to encourage 
gun use by criminals, smuggling and the black market? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Bill C-68 puts Canadians more at risk because it ties 
up scarce law enforcement resources rather than allowing them to 
be used most effectively such as in fighting organized crime. 
The Bloc should support my bill because it ensures our laws will 
become more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these last few minutes I would like to explain some of the 
inefficiencies and the ineffectiveness of the government's 
current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registration of handguns has been mandatory since 1934 but 
neither the Department of Justice nor the RCMP is able to produce 
any evidence to prove that this firearms registry has helped 
solve or prevent even one crime.  In fact, the RCMP does not even 
collect statistics on whether a firearm used in a crime is 
registered.  It is not a factor.  It is almost as if the 
government did not want to know it was a failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada reports that 75% of all firearms crimes are 
committed with handguns and less than 7% with rifles and 
shotguns.  Is it not time for the auditor general to look at why 
the registration of handguns has never worked as intended? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years tens of thousands of guns have been restricted, 
registered, then prohibited by the government even though there 
has been no evidence to show that these firearms were involved in 
criminal incidents or were a threat to public safety.  Many 
prohibited firearms have been confiscated from their rightful 
owners without compensation, breaking if we had them, property 
rights laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to have the auditor general determine if this 
prohibition strategy is actually reducing crime, improving public 
safety or saving lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firearms acquisition certificates have been mandatory since 
1979 but this has not prevented criminals or madmen from getting 
firearms.  Has it kept firearms out of the hands Marc Lépine or 
Valery Fabrikant or Denis Lortie or Mark Chahal or Pierre Lebrun 
and so on?  Is it not time for the auditor general to examine the 
effectiveness of the government's licensing program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my bill or any version of it became law, it would force a 
constant improvement in this country's gun control laws.  Gun 
control laws that do not work would be repealed.  Gun control 
laws that are working would be retained and improved.  There 
would be a dynamic process of change and improvement. We should 
not just have it here, we should have it in all legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, my bill would take the politics and the emotion 
out of the process of making gun control laws.  Laws would be 
based on reason and logic and solid research.  The public trusts 
the auditor general far more than it trusts politicians.  I am 
willing to put our gun laws to the public safety test.  Is the 
government ready to do the same? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank everybody who participated today.  Someone 
drew to my attention a comment made by somebody who thought that 
we needed more gun control laws.  He did a thorough study. Gary 
Kleck said: “The research has caused me to move beyond even the 
skeptic position.  I now believe that the best currently 
available evidence, imperfect though it is, and must always be, 
indicates that general gun availability has no measurable net 
positive effect on rates of homicide, suicide, robbery, assault, 
rape, or burglary” and so on. 
We need to see if this is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this bill dies today, after all the arguments have now 
been heard, I respectfully request the unanimous consent of the 
House to send the bill to the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights for further review and examination.  Let us send it 
to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to refer 
the bill as requested? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the order paper.

next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
