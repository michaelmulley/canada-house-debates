<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MOTIONOFHON.MEMBERFORKOOTENAYEAST-SPEAKER'SRULING">MOTION OF HON. MEMBER FOR KOOTENAY EAST-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on the point of order raised 
by the hon. member for Kootenay East on June 12, 1996 
concerning the placement under Private Members' Business of a 
motion for a free conference with the Senate.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for raising this matter and the chief 
government whip for his contribution to the discussion.
<P>
	In his submission, the hon. member argued that because his 
motion seeking a free conference with the Senate on the 
accountability process for the main estimates dealt with the 
maintenance of the authority of the House on the management of 
its business, it should be considered under Motions, under the 
rubric Routine Proceedings, pursuant to Standing Order 67(1)(p). 
He also requested that this matter be dealt with expeditiously in 
light of the timelines established for the supply process. I have 
tried to accommodate his request.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have examined the arguments and precedents and, in my 
opinion, there are two aspects to this point of order: the first, 
whether or not free conferences can be employed to deal with 
matters such as the one proposed by the hon. member and, second, 
under which heading on the Order Paper this motion should be 
dealt with by the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In a bicameral Parliament such as ours, the two Houses share in 
the making of legislation. Throughout the legislative process, the 
House of Commons and the Senate communicate with each other 
by means of messages. Historically, on occasions where the two 
Houses had reached an impasse on amendments to a bill, they had 
resorted to a free conference, a meeting of the representatives of 
the House and the Senate at which  they attempt, through 
negotiation, to resolve their differences on the amendments in 
dispute.
<P>
<B>(1005 )</B>
<P>
	In the Canadian context, free conferences have occurred only in 
relation to amendments to bills. Although the possibility of 
resolving conflict by means of a conference is provided for in our 
standing orders, it has not been used since 1947. As the hon. 
member acknowledged, Beachesne's sixth edition, citation 748 
states in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Conferences between the Houses are now obsolete, since their main function, 
that of providing an occasion for communicating reasons for disagreement to 
amendments to bills, has been taken over by the modern practice of sending 
Messages.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the present situation, in my view it is not for the Chair to 
decide whether or not a free conference is the appropriate 
mechanism to deal with the substance of the hon. member's notice 
of motion. The matter before the Chair is its placement on the 
Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Over the years, various kinds of motions have been categorized 
and assigned their own place in the daily programme, including 
private members' motions, motions for leave to introduce bills, and 
motions to adjourn under Standing Order 52.
<P>
	These categories have developed over a lengthy period of time in 
response to the need to adapt to the organization of House business. 
Some categories are now uniquely reserved for the government or 
the opposition, whereas others are reserved for private members 
and some very special categories are reserved for items which 
affect the transaction of the routine business of the House.
<P>
	In addition, the kind of motions permissible under ``Motions'' 
has been narrowed to those that consist primarily of motions for 
concurrence in committee reports and motions relating to the 
sittings and proceedings of the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It has become the practice that when private members give 
written notice of motions pertaining to matters of the type 
described in Standing Order 67(1)(p), these motions are placed 
under the heading Private Members' Business on the Order Paper. 
These include motions seeking to amend the Standing Orders, 
providing orders  of reference to committees of the House, 
arranging the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3982"> 3982 </A></B>
<P>
conduct or the management of House business or in some other 
way dealing with the parliamentary environment.
<P>
	On many occasions where such motions as enumerated in 
Standing Order 67(1)(p) have been moved under Motions without 
notice, both ministers and private members have sought and been 
granted unanimous consent to do so. However, there are currently 
no other opportunities for private members to move motions during 
Routine Proceedings.
<P>
	Therefore, the hon. member's notice of motion M-266 is 
properly placed on the Order Paper under Private Members' 
Business. I thank the hon. member for having brought this matter to 
the attention of the House.

and a Canadian strategy document on reduction of military 
expenditures in developing countries.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXPORTOFMILITARYGOODS">EXPORT OF MILITARY GOODS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1992 I was a member of the Standing Committee on 
External Affairs and Trade which issued a report on ways to 
improve Canada's control of the export of military goods and ways 
to diversify the defence industries and promote greater 
conservation toward civilian production. It was a good report and 
my colleagues on the committee worked hard to come up with 
realistic recommendations that would help move government 
policy forward in imaginative ways.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I can say that a number of 
those recommendations are now being implemented. Not all of 
them, of course, in part because the international circumstances 
have changed; in part  because there are limits to what any one 
country can do on its own.
<P>
	I cite the work of the standing committee to underline a crucial 
point: this House has a real and irreplaceable role to play in the 
formulation of foreign policy. Parliament is able to consult with 
Canadians and draw together diverse views in a way that no other 
national institution can. It has an honourable tradition of public 
involvement and consciousness on leading issues, and has 
demonstrated an acute sense of how to promote, even provoke, new 
ideas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to turn to Parliament once again. I want to present on the 
occasion of the tabling of the annual report on military exports the 
main features of our security policy. I encourage the Parliament to 
make new recommendations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First I want to describe briefly the international context in which 
we operate, and give a sense of what Canada is now doing in the 
security field.
<P>
	Canada has long put international security at the centre of 
foreign policy. In the years immediately following the second 
world war, General Andrew McNaughton led the movement to 
place atomic power under multilateral control, and to assure that 
atoms would be used for peaceful purposes.
<P>
	In the 1960s, Tommy Burns was an inspiring force behind the 
drive to establish the international machinery for arms control and 
disarmament negotiations. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Pierre 
Trudeau led the call for nuclear sanity, including a proposal for a 
strategy of suffocation to halt the risk of nuclear proliferation.
<P>
	In recent years, however, the focus has been changing, and 
changing in ways that enables Canadians to play to our unique 
national traditions, strengths and aspirations.
<P>
	At the end of the cold war, the prospects of interstate conflict are 
diminishing rapidly. Instead, we are more concerned about conflict 
within states, that wreak havoc on domestic populations and 
occasionally threaten to spill over into neighbouring countries.
<P>
	If internal conflict does erupt, as we have seen in Cambodia, 
Bosnia, Haiti and elsewhere, it can prove even more vicious and 
murderous than wars between states, and can have enormous 
destabilizing effects on global security.
<P>
	When internal conflict finally does end, we still face enormous 
challenges of building the peace. A ceasefire between states is 
much easier to monitor and enforce than a cessation of hostilities 
within states. There is no clear border to separate belligerents, no 
clear difference between populations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3983"> 3983 </A></B>
<P>
	We must also deal with the new emerging security threats such 
as crimes of narco-trafficking, with environmental degradation 
and displaced populations. A recent round of UN conferences on 
habitat, social development, women's rights, etc., demonstrate that 
security of the individual is now a key element of any foreign 
policy.
<P>
	New instruments are being developed requiring new forms of 
international co-operation. Last year, for example, Canada chaired 
a meeting of G-7 ministers to improve our efforts to combat 
terrorism. Our police forces are working more and more closely 
with our counterparts throughout the world to address the serious 
problem of ruthless criminal organizations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Similarly, we know that democracy, responsible government and 
respect for human rights are fundamental building blocks of 
durable stability and security. But our support for these principles 
should not take the form of hectoring from the sidelines.
<P>
	Therefore, we are working with countries-with their 
governments, their non-governmental organizations, their 
citizens-to build vital, civil institutions that promote human 
rights and democracy.
<P>
	The Dayton accords reflect this approach. Canada played an 
active role in supporting the human rights elements of these 
accords and is strongly committed to continue providing resources 
to this end.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Prevention of conflict is always the preferred option, but 
sometimes there is no stopping the slide into war. What do we do 
then? Peacekeeping has been a major achievement of the last 40 
years, but in more and more cases the traditional forms of 
peacekeeping do not apply. International military units have been 
used in recent years to help deliver humanitarian aid in the middle 
of war. They are being used to enforce the peace, as NATO is doing 
in Bosnia.
<P>
	Canada is responding to new forms of conflict in new and, we 
hope, more effective ways. For example, we believe that the early 
and rapid deployment of well-trained UN forces can help smother 
emerging conflict before it flames out of control. We have 
established a training centre at Cornwallis, Nova Scotia. Our 
soldiers are training their counterparts in Asia, Latin America, 
eastern Europe and elsewhere in the techniques of peacekeeping 
and we have seen in the last few years that these new peacekeepers 
are increasingly making a major difference.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	We also prepared a major study involving experts from Canada 
and around the world on how to improve the UN's capacity to get 
peacekeepers in the field much more rapidly. We have a series of 
practical, affordable  recommendations which we are now 
developing at the United Nations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A third focus is peacebuilding. We know that it is not enough to 
simply stop the war. We must also build the peace. What Canada is 
doing in Haiti is a good example. There, we are working with the 
local government to build political and civil institutions that can 
address the needs of the Haitian people. Police from the RCMP and 
the Sûreté du Québec are training up a new Haitian police force.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We know that hate messages can poison a population and make 
peace impossible. Therefore Canada recently launched an initiative 
in Europe to promote free, democratic media as a counter to the 
kind of distortions that helped trigger the war in the former 
Yugoslavia. We are beginning to look at broad issues of how the 
new information technologies and our high level of skills in 
broadcasting can become an effective role and tool of our foreign 
policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These three strands of conflict prevention, rapid response and 
reconstruction and peace building are distinct, but they do reinforce 
each other. They have to be drawn together into an effective 
approach to conflict. Our resources are finite. Choices have to be 
made about what we can do best. This is an area where the views of 
Parliament are most welcome and necessary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Even as we make these changes we are still faced with a world 
arms production still standing at almost $200 billion per year. 
Granted, there has been progress in recent years in reducing nuclear 
weapons through the START process. The steep cuts to the arsenals 
of the former Soviet Union and the United States are welcome.
<P>
	We now face the prospect of growing nuclear and in most cases 
chemical and biological capacity in other states, particularly the 
so-called rogue nations which recognize no international norms 
and rules. This represents a very serious threat to our security. For 
this reason the extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was 
crucial. The indefinite extension of the NPT was seen as virtually 
unachievable a few years ago, yet with determined effort in 
east-west co-operation we made it happen.
<P>
	At the extension conference last year Canada played a central 
role in drafting a Declaration of Principles and Objectives and a 
Declaration of Enhanced Reviews that broke the logjam and made 
success possible. The latter is of great significance because it 
pledges all signatories to review every five years. Preparations for 
each meeting will take several years and that is the time to get our

ideas  into play. Again, I would consider that Parliament has a 
major role to play.
<P>
	We need new approaches to those regions where proliferation 
risks are the highest. Members of Parliament will remember only a 
few years ago the great anxiety about the future of nuclear weapons 
in Ukraine. After some initial hesitation the Ukraine government 
realized that nuclear weapons were an obstacle rather than an entry 
card into the wide community and today Ukraine is free of nuclear 
weapons. It is also the beneficiary of considerable financial help. 
This year under Canadian chairmanship the G-7 concluded an 
agreement with Ukraine to shut down the Chernobyl reactor.
<P>
	We have to consolidate the gains of recent years in reducing 
nuclear weapons. One major problem is what to do with the nuclear 
weapons grade plutonium which has accumulated from the 
destruction of existing weapons in the United States and Russia. At 
the nuclear summit in Moscow our Prime Minister announced that 
Canada is prepared to consider converting some of this material 
into nuclear power generation in Canada.
<P>
	Our offer is contingent of course on whether the program can 
meet strict security and environmental standards. If we go ahead 
the program would substantially reduce the stockpile of weapons 
grade material that can find its way into countries bent on illicit 
nuclear weapons production.
<P>
	Equally important for attaining security against 
non-proliferation is a need to sign a comprehensive test ban treaty 
by this fall. The Canadian role has been important both in pushing 
for the treaty at Geneva and in providing the scientific work needed 
for verification.
<P>
	Weapons of mass destruction raise the most serious questions 
about the future of our planet, but we must never forget that 
conventional weapons are the ones that still do the killing in the 
conflicts that have raged over the last several years. To limit them 
is even more complex than in the nuclear, chemical or biological 
fields. In this area the end of the cold war may only have made 
matters worse. There is an excessive supply: weapons made 
redundant by the end of the east-west competition find their way 
cheaply into third world countries. There is a heightened demand 
for high tech weapons. Countries that once looked to one or the 
other superpowers now feel obliged to protect themselves.
<P>
	There has been some modest progress but the emphasis is on 
modest. The UN register of conventional weapons is a useful tool. 
However there are loopholes and real problems of voluntary 
compliance. We as Canadians are now working to improve it, but 
progress unfortunately will be slow.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	More optimistically, there are promising signs of the emergence 
of new world co-operation and co-ordination  regarding the control 
of conventional arms and dual-use exports. For decades a NATO 
led organization called COCOM established tough barriers to cover 
the flow of weapons. The cold war is over and the Russian 
federation and former Warsaw pact members in eastern Europe are 
now just as concerned about the destabilizing weapons programs of 
rogue states as we are.
<P>
	Last December Canada, its former COCOM partners, as well as 
its former Warsaw pact adversaries joined forces to announce a 
new regime, the Wassenaar arrangement, to promote greater 
transparency and responsibility in global arms and dual-use trade.
<P>
	Canada is also leading international efforts that could result in a 
global ban on anti-personnel mines. Justified as legitimate 
weapons of war a few years ago, we have seen recently how these 
terrible devices have become instruments of terror against 
civilians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On January 17, we announced a moratorium on the production, 
export and operational use of antipersonnel mines. This provided a 
dramatic push to international efforts. A year ago we were a mere 
handful of hopeful countries and now, a large network of countries 
are thinking along the same lines as Canada.
<P>
	Along with Canada, 35 countries, including the U.S.A., 
Germany and South Africa, have now declared their commitment 
to work for a total ban. Last month, during his visit to Ottawa, 
Foreign Minister Kinkel of Germany agreed to work closely with 
Canada on winning international support for a ban. The Mexican 
Foreign Minister did the same.
<P>
	We have also the commitment of the Central American 
presidents. Furthermore, we are working in NATO, in ASEAN and 
in consultation with our G-7 partners.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This coming fall we will break new ground by hosting an 
international strategy session in Canada to reinforce work on 
securing a ban. We are now mobilizing support for a UN resolution 
at the general assembly.
<P>
	We accept that countries have the right to self-defence, to 
maintain militaries and to arm those militaries in a manner 
consistent with their legitimate defence needs. Aside from the 
so-called rogue states that have removed themselves from all 
reasonable international standards of behaviour, there are still 
others whose weapons procurement appear to go well beyond the 
limits of actual need. The question is: What is legitimate and what 
levels of power, sophistication and expense are warranted?
<P>
	This is particularly worrying in developing countries that divert 
scarce resources from economic development toward military 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3985"> 3985 </A></B>
<P>
build-up. Do aid flows free up money so that governments can 
spend their domestically generated  funds on weapons? Or, if aid 
funds were held back, would these governments spend their money 
on weapons anyway?
<P>
	The relation between aid policy and military in recipient 
countries is now a matter of priority for Canadians. Canada has 
taken a leading role internationally in garnering support for further 
study and concrete action. Canada raises the issue consistently in 
international fora such as the World Bank and the IMF, and has 
formed a group of like-minded countries who meet regularly to 
define innovative ways to target development co-operation efforts 
in this regard.
<P>
	At the G-7 summit in Halifax last year, G-7 ministers adopted 
Canada's proposal to urge multilateral development banks to take 
account of military spending. Recently we have proposed that the 
OECD conduct a series of case studies on this subject. Today I 
tabled a strategy paper and I hope it will be the source of major 
debate in this Parliament.
<P>
	To reinforce our commitment on conventional arms control we 
need to look continuously at our record. Export controls are the 
most important tool in limiting military exports and most 
responsible countries have them in one form or another.
<P>
	Canada's controls are among the toughest in the world, but I 
intend to tighten them further to ensure as far as possible that our 
exports do not end up in the wrong hands or end up being used for 
unacceptable purposes. I have instructed my officials in the 
following way: to carry out more rigorous analyses of the regional, 
international and internal security situations in destination 
countries to forestall the possible destabilizing effects of proposed 
sales; to apply a stricter interpretation of human rights criteria, 
including increasing our requirements for end user certificates and 
other end use assurances to further minimize the risk that Canadian 
military equipment might be used against civilians; and to exercise 
the strictest controls over the export of firearms and other 
potentially lethal weapons to satisfy me that gun control laws and 
practices in recipient countries are adequate to ensure that 
Canadian firearms do not find their way into illicit arms trade nor 
fuel local violence.
<P>
	Today I have tabled the sixth annual report on Canada's military 
exports. I am pleased to report that military exports decreased 12 
per cent in 1995 and remain low as far as lower income developing 
countries are concerned.
<P>
	I want to make Canada an even more responsible player in the 
global military goods market and I want Canada to continue to play 
a leadership role in the multilateral Wassenaar arrangement. Again 
I would invite Parliament to take an active interest in defining this 
role.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	I have talked today about the ways our foreign policy is being 
refashioned around the new security policy principles and 
objectives. I am confident we are on the right track but I want to 
make sure we continue to move ahead, to look to the future by 
building on our solid foundations.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier the work of Generals MacNaughton and 
Burns and of former Prime Minister Trudeau to bring some sanity 
to the world, to reverse the rush toward greater and more 
destructive weapons. At that time many mocked their efforts as 
idealistic dreams or worse. Today their ideas are commonplace, the 
starting point for current discussions. I hope parliamentarians will 
join us in this search.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stépane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to speak about Canada's security 
policy, more specifically about the tabling of the sixth annual 
report on the export of Canadian military goods.
<P>
	However, before I get to this last topic, I would like, first of all, 
to say a few words about the extremely cavalier manner in which 
this government, and more specifically the Department of Foreign 
Affairs, have acted, given the circumstances surrounding this 
debate.
<P>
	Once again, the opposition parties and the official opposition to 
which I belong were not advised until the very last minute that a 
debate on Canada's security policy had been scheduled in the 
House. In light of this fact, it is extremely difficult for our political 
party and for the other parties represented in the House to perform 
their duties properly since we cannot prepare ourselves in advance. 
If the minister truly wants thoughtful, cohesive and lively debates 
to take place in this House, then he must give parliamentarians 
sufficient time to prepare themselves.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the same thing happened in the case of the debate 
on renewing the mandate of Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
There again, the government failed to notify the opposition parties 
or the official opposition until the very last minute, despite the fact 
that this was a matter of utmost importance. Indeed, the debate 
centred on whether or not the government should renew the 
mandate of our peacekeeping forces stationed in a hostile theatre of 
operations. We deplore the attitude taken by the government here, 
as it does not appear to have learned anything from that unfortunate 
incident.
<P>
	The situation is even more regrettable given that the new 
Minister of Foreign Affairs had shown some sensitivity and 
openness toward opposition members by giving them adequate 
time to prepare for the debate on Canada's peacekeeping mission in 
Haiti. In addition to notifying us in advance of the debate and of the 
motion to be debated, the minister invited us to attend a briefing  on 
the subject and gave us more than enough advance notice. It would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3986"> 3986 </A></B>
<P>
now appear that this was nothing more than a chance occurrence on 
the part of this government and that improvisation has now become 
once again the order of the day.
<P>
	I must also deplore the fact that the government is asking us to 
speak about an annual report on which we have yet to lay our eyes. 
How can we properly comment on a report which only the minister 
and his officials have seen? The official opposition has an 
important role to play in a democracy. However, it must be allowed 
to properly assume this role. Unfortunately, we see that once again, 
the government was unwilling to or did not take the necessary steps 
to allow us to properly take on our role. Otherwise, it would have 
given us the chance to read and comment in advance on the report 
on the export of Canadian military goods. Is this not what we are 
doing here in the House today?
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister even took the liberty of giving the 
National Press Club of Canada a sneak preview of his speech 
earlier this morning, before the House even had a chance to hear it. 
What a paradoxical attitude to have toward Parliament, an 
institution that the minister professes to respect and whose 
opinions he claims to value.
<P>
	However, I cannot remain silent when our work is made even 
more challenging by virtue of the fact that the federal government, 
which prides itself on being the champion of official bilingualism, 
displays shocking arrogance by sending us the foreign affairs 
minister's speech in English only. This reflects a blatant lack of 
respect for my political party as well as for all francophone 
parliamentarians in the House. The message the federal 
government has conveyed to the francophone population is 
therefore one of contempt.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I demand that the minister give us his assurances that this 
intolerable situation will not occur again in future.
<P>
	Regarding the sale of Canadian military goods abroad, it should 
be noted that in 1994, sales to third world countries increased by 40 
per cent, setting a new record. In fact, sales to developing countries 
rose from $242.2 million 1993 to $342.6 million in 1994, an 
increase of over $100 million.
<P>
	Canada managed to increase its share of the market at a time 
when other global arms suppliers were experiencing a general 
decline in sales. It will be interesting to see whether Canadian arms 
sales to developing countries will have registered another increase 
in 1995.
<P>
	Yet, the minister mentioned in his speech that exports of 
Canadian military goods had declined by 12 per cent in 1995. 
Despite the decrease, sales of arms and of Canadian military goods 
to developing countries remain very strong.
<P>
	In fact, they remain so strong that the U.S. Congressional 
Research Service, the leading authority on the transfer of 
conventional arms to developing countries, ranks Canada seventh 
among all third world arms suppliers for the years 1991 to 1994. 
This agency estimates that Canadian arms sales to developing 
countries totalled $800 million over this four year period.
<P>
	Moreover, it should also be noted that in 1994, Canada sold some 
of these military goods to countries with repressive regimes guilty 
of systematic human rights violations. Unfortunately, this is 
happening despite government guidelines aimed at curbing exports 
of this nature. The government was either unable or unwilling to 
stop the sale of military goods to these countries.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Foreign Affairs be proud to announce to 
us that Canadian arms sales declined by 12 per cent this year, when 
the 1994 annual report on the export of military goods shows an 
increase of 48 per cent over the previous year? This means that, 
compared to 1993, Canadian arms sales are up 36 per cent. Those 
are the real figures.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to trade. Quite the contrary, 
in fact. However, when it comes to arms sales, we believe that we 
must remain vigilant in the face of the Liberal government's 
choices.
<P>
	In this case, we know for a fact that military goods produced in 
Canada are not always used advisedly. For example, in 1994 
Canada sold $1.2 million worth of arms to Indonesia. Yet, we know 
that this country has been illegally occupying East Timor for the 
past 20 years and has been responsible for over 200,000 deaths, 
according to Amnesty International.
<P>
	How can we believe that the goods produced here were not used 
to put down this country's population? How can the minister claim 
that he is toughening his criteria in order to draw up a list of 
countries that can purchase arms from Canada? What the minister 
is not saying is that arms sales to Thailand increased from 
$620,000 in 1993 to $20.621 million in 1994.
<P>
	Nonetheless, it is ironic to hear the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
give us an overview of his government's record of arms sales to 
foreign countries, when as recently as last year, this same 
government was seriously negotiating the sale of its fleet of 63 
CF-5 fighter aircraft to Turkey.
<P>
	I even put a question about this issue to the minister of defence 
in March 1995. Need we remind the House that the Turkish air 
force and artillery were pounding civilian Kurds in northern Iraq at 
that very moment?
<P>
	Even though Canada ultimately sold 13 of its fighter aircraft to 
Botswana, the mere fact that it even dared to negotiate the sale with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3987"> 3987 </A></B>
<P>
Turkey is reprehensible. There was reason to be concerned that 
these fighter aircraft would be used to bomb civilian targets. The 
Bloc  Quebecois refuses to compromise where this issue is 
concerned.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The minister also talked about antipersonnel mines. I would 
simply remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois members have 
expressed only partial satisfaction with the announced moratorium 
on the production, export and operational use of antipersonnel land 
mines.
<P>
	Admittedly, the moratorium is a step in the right direction. 
However, in our view, the government missed a golden opportunity 
to show some leadership by refusing to destroy its own stocks of 
land mines.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that Canada should take the lead in 
destroying these weapons.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I do want to say that the Bloc Quebecois 
wholeheartedly supports Canada's participation in UN mine 
clearing operations in many countries. Canada must spare no effort 
to help toughen up the restrictions on the use of land mines, until 
such time as these are completely eliminated from the world's 
arsenal of weapons.
<P>
	On the subject of arms exports, I would like to remind the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of his government's profligate 
spending on arms, particularly at a time when it has no qualms 
whatsoever about slashing blindly at the expense of most 
disadvantaged of all to make up part of its annual financial deficit.
<P>
	Simply as an example, consider the defence department's recent 
decision to purchase 1,600 new anti-tank missiles at a cost of $23.6 
million. This brings the total cost of the procurement program to 
over $230 million.
<P>
	One has to wonder what the army did with the first 4,500 
missiles it ordered in 1993. Why did the government order an 
additional 1,600 missiles when it never really had any use for the 
ones it ordered in the first place?
<P>
	I can understand that we need to be prepared, just in case. 
However, I would remind the minister that it is time for his 
government to stop imagining enemies hiding behind every bush, 
to stop making preparations for war and to put a end to costly and 
unjustified large-scale procurement programs.
<P>
	This government's stubborn insistence on purchasing new 
submarines, the usefulness of which has never been proven, speaks 
volumes about its logic.
<P>
	On the one hand, the government is quick to purchase useless 
military toys while on the other hand, because of cutbacks, the 
level of government assistance to the poorest nations will be the 
lowest it has been in nearly 30 years.
<P>
	An OECD report released in Paris yesterday shows that the level 
of official development assistance fell by 7 per cent last year in 
Canada to .39 per cent of GNP, whereas internationally, the level 
was .7 per cent of GNP.
<P>
	Canada's contribution has not been so paltry since 1969. This is 
deplorable.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is my hope that the new guidelines announced 
by the minister this morning for the export of military goods will 
be applied much more stringently and consistently, something 
which we have grown accustomed to since the government took 
over the reins of office.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to comment on the minister's statement. As it was very 
extensive and as I have received it only recently, I will not 
comment on everything but I will focus on a few of the most 
important issues dealt with in the statement.
<P>
	I share the minister's opinion that conflict within states 
constitutes the major security threat in the coming decade. Our 
recent experience in Bosnia, Rwanda and Haiti bear this out.
<P>
	Unfortunately the UN has been woefully inadequate in dealing 
with such conflicts and an increasing burden has been placed on 
countries like Canada to intervene on their own to save the day. 
This is not acceptable.
<P>
	The UN must undergo a fundamental restructuring and reform 
from top to bottom over the next few years, not decades, if this 
trend is to be reversed. As it stands now there is little political 
support for the UN on many occasions and even less financial 
support.
<P>
	It could easily be argued the UN is teetering on the edge of 
bankruptcy. This will continue if countries like Canada do not lay 
down the law at the UN and bring about a fundamental reform.
<P>
	We can be leaders in the area of fulfilling this role. I firmly 
believe the security of the entire world depends on our creating that 
reform within the UN or a similar agency. It is necessary. We need 
a leader and I think Canada could fill that role very well.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	There is more to the problems of international conflict resolution 
than the UN. It can be traced to this Parliament. We all 
acknowledge peacekeeping is one of Canada's great contributions 
to building world peace, but look at how Parliament deals with the 
peacekeeping issue.
<P>
	We have in the past held sham debates with inadequate 
information about the mission and no votes. How can the minister 
argue he really cares about the opinion of Parliament when mission 
after mission this continues to happen?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3988"> 3988 </A></B>
<P>
	It happened repeatedly with the Bosnia mission where there was 
a totally inadequate mandate and no long term plan. Now it 
appears it could be happening with Haiti.
<P>
	The minister well knows the mandate for the Haiti mission 
expires at the end of the June, but we still have no long term plan. 
Canada has not established clear criteria or conditions under which 
we are prepared to continue with this mission. Once again the 
minister is getting ready to sign a blank cheque to continue the 
Haiti mission.
<P>
	Does the minister really think this kind of nonsense is 
acceptable? Helping Haiti is a worthy cause but there has to be a 
plan. There has to be broad based international support including 
financial support. There have to be clear criteria for Canadian 
participation and there has to be a reasonable chance of success in 
an acceptable timeframe.
<P>
	Yet Parliament has heard nothing about these things. There has 
been no information. The UN is still floundering around in typical 
fashion and I do not think this bodes well for the future of the 
mission, regardless of the good intentions of Canada and the very 
commendable work of our soldiers and RCMP and other police 
forces and the hardships they have had to endure in Haiti.
<P>
	Moving on to another topic, I would like to talk about combating 
terrorism. Reform fully supports the government in this effort and 
we encourage the minister to take bold steps to cut off any terrorist 
funding flowing from Canada. In addition, we want to see quick 
progress in international co-operation to punish terrorists who use 
borders as shields against justice.
<P>
	On human rights and democratic development, I agree that 
isolation and hectoring, to quote the minister, is not productive. We 
must assist in the building of institutions which support human 
rights and democratic development throughout the world. This is in 
our interests and this is what Canadians would want us to do.
<P>
	With respect to the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and 
biological weapons, Reform agrees this is an urgent problem. That 
is why we firmly supported the government in its efforts to 
indefinitely extend the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. That is also 
why we have repeatedly urged the government to take all steps to 
ensure the comprehensive test ban treaty is signed as quickly as 
possible. We particularly refer to China which we hope will very 
soon become a signatory.
<P>
	The minister's statement also mentioned anti-personnel land 
mines which should be banned worldwide. He stated how on 
January 17 of this year the government announced a moratorium on 
the production, export and operational use of these weapons. I 
guess the minister forgot to mention that it was Reform that first 
proposed this long before the government ever got around to doing 
it.
<P>
	I congratulate the Reform member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca 
who has worked diligently on this topic and who introduced a 
private member's bill to deal with this issue last year.
<P>
	On the minister's proposal for tightening conventional arms 
control, Reform broadly supports this concept. However, we wish 
to examine the details of the plan before we would comment 
further.
<P>
	There are many areas of security policy on which I believe there 
is a broad consensus between parties. However, we need action, not 
just endless words.
<P>
	On the issue of handing over blank cheques to the UN and 
blindly supporting peacekeeping missions, the government needs 
to rethink its approach. Reform has frequently commented on these 
issues and I know the minister privately agrees with much of what 
we have to say.
<P>
	It is up to him to assume responsibility for correcting these 
problems and he should do so without delay.

have the honour to present the 22nd report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in relation to its order 
of reference from the House on the matter of the communiqué 
published by the hon. member for Charlesbourg on October 26, 
1995 concerning the members of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	The issue before the committee was a narrow one: Does the 
communiqué from the hon. member for Charlesbourg constitute a 
contempt of the House of Commons? The committee came to the 
conclusion that the hon. member's actions were irresponsible. The 
committee cannot find reasonable grounds to show that he was in 
contempt of the House or that a breach of parliamentary privilege 
had occurred.
<P>
	The committee does not countenance the actions of the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg in sending out the communiqué in the 
terms it was, nor does it feel that the hon. member for

Western Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for 
the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec)</B> moved 
that Bill C-4, an act to amend the Standards Council of Canada Act, 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to support the Minister 
of Industry on the third reading of Bill C-4.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3991"> 3991 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me begin by thanking the Standing Committee on Industry 
for the prompt review of the bill. I would also be remiss if I did 
not thank the more than 1,000 Canadians who participated in the 
consultations which led to the development of this amendment and 
this amended bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Its first objective is to provide a structure giving more adequate 
support to the efforts of the 14,000 Canadian volunteers who give 
of their time, energy and expertise to the national standards system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Modern, effective standards are an integral part of creating the 
right marketplace conditions to encourage economic growth and 
jobs for Canadians. Marketplace framework laws like the 
amendments here to modernize the Standards Council of Canada 
help create an environment in which Canadians can make the 
decisions needed to create jobs and growth. These changes define 
the rules of the marketplace to balance the interests of all parties: 
businesses and consumers, small and large enterprises, buyers and 
sellers, the private and the public sectors.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	When marketplace framework laws work effectively, 
governments can stay on the sidelines, like referees, and let the 
private sector get on with the job.
<P>
	Marketplace framework laws have been at the core of the 
government's program to revitalize the Canadian economy. The 
changes proposed here fit well with our overall strategy.
<P>
	When the Minister of Industry tabled the agenda for jobs and 
growths in the publication ``Building a More Innovative 
Economy'', he outlined how Industry Canada would address four 
key elements to help the private sector create jobs and ensure 
growth in Canada. These four elements are trade, infrastructure, 
technology and the marketplace climate.
<P>
	The legislation before us addresses one of these elements, the 
marketplace climate. Standards establish a common benchmark 
against which the performance of goods and services can be 
measured. The impact of this legislation will be felt on all the other 
elements of our jobs and growth agenda.
<P>
	Standards promote trade both domestically and internationally. 
Internationally, standards like the ISO 9000 series give Canadian 
products and services a seal of quality recognized around the 
world. Within Canada, standards enable different jurisdictions to 
agree on a benchmark for quality that allows them to eliminate 
duplication of government services.
<P>
	Let me give the House an example of how important standards 
can be to international trade. Twenty years ago Canadian plywood 
was virtually unknown in Japan.  Japanese builders had not 
accepted the wood frame construction we use commonly in 
Canada. There was therefore no market for Canadian plywood in 
Japan. Well developed Canadian standards in this area have, 
however, helped to convince the Japanese building industry of the 
value of wood frame construction.
<P>
	The forest industry in Canada worked hard with the government 
to have Canadian certification recognized. The Canadian Plywood 
Association became the first organization in the world to gain 
Japanese approval as a foreign testing organization. Today Canada 
sells the Japanese 70 million board feet of plywood each year.
<P>
	Let me also give an example of how participation in standards 
development leads to expanded trade. Advanced Information 
Technologies Corporation, a Toronto based company, is working 
with the International Organization for Standardization to develop 
standards for passports that can be read by a machine. Its work has 
opened many doors for its business and last year its sales topped 
$34 million, with 80 per cent of the sales coming from the machine 
readable document business.
<P>
	Standards are vital in order to build an effective infrastructure. If 
members want an example of what can happen when uniform 
standards are not applied, study the early history of the railway 
industry in North America and in Australia. In Australia each state 
applied a different standard gauge for railway tracks. Hon. 
members can imagine the result. No train could travel from one 
state to the next. Every time one came to a state border the cargo 
had to be unloaded from its cars and reloaded on to the next train.
<P>
	We can shake our heads now in wonder at why this happened, but 
we must ensure a similar situation does not now arise in the case of 
infrastructure for the next century, infrastructure for the 
information highway.
<P>
	This infrastructure requires a great deal of co-ordination in the 
standards that will apply. The standards clearly affect a number of 
both federal and provincial jurisdictions, and a wide range of 
industries are involved in providing both the road bed and the 
content for the information highway. We do not want to find 
ourselves in the cyberspace equivalent of having to unload our 
information railway cars every time we come to a border.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Standards are vital to the healthy development of technology. 
The government's overall objective is to create conditions where 
we can build an innovative society in which research and 
development create technology and the business community adapts 
and adopts the best technology possible. That is the way to create 
jobs and growth in the modern context.
<P>
	One cannot have technological innovation without safeguards. 
Canadians must be assured their health and  safety will not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3992"> 3992 </A></B>
<P>
compromised by the new processes, the new products and the 
industrial designs that make our society innovative.
<P>
	Canadians want assurances that the buildings erected this year 
will not topple next year due to unproven techniques. Canadians 
want assurance that the electrical appliances they buy can be 
plugged into outlets at home and, once they are plugged in, they 
want the assurance a short-circuit will not burn their home down.
<P>
	Canadians want assurances their natural gas lines will not leak, 
that the gasoline they buy has the right octane levels for their car 
and that the propane tanks they buy have the right thread fit for 
their gas barbecues. Canadians value new innovation and the 
convenience of modern technology. However, Canadians will not 
compromise safety and security.
<P>
	This creates clearly a challenge for government. On one hand, 
we must encourage creativity and the adoption and adaptation of 
new technology. We do not want to slow down innovation. At the 
same time we have an obligation to ensure the new innovations will 
not expose Canadians to unwarranted risks. Standards are an 
effective way in balancing the need for technological innovation 
with the need to prevent undue risk. They enable innovators to 
know in advance the criteria that must be met.
<P>
	The criteria have been established as a result of consensus on 
how the public interest can best be protected. This enables the 
business community, researchers and innovators to forge ahead. 
Innovators can be as quick and flexible as they need to be in 
responding to new ideas and to new opportunities.
<P>
	Innovators know that by using standards set for their technology 
they will stay within the limits of safety. From my own 
constituency the needs are particularly important in farm related 
technology and new machinery as well as in the advancing and roll 
out of the information highway.
<P>
	Why has the adoption of standards been part of the government's 
strategy to create jobs and growth? Standards help business people, 
they help innovators and they help the consumers of Canada to get 
on with the task at hand.
<P>
	People do not always have to be looking over their shoulder to 
see what the government thinks. They do not consistently have to 
check for government approval, they just apply the standards that 
are there and accepted.
<P>
	The primary objective of this legislation is to make standards a 
more effective tool for the creation of jobs and growth in Canada as 
well as to provide safety for Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-4 is part of the government's overall strategy to create 
market conditions where the private sector can get on with the job 
of building a modern innovative economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I congratulate all those who contributed to the drafting of this 
bill and I ask my colleagues to give it their full support.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to take advantage of my remarks on Bill C-4, amending the 
Standards Council of Canada Act, to draw to the attention of the 
members of this House a series of legislative elements that I regard 
as extremely significant.
<P>
	The Standards Council of Canada is a body created by the 
Standards Council of Canada Act, which is chapter S-16 of the 
Revised Statutes of Canada. It reports to the Minister of Industry. 
Its objects are ``to foster and promote voluntary standardization'' 
where this is not already ``expressly provided for by law'', in a 
number of fields set out in the act, including construction, 
manufacturing, production, quality, performance and safety of 
buildings, structures, manufactured articles and products and other 
goods.
<P>
	The Standards Council of Canada is made up of representatives 
of the federal government, the provincial governments and 
industry, as set out in section 3 of the act. All standards are 
established on a voluntary basis by the relevant industries, and their 
purpose is to encourage and facilitate domestic and international 
trade.
<P>
	Bill C-4, before us today for third reading, enlarges the mandate 
and powers of the standards council. In addition to advancing the 
national economy, the bill tells us, standardization will have to 
support sustainable development; in addition to benefiting public 
health, it will have to benefit the health and safety of workers.
<P>
	The standards council will have an important promotional role to 
play, in addition to encouraging standardization where it is not 
already mandatory. In its annual report, the council will have to 
make recommendations to the minister regarding standards it 
considers should be mandatory.
<P>
	Bill C-4 proposes significant amendments to the existing act. It 
chiefly seeks to make the council less ponderous by reducing the 
number of its members from 57 to 15. One of those members 
would be ``a person employed in the public service of Canada to 
represent the Government of Canada''.
<P>
	The bill would also create two advisory committees: the 
provincial-territorial advisory committee, whose Chairperson and 
Vice-Chairperson would sit on the council, and the standards 
development organizations advisory committee, whose Chairper-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3993"> 3993 </A></B>
<P>
son would sit on the council. Provincial and territorial 
representation would  thus be assured by the first of these new 
committees and representation of expert bodies by the second.
<P>
	Eleven other people representing the private sector, including 
non-governmental organizations, would sit on the council, for a 
total of 15 members.
<P>
	I think it is important to support Bill C-4 for three main reasons. 
First, the bill is designed to improve the operation of the Standards 
Council of Canada, a federal agency. Second, the bill is designed to 
promote economic growth by eliminating pointless irritants. And 
finally, Bill C-4 would help to pave the way for a flexible, efficient 
and viable partnership between Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	These reasons deserve closer examination. First, the bill id 
designed to improve the operation of the Standards Council of 
Canada. Bill C-4 is designed to make the council less ponderous 
and more functional. This is a very important process. The federal 
government machinery is imposing, weighty, often not very 
efficient, and prone to expensive duplication.
<P>
	The federal government machinery is omnipresent in the 
Canadian economy and often hampers economic growth by 
legislation or regulations that put a brake on, or put obstacles in the 
way of, economic progress.
<P>
	In this context, measures designed to improve operations are 
always welcome. All taxpayers will benefit in the long run. The 
agencies and enterprises that do business with the federal 
government will also benefit.
<P>
	Lastly, since governments are constant targets for criticism, the 
fact that the federal government wants to introduce some real 
changes may well make the public's view of it more favourable, 
and fairly quickly, too.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The end result will be the development and maintenance of 
functional, productive and viable relations between the government 
and the various components of our society.
<P>
	Second, promoting economic growth. The importance of Bill 
C-4 lies in the status and mandate of the organization whose 
operation it is designed to improve. The standards council plays a 
key role in regulating economic processes. Its role is to promote 
voluntary standardization by industry; that is the very core of its 
mandate.
<P>
	It would be difficult to argue that standardization does not 
matter. Without it, the propensity toward diversification 
characteristic of market economies would in the context of vast 
trading networks cause an immense variety of problems for the 
various transactors.
<P>
	Apart from wasted resources, increased costs and consumer 
dissatisfaction, both domestic and foreign trade would be seriously 
affected. Scarcity of resources and the principles of rationalization 
and efficiency demand standardization. Standardization means 
fluidity, efficiency and effectiveness in trade. Standardization  
means the elimination of brakes on trade and of obstacles to trade.
<P>
	Four factors militate in favour of standardization. First, the 
fundamental dynamic of the economy-the interdependence of 
trade, competitiveness, productivity, growth and employment. 
Second, the age-old dependence of the Canadian economy on raw 
materials: although the service sector has been developing steadily 
in Canada over the past 30 years, too many of our raw materials are 
still not processed in Canada, even now.
<P>
	Third, the context of globalization in the framework of NAFTA 
and trade with other countries of the world. Forth and last, the trend 
toward forming local, national and international partnerships.
<P>
	The principle of voluntary standardization is at the heart of Bill 
C-4. This key aspect of the standards council's mandate relies on 
promotion of voluntary standardization being done by industry 
stakeholders themselves. Encouraging stakeholders to adopt 
standards on a voluntary basis has obvious advantages.
<P>
	This approach assumes that each sector knows itself, its 
products, its needs and its stakeholders. It uses a consensus 
approach, which minimizes government intervention and control. 
In the circumstances, and given the council's role and mandate in 
improving efficiency, this is an approach we support.
<P>
	The third element I wanted to discuss is the implementation of a 
Quebec/Canada partnership. This is the third reason for our support 
of Bill C-4. We believe that very soon now, Quebec will have 
achieved sovereignty and, as it committed itself to doing in the 
agreement of June 12 of last year among the Parti Quebecois, the 
Action démocratique du Québec and the Bloc Quebecois, it will 
negotiate an economic and political partnership with 
Canada-essentially because Quebecers want to maintain a shared 
economic sphere, and stable, productive and viable political 
relations, with Canada.
<P>
	From this perspective, Bill C-4, like Bill C-19 implementing the 
Agreement on Internal Trade, constitutes in our view an important 
step toward making such a partnership possible.
<P>
	In both instances, an effort is being made to improve and 
consolidate government agencies that will be better able to serve 
our Canadian friends and that will be indispensable in negotiating 
the new partnership.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	To sum up, our support for Bill C-4 is based on the three reasons 
I have discussed: it should improve the way the Standards Council 
of Canada, a federal government agency, operates; it should 
encourage economic growth; and it should help to lay the 
groundwork for a partnership between Quebec and Canada that will 
be flexible, effective and viable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3994"> 3994 </A></B>
<P>
	We hope that our future Canadian partners will understand that 
we are looking forward in all good faith to these improvements 
in federal political institutions.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to add that the bill does not in our 
opinion seem to pose any major problems. The council's structure 
would be changed, and to a slight extent its powers, while the way 
it operates would be made less ponderous. The provinces and 
territories would drop from 12 representatives to two, but their 
proportional representation would be just the same. In addition, the 
proposed provincial-territorial advisory committee would give the 
provinces and territories the opportunity to make their voices 
heard.
<P>
	Standardization is voluntary. This is simple common sense, as 
the economic sectors or companies that decide not to go along are 
penalizing themselves at a time when trade is so important, both 
within Canada and in North America and the rest of the world.
<P>
	Given the increased trade among the provinces of Canada, 
between Canada, the United States and Mexico under NAFTA and 
soon with South America as well, and ultimately with the whole 
world, standardization will eventually have to be adopted by all 
parties. This is the only logical conclusion for those who want to 
trade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak at third reading of Bill C-4, an act to amend 
the Standards Council of Canada Act.
<P>
	To begin thinking logically about this subject, two questions 
need to be considered: What are standards and what role do 
standards play in Canadian society?
<P>
	Standards reassure consumers that products and services will 
work as they are described and as they are supposed to work. They 
also inform consumers about manufacturer tests for quality and 
safety and guarantee that human and environmentally safe 
production techniques have been used in all manufacturing 
processes.
<P>
	For example, standards tell Canadians that hockey helmets will 
not break when players are in a collision on the ice. They tell 
Canadians that an electrical cord is safe to use and will not spark a 
fire. Standards tell Canadians that their TV reception will not go 
fuzzy when they turn on their sets. Indeed, standards ensure 
Canadians that products and services provide a level of quality on 
which they can rely.
<P>
	Standards also play an important role in national and 
international trade. If a manufacturer in Canada makes a product 
that does not meet the standards required by another province or 
another country, it will not be allowed to ship or export that product 
to the desired destination.
<P>
	In fact, some countries use unique product standards as artificial 
trade barriers to restrict foreign imports. It is important, therefore, 
for Canada to encourage national and international co-operation in 
the development of common standards.
<P>
	In that regard, Canada's trade agreements, NAFTA, GATT and 
the internal trade agreement, prohibit the use of standards as trade 
barriers.
<P>
	The development of the Standards Council of Canada reflects the 
importance the Canadian public places on standards. Established in 
1970 as a crown corporation, the Standards Council of Canada 
promotes voluntary standardization in Canada and encourages 
international co-operation with our trading partners and standards 
organizations. It also oversees the Canadian standards system 
which consists of organizations that write standards, certify 
products and services, tests and calibrates, and registers standards.
<P>
	The bill before us today changes the form and function of the 
Standards Council of Canada in several ways. First, it expands the 
current mandate of the Standards Council.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Second, Bill C-4 reduces the number of council members from 
57 to 15 and adds necessary qualifications for the private sector 
representatives.
<P>
	Third, Bill C-4 changes in the English version the titles of the 
president and vice-president to chairperson and vice-chairperson 
respectively.
<P>
	Fourth, it specifies the duties of the chairperson.
<P>
	Fifth, Bill C-4 establishes the provincial territorial advisory 
committee and the standards development organizations advisory 
committee.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-4 specifies that meetings of the council and its 
committees may be held through electronic means.
<P>
	These are changes to the Standards Council of Canada Act that 
the Reform Party of Canada supports.
<P>
	Let me discuss just a few of these proposed changes. First, the 
expansion of the Standards Council of Canada's current mandate 
means that it will include all areas where standardization is not 
already provided for by law. It will involve more Canadians in 
standards activities. It will oversee the national standards system. It 
will foster quality, performance and technological innovation in 
Canadian goods and services through standards. Finally, it will 
establish long term objectives and strategies.
<P>
	These changes increase the competitiveness of Canadian 
industry. Let me explain why. The current role of the Standards 
Council relates to the maintenance of the national standards 
system. The Standards Council does not develop or promote a 
national strategy. This puts Canada at a competitive disadvantage 
vis-à-vis other  countries, as Canada is one of just a few G-7 
members that does not have a national standards strategy.

	For example, Britain, Germany and France have well established 
strategies designed to support their industry both domestically and 
internationally. Often representatives from Canadian steel 
companies find that potential customers from around the world 
want to purchase steel according to German standards, an 
indication of how well the Germans have promoted German 
products and German standards throughout the world.
<P>
	British industry improved the image of its export products by 
complying with international standards for quality labelled ISO 
9000.
<P>
	Japan currently provides assistance to many countries in order 
for them to adopt national standards based on its system of 
standards and as a result Japan acquires a competitive advantage.
<P>
	The United States also aggressively promotes its standards 
internationally, even though it has not formed a formal national 
strategy.
<P>
	A Canadian national standardization strategy would go a long 
way to support and help build Canada's commercial 
competitiveness abroad. Other countries would be encouraged to 
develop our system of standardization and we could gain more 
credibility by having Canadian industry accredit themselves with 
ISO 9000.
<P>
	Renewing the Standards Council of Canada mandate to establish 
long term objectives and strategies is an important step to 
increasing Canada's international competitiveness. It is important 
that the Standards Council does not develop its strategies in secret.
<P>
	Bill C-4 gives Canadians this commitment. It states that more 
people will be involved in standards activities. I remind the 
Standards Council to make sure it consults small and medium size 
businesses and implements their views in planning national 
standards strategy. Their interests must not be neglected as they 
have been in the past by this Liberal government.
<P>
	Changes to the Standards Council of Canada membership under 
Bill C-4 is an important step in moving in this direction. The 
number of public servant members on the council will decrease 
from six to one. This change will hopefully make the Standards 
Council of Canada become more representative of Canadian 
industry, including those from the medium and small enterprises.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	The private sector membership of the standards council will also 
change under Bill C-4. Private sector members would now have to 
represent a broad spectrum of interests and possess the experience 
necessary to assist the standards council in fulfilling its mandate. 
Hopefully  the standards council will become more open, 
accessible and accountable to Canadians and Canadian industry 
under this change.
<P>
	I recommend to the minister to make one change that would 
improve Bill C-4 in our estimation. That is to follow the 
suggestions made by the Canadian Standards Association and add a 
review clause to the Standards Council of Canada Act. The review 
clause would state that the act be examined on a regular basis such 
as five year intervals.
<P>
	Since standards change rapidly in a fast growing technological 
and global economy, it makes common sense to review the 
Standards Council of Canada Act to ensure the standards council 
and the national standards system remain relevant to the needs of 
Canadian industry and Canadian society.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-30 just as I 
did when Bill C-58 was introduced in this House at second reading, 
on November 17 1974.
<P>
	We all remember why the government tabled Bill C-58, which 
has now become Bill C-30. According to a decision of the trial 
division of the Federal Court of Canada, RCMP officers were 
basically covered by the legislation pertaining to public service, 
subject to working conditions established by Treasury Board and, 
indirectly, to the RCMP's incorporating instruments, the Financial 
Administration Act and the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	That lead to the following situation. First, according to the 
Gingras decision, the government had to give a bilingual bonus to 
RCMP officers. It did not appeal the decision from the trial 
division of the Federal Court. It rather decided to table Bill C-58, 
which was a kind of backdoor appeal. This is like changing the law 
after the decision was rendered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> I will wait till my colleague from Kingston and 
the Islands has finished.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He just left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> He just left? Thank you. He probably met his 
whip on the way out who told him to keep quiet. I would like to 
thank the member from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who, for 
once, succeeded in bringing the hon. member from Kingston and 
the Islands back in line.
<P>
	I can now go on. The government tabled Bill C-58 after deciding 
not to appeal the Gingras decision. What Bill C-58 basically tells 
us is that RCMP members are not part of the public service, they 
are not governed by the provisions on public servants or by the 
working conditions established by Treasury Board. This is getting 
close to the separate employer status that some have always wanted 
to give to the RCMP.
<P>
	There is a much broader problem, a staff relations problem that 
has been around for a while and which the study of Bill C-58 made 
apparent. There is a gap between command staff and officers of the 
RCMP. The study of Bill C-58 clearly demonstrated that working 
conditions are not too good.
<P>
	Some RCMP members wanted to appear before the committee 
on government operations to talk about Bill C-58 because it was 
directly affecting them. They were told not to wear their uniform 
and that they would have to appear in their own personal name, 
outside regular hours of work. This job atmosphere is pretty weird 
in an organization where everybody is supposed to have the same 
goals.
<P>
	Bill C-58 also touches upon another aspect of working 
conditions of RCMP members, that is to say their unionization. 
Some members are unionized. At present, RCMP civilian 
employees are unionized. The March 1994 Gingras judicial 
decision definitely opens the door to the possible application of 
Part I and, of course, Part II of the Canada Labour Code to RCMP 
officers.
<P>
	Fearing that its RCMP police officers could unionize, the 
government introduced Bill C-58 to exclude them from the 
ordinary rules of law applicable to all other Canadian workers 
subject to the Canada Labour Code's general rules.
<P>
	When the minister and RCMP officers appeared before the 
government operations committee, they were hard put to answer 
the following question: ``For which reasons are you opposed to 
unionization, to free negociation of working conditions between 
RCMP police officers and the government, their employer?''
<P>
	All they could say was that since RCMP officers had to look 
after the safety of ambassadors and members of the consular corps, 
they could not be compared to other Canadian police officers who 
dit not have to perform such duties. However witnesses have shown 
during committee hearings on Bill C-58 that Sûreté du Québec 
police officers, Ontario Provincial Police officers, in their 
respective province, have to look after the safety of consular corps 
members located in Toronto, Montreal or Quebec City.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Now, all things considered, they are not any different. We realize 
the distinct status the RCMP command staff is so fond of is like a 
sacred cow.
<P>
	A case is still outstanding before the Quebec Court of appeal. I 
am talking about the Delisle case against the Attorney General of 
Canada. Staff sergeant Gaétan Delisle, who is now mayor of 
Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu, claims that the freedom of association 
provided for in the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
includes the right to unionization.
<P>
	The government simply wants to ignore court rulings and 
legislate retroactively to deny some rights. This approach is not 
appropriate. Let us wait and see what the court rulings on the right 
to unionization will be as well as the rulings of the federal 
commissions responsible for implementing the Canada Labour 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3997"> 3997 </A></B>
<P>
Code before deciding if, according to them, RCMP police officers 
can be  unionized, and if so, which system should be applied to 
them.
<P>
	We could eventually hold an open debate on unionization 
conditions for police officers that would be acceptable to MPs 
representing Canadian citizens. Should we have a general system 
providing for the right to strike, a system providing for compulsory 
arbitration or a system providing for a final offer? These are all 
possible options. With a bill such as Bill C-30, let us not exclude 
other possible courses of action. Above all, we cannot disregard the 
tension seething within the ranks of the RCMP, tension which last 
October or November resulted in Staff Sergeant Gaétan Delisle 
being ordered not to run for the office of mayor of 
Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu.
<P>
	We have indeed come to a pretty pass when a police force's 
headquarters seeks to strip one of its officers of his fundamental 
right to run as a candidate in a municipal, provincial or federal 
election. A grievance has been filed. This whole matter will be 
heard by the trial division of the Federal Court. However, this case, 
like many others, underscores the prevailing tension.
<P>
	We are coming very close to restricting individual freedom of 
expression. In the case of the communiqué released by the member 
for Charlesbourg, an attempt was made to restrict the freedom of 
expression of a member of Parliament. This member was brought 
up before the procedure and House affairs committee and an 
attempt was made to ``do a number'' on him, as they say, to 
intimidate him and to restrict his freedom to freely and 
democratically voice his sovereignist convictions in an open 
debate. We have never hidden our true intentions.
<P>
	The Gingras case, the Delisle case at the RCMP, Bill C-58, Bill 
C-30, the case of the member for Charlesbourg's communiqué: in 
all of cases, there is a common denominator, namely an attempt to 
restrict democratic rights, whether it be the rights of officers of the 
peace, those of RCMP officers or those of the member for 
Charlesbourg. To attempt to restrict a member's freedom to voice 
his opinion about a platform on which he was elected is to take 
matters too far. That is why we will be voting in favour of the 
motion at the report stage. We want to have certain provisions 
stricken from Bill C-30.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
respect to the first group of motions for Bill C-30, the Reform Party 
is guided by the following principles and policies found in our 
official policy document, the blue Book.
<P>
	The blue book policy on the RCMP states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports the traditional role of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police (RCMP) as a police force representative of and responsive to 
the populations it serves in Canada's regions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The blue book policy on official languages states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports official bilingualism in key federal institutions, 
such as Parliament and the Supreme Court, and critical federal services where 
need is sufficient to warrant provision of minority services on a cost effective 
basis. The Reform Party supports the removal of bilingual bonuses to civil 
servants as federal cost reduction measures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-30 contains provisions identical to Bill C-58, which died 
on the Order Paper as a result of the government's decision to 
prorogue Parliament this year.
<P>
	Bill C-30 removes RCMP officers from the definition of 
employee and therefore as members of the public service under the 
Public Service Staff Relations Act, essentially separate employer 
status. Only civilian members of the RCMP are to be governed by 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act. The staff relations for police 
officers of the RCMP are to be governed by the RCMP Act.
<P>
	Bill C-30 was originally introduced as housekeeping in nature; 
however, it became evident that the effect of the legislation would 
have serious implications for the rights of RCMP members. There 
exists concern that Bill C-30 in its present form would completely 
eliminate the application of the Canada Labour Code to RCMP 
members. At present RCMP members have the protection of part II 
of the code concerning health and safety.
<P>
	In order for the Reform Party to support Bill C-30, it would 
require a substantive amendment which would ensure the 
continued statutory protection of RCMP officers under the Canada 
Labour Code. In my assessment, none of the amendments put 
forward by the hon. member for Bellechasse would satisfy this 
requirement. Therefore, the Reform Party will not support Motion 
No. 1 which would amend Bill C-30 by deleting clause 1. The 
Reform Party will not support Motion No. 2 which would amend 
Bill C-30 by deleting clause 2. The Reform Party will not support 
Motion No. 3 which would amend Bill C-30 by deleting clause 3.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-30's aim is essentially to overturn the Federal Court of 
Appeal's decision of March 10, 1994 in the Gingras case. You will 
recall that the appeal court had concluded, at the time, that RCMP 
members, most of them law enforcement officers, are members of 
the public service and must submit to the rules of Treasury Board. 
And also that RCMP members are entitled to the bilingual bonus of 
more or less $800 per year.
<P>
	In May 1994, the government announced that it had no intention 
of appealing the Supreme Court of Canada's judgment and that 
consequently it would pay the bonus to RCMP members, including 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3998"> 3998 </A></B>
<P>
for some of the years during which the government had illegally 
refused to pay  that bonus. In total, retroactive payments amount to 
approximately $30 million.
<P>
	It seems that RCMP management is disturbed by this Federal 
Court of Appeal's decision since it means, according to some 
people, that the other rules of Treasury Board would also apply to 
the RCMP and its law enforcement officers, namely those 
concerning pay equity, the enforcement of official languages laws 
and working conditions, except the right to form a union.
<P>
	But before going further, it would be appropriate to determine 
the time context as well as the particular group concerned. What is 
the RCMP? Maybe we should start with this definition. There are 
15,500 regular members and special constables, about 2,000 
civilian members and also 3,400 public service employees.
<P>
	The 15,500 regular members are in fact law enforcement 
officers, the policemen of the RCMP. They are not unionized. The 
2,000 civilian members hold support positions such as laboratory 
technicians, general technicians, specialists in various fields, 
airplane pilots, and there are a indeterminate number of 
administrative support staff. The administrative support employees 
are not unionized either.
<P>
	The 3,500 public servants are members of the administrative and 
support staff, such as clerks, secretaries, custodians, etc. They were 
all hired by the Public Service Commission or came from other 
departments.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	What is worrisome about this bill is the roundabout way it is 
trying to achieve what is basically forbidden by the legislation. In 
the case of Bill C-30, the authorities are annoyed because, for a 
number of years now, there have been pushes inside the RCMP to 
unionize the agency.
<P>
	However, three times already, these attempts have failed. 
Unionization in 1996 is not supposed to be a barbaric act that must 
be opposed. It is the free expression of a group's desire to protect 
itself and to present a united front to the employer.
<P>
	Bill C-30 aims to overturn the Gingras decision of March 10, 
1994. Through Bill C-30, members of the RCMP would be 
excluded from the public service and could not therefore unionize. 
However, they would be allowed the bilingual bonus, a more or less 
roundabount way to take into account the Gingras decision.
<P>
	But what do members of the RCMP think of this bill? On June 14 
I received a copy of the magazine <I>Action</I> published by the RCMP's 
staff members association in Quebec. It is probably the special 
spring edition. It refers to all kinds of documents. This special 
edition is mostly about Bill C-30. There is even a paragraph and a 
half where the editor gives his opinion on the bill, and I quote: ``By 
introducing Bill C-30, the government is trying to reintroduce Bill 
C-58, the very one which gave  such grave concerns to the 
association and the public. In light of its background, one would 
have thought the government would have abandoned and 
pigeon-holed it. To our great surprise-I am still quoting the editor 
here-we learned that only a few days after meeting with you in 
Toronto the government was introducing Bill C-30 which 
contained the same provisions as its predecessor, Bill C-58, and 
announced that the bill was at the report stage. The adoption of Bill 
C-30 would represent a big setback in labour relations at the RCMP 
and it would seriously affect the rights of RCMP members''.
<P>
	These last words concerning the very rights of RCMP members 
are rather interesting. RCMP members are asked, of course, to 
protect the rights of taxpayers but when their own rights are 
involved, they are litterally sent packing.
<P>
	In Quebec, the provincial government has just put in place a very 
interesting program aimed at letting public servants who, in a show 
of economic and social maturity, deliberately decide to honestly 
and sincerely discuss what could seem a terrible waste of public 
monies, a misuse of public funds in order to cut down operational 
costs without affecting the quality of services provided. In today's 
discussion, that would be the quality of services provided by 
RCMP members to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Bill C-30 obviously snubs all efforts made by these people to 
expose in the most honest way the abuses committed inside their 
organization. Bill C-30 confirms that the government wants to turn 
them into little robots in the service of a small group of individuals 
whose only aim is to control situations and therefore influence 
events and the people responsible for fabricating these same 
events.
<P>
	In Quebec, the provincial police force is unionized, as are the 
Montreal and Quebec City municipal forces and many others. The 
RCMP, however, is not interested, thank you.
<P>
	According to rumours, the employees tried on three different 
occasions to unionize. They failed all three times.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	This completely flied in the face of the charter of rights but, in 
Bill C-30, this devious strategy is so well disguised that an official 
complaint cannot even be made under the charter claiming that the 
federal government does not want, or is trying to prevent, the 
unionization of RCMP employees.
<P>
	The parliamentary process is being used to take certain 
fundamental rights away from people. But strangely enough the 
people whose fundamental rights we are trying to take away are the 
very ones who are responsible for ensuring that the fundamental 
rights of all Canadian taxpayers are respected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3999"> 3999 </A></B>
<P>
	To recap, employees who are in a position to find out about 
abuses committed by certain people and various branches are 
considering forming a union, so a bill is tabled in order to isolate 
the only people who have access to documents that might be 
compromising.
<P>
	I am sure that, by the end of this Parliament, the Liberal Party 
will have managed to push through this bill putting the RCMP 
under the same banner as CSIS-that is, with many millions of 
dollars to spend, but without taxpayers ever knowing how the 
money is being spent, and even less who is spending it, and on 
what.
<P>
	I fully agree with the motion moved by the hon. member for 
Bellechasse, who wants to strike out certain provisions of Bill 
C-30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not very happy, nor am I in a very good mood. I 
cannot fathom that at the end of the session we are faced with a bill 
like Bill C-30. I hope you are going to do everything in your power 
to block this bill that might have found favour in the 19th century, 
but in the 20th century, when we have a charter and since we had 
agreed with the Minister of Labour-by the way, where is the 
Minister of Labour, where is the Solicitor General?-we had 
agreed on a sort of moratorium regarding labour relations with the 
minister-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would like to remind the hon. member, 
with the utmost respect, that as he is aware we cannot mention that 
a member is not in the House. It is very possible that the individual 
may have been held up by very important business elsewhere.
<P>
	I ask all members to refrain from mentioning that someone is 
absent from the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not referring to his physical 
presence, I was referring to his intellectual standpoint. After sitting 
in this House for the past three years, I am well aware that we 
cannot mention the fact that certain people are not in the House. I 
apologize if I gave the impression I might want to disobey any of 
the Standing Orders.
<P>
	What I want to make clear to those listening to us and to all the 
hon. members in this House is that it is difficult to follow the 
government in matters of labour relations. We agreed, the official 
opposition agreed that we were going to modernize the entire 
labour code in September; I am the labour critic for my party. 
When we talk about the labour code, we are talking about part I, 
which refers to unfair treatment in the workplace, part II, which 
covers workplace health and safety, and part III, which involves 
minimum standards.
<P>
	The proof of what I am saying is that until now the bills that have 
been tabled on labour relations have been minor ones. We changed 
the minimum wage to put it in line with provincial rates. By 
delegating authority, we passed control of nuclear energy over to 
the provinces.
<P>
	There was a tacit understanding with the Minister of Labour to 
the effect that, since the legislation was so important, no 
fundamental changes would be made until the committee was able 
to review the entire labour code. How come this argument was not 
applied in the case of the 16,000 RCMP officers? It would have 
been more honest for the government to have asked us to study this 
in committee.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	It would have been even more honest, given the situation, which 
is as follows. There are a total of 18,000 officers involved, and 
16,000 of those are demanding the right to negotiate. We are in a 
situation where there are a variety of tribunals, and I know the Bloc 
Quebecois critic for the Solicitor General has referred to the 
various common law tribunals. These count for something in our 
society. What is being said is that the 16,000 RCMP officers are 
entitled to collective bargaining. They ought to be considered 
employees of Treasury Board. This is something of significance, 
after all.
<P>
	I am issuing a challenge to the ministers, perhaps the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice who is currently 
in the House, to give us one of the examples he has in mind of a 
situation comparable to that of the RCMP. There is a rule that 
applies to labour relations. That rule, which has taken on the shape 
of an underlying principle, is that people are entitled to be involved 
in determining their working conditions. Not only determining 
them, but negotiating them as well, given that our society agrees 
that one of the forms of freedom of expression includes the right to 
freely negotiate a collective agreement.
<P>
	That principle, when applied in complete logic, has a corollary. 
That corollary is that an outside body ought to be the one to make 
an interpretation when there is any disloyal action within a 
workplace. RCMP officers are rightfully saying that the RCMP 
Commissioner, while no doubt an honest citizen, ends up being 
both judge and party to the action, since he is called upon to act as 
an administrator and at the same time to settle differences 
concerning overtime, patrols, mobility and employee benefits. This 
cannot help but lead to a tainted atmosphere, since it is not 
compatible with the basic principles of healthy labour relations to 
have someone be both judge and judged in the same matter.
<P>
	It is hard to follow the government. Its logic is dubious, to say 
the least. As I have already said, we had agreed with government 
not to go ahead with any major legislation on labour relations. 
Not only is it not respecting this principle, government is 
reintroducing it.
<P>
	What happened? I think the RCMP was quite clear on this. The 
former Minister of Labour, who now holds the heritage 
portfolio-though we do not really know how things will turn out 
because, as those who follow current events know, the former 
minister could become the new minister-had appointed an 
independent task force  chaired by Professor Sims, of Edmonton. 
You are signifying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4000"> 4000 </A></B>
<P>
your assent, so I gather you have followed those events with the 
same enthusiasm as I did.
<P>
	The Sims task force, including Mr. Blouin from Quebec, had 
three members at that time. They said very clearly in their report 
that RCMP staff members should have the right to collective 
bargaining and that the RCMP should be recognized as an 
employer under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Board. This is more 
than reasonable.
<P>
	Had you been in their shoes, Mr. Speaker, I wonder if you would 
have showed as much common sense. These people claim the right 
to collective bargaining, but at the same time, they recognize that 
their specific responsibilities require them to protect the public, 
investigate, provide security services-especially in embassies- 
and that they are under contract to eight provinces on the Canadian 
territory.
<P>
	These people show such civic-mindedness, a sense of 
responsibility and a will to serve their country-which, in truth, is 
made up of two countries on its territory-that they are not asking 
for the right to strike; they only claim the right to free collective 
bargaining. They are willing to submit to binding arbitration. In 
fact this is more and more the case at the municipal level.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I think you have to be really dishonest, shortsighted, obtuse like 
this government to introduce today a bill like Bill C-30 as if it were 
the most natural thing in the world, as if the past meant nothing and 
as if there were no agreement on developments in modernization of 
the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Those of us in the official opposition, one of the best you will 
ever see, have made it very clear that we will do everything to kill 
this bill, because we consider it undemocratic and because it denies 
the fundamental right of 16,000 workers in the public service-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Archaic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Archaic is the word. The member for Lévis, never 
lacking for the word thanks to his past experience, knows very well 
that this sort of situation brings no credit to Parliament.
<P>
	The RCMP union representatives, believe it or not, produced a 
special edition of the magazine <I>Action</I>, in which they proposed the 
wording of a bill. I am sorely tempted to introduce it on my own as 
a private member's bill. It would not be the first time this sort of 
thing has been done, as the member for Rosemont knows.
<P>
	Finally, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that, 
if we are not careful and if we continue to ignore the most basic 
rights of the members of the RCMP, the work atmosphere will 
continue to worsen. Nothing good will come out of a situation like 
this.
<P>
	I would like to identify five grievances, five statements of fact 
drawn to the attention of each parliamentarian, which should unite 
us in our rejection of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I will identify them by 
order of importance and will do so carefully knowing that you are 
listening attentively to what I have to say.
<P>
	What the RCMP says in its special edition is, first, that the denial 
of the freedom of association and collective bargaining rights for 
members of the RCMP is unacceptable and this is according to the 
logic we explained this morning.
<P>
	We are also saying there were acts of retaliation against RCMP 
members who dared to support and promote collective bargaining. 
It is all reminiscent of the underworld, with mobster-style bosses 
making for an intolerable job atmosphere. That happens when you 
are both judge and judged. This is the kind of unhealthy situation 
that can happen when you are unable to distinguish between 
decisions that you must take as a manager and those you make 
when adjudicating grievances or litigations.
<P>
	We also say, it is obvious and members must keep it in mind 
when they vote on Bill C-30, that the present divisional 
representation system, being completely controlled by the RCMP 
commissioner, is essentially aimed at creating an hostile 
atmosphere for collective bargaining.
<P>
	Four, there is no independent and binding system for grievance 
adjudication in matters of discipline or any other known area or 
type of violation.
<P>
	Five, Mr. Speaker, since you are reminding me that time flies, I 
will only mention the tremendous waste of public funds engulfed in 
this inefficient and unacceptable system. While I have an audience, 
I am taking the opportunity to denounce the fact that there is no 
family policy, as we were reminded a moment ago by the heartfelt 
cry of a young Canadian citizen.
<P>
	In conclusion, the fact is that, as members of Parliament, we 
must reject Bill C-30 because it does not respect the fundamental 
right to collective bargaining and to have a say in their working 
conditions that all our country's workers are entitled to, including 
members of the RCMP. I call upon all my colleagues to vote 
against Bill C-30 and to ensure that it be referred to the labour 
committee where witnesses can present the House with original 
proposals concerning the RCMP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the remarks made by the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, who as you have seen, is an expert in 
labour relations.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Of course, I am not as experienced as he is in this field. I took 
interest in the subject in order to give my views on this bill. I must 
say that the government made my task  easier. I studied this bill, 
which I cannot show you because the rules do not allow me to do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4001"> 4001 </A></B>
<P>
so. It is an eight-page bill. However, of these eight pages, only two 
contain clauses, for there are only four clauses in all.
<P>
	As the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve pointed out, it 
would have been more efficient to examine a bill of broader scope. 
A bill affecting 16,000 persons is not insignificant. This special bill 
is an attempt to impose a particular framework on those people. 
This is in line with the way the government usually works, by 
introducing piece-meal legislation, in any old way, for individual 
cases.
<P>
	Canadians must be disappointed to see their government passing 
such a bill, containing four clauses and four blank pages. This 
shows the government's lack of imagination, its lack of depth, its 
lack of thoroughness. What is surprising is that it is about RCMP 
employees, who come under the Solicitor General. The role played 
by the RCMP has always been important in Canada. So has been 
the role of their counterparts in the United States. We know the 
matter of the FBI is currently being debated in the U.S. The 
relationship between the FBI and the government is very 
controversial in the United States, as is the relationship between the 
RCMP and the Government in Canada.
<P>
	What does the government want to do? It wants to go back to an 
archaic system. I suggested the term to the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, who agreed because it describes the 
situation perfectly. The government wants to backtrack, which is 
not fitting for an advanced society belonging to the G-7 such as 
Canada. It wants to set RCMP employees apart.
<P>
	I believe we do need a special framework but, and this is the 
official opposition's position, it should be broader, more 
comprehensive and all-encompassing. Naturally, Bloc members 
look at the situation from Quebec's viewpoint.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have the Sûreté du Québec, therefore the province 
controls its own police force. It operates within a special 
framework, but employees still have the rights the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve mentioned, namely the right to 
negotiate, the right to go to arbitration, and the right to take part in 
setting their working conditions. On the eve of the 21st century, 
these things are normal.
<P>
	We would never have expected such a backward bill giving full 
authority to the commissioner. Let us look at current events. Some 
things are of great concern to me. I heard a baby crying before, I 
know he does not understand what is going on, but it brought home 
how worrisome the situation is.
<P>
	Cases in point are the RCMP investigation of the former Prime 
Minister, and the several instances of security breach regarding the 
current Prime Minister. RCMP officers are being criticized by the 
government  side. I believe they are living in a climate of insecurity 
harmful to the proper discharge of their duties. It is obvious they 
are under pressure from the top.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The government wants to subject them to different working 
conditions. I am concerned because if there is an occupation which 
needs a very comprehensive code of ethics, this is it, because 
officers deal with extremely sensitive issues.
<P>
	As regards the investigation of the former Prime Minister, for 
example, suppose that, as was the case in the United States, the 
commissioner feels obligated to respond to requests from the top; 
officers, having neither job security nor the means to know that 
there might be some abuse of powers, cannot say no for fear of 
retaliation.
<P>
	That is why I find the position of the previous members of the 
Bloc Quebecois very logical, because they are requesting that any 
part of a bill or a labour code affecting them be much more 
complete than that. Quite frankly, four clauses and four blank pages 
do not make a very credible bill when you want to improve a whole 
situation.
<P>
	I am talking to members on the other side now present in the 
House. We cannot speak of absent members, but we can talk to 
those present, who are few, like always. At least I can ask those 
who hear us to reconsider their position and declare, as we do, that 
this is insufficient, incorrect and incomplete.
<P>
	I know there will be other eloquent speakers specialized in 
labour relations who will rise on this point. I see the member for 
Mercier ready to speak and the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup who comes from a labour relations 
environment. I am sure they will want to convince members 
present that these statements are sound and sensible. As far as I am 
concerned, I thought it was important to do what the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve suggested, in order to illustrate the 
extent of our opposition to this bill which is too limited and too 
simple. So I will yield the floor to my colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am rising at the report stage on this bill which provides 
that only civilian employees of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police will now be governed by the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act, and that staff relations for police officers be governed by the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
<P>
	To start with, I have to confess that when I was informed that I 
would speak on this bill, my thoughts were that, in Quebec, the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police is not the police force with the 
most positive image. We had a few major incidents. I will simply 
remind hon. members that some RCMP officers were  accused of 
planting bombs. Others stole the list of Parti Quebecois members; a 
list on which I am proud to say I was. The Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police in the rest of Canada is also a municipal police 
force. It is a force which is more or less the equivalent of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4002"> 4002 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec Provincial Police for Quebecers, since it deals with 
everything from traffic to Criminal Code offenses.
<P>
	It seems important to me that a police force like that one should 
have room to manoeuver, enough independence to avoid a 
paternalistic system. When you look at Bill C-30 which we have 
before us today, and was C-58 in the previous session, we realize 
that it is exactly what it will bring. We will create a paternalistic 
system whereby the Commissioner of the RCMP will have almost 
life and death power over his staff. If, for example, an officer is not 
satisfied with a given situation, or with the way a case is being 
handled, and files a grievance, contrary to all the rules of staff 
relations, the adjudicator will be appointed by the commissioner. 
Therefore, we will have more or less the situation of a small shop 
union, a situation similar to what we had in the past in other areas, 
and this is not very good for staff relations.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	This is not healthy in a processing plant, for example, but it is 
even more dangerous in a police force that has to apply the law in 
Canada. This may even lead to very difficult situations where 
police officers who work in Quebec could be asked, in a critical 
situation, to behave in a manner that is not necessarily in keeping 
with the law. These officers who are living under a fear regime to a 
certain extent would find themselves facing unacceptable 
situations and would have to choose between their job and their 
loyalty to their vision of things. In this regard, the government is 
trying, with the bill, to escape a reality, to pull on us a little bill that 
completely changes the relationship with RCMP officers, which I 
find unacceptable.
<P>
	We must remember that this bill is the result of what we call the 
Gingras decision, where the courts said RCMP officers were like 
other public servants and should be covered by the legislation 
governing the public service. And the government decided that was 
not possible.
<P>
	Should there not be indeed a special regime for peace officers as 
opposed to public servants? That is possible. That is very likely the 
right solution, but not in the form the government is giving it. It 
seems the government is stretching the limits, is trying because the 
Gingras decision, which was not favourable to it, to reverse the 
position in such a way that officers will become a little dependent 
on the commissioner and RCMP authorities. I think this is wrong in 
itself.
<P>
	There are three different types of relations in the federal 
government labour relations spectre. There is the one governing the 
public service, with negotiations, which give certain results. On the 
other extreme, there is  the one the government is proposing in this 
bill, where RCMP officers will ultimately find themselves with a 
very weak negotiating power. In my opinion, this legislation, if 
passed in its present form, is only the prelude to other actions 
where workers' rights, the rights of those who work as peace 
officers will be gradually eroded.
<P>
	Instead of taking advantage of the situation as it is now doing, I 
think the federal government should take the time to analyze the 
situation, to really negotiate with the union representing RCMP 
officers within a framework modelled after other similar 
frameworks that exist elsewhere. Of course, as we saw in the past, 
issues like the police's right to strike are very dangerous and can 
lead to unacceptable civilian situations. However, there is a way to 
manage labour relations so that RCMP officers still have the power 
to negotiate beneficial agreements with the federal government 
while remaining independent and not being in the untenable 
position of being unable to defend their views.
<P>
	I think that, in the medium term, this decision benefits the 
government as much as it does RCMP officers. Because failing to 
create an acceptable climate could lead to events, to difficult 
situations, to lawsuits outside the established framework, which 
could translate into higher costs and situations that will penalize 
both the employees and the government.
<P>
	We are not against having a special framework for RCMP 
officers, but against creating a paternalistic system that will give 
the RCMP commissioner inordinate powers over relations with the 
employees he manages.
<P>
	Striking a balance is important because the police must enjoy 
sufficient freedom of action. We should heed the old horror stories 
concerning several police forces back in the 1940s, 1950s and 
1960s, when these forces were underpaid or had to work in 
unacceptable conditions so that officers were forced to moonlight. 
They were very vulnerable to bribes and that kind of thing. A police 
force ought to be able to work in conditions that keep such 
temptation at bay.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	At a time when the government is looking to cut everywhere to 
reduce operation costs to a minimum, it could be dangerous to 
create a framework where officers are not given enough leeway and 
where what powers they have and the working conditions they 
should have are being whittled away. It is not to play very fair to 
impose a framework like the one the government has in mind now, 
especially since there will not be only RCMP officers in the 
organization, but also civilian employees, and these employees will 
be subject to public service legislation.
<P>
	This kind of situation, as we saw with the Department of 
National Defence, causes impossible imbroglios and often results 
in unnecessary expenditures. There will be cases where we will see 
two categories of employees  competing within the same office. 
Difficulties will arise concerning hours on call and that sort of 
thing. The model developed for the Royal Canadian Mounted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4003"> 4003 </A></B>
<P>
Police officers, constables and so on must be compatible with the 
existing model in civilian life.
<P>
	If we want both models to be compatible, then the model they 
are being offered must allow for real negotiations, where 
comparisons can be made between what they are offered and what 
other employees are being offered and where, in the end, a decision 
can be made that will foster sound labour relations for years to 
come. What we are doing today-and it is somewhat surprising 
that it all fits in a bill barely two pages long, containing just four 
clauses-is completely changing employee-employer relations in 
this police force. This is not a very serious approach.
<P>
	If we really want this police force, which is the most prominent 
one across Canada and which deals with extremely diversified 
matters-for example, outside Quebec, it deals with everything 
from traffic offences to criminal offences of all kinds, while in 
Quebec and Ontario, the provincial police takes care of some of 
that.
<P>
	I think that dealing with the whole issue of setting precedents in 
a bill merely four clauses long will create a climate of 
confrontation for RCMP officers, their representatives and 
management, which may well be to the government's 
disadvantage, because, in these circumstances, the officers, when 
the time comes to define their-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. member's time 
has expired. The hon. member for Mercier now has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will pick 
up where my colleague had to leave off abruptly. This Bill C-30, 
with its four short sections, simply blocks, voids and erases the 
effects of the court decision in the Gingras case. This bill will anger 
all police officers and all members of the RCMP.
<P>
	If I had been told a few years ago that one day I would stand up 
in the House and support the RCMP, I would have smiled, to say 
the least. But in this case, the members opposite ant the public 
absolutely have to understand that this police force and many of its 
members have long sought unionization. But they are mistreated by 
this bill which negates the result of their action; after all, if a ruling 
was handed down, it was because there had been complaints, and 
the case went to court because everything else had been tried first 
without success.
<P>
	The bilingual bonus was the focus of the court decision.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	But the decision in <I>Gingras</I> was far from limited to the bilingual 
bonus, because to rule on eligibility for the  bonus, the court had to 
determine the status of the employees. The legislation was such 
that, as the library research service has indicated, the only 
employer of the RCMP would appear to be the Queen. However, 
there is no direct link between the Queen and the Commissioner.
<P>
	The judge wanted to determine the status of RCMP personnel. In 
doing so, he ruled that they were members of the public service and 
that they could be governed by part II of the Canada Labour Code 
dealing with occupational safety and health, and that they were 
eligible to receive the bilingual bonus, something which is not clear 
in any act, as long as it was also granted to others. In fact, the 
government complied with the ruling and started paying the 
bilingual bonus to RCMP personnel. Eventually, RCMP personnel 
might even have gained the right to become unionized.
<P>
	For sometime, 16,000 RCMP personnel, 18,000 counting 
civilian employees, thought that they were public servants within 
the meaning of the act, and that they were governed by the Canada 
Labour Code. But what does the bill do? It abruptly eliminates the 
beginning of such recognition, the ability to have some rights 
recognized.
<P>
	My colleague was absolutely right when he concluded by saying 
this was not good-to say the least-for staff relations. I think it is 
extremely bad.
<P>
	When a group-not necessarily everyone-which is often the 
most conscientious, the most professional and the most vocal one, 
wants to have a say regarding staff relations, wants to get fair 
conditions and wants to put an end to paternalism and arbitrary 
decisions-that is basically what unionization is about-, the 
government is bound to create a great deal of discontent if it resorts 
to its supreme power, the power to introduce legislation, to take 
away, with just four small clauses, what these workers thought they 
had finally won after years of efforts.
<P>
	It is not good to have people in a position of power such as 
RCMP officers feel they are treated in a very unfair and arbitrary 
manner. Their status will almost be like that of the military. It is 
generally understood-I am not an expert in this field-that, in the 
army, the commanding officer is the authority. This is 
understandable, given the structure and the role of the army.
<P>
	However, police officers must make decisions during the course 
of their work. They must take part in the organization of their 
activities. They have a right to be protected by the occupational 
safety and health regulations. They are professionals who want a 
degree of responsibility. They are law enforcement officers and 
they must comply with the notion of authority, but they also wish to 
negotiate their conditions of work with the authority appointed by 
the government.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	With regard to the bilingualism bonus, which concerns mostly 
francophones in Quebec and Ontario, it is particularly sad that the 
government is using this bill to remove the legal bond that had been 
acquired to obtain it. We can also understand-we know this is true 
for military life-that for francophones, life in the RCMP has not 
always been easy. Contrary to other public servants, they are not 
entitled to this bonus they have been claiming for a long time. 
Moreover, thousands of those who are claiming it are now 
retired. We can then understand the tremendous frustration this 
bill generates.
<P>
	I cannot help but totally agree with the recommendation made 
earlier by the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, our 
critic for labour relations, who said that the government should not 
proceed negatively and try to restore a statu quo ante that cannot 
exist any more. Indeed, once a court, setting up a legal precedent 
with a well-founded decision, has come to the conclusions arrived 
at in the Gingras ruling, it cannot be just wiped out in four 
paragraphs. This is impossible.
<P>
	There is nothing in this bill that says what actual conditions will 
apply. There is nothing either that says how the workers will be 
covered with regard to occupational safety and health. This is 
intolerable. This creates conditions that either feed the anger that is 
latent or is starting to emerge, or it generates something that is 
never desirable either in a private business or in a public 
organization, a feeling of discouragement or rejection. Many are 
coming to think: ``If they give us no more consideration than that, 
we will act the way they consider us''.
<P>
	In the area of labour relations-and it is like this also in many 
areas of life-people behave according to the way they are treated. 
Thus, it is highly unacceptable for an organization as important as 
the RCMP to treat its members like irresponsible children, because 
that is what it amounts to.
<P>
	Therefore, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, will continue to plead for 
the RCMP to have the means to be a more open police force, more 
responsible for its operations and also more transparent toward 
members of Parliament and the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in this debate on Bill C-30, an Act to amend the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Act.
<P>
	As you know, I was active for 19 years in the labour movement 
in Quebec, and more particularly in the FTQ. Before that, I was a 
labour relations lawyer in Chile. So this is a subject matter in which 
I have some proficiency.
<P>
	The right to organize and to bargain collectively has been 
considered important for a long time, and it is recognized in all 
democratic countries, by the International Labour Organization, 
and ratified by most  countries. This right does not exclude public 
servants or other public employees. These employees are also 
covered by the international conventions of the ILO, and more 
particularly by conventions on the right to unionize and the right of 
collective bargaining.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	All workers in the private sector, in public corporations or in the 
public sector enjoy this important right. They can organize and 
negotiate with their employer. In this case, the employer is the 
government. We should not discriminate against this group of 
workers, the members of the RCMP, because they are part of a law 
enforcement organization. They are unionized members just like 
all other public servants. They should also be able to negotiate with 
their employer, which is the government. I see no reason why they 
should not have the collective bargaining right which is provided 
for in the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	I am against the militarization of police forces. I think the 
members of police forces have rights that must be recognized, 
including the collective bargaining right. It helps to create a better 
and healthier work environment, particularly between the 
employees and their boss. When working conditions are set 
unilaterally by the employer, the employees are, of course, annoyed 
and dissatisfied. However, working conditions resulting from free 
negotiations between the employees and the employer will 
naturally have a positive impact on the job atmosphere.
<P>
	This is why I rigorously object to this bill. I am also against this 
bill because it excludes this group of public servants, i.e. RCMP 
officers, from the occupational safety and health provisions, which 
apply equally to all employees and workers. I do not see any reason 
why this group of employees should also be excluded from 
provisions which protect the rest of the workers.
<P>
	Also, I do not see any valid reason why this group of public 
servants, employees or workers should not be entitled to the 
bilingual bonus. This bonus was introduced for all public servants. 
These people belong to the public service. They should be entitled 
to this benefit, which is important because they have to work in 
English, in French and even sometimes in another language, given 
the increasing number of immigrants who speak other languages, 
like Spanish or Italian. I was very glad to meet with officers of the 
RCMP who could speak Spanish, my mother tongue. These people 
should be entitled to the bilingual bonus if they are bilingual, that is 
if they speak both French and English.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I am against Bill C-30 and, of course, I 
support the proposals put forward earlier by my colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address my remarks, in a fairly brief fashion, to some 
of the issues before the House today with respect to the motions 
that have been put forward by the member for Bellechasse 
concerning Bill C-30, an act to amend the Public Services Staff 
Relations Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	With respect to the motions proposed to amend Bill C-30, they 
seek to do so by deleting three clauses. Each of Bill C-30's four 
clauses are intended to achieve a specific but interdependent 
legislative purpose. For that reason none of the individual clauses 
can be read in isolation from and without reference to the others.
<P>
	Similarly, changes in one clause are impossible to make without 
serious consequences for the rest of the bill. The impact of any one 
of the hon. member's motions if carried would be more legal 
confusion or uncertainty caused by the conflicting references or 
gaps in the Public Service Staff Relations Act, the RCMP Act or 
the Financial Administration Act.
<P>
	For example, clause 1 cannot be deleted as proposed by the hon. 
member's first motion. Doing so would leave conflicting 
references to the RCMP in the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
Similarly, doing away with clause 2 of Bill C-30, which is the 
proposal put forward by the hon. member's second motion, would 
leave conflicting references to the RCMP under part I of schedule I 
of the same act.
<P>
	Conversely, by deleting the third clause of Bill C-30 as proposed 
by the hon. member's third motion, there would be no reference to 
the PSSR Act or to the RCMP. If carried, this motion would leave 
the legal status of all RCMP employees open to question and 
without legislative basis under federal statute. I am certain the hon. 
member would not wish to create this type of uncertainty.
<P>
	The House has examined the first three motions put forward by 
the hon. member for Bellechasse. I believe the government has 
clearly shown why these motions are simply not acceptable.
<P>
	In all legislation brought forward by the government, it is 
brought forward after due consideration of how modifications to 
the legislation are consistent internally within the act for which 
they are presented and also consistent with provisions in other 
statutes put forward by the government. On a number of occasions, 
when amendments are brought forward and with respect to all hon. 
members who bring forward very discrete and distinct amendments 
to statutes brought forward by the government, often the 
interrelationship of how these proposed amendments would affect 
the total bill or how  they would interact with provisions in other 
pieces of government legislation are overlooked. That is the case in 
respect of the motions which have been brought forward.
<P>
	A number of issues have been raised by hon. members in 
discussing this bill. First, the implication was made that somehow 
this piece of legislation interferes with collective bargaining. That 
is simply not the case. I will quote from a speech by the hon. 
solicitor general where he outlines exactly the relationship between 
the changes that are being proposed in this bill which are merely 
technical in nature and which merely seek to clarify ambiguities 
created by a tribunal or court decision in relation to collective 
bargaining.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Another issue I would like to comment on concerns collective bargaining. It has 
been suggested that Bill C-58 was drafted to prevent unionization within the force. 
However RCMP members have never had the legal authority to enter into collective 
bargaining and Bill C-58 does not change that. Collective bargaining is a completely 
separate issue from Bill C-58 and would have to be dealt with by the government and 
Parliament as a separate legislative matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have been advised that collective bargaining is not a natural or inherent right but 
a right granted by Parliament only. Collective bargaining rights have never been 
extended to the RCMP members under either the Canada Labour Code, the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act or the RCMP Act. The Federal Court of Appeals decision 
in the Gingras case has done nothing to alter this fact.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would like to observe in passing that the only issue dealt with by the court in the 
Gingras case was whether RCMP members were entitled to be paid the bilingualism 
bonus. The plaintiff raised no other issue and the court's ruling did not go beyond it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I want to indicate that where qualified, individuals in the RCMP 
within positions that are designated bilingual are and always will 
be allowed to avail themselves of this bonus as long as the bonus 
exists.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since May 1974, the RCMP has had its own system for addressing 
labour-management issues and which since 1989 has been provided for in 
regulations made pursuant to the RCMP Act. This is the RCMP division staff 
relations representative program, the DSRRs for short.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The program is an internal staff relations program intended to provide a 
communications network whereby members at all levels can voice their views 
and concerns through elected member representatives. The members of each 
division across the country elect at least one full time representative and two 
part time representatives. For example, ``E'' Division in British Columbia has 
six full time representatives and 31 part time representatives, all elected by the 
members of the division. These divisional representatives have direct access to 
all levels of management including the commissioner and the solicitor general.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The DSRRs also serve on 11 national committees that deal with issues such as 
pay, travel and relocation, and health and safety to name but a few. Consultation 
between management and these committees is ongoing. In addition, conferences 
involving  the commissioner, deputy commissioners, all commanding officers 
and the DSRRs are held twice a year with the DSRRs setting the agenda.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4006"> 4006 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is also the RCMP external review committee which provides neutral 
third party review of certain types of grievances, formal disciplinary and 
discharge and demotion appeals referred to it from the RCMP.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Furthermore, Bill C-58 does not create a separate employer status for the 
RCMP. This requires separate and specific legislation. However a consultative 
process is currently under way in the force involving the DSRRs, which is 
examining the advisability of moving toward such status.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I should also confirm that Bill C-58 gives no additional power or authority to 
the commissioner. The bill simply confirms the status quo regarding the force 
that existed before the Gingras decision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Again and to conclude, the purpose of Bill C-58 is to remove ambiguities 
raised by the Gingras decision and to confirm that the primary legislative 
authority governing the operation and management of the RCMP is the RCMP 
Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I have indicated, the changes that are being brought forward 
by the government are merely technical in nature. They serve to 
remove any ambiguity created by the court decision as to how the 
management of the RCMP resolves that in favour of the status quo. 
As has been indicated, these are only technical changes. There have 
not been major changes or anything that would in any manner 
change substantively the governance of the RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	With the greatest of respect to those who have put forward 
different points of view and to those who have put forward the 
points of view that there have been major changes, I wish to inform 
the hon. members I am certain it is simply a matter of error on their 
part. Major changes have not been made. To assure this House, if 
major changes were ever to be undertaken, it would be a 
significantly larger process than has been dealt with in this case 
where merely technical changes are required.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 5</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-30, in Clause 4, be amended by replacing line 4, on page 2, with the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``47.6(1) For greater certainty, with the exception of Part II, the Canada''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, in his speech on the first group of 
motions, the parliamentary secretary said that they were only 
minor changes on which the opposition needs not ask so many 
questions.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We always thought the opposite, and the government's approach 
had been to say that they were in fact only technical changes. The 
bill was referred to the committee on government operations when 
it should at least have been sent to the justice committee or the 
human resources development committee, considering the radical 
and major changes it brings to the overall working conditions of 
RCMP officers and to their relations with their superiors.
<P>
	This not an innocuous bill. We were told that it deals only with 
the payment of the bilingualism bonus to RCMP officers, but then 
one has to see on what legal grounds the decision was based. That 
is one of the biggest flaws in the reasoning of the parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	A few moments ago I said that the Gingras decision was a trial 
decision of the Federal Court, but, in fact, it was an appeal decision 
of that court. The Appeal Division of the Federal Court ordered the 
payment of the bilingualism bonus to RCMP officers only because 
it could rely on a legal analysis saying that those officers have the 
same status as public servants. But if the officers are part of the 
public service, that means that they are covered by all applicable 
rules that stem from Treasury Board decisions and legislation 
applicable to the public service, including the bilingualism bonus 
policy.
<P>
	The Appeal Division of the Federal Court did not decide on its 
own that they were entitled to the bonus, it had to make a legal 
analysis of the situation. So, the whole question should not be 
downplayed.
<P>
	In clause 4, and this is quite revealing, there is a derogation or 
interpretive clause that has a clearly retroactive effect. The clause 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) For greater certainty, the <I>Canada Labour Code</I> does not apply to 
members, and members are not part of the Public Service within the meaning of 
the <I>Public Service Staff Relations Act</I>, nor part of the public service within the 
meaning of section 11 of the <I>Financial Administration Act</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of Bill C-30 is quite obvious. If the government 
wished to keep this position, all it had to do was go before the 
Supreme Court and plead its case. In this country, we do not 
legislate retroactively except in very rare cases and for good 
reason. It is a way of legislating, referred to as <I>nunc pro tunc</I> in 
latin, by which the government is trying to ensure retroactively that 
if the officers were to go back to court and if Bill C-30 perchance 
were passed, they would be told that the law has been changed and 
that their rights can no longer be recognized.
<P>
	Canadian courts do not need clause 4 in Bill C-30. It is up to 
them to determine what the state of the law is pursuant to the 
general provisions applying to every citizen. One clause, clause 4, 
is written only for RCMP officers. This clause does not apply to 
everybody. It applies only to one class of citizens. The government 
takes their measurements, the size of their coat, pants, shoes, and 
hat if they need one, and says that these people, RCMP officers, are 
not covered by the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	As my colleague for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup mentioned 
a few moments ago, as did my colleague for Mercier, labour 
relations are a serious problem in the RCMP. There is an unhealthy 
climate, and a constitutional state such as ours cannot tolerate that 
labour relations be subject to the pleasure by the prince, in this case 
the commissioner of the RCMP, who dictates working conditions 
and refuses to share his supervisory powers with the country's 
regulatory agencies. We believe there should be a system, which 
could be unique to the RCMP, that would give members of this 
force the right to free collective bargaining.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Such free collective bargaining does not exist. Of course, there 
are divisional representatives who do their best but, as I was saying 
in my remarks on the first group of motions, the climate is such that 
the basic trust that should normally exist between management and 
employees is just not there. There will be a need for an outside 
agency to come it and help settle the disputes and legitimate 
grievances that may arise.
<P>
	The myth that the RCMP exists outside our society must be 
destroyed. RCMP members are first-class citizens who have the 
right, like everybody else, to have their grievances heard by courts 
that are not prejudiced against them. When you look at the existing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4008"> 4008 </A></B>
<P>
grievance  adjudication process, the adjudicators can only make 
recommendations. They cannot make binding decisions.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier the case of Staff Sergeant Gaétan Delisle, 
mayor of Saint-Blaise, who was reprimanded and who basically 
received a notice of discharge because he was a candidate in an 
election. That shows how serious the problem is. No other police 
force in Canada could have done this. Members of the RCMP are 
no different from members of the Sûreté du Québec, members of 
the OPP and members of most municipal police forces. Their right 
to free collective bargaining must be recognized.
<P>
	The Gingras decision does not say explicitly that members of the 
RCMP can be unionized under Part I of the Canada Labour Code, 
but it opens the door. So let us allow the legal debate to take its 
course. Given that RCMP officers are considered members of the 
public service, does Part I of the Canada Labour Code apply to 
them? If so, they can be unionized under the Code. If, after this is 
done, it becomes apparent that it is not the appropriate regime for 
their collective bargaining framework, there will still be time to 
legislate a different framework, which could resemble what has 
been done in the case of the Sûreté du Québec.
<P>
	The vast majority of RCMP officers are not claiming the right to 
strike. We could therefore consider a binding arbitration, or final 
offer, mechanism, as was often mentioned. In this sense, I support 
the motion to delete clause 4. The motion presented by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Calgary Northeast, is nonetheless a 
lesser evil, in the sense that if we had to include the right of police 
officers to unionize by leaving clause 47.6 in Bill C-30, the 
recognition that Part II of the Canada Labour Code, as it relates to 
health and safety at work, applies, would at least be a consolation 
prize.
<P>
	I am therefore in favour of the motion by my colleague, the 
member for Calgary Northeast, but only for these reasons. I believe 
that the deletion of clause 47.6 basically resolves the entire issue 
and that the right to collective bargaining under the Canada Labour 
Code is the same everywhere in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
reference to the motions in group 2, in order for Reform Party 
members to support Bill C-30 fully, we seek a substantive 
amendment which would ensure continued statutory protection of 
RCMP officers under the Canada Labour Code. I do not believe the 
motion by the member for Bellechasse really satisfies our concern.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 which states that Bill C-30 be amended by deleting 
clause 4, cannot be support by members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Motion No. 5 asks that Bill C-30 be amended by adding directly 
following ``for greater certainty'', the words ``with the exception of 
part II'', which refers to the Canada Labour Code. Bill C-30 was 
originally  introduced as a housekeeping bill, but it became evident 
that the effect of this legislation could have serious implications on 
the rights of RCMP members.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Some concern exists that Bill C-30 in its present form would 
completely eliminate the application of the labour code to RCMP 
members. At present the RCMP has the protection of part II of the 
code concerning health and safety. There is no valid reason to 
justify the exclusion of the RCMP from the health and safety 
regulations listed in part II of the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	This amendment, if adopted, would maintain the health and 
safety protection of the Canada Labour Code for RCMP personnel. 
It would still exempt the RCMP from the Canada Labour Code 
overall, with the exception of part II, and it deals strictly with 
health and safety. Those are my comments in reference to Motion 
No. 5.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe it is very important to speak on this group of 
motions because the bill before us was introduced following a court 
ruling called the Gingras ruling, which has completely changed 
labour relations for employees of the RCMP.
<P>
	The government showed very little planning in its response. The 
bill it introduced sets a very paternalistic framework for the RCMP 
officers. I believe this legislation is the best proof of it. If this bill is 
passed in its present form, the officers of the RCMP will find 
themselves excluded form the protection of the Canada Labour 
Code in the areas of occupational health and safety. This is 
astonishing proof of improvisation on the part of the government.
<P>
	We all know very well that occupational health and safety is a 
very important issue in the work of police officers. They undergo 
considerable stress that can have serious physical and 
psychological effects. Police officers often have to go through 
stressful situations and have to deal with difficult human cases. 
This group of our society shows a very high suicide rate, family 
problems and all kinds of situations due to difficult working 
conditions.
<P>
	Because this government is excluding them from the protection 
of the clauses on occupational health and safety in the Canada 
Labour Code, the RCMP officers will be somewhat powerless in 
terms of their rights to occupational health and safety. Yet, this 
group of workers is more exposed than others to work accidents 
and we are not talking here about small accidents but situations 
which can be very difficult, complex and have very serious human 
impacts.
<P>
	We should not be holding this debate again today and this is why 
we believe the House should support this motion because we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4009"> 4009 </A></B>
<P>
stressed the fact in the previous  groups of motions-and I believe 
we proved our point-that this government is improvising and that 
this bill will give the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police powers which really are greater than those an 
employer should have, in a police force.
<P>
	This motion is an example of the exclusion of RCMP officers 
from a significant area of particular concern to them, perhaps more 
than other categories of personnel, because of the impact of 
work-related accidents and health problems that may be 
experienced, due to the nature of their work.
<P>
	Another example concerning police officers. They may develop 
back trouble, for example, because of ergonomic problems, and 
these are not recovered from quickly. Sometimes we have a bit of a 
tendency to scoff at such things, but for the person in that situation 
it is no joke. Police officers, particularly those in patrol cars, have 
about the same situation as people who drive for a living. The long 
hours they spend in a car requires ergonomic studies, processes to 
ensure that recurring problems are eradicated, for instance all the 
back problems these people are liable to develop. It would be 
important to ensure that, should they be dissatisfied with how 
things are being managed by the RCMP, they would have access to 
the appeal process and to adequate protection.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	There are other safety elements. Police officers carry fire arms, 
and often have to deal with criminals and with illicit substances. 
There are many aspects of their work that involve safety, and it 
seems to me to be inappropriate that their labour relations regime 
can be modified with a bill containing only four clauses.
<P>
	It has been decided that, in future, they would no longer be 
protected by the rules that apply to the public service as a whole. 
There has been a decision by a judge that they are to be considered 
members of the public service, but this decision has been modified 
considerably because the government does not accept it, and is 
taking advantage of the opportunity to deprive officers of proper 
protection. What should have been proposed is a model reflecting 
the needs of these peace officers. But, no. The decision was made 
to simply include them in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, 
without any sort of protection.
<P>
	It is a bit like taking people back to the beginning of the 20th 
century and forcing them to start a whole series of fights for 
working conditions all over again. Both employees and employers 
can be the losers in such fights. If occupational health and safety 
were not regulated for the public sector across Canada, we would 
find ourselves in legal proceedings.
<P>
	Peace officers will perhaps be obliged to follow the traditional 
legal route, which takes a lot of time and creates a lot more 
frustration but produces essentially the  same results in the end. 
Why would the government not listen to these proposals?
<P>
	If the government does not want the framework governing the 
working conditions of the RCMP to be well thought out, it should 
at least give RCMP officers appropriate protection in matters of 
occupational health and safety to permit them to do their work in 
acceptable conditions and to give them recourse when difficult 
situations arise.
<P>
	An officer of the RCMP in Quebec is involved primarily in the 
fight against drugs or similar matters. Elsewhere in Canada, 
officers also do patrol work. From personal experience, I know that 
the people in this area need special support to remain in good 
physical condition and to meet the demands of their work. In many 
instances, before there were relevant regulations, difficult 
situations arose.
<P>
	People had to take legal proceedings, which they sometimes won 
and sometimes lost. It is not just in the interest of the officers 
concerned to have this problem properly resolved, it is in the 
employer's interest too.
<P>
	These amendments relating to occupational health and safety, in 
a way, send the government a message that it did its job in a 
makeshift manner, that it should have provided a labour relations 
framework which would have allowed negotiation of acceptable 
work conditions. However, this is not the position the government 
opted for. Today, we are faced with this situation.
<P>
	I would not be surprised if, one or two years from now, this 
framework needed to be changed, if a new proposal was introduced 
in the House to give back to the RCMP employees an acceptable 
labour framework. Occupational health and safety is an area where 
paternalism can be particularly pernicous.
<P>
	In the field of occupational health and safety, there is a basic 
principle according to which the best way to address a health and 
safety problem is to eliminate it at the source. Very often, 
employers tend to seek solutions for the problem once it already 
exists. The best example is noise. The first thing that was done was 
to force the workers to wear ear plugs in order to reduce the decibel 
level. In the medium term, having a broader vision, it was realized 
that what needed to be addressed was the source of the noise.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	In the absence of a proper framework to address this kind of 
problem, the employer is often going to close his eyes to cases 
reported reported to him, and the peace officer concerned will not 
have the appropriate means of redress. Then, we will be faced with 
more and more regular referrals to health professionals, more and 
more regular use of existing legal processes, because when the 
labour framework does not provide employees with the proper 
means of redress, they tend to seek justice through other avenues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4010"> 4010 </A></B>
<P>
	As an employer, the government would be better off if it took 
the time to change the bill we have before us, to flesh it out so 
as to ensure that employees can be satisfied with their work 
conditions, feel more secure and do their jobs properly. The 
framework for negotiations will allow employees to change 
regularly their working conditions without necessarily having the 
Sword of Damoclès over their heads in the person of the 
commissioner, who could say: ``With the authority given me, I can 
take action if you make too many demands''.
<P>
	I hope the House, or in fact the Liberals, will accept to act on 
these amendments concerning occupational health and safety in 
order to give RCMP officers adequate working conditions and also 
to avoid numerous legal proceedings for employers, which would 
create significant costs and spoil the job atmosphere for police 
officers. If this were the case, it is mostly the client, the citizen that 
pays the price of such internal conflicts and, therefore, the 
government would not be carrying out its mandate to serve the 
population adequately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what a pleasure to speak to you again aboutthis new group 
of motions.
<P>
	I do not know if the government is finally going to agree with the 
official opposition that the situation we are in is of great concern, 
as the member for Kamouraska-Rivière du Loup said. We cannot 
behave as if the charter of rights did not exist. What is the use of 
having a government constantly reminding us about principles? 
How often have ministers risen in the House, the Prime Minister 
first and foremost?
<P>
	How can we forget the Prime Minister's cries straight from the 
heart, sincere cries no doubt, telling us that we live in the greatest 
country on earth, a country based on freedom and democracy?
<P>
	How, then, can this be compatible with the bill before us today 
and the way the government is going to treat these workers, these 
honest citizens, who have a particular mission to carry out in our 
society as police officers and rehabilitation workers, and who have 
to face situations that are sometimes critical or extremely thorny?
<P>
	The truth is, and we must repeat it for the benefit of our listeners 
who have just tuned in, that in spite of decisions rendered by 
various courts of law and supreme courts, this heartless, stubborn 
government that is not listening, this doomsday government, which 
is coming to the end of the session and is akin to a government at 
the end of its mandate, is ignoring the most basic principles of 
demacracy.
<P>
	Let me review the facts. If the government implements this 
measure, 16,000 persons will be denied a very fundamental right, 
one which is the basis of democracy, that is the right to participate 
in the definition of their own working conditions. It is also the right 
to be judged,  in the event of a dispute, a conflict or unfair 
practices, by a third party who is neither judge nor party, as is the 
case for all public servants.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Why such an obstinate attitude? What is going on in the heads of 
the government members? What can the leaders of this government 
be thinking of to violate a moratorium whereby we were to 
examine the Canada Labour Code in September, just a few weeks 
from now, in accordance with the Sims report. You will recall that 
the former labour minister, who is now Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, had created a task force presided by Mr. Sims, a specialist 
in labour relations in western Canada, who, with the help of an 
industrial relations specialist, Mr. Blouin from Université Laval, 
and other members, decided to make some very specific 
recommendations to the government suggesting that the Canada 
Labour Code be updated, since no thorough review of that code had 
been done since 1972.
<P>
	We had agreed that a parliamentary committee would hear 
witnesses who would speak about the review, the modernisation of 
the Canada Labour Code, and tell us how to proceed to update the 
first part pertaining to unfair labour practices, the second part on 
the OHSC or more precisely occupational safety, and the third part 
listing the minimum standards that are so important for all workers 
across the country who do not have a collective agreement.
<P>
	We could have, in a very democratic and enlightened way, 
benefited from the debate the Minister of Labour, and member for 
Saint-Léonard, was hoping for. Instead, we are now in a very 
upsetting situation. You know that as the official opposition, we 
have a basic mandate to carry out. We must work to improve the 
government, to make it more and more efficient, to bring about a 
more enlightened government when dealing with the issues it 
brings up.
<P>
	I do not need to tell you that with the government we have at the 
present time it is a full time job and, to be frank, we do not see the 
light at the end of the tunnel. There is no predictable way out for us 
in a foreseeable future. We do not see any way to improve this 
government, to improve its practices.
<P>
	How can you expect any form of co-operation in this House, a 
co-operation which goes through you, Mr. Speaker, when the 
government remains as stubborn as it has been. Those who are 
watching us today, those who would like to understand what is 
going on in the Parliament of Canada, how are they going to react 
when they learn that there has been a decision, the Gingras 
decision, which said that the RCMP, the 16,000 employees-in fact 
18,000-are part of the public service? But you know that the 
government is so-I do not know if you are going to let me say 
that-astute, although it is not what it really is, you know very well 
that it is not the word astute that I should be using, but  devious, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4011"> 4011 </A></B>
<P>
even dishonest; the government is so crafty that it is creating two 
categories of workers within the RCMP.
<P>
	It allows 2,000 civilian employees to have access to collective 
bargaining. But it tells the 16,000 others that they do not. This is 
the extremely harmful, perfidious, age old theory of dividing to 
conquer.
<P>
	Let us recall what is happening and watch as government 
members blush. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Labour, who is with us today, will listen to what I am saying, 
because if this man has some conscience, if there is moral fibre in 
the government members, they must know they are going against 
decisions that were made by the courts.
<P>
	The decision was clear and simple. How can government 
members support a bill that goes against the courts? That is what 
we are talking about today. We say, and we will repeat it again and 
again, and we will try, as opposition members, until we get a very 
concrete result, to have RCMP members obtain the fundamental 
right, the right that is enshrined at the very core of our freedoms of 
functioning, of our democratic freedoms here in Canada and in 
Quebec, the right to freely negotiate their working conditions.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, have you ever thought-I am sure you did, because 
I know you have an alert mind-about the number of hours we 
spend in the workplace? Sometimes, it seems quite unbelievable, 
but I must say it is because we spend many hours in the workplace. 
It is because we are far from having reached the leisure society the 
generation of the member for Rosemont had promised us that we 
must have interesting working conditions in a work environment, 
so that things go smoothly, so that workers are motivated. That 
certainly means something in a work environment, in a public body 
such as the RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Motivation is not without significance. We are convinced that 
motivation requires the right to negotiate freely, with full 
knowledge of the facts, as well as the right to be represented by a 
bargaining agent to determine working conditions.
<P>
	We would have understood to a certain extent if a government 
member had risen to tell the opposition: ``Yes, but you know that, 
for those who have a mission as specific as that of RCMP 
members, the right to strike must be examined very closely''. But 
this is not the issue. RCMP members, or the 16,000 workers 
concerned, are so reasonable-and they even have their own draft 
bill-that they are saying to the government and to the official 
opposition: ``We do not want the right to strike as our last resort. 
We want what several municipalities have implemented''.
<P>
	Members will recall that several police forces have exercised the 
right to bargain freely, and today we, as parliamentarians, are being 
asked to do something so  reasonable that we cannot understand the 
government's refusal to see the facts. They are asking not only for 
the right to bargain freely, but also for binding arbitration. The 
word ``binding'' does have a legal meaning. It means that the 
parties are bound and must agree to allow a mediator to make a 
decision. This is the real issue.
<P>
	We are not very proud of what is happening. We are witnessing 
the actions of a very petty government. And that is an 
understatement. These people have chosen to turn a deaf ear and 
they are about to shamelessly betray a principle which is central to 
the very functioning of our society. Canadians will not forget and 
their verdict will be pitiless because they will mobilize. We will 
help them. They will come to Parliament Hill. They will appear 
before parliamentary committees.
<P>
	You know-and I will conclude because my time is running 
out-that the best way to oppose an idea in democracy is to 
propose a better one, but not to come to us with a skimpy piece of 
legislation that has only four clauses. This measure is so skimpy it 
is laughable. I do hope that the government will have second 
thoughts about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve pointed out something 
important, because this really something lean and mean. This is a 
small bill. I am repeating myself, but this has to be repeated 
because it cannot be shown on television. It is incredible: the first 
page has three clauses and the second, only one, which is the most 
important. The rest is made of blank pages. This government talks 
about saving everywhere, but the saving was not well-founded in 
this case. I am in favour of saving in Parliament, but such a glaring 
saving of ideas is too much. We were not asking for that much 
saving when dealing with an extremely important subject.
<P>
	What does clause 4 say, since it is the most important one? It 
says: ``For greater certainty, the Canada Labour Code does not 
apply to members, and members are not part of the Public Service 
within the meaning of the Public Service Staff Relations Act, nor 
part of the public service within the meaning of section 11 of the 
Financial Administration Act.'' This means that the 16,000 people 
working for the RCMP are not covered by the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
	To replace that, the government brings forward this small, lean 
and mean bill comprised of four clauses. The hon. member for 
Calgary Northeast is right about the great probability that the 
government will get this small bill passed. There is a major 
omission: occupational health and safety. This is important for 
everybody, including the members of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police. As it is, there is no indication that these people will be 
protected in the future since it is made very clear that they are not 
covered by the Canada Labour Code. They are governed by what? 
This legislation only. Sometimes, people in Quebec say that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4012"> 4012 </A></B>
<P>
collective  agreements are too long, but this is not a collective 
agreement, it is a piece of legislation that is extraordinarily simple.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Any schoolchild in third grade who knows how to read can 
understand that. I am not an expert or a lawyer, but I can realize the 
bill says people in the RCMP are excluded. It does not say, though, 
what they will get to compensate. We are confronted with a 
legislative vacuum-maybe not a legal vacuum, because there are 
other statutes-but there is room for interpretation.
<P>
	A more serious problem is the enormous power being given to 
the commissioner over his 16,000 employees. This will be almost 
unprecedented in Canada. He will have this power not only over 
trivial matters, but over very important ones too, as important as 
the RCMP investigation on the conduct of the former Prime 
Minister of Canada. That is quite something. This fact is 
recognized, but at the same time, Bill C-30 would set the 
operational context.
<P>
	I do not know what judges or commissioners will be able to do 
when arbitration time comes, but the power of the RCMP 
commissioner is enormous. That is why I tend to agree with the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve when he says that after 
less than three years in its first mandate, this government is already 
spent and bankrupt.
<P>
	Since the beginning of June, Liberal members are silent. If it 
were not for the official opposition members, I think it would be 
rather boring, because very few Liberals, who are the ones 
introducing the bills, present arguments in favour of their bills. 
What are we to understand? Are they so eager to go on vacation 
that they simply want to close this place down? Is that it? Then, 
listeners could well wonder what members are paid for. They may 
not be overpaid, but they are paid to represent their constituents in 
the House of Commons. What do they do? They introduce bills, say 
a few words and then leave.
<P>
	Opposition members move motions and amendments, as we 
have just seen, but not one Liberal member rises to speak. Where 
are they? Are they out playing golf? Have they gone fishing? 
Where are they? We have been here since this morning and, of 
course, we cannot speak about the members who are absent, but the 
least we can say is that they are not exactly present. However, the 
few members who are here could at least take the floor! They keep 
silent. These last few months, they have honoured a code of 
silence. This Bill C-30 could be known at the code of silence 
legislation, because it is so thin. The Liberal members have 
stopped speaking in the House of Commons.
<P>
	What is going on? I think we have here a rather serious political 
problem. A number of hon. members have expressed their 
opposition to the bill allowing  Newfoundland to change its 
education system and the Prime Minister said that there would be a 
free vote. Thank God for the hon. members of the opposition. I 
wonder if the bill would have passed without their support.
<P>
	I do not want to be impertinent, but I have noticed a connection 
between the series of bills recently before the House and the 
behaviour of the Liberal members, which have more than one 
person worried. I find it strange that the media have not picked up 
on this. Also, they do not seem to be in a hurry at the end of this 
session, because they are waiting for a specific bill to come back 
from the other place. In the meantime, they are just marking time, 
killing time, and not introducing any legislation. But when they 
introduce bills, they should argue! This is incredible!
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I call upon the members across the way. They still have time, in 
the next two hours, to participate in the debate on this bill so that 
we can do our work as parliamentarians, that is, the government 
presents a bill, explains its advantages, and the opposition reacts, 
criticises and shows the bad sides of that bill.
<P>
	After that, people can make their own minds. They can also 
change their minds and propose amendments, but now the situation 
is inanimate, senseless, nothing is happening. There is no debate 
because the only team willing to play is that of the opposition, 
because it takes its work seriously.
<P>
	We are asking ourselves some very serious questions about the 
content of the bill. The first three clauses are normal and prompt no 
comment. The fourth one denies a number of rights which are not 
replaced by others and are not specified. Where will this lead? I 
fear an incredible backslide, the emergence of a system where one 
person has immense power.
<P>
	There are problems within the RCMP, as shown by the incident 
at the Prime Minister's house and the inquiry into the case 
involving a former Prime Minister. I would never dare criticize 
members of the RCMP because I think they lack supervision and, 
at the same time, managers, heads of departments and 
commissioners have too much power.
<P>
	Given that context, these people act as people will. They go 
every which way as we say. I ask those Liberal members who have 
something good to say about this bill to rise and present their 
arguments so that the Canadian public and the 16,000 members of 
the RCMP, those guardians of the law and order in our country, will 
accept it.
<P>
	I ask them to take advantage of this forum, the Parliament which 
costs us something everyday and every hour. They should respect 
Parliament and put forward their positive arguments in support of 
this bill. I cannot see a single one, but I am very willing to listen.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
admirable colleague for his speech. I would like to ask him-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are no questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Very well. I was going to ask him a question, but I 
think I can still do so in my speech. I am certain you will agree with 
me, Mr. Speaker, as usual.
<P>
	How are RCMP officers going to react to the fact that they 
cannot hope to enter into collective bargaining, or have a safety 
code, in short to do what all other workers are allowed to do today, 
namely, get together and have their voices heard.
<P>
	I am afraid that this bill will deprive RCMP officers of any hope 
to find a balance between their status and the status of all other 
Canadian workers, who have the right to join forces, and 
sometimes are compelled to by the social context. From now on, 
RCMP officers-that is the police officers of the RCMP-will not 
be allowed to engage in collective bargaining, or to form unions or 
brotherhoods. All these things that give hope to other workers are 
henceforth taken away from them.
<P>
	What is their attitude going to be with regards to their work? 
What is going to motivate them to proudly discharge their duties if, 
year after year, their pay scale is going to lag behind those of other 
police forces, construction workers or workers in any other fields?
<P>
	Are RCMP officers going to find themselves in the same 
situation as some members of the armed forces? According to a 
news item the minister of defence is careful not to comment, 
military personnel from Quebec who had been transferred to 
Vancouver had to go to the British Columbia welfare office to 
cover the shortfall between their military pay and what they need to 
live on in Vancouver.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	I know you agree with me, Mr. Speaker, as always. Except that, 
do we wish the same thing for RCMP officers? Is this yet another 
roundabout means, a trick this government has found to make 
provincial governments pay for a part of its police officers' salary? 
There is some machiavellism in that. I refuse to recognize there is 
some good faith in a bill containing four clauses. In fact, it contains 
only one, because the first three say this is a piece of legislation, 
which we all figured out here, but there is one that is fundamental, 
and it is clause 4. It takes away all rights from our police officers' 
elite.
<P>
	I think the government is also relying greatly on the fact that the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been in existence since 1873, I 
believe, and the member for Bellechasse, who is knowledgeable, 
may correct me if I am wrong. It has been turned into a religion in 
some families. First of all they want a priest in the family, then a 
RCMP officer. And the government has used that ever  since. It 
used the fact it was a vocation for many who joined the RCMP to 
underpay them, to impose working conditions that would not have 
been acceptable anywhere else, but it did so in the case of the 
RCMP because it was a religion.
<P>
	Religion means privation, of course. Privation means unfulfilled 
needs, needs that are not compensated for. It can end up being 
dangerous. There have been unfortunate occurrences like the recent 
one involving a career officer in the RCMP who turned his service 
weapon against himself because he was suspected of some 
wrongdoing, maybe rightly so, I do not know, because I have not 
investigated the matter. He was allegedly involved in something 
improper, according to the media-which I do not always 
trust-and he killed himself. If this man had been adequately paid, 
if his dignity had been recognized in his work and duties, if he had 
had the same opportunities as his fellow officers, if he had been 
able to afford going to the restaurant once in a while, with his wife 
and kids, maybe he would not have committed suicide. But these 
people are asked to behave as if their occupation was a vocation, 
like priesthood. ``You are paid less''. And, in polite terms, they are 
told: ``Shut up. Do not demand anything''.
<P>
	Things have to get really awful before an RCMP officer 
complains about anything. I can see that when I sit on the scrutiny 
of regulations committee. Retired RCMP officers have been 
cheated for 15 years in the calculation of their pension benefits. But 
during that whole period, not a single one of them has launched 
proceedings to argue for his rights before the trial and appeal 
divisions of the Federal Court of Canada. An RCMP guy never 
demands anything. Does a priest ask God anything for himself? 
Never. It is just the same with the RCMP.
<P>
	Had this problem happened in the public service, it would have 
been quickly brought before the Supreme Court of Canada, and 
justice would have been done, but the RCMP is like a religion or 
like priesthood. You never ask for anything, and if you do, you do 
so humbly and never demand anything. If your request is not 
granted, well-
<P>
	I have seen a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police sell 
his house at something like $15,000 below market value for fear of 
making a profit he could be criticized for by his superiors. This is 
as true as the fact that you are in your seat, Mr. Speaker. I know that 
you are listening, as always, and I thank you for that.
<P>
	I would imagine that, coming from so far away, the hon. member 
for Bourassa has known a police force or two. He must have 
encountered police officers who not as patient and amicable as our 
RCMP officers. He has seen it all, the whole range of police forces. 
He can tell you himself-I am not putting words in his 
mouth-that we are well served by the RCMP. We have come to 
rely on the members of the RCMP, who have become, at least  in 
our minds, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4014"> 4014 </A></B>
<P>
some kind of missionaries. They are paid less than they should be 
for the work they do. There are members of police forces much less 
important and definitely not as endearing as the RCMP who are 
paid better. Personally, I suspect that we pay more for RCMP 
horses than RCMP officers. This flies in the face of reason. Of 
course, they do have very fine horses.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	All this to say that we must do our police officers justice and 
throwing bludgeon legislation like this at them is certainly not the 
way to go about it. How nice: Tourists come here to see the 
changing of the guard, with the big fur hats and all. It looks good, 
but the fact is that the person under the hat is not paid or underpaid. 
This person is not entitled to the same pay as anyone else. I do not 
know many people who would agree to stand there under a hot sun 
with a fur hat.
<P>
	I would therefore ask the sponsors of this bill to reconsider and 
try to understand where others are coming from, to understand the 
tragedy for these people of having no bilingual bonus and no 
collective bargaining. In fact, all they are allowed to do is to ride 
their horses and shut up. This is really not the sort of life one would 
expect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a few comments on the issue of staff relations 
between RCMP officers and their employer, the government, from 
a perspective which concerns me somewhat, namely staff relations 
and public offices which RCMP members can hope to hold.
<P>
	I am referring, as you know, to the case of the RCMP officer who 
got involved in a municipal election and was sharply reprimanded 
by his superiors. Such is the current staff relations policy within the 
RCMP regarding this issue. Incidentally, such an attitude also 
prevailed elsewhere, including in the Quebec public service, of 
which I am a former member. Until 1976-77, any public servant 
who got elected in Quebec had to resign from his or her position in 
the public service.
<P>
	This, of course, was a serious injustice to public servants, who 
not only had to make the major decision of whether or not to run for 
office, but to accept the fact that they would have to resign if they 
did get elected. I am among those who fought at the time to ensure 
that the employer, that is the Government of Quebec, treated its 
employees more decently and more fairly and in a less arbitrary 
and demanding way.
<P>
	The act as it stood in 1975, 1976 and 1977-which had been as 
all acts enacted by men and women-was amended by the Parti 
Quebecois government and nowadays the Quebec public servants 
who have the honour of being elected in their ridings to the 
National Assembly of Quebec do not have to resign, since they are 
entitled to a leave of absence without pay for the whole time they 
sit as an MNA and when they leave politics  they have the choice, 
depending on the length of their terms, of simply going back to 
their jobs in the Quebec public service.
<P>
	That gives you an idea of how far we are from implementing that 
type of solution with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the 
Government of Canada and their employees. I met the officer who 
ran in some municipal election and who brought down his 
employer's wrath upon himself. That man was badly hurt; he was a 
victim, I think, of a major injustice, of some kind of abuse of 
authority, of the latitude given to his employer, because there is no 
rational or justifiable reason for the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police to be so hard on its employees, to be so demanding.
<P>
	The right thing would be for these people, as for all other 
workers, to be able to get a leave of absence without pay and to go 
back to their jobs after their terms, if it is possible, and I am talking 
here about members of Parliament. We could even stipulate that 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers cannot be elected to the 
House of Commons, because they would then be part of one of the 
entities acting as their employer, since the Government of Canada 
is the employer of the RCMP. But to go so far as to prevent an 
RCMP officer from running as mayor or town councillor is, I think, 
an abuse of authority worthy of condemnation.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	It seems that with this bill now before us, the government is 
maintaining that policy which restrains rights. It is a question of 
fundamental human rights to recognizethat somwone is entitled to 
be chosen by his community to represent it. We cannot, for 
purely-not to say meanly-administrative resaons, deprive 
someone of a right as fundamental as the right to run in an election.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity today to share my personal 
experience with you. Legislation in Quebec in this regard has 
changed significantly. If one was a public servant in Quebec, one 
had to resign after having been elected as a member of the national 
assembly. This law was passed by men and women.
<P>
	Today, because the government listened to peoples' demands 
and representations, the law was changed so that now a leave 
without pay is granted. Why do we not do the same thing with 
RCMP officers, maybe with the required differences and 
subtleties?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-30 
concerning the members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
should be rejected. The decision made on March 10, 1994, by the 
Federal Court-Appeals Division in the Gingras case was very clear. 
RCMP officers are members of the federal public service and as 
such they have the same rights as the other public servants.
<P>
	They have the right to unionize and to bargain collectively with 
their employer. These principles are recognized in all democratic 
countries: The right to  unionize and the right to bargain. These 
principles should also apply to the members of the RCMP. The 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4015"> 4015 </A></B>
<P>
International Labour Organization was very clear on this: Those 
principles apply to all wage earners.
<P>
	I would like to come back to what my colleague from Chambly 
said earlier when he commended the RCMP. I agree with him that 
the RCMP is fulfilling a necessary, an essential function and that it 
is a democratic and very professional police force. I am satisfied 
when an RCMP officer is fighting against drug trafficking, for 
example.
<P>
	RCMP officers should have the same rights as the other public 
servants, the other wage earners, that is, for example, all rights in 
terms of occupational safety and health. A colleague mentioned 
that they are sometimes exposed to the same dangers-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, it being almost 2 p.m., you will 
still have the floor and you will be able to continue after Oral 
Question Period. We will now proceed to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Alzheimer's disease affects more than a quarter of a million 
Canadians. The cost of the disease is over $4 billion per year.
<P>
	I recently had the opportunity to meet with the Alzheimer 
Society of Ottawa-Carleton. It believes it is vital to protect and 
strengthen the principles of the Canada Health Act to ensure that an 
effective system exists to meet the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	Alzheimer organizations across Canada have identified three 
specific priorities: to reform Canadian tax laws to provide financial 
relief for Alzheimer family care givers; to recognize Alzheimer's 
disease as a priority of the national health research development 
program; to expand federal program grants that benefit people 
affected by Alzheimer's disease.
<P>
	Alzheimer groups continue to work hard to address the needs of 
Canadians who must live with this disease. I congratulate these 
dedicated individuals and organization on a job well done.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple

drew the attention of the minister of agriculture to a restrictive 
trade practice by the Farm Credit Corporation. He has not yet 
responded.
<P>
	Farm Credit makes feed loans to cattle producers. However, it 
appears that these are all channelled through Heartland Livestock 
Services, which then handles all the sales. This puts private auction 
markets at a severe disadvantage since they are, in effect, forced to 
compete against federal government money.
<P>
	Independent dealers have been cautioned that the FCC has first 
call on sale proceeds from any cattle that they receive bearing a 
Heartland brand. Thus, besides being subject to unfair competition, 
the independents must also act as Heartland's collection agency if a 
producer attempts to default.
<P>
	Independent dealers' tax dollars are being used to favour a huge 
competitor. When will the minister get off his duff and investigate 
this complaint?

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the love affair between the media, the Liberals and big business 
continues. What Canadians want and need is not getting reported 
fairly by the media or acted on by the Liberals. Canadians need 
jobs, fair taxes and sensible social programs. The only party in 
Canada that fights for what Canadians need is the NDP.
<P>
	Fortunately, ordinary Canadians are ignoring the big business 
message of the media and the Liberals, and even though the 
Liberals deny New Democrats full access to Parliament, more and 
more Canadians are listening to our message.
<P>
	How do we know this? In Saskatchewan the NDP government 
was re-elected. In Manitoba the NDP leads the polls. In the recent 
Halifax byelection the NDP got 65 per cent of the vote. In B.C. the 
NDP government was re-elected. Last night in the Hamilton 
byelection the NDP finished a strong second with 26 per cent of the 
vote.
<P>
	While the media prop up the Liberals who betray Canadians, 
more and more Canadians are ignoring both and voting for the 
party that is on their side, the NDP.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

international law Brian Tobin's efforts to save marine fish stocks.
<P>
	Rising world demand, indiscriminate industrialized fishing and 
environmental changes have stressed global fish stocks to a critical 
level. This is not a problem that can be solved by any one nation 
working alone. International action, leading to truly global fish 
stocks legislation, is necessary.
<P>
	While putting our own house in order, the Ministers of Fisheries 
and Oceans, Foreign Affairs and the Environment should continue 
to push vigorously for international laws to protect straddling fish 
stocks and highly migratory fish. Protection of particular stocks is 
a good first step toward global fish stocks management.

completed its annual Carousel of Nations, celebrating the ethnic

A World without Boundaries''. Every year for two weekends in 
June this celebration attracts thousands of Canadian and American 
visitors to the area and provides entertainment, food, a touch of 
history and the cultural diversity of the various ethnic backgrounds 
that make up our country.
<P>
	This weekend, however, was very special. On Saturday, June 15 
a new village was inaugurated. With the help of many friends, 
neighbours and esteemed colleagues, the Canadian Unity Village 
was opened. This village brought together the special qualities that 
were demonstrated during the Montreal rally in October. Canada's

donated to the village by the Windsor Jaycees and provincial flags 
lent by my colleagues were mounted to give a panorama of our

	The odds of making an NHL team as a player are very high. The 
odds of coaching an NHL team and having that team go to the

was outpouring of warmth and pride in Doug's accomplishments 
from the people of Summerside and P.E.I. in general.
<P>
	As much as anyone can be, Doug MacLean is a self-made man. 
His determination and personality have made him the best coach in 
the NHL. All Islanders have their fingers crossed as we await the 
announcement of the coach of the year in the NHL.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is getting ready to meet the premiers at 
a conference where he will probably announce the federal 
government's intention to withdraw from some areas of provincial 
jurisdiction in which it is now involved.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister or the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. Will the Prime Minister admit that the 
federal government's withdrawal from areas of provincial 
jurisdiction in which it is now involved can only be done by 
transferring at the same time the funds now spent by the federal 
government in these areas? Otherwise, this will be nothing but a 
dumping operation likely to place the provinces in a difficult 
financial situation.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the meeting is  to enable the two orders 
of government to work together, even better than they do now, to 
provide Canadians with better services at a lower cost. And we will 
succeed.
<P>
	In some areas, it is important to better clarify the respective roles 
played by the two levels of government, as in the case of mining 
and forestry. In other cases, the federal government will transfer 
substantial amounts to the provinces. For example, $2 billion will 
be transferred for active employment measures over the life of this 
program. The federal government will also transfer $1.9 billion to 
the provinces for the management of some 660,000 social housing 
units.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in this regard, given the extremely high cost of renovating 
our social housing stock, the Prime Minister said he wanted to give 
this area back to the provinces.
<P>
	Given, then, the substantial amount of renovation work needed, 
is the government committed-it is important to set the record 
straight on this-to withdrawing from this area, but only if it helps 
pay for the work needed to repair all these social housing units?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are committed to 
transferring the money we now spend on social housing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what I want to find out from the minister-It is important 
to set the record straight. The minister talks about the money now 
spent by the federal government, but we know that the government 
is not spending anything on repairs to our social housing stock, 
which has been deteriorating for several years.
<P>
	My question to the minister is this: Is the federal government 
preparing to transfer to the provinces apartments in need of major 
renovation work, thus forcing them to pay exorbitant repair bills? 
Is this not an example of the kind of federal withdrawal that is 
tantamount to dumping on the provinces?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, our commitment is 
clear. The Leader of the Opposition, however, should make up his 
mind. Does he want us to withdraw from areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, yes or no? We said we would continue to contribute 
the same amounts as at present, to be administered by the 
provinces. Any savings will benefit the provinces, which will be 
able to do more with the same amount, as there will now be a single 
level of management.
<P>
	The provinces should make up their minds. If they do not want 
us to withdraw, we will not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister gave as an excuse for putting the 
securities issue on the agenda of the first ministers' conference the 
fact that it was requested by a number of provinces. Six provinces 
also asked the Prime Minister to put the GST on the agenda.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister, the Acting Prime Minister 
or the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. How does he explain 
his refusal to put the GST on the agenda of the first ministers' 
conference, as requested by six provinces representing 90 per cent 
of the Canadian population?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the GST issue will be discussed very soon at a finance 
ministers' conference.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when a number of provinces ask that the Canadian social 
policy be on the agenda, the Prime Minister puts it on the agenda. 
When other provinces ask that securities be on the agenda, the 
Prime Minister agrees to put this topic on the agenda. But when six 
Canadian provinces ask that the GST be on the agenda, the Prime 
Minister says: ``No, we will not discuss the GST''.
<P>
	My question to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is this: 
Why does the Prime Minister not want to talk about the GST, an 
issue of interest to the four western provinces as well as to Ontario 
and Quebec? Is he afraid?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, one of the comments made was that the agenda was 
quite heavy and that there might not be enough time to deal with 
everything on it. This is a very good point, but I think that, if we 
keep a tight schedule, we should be able to go through the whole 
agenda.
<P>
	The opposition would like to add yet another item. A number of 
provinces would like to discuss several other issues. But we have 
had to make a selection to put the agenda together. If it is too heavy, 
it will require a great deal of discipline on the part of the ministers 
to deal with all the issues constructively.

<P>
	In particular he said job creation will be one of the main themes 
of the discussion. The key to job creation in this country, 
particularly private sector job creation, can be summed up in two 
words: tax relief. It is taxes, taxes taxes that kill jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	If job creation really is an objective of the first ministers 
conference, why is tax relief not front and centre on the agenda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government's 
record on job creation is already excellent. There have been 
600,000 new jobs already created since our mandate began, some 
150,000 created in the last six months alone. The job creation 
record of the government is top notch.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, its record on job creation is 1.3 million unemployed, 2 
million to 3 million under employed and 1 out of 4 Canadians 
worried about their jobs.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister goes into that conference at the end of 
the week, of the ten premiers there, eight will have either balanced 
their budgets or run surpluses. All those premiers are in a position 
to actually deliver tax relief to their people, whereas the federal 
government will be taking $25 billion more out of the pockets of 
Canadians next year than in its first year in office.
<P>
	Is it not true the federal government is at the back of the pack 
when it comes to tax relief and that is why it is unable to provide 
leadership on this subject at the first ministers conference?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking of people 
who are at the back of the pack, despite being at the back of the 
pack, the Reform Party has suggested in its budget that it would not 
reduce taxes until the budget was balanced.
<P>
	Do Reform members want us to reduce taxes before our budget 
is balanced? Is that what they are suggesting as they change their 
policy once again? They flip-flopped on the GST time and time 
again. Are they flip-flopping on their policy on deficit reduction or 
do they really mean it?
<P>
	We put deficit reduction first. We have achieved our goals on 
deficit reduction and we have done a first rate job. We have the 
strength of the financial markets behind us now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the parliamentary secretary is supposed to be some sort of 
economist. He would know that under Reform's taxpayers budget 
the federal budget would have been balanced this year and tax 
relief would have been accomplished.
<P>
	The Government of Ontario has responsibility for the biggest 
regional economy in the country. The federal job strategy has to be 
co-ordinated with the job strategy in that province for maximum 
effect. The Ontario government has taken the position that tax 
relief is the key to job creation in that economy and has acted on 
that position in the recent budget.
<P>
	If the federal government truly believes in co-ordinated 
federal-provincial approaches to job creation, why does it not 
follow Ontario's lead and put tax relief squarely on the agenda of 
the first ministers conference?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have put 
harmonization first. We have put co-ordination first. Why does the 
hon. member not ask the premier of Ontario why he flip-flopped on 
the GST, where there are real savings in government, real savings 
in collection of taxes and real savings to the Canadian people?

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
GST has hijacked the meeting this week of the finance ministers.
<P>
	The finance ministers across the country are trying to meet to 
discuss true pension reform this week. Instead they have to talk 
about how the Liberals are pitting provinces against each other 
with a billion dollar GST harmonization pay-off.
<P>
	My question is for the minister of the GST. If the harmonized 
GST is such a great and fair deal, why are 63 per cent of the people 
of Nova Scotia dead against it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the finance ministers 
will be discussing a number of issues at their meeting today, 
including CPP, which is an important part of the meeting and an 
important issue. They may also be discussing the GST.
<P>
	We have support from business groups and consumer groups 
across the country for a harmonized GST. Every major business 
and consumer group supports the harmonization project.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems fairly clear that 63 per cent of Nova Scotians, the very 
people the Liberals are trying to butter up to buy into this 
harmonization program, are not supporting it. How can the 
minister say every major group across the country is?
<P>
	The GST still puts the financial screws to Canadians every single 
time they go to the cash register. Now it is causing bitterness and 
division instead of progress at the finance ministers meeting.
<P>
	Remember how we got into this mess in the first place, Mr. 
Speaker, you were here: a Tory tax, a public outcry, a Liberal 
promise; and now crass manoeuvring by the finance minister to 
distract attention from his own broken promise.
<P>
	Why does the minister continue to divide Canadians with this 
harmonization scheme? Why will he not unite Canadians by living 
up to the election promise to scrap, kill and abolish it? When will 
he do that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always nice to 
listen to the Reform Party.
<P>
	We especially listened to it when it came out with its minority 
report from the finance committee on the GST. It said harmonizing 
was the way to go. That is what we did, but here we have the 
Reform Party squabbling again.

for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	On Saturday, <I>Le Journal de Montréal</I> released the content of a 
coast guard internal document entitled ``Fleet Merger'' and dealing 
with the cuts affecting the coast guard. Once again, the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans is displaying a blatant lack of judgment by 
cutting everywhere, except in his province of Newfoundland.
<P>
	After favouring his province with the fee structure for 
commercial traffic, how can the minister justify that he is about to 
make drastic cuts of $25 million in all regions of Canada, except in 
his own province, where the cuts will only total $140,000?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my response to the hon. member in this instance in 
essence is the same as it was in the previous instance.
<P>
	What is happening to the coast guard is the result of a number of 
studies that went back to 1962, 1975, 1990 and which ended in the 
mix of DFO and the coast guard. As part of this we are rationalizing 
this fleet of 162 ships, reducing it by over 30. The decisions have 
not been made. The discussions are still continuing.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister did 
not comment on the figures mentioned in <I>Le Journal de Montréal</I>. I 
am asking him the same question again.
<P>
	How can the minister so blatantly favour his province of origin, 
considering the coast guard budget for Newfoundland is the same 
as for Quebec and British Columbia, even though traffic in 
Newfoundland ports is lighter, and in spite of the fact that the coast 
guard is less busy in that province?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is trying to compare different 
aspects of a very complex program. Whatever the figures are, I am 
not sure where they came from, because a decision has not yet been 
made.
<P>
	My advice to the hon. member is to read the reports with a 
certain amount of circumspection and a certain amount of 
understanding because the decisions have not been made.

increasing taxes. Here is a real life example of the damage these 
changes are causing.
<P>
	Dave Quest from Kallal Pontiac Buick in Tofield, Alberta had a 
customer come in to sell a truck. As a direct result of the new GST 
changes, this dealership's profit has shrunk from about $1,000 to 
$80 on the truck; a $920 tax grab for the government.
<P>
	I want the government to explain to Dave and all the thousands 
of other small businessmen out there why it is continuing to pursue 
taxation policies which gut business and kill jobs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought the Reform 
Party was playing for political points when its members asked this 
question every day for the last week or so, but it seems they really 
do not understand it. Let me give them an example for Dave or for 
whomever out west.
<P>
	A used car under the old system was subject to the same GST tax 
as it is under the new system. A new car under the old system was 
subject to twice as much GST as-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> We put an input tax credit on it and the net is exactly 
the same. The new system and the old system have exactly the 
same GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> He really 
straightened me out, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Let us look at the RV business. Don Sneyd at Ruston RV Centre 
in Burlington said the GST change has directly cost his business 
$13,000 since April 23. Dave McKee from the Hitch House in 
Barrie says his losses have been closer to $25,000 in the last seven 
weeks.
<P>
	They laugh at that. They think that is funny, but I know there are 
Liberal members who are lobbying the finance minister and the 
revenue minister over these very changes.
<P>
	Why does the government continue to deny these GST changes 
are anything but a tax grab? When will the minister admit and 
recognize that taxes, taxes, taxes kill jobs, jobs, jobs? When will 
the government get rid of this boondoggle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party has 
demonstrated its ability not only to come last but to misunderstand 
government policy.
<P>
	The taxes raised under the new and old system of the GST are 
identical. They are exactly the same.
<P>
	How these dealers can lose money when they are paying exactly 
the same tax is beyond me. I will be glad to explain it to the hon.

<P>
	When a Canadian citizen inquired of the head office of American

to date?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

the effects of the Helms-Burton law. It is a last resort measure. It is 
one I hope we never have to engage in. It is a framework law which 
allows that if a company is sued in the United States courts, we 
could either block them from getting any of the assets of the 
Canadian company here in Canada or a court action could be 
instituted here in Canada to recover any funds. It is to neutralize the 
effect.

think twice before they proceed in the U.S. courts under

yesterday I and several other MPs received sneering personal notes 
from child killer Clifford Olson to which he attached his new line 
of serial killer cards, a collection of police photographs taken of 
him at different stages in his criminal life.
<P>
	In his letter Olson brags about his prospect for early release this 
August using section 745 of the Criminal Code. He claims it is his 
democratic right within the charter of rights and freedoms and 
common law.
<P>
	Why will the justice minister not immediately repeal section 745

that early release is not a democratic right or even an option for 
cold blooded killers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

Olson who is serving a life sentence for crimes that are absolutely

killers and that will never be shut down.
<P>
	The justice minister refers to section 745 of the Criminal Code as 
the faint hope clause. He tells Canadians that section 745 is 
necessary because killers need a glimmer of hope. What the justice 
minister is reluctant to say is that 80 per cent of the killers who 
apply for release under section 745 receive some type of early 
parole. So much for faint hope. Section 745 is a sure bet clause.

	Each time a killer makes an application under section 745, the

individuals and their jobs.

subsidy from the taxpayer of Canada, from $172 million to $100 
million. It has to go through the same process of program review, 
of restructuring and downsizing, as the government and other 
crown corporations.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It has to do with 
events in the San Alfonso Valley in Chile in recent days. I have 
written to the minister about this.
<P>
	Earlier this day members of Parliament from three different 
parties held a press conference to express their concern that NOVA 
Corporation of Canada, the majority shareholder in GasAndes 
which is building the pipeline from Argentina through to Santiago, 
is associated with a police action against a blockade in the San 
Alfonso Valley that in our opinion is dragging the good name of 
Canada through the mud and is bringing Canada's reputation into 
disrepute.
<P>
	Is it the minister's intention to express concern on behalf of the 
Canadian government at the way the Chilean police are behaving 
and the way in which NOVA Corporation is associated with that 
police action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that people were injured in the 
clash between demonstrators and riot police on June 13. Although 
we do not have the details of the incident, we understand that the 
police intervened to remove demonstrators who were blocking a 
national highway. According to some reports, some individuals 
threw rocks at police, injuring some people.
<P>
	NOVA corporation is a lead partner in the GasAndes consortium. 
This consortium has gone through every single required approval 
by Chilean authorities including an environmental impact study. 
Amendments were made. It has completely abided by the law and I 
am told that many of the standards are very similar to the standards 
that exist in this country. They are following the law completely.
<P>
	The incidents that occurred in the demonstration were most 
unfortunate although we have very little information at this point in 
time.

	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is directed to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	In June 1995 the Bureau of Competition Policy outlined a review 
of the Competition Act. At that time a discussion paper was 
circulated to obtain feedback on several proposed changes to this 
act.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers produced a 
paper which outlines strong arguments against the bureau's 
recommendation to repeal the price discrimination and 
promotional allowance provisions of the act.
<P>
	Would the minister assure the House and the independent 
grocers across Canada that their concerns will be explored before 
any other changes to the act are adopted?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, may I begin by stating that, when the bill is introduced 
this fall, my colleague, the Secretary of State for the Federal Office 
of Regional Development-Quebec, will be responsible for it, 
being a Canadian expert on the Competition Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Second, I take very seriously the arguments that have been made 
by a number of representatives from the small business 
community, including the independent grocers, that the existence 
of provisions relating to price discrimination and promotional 
allowances gives them some protection from actions of large 
suppliers, although those provisions have never been used.
<P>
	Having taken heed of those arguments we will not be 
recommending that those provisions be eliminated from the act.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I 
may, I wish to make a solemn declaration today relating to a 
question of privilege raised in this House on March 12 by the hon. 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, a question of 
privilege you yourself described as extremely serious, and to which 
you attached vital importance, stating, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House today is being faced with one of the more serious matters we have 
been faced with in this 35th Parliament. I believe the charges are so grave 
against one of our own members that the House should deal with this accusation 
forthwith.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hereby declare that the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, through his overzealous 
accusations of call to arms and sedition, has deliberately led the 
House and yourself astray, thus bringing doubt  and suspicion to be 
cast upon a member of the House of Commons, without any proof, 
since his charges were based solely upon false interpretations of 
my press release dated October 26, 1995.
<P>
	The report by the Liberal majority and the dissenting report by 
the Bloc Quebecois issued by the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs conclude that this entire question is a 
matter of political debate and ought never to have been raised 
before the House on a question of privilege, particularly one 
supported by unfounded accusations.
<P>
	What is of the most concern to me, apart from the attack on the 
rights and privileges of a parliamentarian, is that it is also an attack 
on the freedom of expression of all Quebecers and all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, solemn declarations are generally 
free of what I might call any additional accusation. At this point, 
although the Chair has a decision to make, I find, with all due 
respect, dear colleague, that the words being used today tend more 
toward a debate than a solemn declaration. I would like to put an 
end to the statement at this point.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Oder, please. My colleagues, I would prefer this 
matter to remain closed at this time. I have made my ruling on 
behalf of all of the hon. members and I would ask you to respect it.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	This point of privilege, this statement, is terminated. I would ask 
members to respect my decision as your Speaker. I ask you that 
with the full authority of the House and of my position.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PRIVATEMEMBERS'BUSINESS-SPEAKER'SRULING">PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on the point of order raised 
on May 9, 1996 by the hon. member for Lethbridge concerning the 
procedural acceptability of Motion M-1 standing on the order of 
precedence for Private Members' Business in the name of the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge argued that the motion is 
procedurally unacceptable because it contains allegations of 
contempt by one member against another and yet had not been 
designated as votable by the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs. In other words, the House must be capable of taking 
a decision on any motion which contains a charge against a 
member. In addition, he questioned the current rules governing 
Private Members' Business which have allowed this situation to 
occur.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The rules governing private members' business are indeed 
complex. Members may put bills or motions on notice, and then 
those members whose names have been chosen in a draw decide 
which item they wish to put forward for debate in the House during 
private members' business hour.
<P>
	Once the chosen items are placed on an order of precedence, the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs selects which 
ones will come to a vote of the House. In the case of Motion M-1, 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs chose not 
to designate this item as votable.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 92(2), the report of the committee 
concerning votable items is automatically deemed adopted, and 
therefore stands as a decision of the House. This is how the House 
has decided, through its Standing Orders, to deal with private 
members' business.
<P>
	The hon. member is quite correct in his assertion that the 
conduct of a member can be brought before the House only by way 
of a specific charge contained in a substantive motion. Often, in 
such cases, members will choose to raise the matter on the floor of 
the House without giving the required 48-hour or two-week notice 
and ask the Speaker to give it priority or right of way for  
immediate consideration by the House, thus putting all other 
regular House business aside.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What is at stake here is whether or not your Speaker can override 
the rules governing the transaction of Private Members' Business 
in order that such motions come to a vote even when the sponsoring 
member has selected to bring it before the House under that 
procedure. I humbly must admit that unless the House changes its 
rules I do not have that power.
<P>
	For the benefit of the House, please allow me to point out that 
this is not the first time this type of motion has come before the 
House without the possibility of a vote.
<P>
	On a number of occasions on supply days the opposition has 
moved non-votable motions to condemn or challenge ministers for 
their actions.
<P>
	In one case a motion condemning a minister for ``failing to 
provide full and satisfactory information on the blatant conflict of 
interest situation involving the minister'' was moved as a 
non-votable motion on a supply day.
<P>
	I refer members to the <I>Journals</I> of the House of Commons of 
May 12, 1986, page 2160: ``In at least one other instance, a 
non-votable supply motion contained a specific charge of contempt 
of Parliament against the minister''. The text of this motion can 
also be found in the <I>Journals</I> of June 17, 1982, page 5025.
<P>
	The content of the motion and the fact that it has not been 
designated as a votable item under Private Members' Business 
does cause the Chair some difficulty.
<P>
	I understand the concerns of the hon. member for Lethbridge. As 
your Speaker I suggest this situation could be corrected either by 
the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the hon. 
member for Lethbridge or, for that matter, the House itself. There 
are procedures at the disposal of the House to ensure that a sense of 
fair play prevails in all of its proceedings so that members are not 
placed in this type of position.
<P>
	In the current circumstances I find that the rules for Private 
Members' Business have been followed and that there is therefore 
no point of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for raising this point and

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of 
your ruling and based on the fact that Motion No. 1 is still on the 
floor before us, I rise on a question of privilege with regard to that 
matter which is a personal charge against me as contained in the 
motion put forward by the member.
<P>
	In a sense that charge is one that is criminal in nature and reflects 
upon my reputation. This has and will continue to affect my ability 
to function effectively as a member of Parliament while the matter 
remains unresolved.
<P>
	On March 22, 1983 on page 24,027 of <I>Hansard</I> the Speaker 
ruled:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A reflection upon the reputation of an hon. member is a matter of great 
concern to all members of the House. It places the entire institution under a 
cloud, as it suggests that among the members of the House there are some who 
are unworthy to sit there. An allegation of criminal or other dishonourable 
conduct inevitably affects the member's ability to function effectively while the 
matter remains unresolved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Speaker was concerned with the matter remaining 
unresolved. I raised a point of order with regard to private 
member's Motion No. 1 in the name of the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	I thank you today for considering that and I appreciate the ruling 
you have placed before this assembly. This type of motion and the 
affect of this motion is considered an anomaly of the rules. 
Although the motion is in order, I would like to demonstrate that its 
presence infringes upon my and other members' privileges in the 
Chamber.
<P>
	The motion accuses me of intimidation and coercing others to 
intimidate. The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell's 
charge against me is in the form of a motion and so he is allowed on 
a  technicality to get away with what I believe is unparliamentary 
language.
<P>
	For the purpose of my question of privilege, the fact that the 
charge against me is in the form of a motion is immaterial. What is 
important is that the motion is non-votable. It is non-votable by the 
virtue of our standing orders. It is unresolvable and therefore prima 
facie.
<P>
	I would also like to address at this time the issue of raising this 
question of privilege at the earliest opportunity. Before raising my 
point of order regarding Motion No. 1, I felt it necessary that the 
motion be at least scheduled for debate, and I believe we are at that 
course of events here today.
<P>
	The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell agreed with me 
because despite the impression I was under at the time, the motion 
was not before the House that day and the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell argued that he ought not bring the 
matter up until it was before the House. For once I agreed with him. 
Fortunately I was allowed to present my argument on that day in 
May.
<P>
	The fact that the motion of the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is a product of our rules led me to 
originally pursue the matter as a point of order.
<P>
	At this point my only hope for a remedy to resolve this charge 
against me a question of privilege because the matter remains 
unresolved, as you have said so eloquently, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In the ruling I referred to earlier from 1983, the Speaker 
considered:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The question for the Chair to determine, therefore, is whether the hon. 
member for Lincoln should seek his remedy through the courts, or whether, in 
order to bring the matter to a swifter resolution, the Chair should accord this 
question of privilege precedence over other business.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As you are fully aware, Mr. Speaker, I do not have the luxury of 
bringing this matter before any court. The member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is protected by parliamentary 
privilege.
<P>
	The Speaker in 1983 had another concern:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given the precedence I have studied, it is clear to me that while the hon. 
member could seek a remedy in the courts, he cannot function effectively as a 
member while this slur upon his reputation remains. The process of litigation 
would probably be very lengthy and there is no knowing how long it would take 
before the issue is finally resolved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Once again there is the emphasis on resolving the matter.
<P>
	The Speaker was also concerned here with the length of time the 
matter was to be unresolved. The member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell could, through a series of trades, 
avoid debating the motion. If we do finally get a debate on the 
motion it will disappear from the Order Paper after one hour of 
debate.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4030"> 4030 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Regardless of those two scenarios, the matter will never be 
resolved by this motion. My reputation will be hanging out to dry 
forever. As Speaker Sauvé was concerned with, the entire 
institution of Parliament will be left under a cloud without ever 
being resolved.
<P>
	Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, page 210, 
states that the practice relating to taking up the conduct of members 
is a matter of privilege.
<P>
	If the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell raised this as a 
question of privilege the matter would have been dealt with, but it 
was not.
<P>
	To protect my reputation and the reputation of the House I must 
raise this matter as a question of privilege. Mr. Speaker, if you rule 
this to be a prima facie question of privilege I will be moving the 
following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the member for Lethbridge and the Reform Party of Canada be 
exonerated of the allegations levied by the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell of attempting to coerce, intimidate or incite 
others to coerce the hon. member for Welland-St. Catharines which are 
contained in his non-votable private member's Motion No. 1; and that the 
matter of the use of non-votable motions to charge members with contempt of 
Parliament be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, if you do not consider this a prima facie question of 
privilege I would appreciate your guidance and maybe that of the 
law clerk on how I can resolve this allegation against me of 
criminal intent. I cannot allow this motion to stay on the Order 
Paper all summer. This charge has been hanging over my head long 
enough. It must be resolved now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to take but a moment to respond to what has been 
stated by the hon. member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge essentially says today that his 
reputation is somehow tarnished by this motion's being on the 
Order Paper. He says it is further damaged because the issue is 
non-votable and therefore whenever the issue is dealt with in the 
House no conclusion will have been arrived at and therefore his 
name will not have been cleared, if I understand the allegation 
properly.
<P>
	The member also says the accusation in question, which appears 
in my Motion No. 1, ballot item No. 3 on the Order Paper, is 
criminal in nature.
<P>
	I will begin by dealing with the last issue. It has been suggested 
on at least two occasions in the remarks of the hon. member that the 
allegation listed in Motion No. 1 is criminal in nature.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I remind you of a report tabled in the House earlier 
today which clearly indicates to the House that those things that are 
criminal in nature are not to be dealt with in the House on matters 
of privilege and that a motion should not contain that, and I believe 
it does not,  and that those issues would be dealt with elsewhere 
even if they were in the motion.
<P>
	To refresh the House's memory, the motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the attempt by the hon. member for 
Lethbridge and the Reform Party of Canada to coerce, intimidate or incite others 
to coerce the hon. member for Welland-St. Catharines-Thorold (the Hon. 
Gilbert Parent), in his capacity as Speaker, to make certain decisions in regards 
to the status of the Official Opposition in Parliament, constitute a contempt of 
this House and consequently that the hon. member for Lethbridge be ordered to 
the bar of the House to be admonished by the Chair.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I do not believe that someone's being admonished by the Chair 
in Parliament constitutes criminal behaviour. If criminal behaviour 
was there I suggest the punishment would be rendered by someone 
else and it would probably not be an admonishing by a Chair that 
would be the proper sentencing if that kind of criminal behaviour 
had been what was done. We are not talking about that at all.
<P>
	The issue that was brought before the House had nothing to do 
with what the hon. member has just suggested. What was brought 
before the House is what was believed to have been and still 
believed to be a case of someone's doing things to the most senior 
officer of Parliament. That is what is contended as being the case of 
contempt listed in the motion.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I have in hand a memorandum dated January 11, 1996 entitled 
``To all Reform constituency presidents, regional organizers and 
executive councillors''. This letter says in part: ``What I am asking 
you to do is to help launch a high pressure phone, fax and letter 
writing campaign to'', and it lists your name, Mr. Speaker. ``The 
objective is simple: to make it clear to him that as he contemplates 
his decision'', this is the decision to choose who the official 
opposition is in this House, ``that Canadians will no longer tolerate 
a separatist official opposition''.
<P>
	It goes on to say that time is running short and that this high 
pressure campaign against the occupants of the Chair of this House 
should be commenced immediately by fax, letter writing, 
telephone calls, and so on so that Mr. Speaker, can and I conclude 
``do the right thing''. Presumably Mr. Speaker would rule based on 
pressure put on to intimidate him to give a favourable ruling to 
those who had asked for the ruling.
<P>
	That is what is in the motion that was brought by your humble 
servant. What was put in that motion is not an allegation of 
criminal behaviour. It is an allegation that something wrong was 
occurring against the occupant of the Chair of this House, this 
House being the institution that all of us cherish.
<P>
	That is what occurred and nothing else. I am sure that deep down 
in his heart the hon. member knows this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4031"> 4031 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, there is even a draft letter to be sent to the 
occupant of the Chair with his fax number preprinted on the form. 
This draft letter, prepared by the Reform Party and attached and 
sent by the hon. member for Lethbridge, is an instruction to the 
occupant of the Chair of this House to rule not according to what 
is right, but to rule according to the pressure applied to him as 
organized by a member of this House.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is what was asked of you as the occupant of the 
Chair of this Chamber. You were asked to rule that way for the 
reasons I have enunciated.
<P>
	I do not pretend that it is criminal and I never will. I never 
suggested so, either in my press releases or in the motion that is 
today before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What I did say, however, is that this sort of behaviour should not 
be how we approach things in this House and should stop. The 
events occurring a few days after this motion dealt with matters, 
and we hear no more of the issue today. What I have heard in the 
House today explains why we have heard no further mention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
listened to the whip for the government side put forward his case. 
In fact he presented an entire debate on the subject.
<P>
	The question of privilege that has been presented to you today by 
the member for Lethbridge is that some method be found to resolve 
this issue. The issue is not whether the government whip is allowed 
to bring this motion forward. The issue is the dilemma that my hon. 
colleague from Lethbridge finds himself in. It cannot be resolved. 
It cannot be voted on. It cannot be debated. It is just hanging over 
his head like a sword.
<P>
	That is the issue of privilege, not the motion itself.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With regard to this point of privilege I will take 
the information I have under advisement. If the House will permit 
me I will reflect on it and I will come back to the House, if it is 
necessary, to rule on the point of privilege that the member for 
Lethbridge has brought to the House.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a member of this House and a colleague of the member 
for Charlesbourg and further to the report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, I today demand a 
public apology in the name of all the members of this House.
<P>
	I therefore demand a public apology from the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt for having misled this House 
by making false accusations that called into question the honesty 
and integrity of the member for Charlesbourg. I demand an apology 
from the member, otherwise there is nothing to prevent gratuitous 
accusations of all sorts from being made against anybody at all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Your Speaker is fully aware of the importance of 
the statement that the hon. member for Charlesbourg began today.
<P>
	It was explained before the hon. member began his statement it 
was a solemn declaration. It was not a declaration which would 
incite debate. I was dealing solely with the statement itself.
<P>
	There is, of course, an avenue for the hon. member or for the 
Leader of the Opposition if they so wish to make a further 
statement, a broader statement. The particular avenue that was 
chosen today, in my respectful view, is evidently not the one that is 
going to fulfil what the hon. member wants to do.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Charlesbourg wishes to pursue the matter, 
then either the hon. member or the Leader of the Opposition or any 
member of this House can file a notice of concurrence in the 
committee report. That can be done by giving a notice to the Clerk 
of the House. At that point there is an avenue for hon. members to 
express themselves.
<P>
	But in the case of this particular statement, my decision is that 
this is not the vehicle to be used for making such a statement. That 
is why I have asked hon. members to respect the decision of the 
Chair, knowing full well that if members want to pursue it, it can be 
done by the method which I have suggested.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand your ruling on the 
solemn declaration. We may disagree on how we see things, but I 
accept your ruling.
<P>
	However, I raised a point of order, and, unless I have 
misunderstood, I have had no response to my point of order. I did, 
however, very clearly insist on apologies from the member 
concerned for having misled the House by intentionally spreading 
falsehoods about the member for Charlesbourg. This is a point of 
order and not a solemn declaration. I therefore await your ruling on 
this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member has asked me to rule on the 
point of order. I will take his request under advisement. I will think 
about it and if it is necessary I will come back to this House.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-30, an act to amend 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police Act, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee, and of Motions Nos. 4 and 5.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I believe the hon. member for Bourassa still has 7 
minutes or so left. He has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for allowing me to continue my presentation on Bill C-30 
concerning members of the RCMP.
<P>
	I would like to make two comments before resuming my speech. 
I was stunned by the unfounded accusations made by a Reform 
member against my colleague from Charlesbourg. I think that, with 
such accusations, the Reform Party will never have a single 
member elected in Quebec.
<P>
	My second comment is this: I would like to draw members' 
attention to the presence in our gallery of a distinguished citizen 
from my riding of Bourassa, Victorin Bellemare, who is very 
involved in the social, community and political life of Montreal 
North. He is accompanied by his family.
<P>
	As I said, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled in the Gingras case 
that RCMP members were also members of the Canadian public 
service and, as such, had rights like the right to organize, to form a 
union and to negotiate collective agreements.
<P>
	They do not claim they have the right to strike, as these police 
officers provide essential services. If the employer and the 
employees' union cannot agree on working conditions, the police 
officers would rather resort to arbitration than go on strike.
<P>
	But they still have legitimate rights. They have rights in terms of 
occupational health and safety and, like all other public service 
employees, they sometimes fall victim to work accidents or 
occupational diseases. Stress, for example, is a very prevalent 
problem among police officers, who must sometimes work in 
difficult and dangerous conditions. They should at least enjoy the 
full protection of all occupational health and safety laws.
<P>
	I think that, instead of depriving employees like those of the 
RCMP of their vested rights, the government should set an example 
for the provinces in the area of labour relations.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	It is a disgrace, for instance, that the federal minimum wage is 
lower that the provincial rates. It is unacceptable that the federal 
occupational safety and health legislation is not on a par with 
provincial legislation like Quebec's. Government should be an 
example to the private sector, and this is certainly not the case at 
present. Instead, the government is attacking vested rights of 
workers, in this particular case the rights of RCMP workers.
<P>
	Take this other important right: the right to precautionary 
cessation of work for pregnant workers. This is not a right that 
federal public service employees enjoy, while it is already provided 
for in Quebec's legislation respecting occupational health and 
safety. A pregnant employee who works in conditions hazardous to 
herself or to her unborn child should be either reassigned or 
allowed to go on leave for the remainder of her pregnancy.
<P>
	So far, the federal government has refused to bring down 
anti-strikebreaking legislation. Quebec and British Columbia both 
have such legislation. Ontario's legislation was just repealed, but 
the fact remains that this kind of legislation improves labour 
relations and helps create a social climate conducive to economic 
development.
<P>
	I find that democracy has progressed in our society, but not in the 
workplace, in businesses and in corporations, where labour 
relations in certain areas are still dictated in an authoritarian way, 
as in the case of the RCMP. The commissioner of the RCMP has 
unlimited rights, while the members of this police force have very 
limited rights.
<P>
	This government has not done very much to improve the 
working conditions and life of workers in Canada and in Quebec. 
On the contrary, when faced with a legitimate strike of rail workers, 
it thought it wise to bring in back-to-work legislation in this sector, 
instead of allowing collective bargaining to operate.
<P>
	The Liberals' labour relations record is very poor. They have 
demonstrated a favourable bias for big business, but have not 
shown much concern for the average worker. Instead of helping 
workers, there are ministers, including the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who attack the Canadian Labour 
Congress and who have made disparaging remarks about its 
president, Robert White, as well as myself, but for different 
reasons.
<P>
	This government claims to occupy the centre, but we can see that 
it is moving with ever increasing speed to the right, the former 
Liberal or neo-Conservative right, and that it has done nothing for 
the working class as a whole, for the workers of Canada and of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Last Saturday, a women's march ended its journey here in 
Ottawa. These women had very legitimate concerns. For example, 
they were calling for a job creation program designed specifically 
for women. They were also calling for increases in the minimum 
wage, day care funding, and grants for women's shelters. All the 
government comes up with is ``niet'', there is no  money. That is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4033"> 4033 </A></B>
<P>
really a shame because I think the patience of Canadians and 
Quebecers is running out.
<P>
	What will it take for the government to act? Does it want a 
revolt? Does it want people to come and demonstrate daily in order 
to be granted their legitimate rights, rights which are recognized in 
other democracies, particularly in Europe? Here, they are 
destroying the social safety net, eliminating social programs. 
Where is Canadian society headed with this Liberal government?
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	My time is nearly up and I will conclude by saying that I am very 
vigorously opposed to Bill C-30.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Colleagues, I am asking to resume debate. I just want to make 
sure we understand clearly that we are on report stage of Bill C-30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have only a few quick words to say in relation to the second group 
of amendments that have been brought forward by members 
opposite. In order to bring forth amendments, a number of factors 
need to be considered.
<P>
	First, the amendments must be consistent with other 
amendments that are brought forward and consistent with 
provisions already in the statute which is sought to be amended by 
the provisions that are brought forward. In this case the 
amendments certainly do not assist in that regard. Therefore they 
ought not to be brought forward because they do not assist with the 
internal consistency of the act.
<P>
	Second, the changes that are brought forward need to be 
consistent with other statutes and laws. Again, this test is also not 
met. The amendments that are being brought forward conflict with 
other pieces of legislation. This is the case when amendments are 
brought forward in a willy-nilly fashion. They are not fully 
researched and the implications of each of the amendments are not 
thought out so that we get consistency with other pieces of 
legislation.
<P>
	In addition, some of the amendments are also proposing some 
type of governance changes. They are being brought forward 
without any type of consultation that would need to be had to make 
these types of statements.
<P>
	In any event, I will say that because of these factors, the 
government will not be supporting the amendments. With respect 
to the comments made in relation to this bill, these are merely 
technical amendments to ensure the maintenance of the status quo 
after court or tribunal decisions have maybe cast some doubt upon 
the governance. It is simply to maintain the status quo at this time. 
These things have been vastly overstated.
<P>
	The government will not be supporting any of these motions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>

	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (for the Minister of Justice, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-42, an act to amend the Judges Act and to make 
consequential amendments to another act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to address the House on Bill C-42, an act 
to amend the Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to 
another act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4034"> 4034 </A></B>
<P>
	Hon. members are aware that crimes of indescribable brutality 
have been perpetrated on tens of thousands of people in the former 
Yugoslavia and Rwanda. A Canadian judge, Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour of the Ontario Court of Appeal has been requested by the  
Secretary-General of the United Nations to serve as chief 
prosecutor of the UN International Commission on War Crimes for 
the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
<P>
	The appointment of Madam Justice Arbour to this very 
important and prestigious international position is without doubt a 
great honour to Canada. A necessary condition imposed by the 
United Nations for Madam Justice Arbour to take up this 
appointment is that her salary and expenses are to be paid by the 
United Nations during the period in which she will be serving as 
the chief prosecutor. This requirement relates to the UN's own 
requirements for the independence of its chief prosecutor and it 
would require Madam Justice Arbour to take leave without pay 
from the Ontario Court of Appeal and to receive a salary from the 
United Nations.
<P>
	There is no provision in the Judges Act as it is currently 
constituted for a federally appointed judge to be granted leave of 
absence without pay to work for an international organization such 
as the United Nations. Nor does the act permit the salary and 
expenses of a judge during the period of leave to be paid by any 
organization or entity other than the Government of Canada. The 
amendments contained in Bill C-42, which have the full support of 
the Canadian Judicial Council, would permit this type of 
arrangement to be entered into by Madam Justice Arbour, and 
should another appropriate occasion arise, by other Canadian 
judges.
<P>
	This bill makes other minor amendments. The bill transfers from 
cabinet to chief justices the authority to approve judicial leaves of 
absence of up to six months. This recommendation was made by 
the 1992 Triennial Commission on Judges' Salaries and Benefits 
and is endorsed by the Canadian Judicial Council. It allows a judge 
to request maternity or parental leave without having to seek 
cabinet approval.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-42 also recognizes the importance of the Court Martial 
Appeal Court of Canada by including the chief justice of that court 
on the membership of the Canadian Judicial Council. The 
requirements of the chief justice of the Court Martial Appeal Court 
arising out of the representational duties and functions that are 
inherent to that officer are also reflected in the bill which 
authorizes the payment of a modest representational allowance of 
up to $5,000 per year to the head of that court. The chief justices of 
the Courts of Appeal of the Yukon and Northwest Territories are 
being granted similar representational allowances.
<P>
	Bill C-42 would also permit the appointment of up to three 
judges Canada wide to the provincial courts of appeal which have 
been experiencing increasing workloads and backlogs over the past 
number of years.
<P>
	Finally, the bill corrects some technical errors and clarifies some 
ambiguous language in the Judges Act.
<P>
	Bill C-42 is a modest legislative measure but at the same time a 
significant one because it will permit a Canadian judge to respond 
to a request by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to take 
on an international assignment of the utmost importance to the 
world at large.
<P>
	I would respectfully urge all hon. members to approve the quick 
passage of amendments to the Judges Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Judges Act we are being urged to amend through Bill C-42 is based 
on sections 96 and 100 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which 
provided that the Canadian Parliament could create a general court 
of appeal for Canada, as well as appoint and pay superior court 
judges in every province.
<P>
	This law sets out the working conditions applying to the judges 
of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Court, the Tax Court 
of Canada, the appeal courts and the superior courts in each of the 
provinces. This law is like a collective agreement for federally 
appointed judges. It also establishes the Canadian Judicial Council, 
whose mandate is to make superior jurisdictions and the Canadian 
tax commission work better.
<P>
	Through this law, the legislative power exerts obvious control 
over the judiciary. It is the legislative power that decides how much 
judges should be paid, what pension and other benefits they should 
receive, how much leave they can take, and what activities they can 
participate in.
<P>
	We are being called on today to review some of the working 
conditions of federally appointed judges.
<P>
	Of course, this does not give the government any right to 
interfere in the judicial process as it has recently, unfortunately, by 
threatening the Chief Justice of the Federal Court himself to take 
away all files relating to war criminals and handing them over to 
the Supreme Court of Canada if the proceedings were not 
conducted more expeditiously.
<P>
	Judges appointed by the federal government must be able to 
perform their duties as their conscience dictates. In order to be 
independent, they need working relations where the executive 
branch does not have them over the barrel.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the main amendments. The existing 
legislation allows the provinces to create seven positions as judges 
in addition to the number prescribed by law for each province as 
well as for the Yukon and the territories. The proposed change to 
the applicable provision would introduce a degree of flexibility by 
giving the provinces the power to appoint more judges.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to increase the number of additional 
judges from seven to ten. The provinces will be able to avail 
themselves of this provision as required. It seems reasonable to us, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4035"> 4035 </A></B>
<P>
given that how fast cases go to trial and how much work each judge 
has to do is dependent on the number of judges.
<P>
	Several amendments are simply designed to clarify the wording 
of certain sections without changing the scope of the legislation. 
Let me give you an example. Subsection 27(2) of the existing 
legislation states that each judge of the Yukon Territory and of the 
Northwest Territories ``who is in receipt of a salary under section 
22'' shall be paid an allowance, while in the amendment, reference 
is made to the act instead of to section 22 specifically.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	This amendment was necessary because additional judges are 
not paid under section 22, but under sections 28 and 29. As you can 
see, we are really talking about technical details. However, it was 
clearly not the legislator's intention to deprive additional judges of 
this isolation allowance.
<P>
	A new paragraph provides that, from now on, only a leave of 
absence of more than six months will require the approval of the 
governor in council. Currently, a leave of absence of more than one 
month requires the authorization of the government. This provision 
gives more independence to the courts vis-à-vis the executive 
power.
<P>
	In light of the fact that an assistant deputy minister recently 
interfered with the judicial process by contacting the Chief Justice 
of the Federal Court, we understand the need to ensure greater 
administrative autonomy to the judiciary. We must make sure 
judges do not have to beg as regards their working conditions, so 
that they do not feel at the mercy of the executive. We support this 
measure.
<P>
	The most innovative provision in this bill is undoubtedly the 
possibility for judges to now participate, with the authorization of 
the government, in international activities.
<P>
	Until now, judges had to devote themselves exclusively to their 
judicial duties. Indeed, section 56 of the Judges Act provides that: 
``No judge shall, either directly or indirectly, for himself or others, 
engage in any occupation or business other than his judicial duties, 
but every judge shall devote himself exclusively to those judicial 
duties''.
<P>
	There exists, furthermore, a tradition requiring judges to avoid 
involvement in situations that could oblige them to take a stand in 
public.
<P>
	It is therefore a departure from our legal tradition to allow judges 
to take part in international activities. They should, however, 
obtain prior approval for leave of absence without pay, but they 
may receive remuneration from an international organization.
<P>
	We believe that this new avenue will be of benefit to the 
international community. It will give Canada an opportunity to 
share its savoir-faire, to demonstrate its  abilities to an international 
audience, without detracting from the impartiality of our courts.
<P>
	For judges, this bill increases the possibility of an international 
career in the context of international co-operation projects, and in 
the creation and operation of international tribunals. Justice is 
called upon to cross borders. Many crimes cannot be effectively 
combatted except through international bodies and co-operation 
between countries.
<P>
	If our judges cannot participate in projects involving more than 
one country, Canada may find itself left out of certain debates, in 
particular those affecting the development of international law and 
the creation of international law tribunals. It is also an opportunity 
for our judges to acquire in other countries knowledge and abilities 
that could enrich our own institutions.
<P>
	We are in favour of this bill primarily because it will increase the 
independence of judges and their exposure to the international 
context.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak in support of Bill C-42 which amends the Judges Act.
<P>
	Bill C-42 sets out the terms on which Canadian judges can 
participate in international activities, international technical 
assistance programs and/or the work of international organizations.
<P>
	Although the bill does not specifically say so, it would appear 
that these amendments to the Judges Act are to assist Madam 
Justice Louise Arbour. Madam Justice Louise Arbour is to take up 
her appointment to the United Nations team prosecuting war 
crimes in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda.
<P>
	Chief justices are granted the authority to extend leaves of 
absence to their judges for periods of up to six months. In situations 
such as Judge Arbour's, the governor in council's approval is 
necessary as her appointment will be for longer than six months. 
Bill C-42 will simply ensure that Madam Justice Arbour, and 
similar appointments for longer than six months, will not require 
governor in council approval.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	The Judges Act does not clearly stipulate who is responsible for 
the remuneration of UN appointed judges. Bill C-42 does clearly 
designate the UN as the payer of Judge Arbour's salary and 
similarly appointed judges' salaries during the time of their UN 
appointments.
<P>
	I am confident most Canadians would agree that it should be the 
responsibility of the UN to pay such salaries. Canadians, in my 
opinion, would be agreeable to providing legal expertise to the UN 
but not additional financial support. Therefore they would be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4036"> 4036 </A></B>
<P>
opposed to paying the moving expenses and other reasonable travel 
expenses of UN appointed judges as outlined in Bill C-42.
<P>
	The UN or other international bodies which second Canadian 
justices should be fully responsible for all moving and travel costs 
associated with the appointment. We will be introducing an 
amendment during report stage of Bill C-42 in this regard.
<P>
	On March 6 of this year the Liberal government amended the 
Judges Act through Bill C-2. Madam Justice Arbour's appointment 
by the United Nations occurred in February 1996. Bill C-2 was 
introduced and passed therefore subsequent to Arbour's 
appointment. I question why the government did not incorporate 
the Bill C-42 changes into Bill C-2. Another bill, Bill C-48, is soon 
to be before the House and proposes additional changes to the 
Judges Act.
<P>
	Bills C-2, C-42 and C-48 may streamline administrative matters 
pertaining to judges, alleviating some judges' preoccupation with 
bureaucratic concerns and allowing them to get on with the real 
task at hand: ensuring that justice is served; ensuring that convicted 
criminals serve time which is proportionate to the severity of their 
crimes. These bills, really nebulous and inconsequential pieces of 
legislation, will be of little real significance to Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians do not really applaud the minister's initiatives in this 
regard. Canadians' primary concerns are not with these 
administrative justice matters. What Canadians really care about is 
their personal security and that of their families. These 
administrative changes we are spending our time debating today 
will do nothing to protect Canadians from the murderers, rapists 
and other sadistic criminals who roam our streets and enter our 
homes.
<P>
	Canadians want substantive change within the justice system. 
They want pieces of legislation that do something to enhance 
public safety. They want a bill which repeals section 745 of the 
Criminal Code, not legislation which merely tinkers with that 
betraying section of the Criminal Code which allows convicted 
first degree murderers the opportunity for early release.
<P>
	Canadians want first degree murderers' right to a parole 
eligibility hearing after serving only 15 years of their 25 year 
sentence to be completely abolished. Canadians do not want the 
minister giving killers even a faint glimmer of hope. They want 
killers behind bars and they want them there for at least 25 years, 
not 15 years, not 20 years. Canadians overwhelmingly want 
murderers behind bars for the full length of their life sentence.
<P>
	Canadians also want dangerous offender legislation brought in 
by the Minister of Justice and they want the minister to end 
statutory release. The minister has promised to bring in an omnibus 
bill which would encompass these two initiatives, an initiative 
which would significantly enhance public safety. We have yet to 
see  such a bill. Instead we have these three insignificant 
administrative bills.
<P>
	The Liberal government's failure to make our homes and streets 
safer is evident in its lenient justice legislation which has done 
more to threaten public safety than it has to enhance it. Bill C-37, 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act, is a prime example of 
this failure. The government failed to amend the act in accordance 
with Canadians' frustration with youth violence and frustration 
with Liberal justice leniency.
<P>
	Reform believes the age limits covered by the YOA should be 
changed. We recommend lowering the YOA age definition of a 
young person to 10 to 15 years of age from 12 to 17. This is in 
recognition of the fact that there are offenders under 12 years of age 
who currently slip through the system and go on to be full-fledged 
youth criminals because the justice system cannot deal with them. 
This was very evident a few weeks ago in Toronto. An 11-year old 
boy with accomplices aged 10, 13 and 15 abducted and raped a 
13-year old girl. This young offender was well known to the police 
who had on more than one occasion picked him up. This well 
known juvenile criminal taunted police with the fact that they could 
not charge him.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals believe that 10 and 11-year-olds should not be held 
accountable for their criminal actions. If the Liberal government 
had heeded our well-founded advice and amended the YOA under 
Bill C-37 to include 10 and 11-year-olds, there may well have been 
one less rape victim in the city of Toronto. One more young person 
may not have been so brutally traumatized.
<P>
	Our amendment to the YOA to include 10 and 11-year-olds is 
supported by the Canadian Police Association and Victims of 
Violence.
<P>
	The Liberal government does not believe that 16 and 
17-year-olds are mature enough to accept full responsibility for 
their criminal actions. We believe that youths aged 16 and 17 are 
old enough to assume full responsibility for their crimes and 
therefore in all cases of violent crime they should be tried in adult 
court.
<P>
	The reverse onus provisions contained in Bill C-37 place the 
onus on the young offender to demonstrate why he or she should 
not be tried in adult court. The court will have the discretion to 
accept or reject the application, all at a tremendous cost financially 
and resource-wise to the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Even if the 16 or 17-year old is tried in adult court, they will not 
receive an adult sentence. Anyone under the age of 18 convicted of 
first degree murder and sentenced to life can be paroled in between 
five and ten years. Anyone under the age of 18 convicted of second 
degree murder and sentenced to life can be paroled after only a 
maximum of seven years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4037"> 4037 </A></B>
<P>
	This Liberal government, which professes to be making our 
streets and homes safer and to be improving our justice system, 
is responsible for the reduction in the parole eligibility of second 
degree murderers under the age of 18 from a maximum of 10 to 
only 7 years.
<P>
	The Liberals believe that the publishing of young offenders' 
names must be prevented by law. Their priority is the protection of 
the offender. Reformers believe that the only way to truly make our 
streets safer is by removing the extra privacy and secrecy 
provisions of the YOA. YOA records should be accessible and the 
names of violent young offenders should be published. Our priority 
is the protection of society, not the protection of criminals.
<P>
	The Liberal government has continually placed the rights of the 
offender ahead of the rights of the victim. Under Bill C-37 it 
continues to emphasize rehabilitation, not victim compensation.
<P>
	We believe that the sentencing of young offenders must 
emphasize victim compensation, community service, skills 
training, education and deterrence to others. Opportunities for 
rehabilitation must be emphasized in a disciplined environment.
<P>
	We believe that parents of young offenders should be held 
legally and financially responsible for the criminal actions of their 
children if evidence clearly shows that they have not made a 
reasonable effort to exercise parental control. Despite 
overwhelming support for this amendment to the YOA, the Liberal 
government maintains Canadian parents should not be held 
responsible.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is another example of the government's failure to make 
our streets and homes safer. In Bill C-41 the Liberal government 
introduced alternative measures, which is its answer to the 
overcrowding in Canadian prisons. Although in some cases 
alternatives to prison may be acceptable, we are opposed to the 
system outlined in Bill C-41, as is the Canadian Police Association, 
because it does not stipulate what offences are to be part of the 
alternative measures program.
<P>
	Nowhere in the bill did the Liberal government define 
alternative measures, nor did it stipulate the limitations to be 
imposed on the use of alternative measures. This leaves far too 
much discretion to the courts to interpret what is meant by this 
portion of Bill C-41. This could lead to an abusive use of 
alternatives to prison, particularly in areas of the country where 
prisons are overcrowded or there are backlogs in the courts. 
Potentially, violent offenders could walk. Does this provide safer 
communities and safer streets? I do not think so.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-45 is another example of Liberal leniency. Under this bill 
the Liberal government, despite our strong opposition, chose to 
continue allowing violent  offenders back on the streets before 
serving their full sentences. We propose that all violent criminals 
must receive full term sentences. Statutory release, conditional 
release or parole must not be given to violent offenders.
<P>
	We also proposed that offenders who commit another offence 
while on parole must serve the remaining time of the original 
sentence and then full term for the second offence. The Liberals 
defeated our amendment. The government defeated a safer 
measure despite its claim it is making our streets and homes safer.
<P>
	We also proposed that when the parole board grants parole to 
violent offenders and that offender commits another violent crime 
while on parole, an inquiry be held into the original decision of the 
board to release the offender. The Liberals defeated our 
amendment. The Liberal government defeated a proposal aimed 
solely at protecting the Canadian public.
<P>
	The justice legislation introduced by the Liberal government 
today clearly demonstrates that it has broken its promise to make 
our streets and homes safer. What further demonstrates this broken 
promise is the absence of legislation. The government, despite 
demands from all across Canada, including the police and victims 
of violence, has failed to repeal section 745. The Liberal 
government has also failed to bring in dangerous offender 
legislation. The evidence is clear that the Liberal government has 
failed to make Canadian streets and homes safe.
<P>
	We support Bill C-42 but we do not support the Liberal 
government's preoccupation with accommodating the growing 
justice industry while failing to more vigorously protect innocent 
victims and law-abiding Canadians.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a question on clause 1 and, in fact, on the entire bill, as I do not 
want to go back to every paragraph to ask the same question.
<P>
	What I would like to know is the total cost of this bill. Could the 
government tell us how much more will have to be spent on judges 
as a result of this bill?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, a 
number of provisions will add cost. First, in clause 1 three judges 
are being added to the judges pool for the courts of appeal for the 
provinces, two to fill B.C. court of appeal vacancies. The amount 
of that expense will be $200,000 per year per judge effective when 
the judges are appointed.
<P>
	With respect to the vacancy to be filled on the Ontario court of 
appeal there will be no immediate cost there until after the return of 
Madam Justice Arbour.
<P>
	There are a number of other provisions. The chief justices of the 
Yukon and the Northwest Territories courts of appeal now will be 
entitled to representational allowances. These two individuals will 
receive $5,000 a year each. In addition, the chief justices of the 
courts of appeal and the court martial appeal court are to receive a 
$5,000 allowance.
<P>
	An error was discovered in the legislation which at one time did 
not allow judges in certain instances to get their expenses. This has 
been cleaned up, but that will not be an additional cost to the 
government.
<P>
	I think that is the bulk of the expense with respect to this 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Shall clause 1 carry?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	On Clause 5:
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, as 
I mentioned in my intervention on this bill, there is some concern 
that the bill does not clarify that the international bodies seconding 
our judges will be fully responsible for all reasonable moving and 
travel costs associated with the appointments.
<P>
	Therefore, to ensure that international bodies will be responsible 
for these costs, I would like to propose an amendment to clause 5. I 
move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-42 in clause 5 be amended by replacing lines 20 and 21 on page 4 
with the following: ``reasonable travel and other expenses from an 
international''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Before I give the floor to the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, I am of the view 
that the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Calgary 
North is in order. I ask the parliamentary secretary to make his 
remarks and intervention respecting the amendment.
<P>
	Let me just verify a point with the Table once more. I should like 
to hear what the hon. parliamentary secretary might add to the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, 
with respect to the amendment being proposed by the hon. member, 
clause 5 contains within it sufficient authorization for the judge to 
receive payment for the reasonable expenses which are the subject 
of her motion.
<P>
	In my view the amendment is redundant. In addition, however, it 
was my understanding that all parties had agreed that we would 
take all necessary steps to pass the legislation today without 
amendment. In any event, the provision the hon. member seeks to 
bring forward is covered by the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Chairman, it would appear that the lines to 
be replaced in the amendment are lines 15 and 16 on page 4. I will 
give a copy to the hon. parliamentary secretary. I apologize to him. 
I did not anticipate that we would be dealing with it right now, but I 
will make sure he sees a copy of it.

	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (for the Minister of Justice, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-48, an act to amend the Federal Court Act, the 
Judges Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
address the House today on Bill C-48, an act to amend the Federal 
Court Act, the Judges Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	Under the Judges Act, judges of provincial superior courts and 
appellate courts may be appointed from applicants who have at 
least 10 years at the bar or as provincial court judges. However 
under the Federal Court Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act 
eligibility for appointment to each of these two courts is limited to 
persons who have 10 years at the bar or who are already federally 
appointed judges.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Since the time served as a provincially appointed judge does not 
count toward eligibility for appointment to the federal court or the 
tax court as it does for appointments to the provincial, superior and 
appellate courts, this historic anomaly effectively disqualifies from  
appointment to these two courts any provincial court judge 
notwithstanding his or her extremely high qualifications who had 
practised law for less than 10 years prior to his or her appointment 
to the provincial court.
<P>
	There is no legal or policy reason for so limiting the 
appointments to the federal court or the tax court in this way. 
Furthermore, in all three acts time spent as a provincially or 
federally appointed judicial officer such as a master or superior 
court registrar during which the applicant's membership in the bar 
may have been in abeyance also does not count toward the 10-year 
eligibility requirement for the appointment to the provincial, 
superior and appellate courts, the federal court and the tax court.
<P>
	Bill C-48 would amend all three acts to make the appointment 
eligibility requirements consistent. Once these amendments are in 
effect, time spent either as a lawyer, a provincially or federally 
appointed judicial officer or a provincially or federally appointed 
judge would count toward the 10 years at the bar requirement for 
appointment to any federally appointed court, with the exception of 
the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	For the supreme court it would continue to be the case that only 
lawyers of 10 years standing or provincial superior court judges 
would be eligible for appointment.
<P>
	The amendments to the Federal Court Act and the Tax Court of 
Canada Act are being given retrospective effect so as to place the 
validity of the appointment of a judge appointed in 1990 and 
another appointed in 1995 beyond any possible doubt regardless of 
how one interprets the provincial laws governing the status of those 
judges continuing membership in the bar while they were 
provincial judges.
<P>
	That is all Bill C-48 does. It is a very simple bill with a very 
limited technical objective. I urge all hon. members to pursue quick 
passage.
<P>
	I ask at this time for unanimous consent for the House to take all 
necessary steps to pass and adopt the bill expeditiously today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The parliamentary secretary 
has asked for unanimous consent of the House to move the 
legislation forward today at all stages.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to confirm that we will in fact

comment, or can I simply ask if there is unanimous consent to 
proceed at all stages?
<P>

do not oppose the process of passing it through all stages today.

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, quite 
honestly, as for having a great debate on a piece of legislation that 
simply changes the number of years a judge must sit before being 
eligible for the federal court or the tax court of Canada, I really 
could not bring myself to make Parliament or our electors foot the 
bill for such a thing.
<P>
	However, I will say that I would like to add a really minor 
amendment, but only we study the bill in the committee of the 
whole.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are discussing Bill C-48, an act to amend the Federal Court Act, the 
Judges Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act. This is the third piece 
of legislation brought before the House since February of this year 
dealing with amendments to the Judges Act. I have to question why 
the government is making all of these piecemeal changes instead of 
bringing in one bill to satisfy all the administrative and technical 
changes it feels are necessary.
<P>
	This bill has been brought in specifically to correct a situation 
where the justice minister appointed a provincial court judge from 
British Columbia to the Federal Court. On November 29, 1995 the 
justice minister appointed Douglas Campbell of the provincial 
court, criminal division, in Vancouver to the Federal Court of 
Canada. The legislation at the time permitted any judge of a 
superior county or district court to be appointed to the Federal 
Court, but Judge Campbell was a judge of the provincial court. We 
are therefore debating a technical amendment to the Federal Court 
Act to deal with this oversight.
<P>
	It is a technical amendment, since the current legislation also 
includes provisions that a barrister or advocate who has been at the 
bar of a province for at least 10 years is also eligible for an 
appointment. Therefore, while Judge Campbell was not from the 
proper judge pool, he did in fact have the necessary years of 
experience to qualify.
<P>
	At the Reform Party's national assembly, which was held in 
Vancouver two weekends ago, the delegates voted 75 per cent in 
favour of the following resolution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Resolve that the Reform Party supports dissolving the current system of 
appointing federal judges and replacing it with a democratic and accountable 
method.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We feel that political patronage in the appointment of judges has 
been an albatross around the necks of Canadians for years and that 
it has to stop. Only with a more transparent appointment process 
can Canadians be satisfied that the integrity of our justice system is 
protected.
<P>
	For the reasons I have mentioned, the Reform Party will not be 
supporting Bill C-48. We believe it is time to de-politicize the 
appointment process in putting men and women on the benches of 
the courts of our land. This cannot be achieved until the process is 
open and accountable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?

have just said, I did not speak on this, I did not take the time 
allocated to me because I simply wanted have the time to propose 
an amendment.
<P>
	Bill C-48 has our agreement in principle, we agree that certain 
technical details do, of course, have to be modified, but if changes 
are going to be made, I feel it would be worthwhile to add my 
amendment. I shall speak of it now and provide you with the 
written copy immediately afterwards.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 1, page 1, line 18, be amended by the addition of the following 
paragraph:</BLOCKQUOTE>

Chambre des notaires du Québec.''</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4041"> 4041 </A></B>
<P>
	This would simply make notaries eligible to become Federal 
Court judges, which I feel would be a matter of equity. This is 
something the Quebec notaries have long been calling for, and our 
having a Civil Code and not the Common Law is no reason we 
ought not to have the right to have judges from the Chambre des 
notaires. That is the reason I am proposing this amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Colleagues, on a prima facie basis it 
would appear that this amendment is in order. I would ask the hon. 
parliamentary secretary who is seeking the floor for his comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
would suggest that the proposed amendment is out of order.
<P>
	Section 98 of the Constitution requires that judges of the courts 
of Quebec be selected from the bar of the province. Notaries are not 
members of the bar of the province. Therefore it would not be 
possible to put forward such an amendment.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to what the hon. 
parliamentary secretary just said, perhaps I should point out that 
the charter of rights and freedoms certainly does not encourage 
discriminating against notaries to favour lawyers.
<P>
	I think that, if the idea is to make this a constitutional or charter 
issue, it is up to the hon. members to decide whether they want to 
do so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would ask the indulgence of the 
Chair to consult.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> If there are no other discussions, I am 
prepared to rule on the amendment by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert. I thank both her and the parliamentary secretary for 
their interventions.
<P>
	I would submit to the committee that the arguments, while they 
were of a legal and constitutional nature, my ruling is based on 
procedural matters and that in fact the amendment is in order. It 
does not go beyond the scope of the bill and it does not add any 
charge. Therefore, the amendment is acceptable and I will accept 
debate on the amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am sorry, but I cannot recognize the hon. member on debate, as 
she is he one who introduced the amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Chairman, I will make my point with respect to 
the amendment very quickly. The government will not be 
supporting the amendment. As I indicated before, the amendment 
is, in the government's view, unconstitutional.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, it 
seems, in looking at the merits of this amendment, that it does fly 
in the face of section 98 of the Constitution. Also, if the argument 
is that notaries are being discriminated against because they cannot 
be elevated to the bar, it seems one could make the same argument 
that engineers, nurses or housekeepers are being discriminated 
against because they cannot be named to the bench. This seems to 
be carrying discrimination to rather far-fetched extremes.
<P>
	In view of the clear wording of section 98, I believe it would be 
in order to reject this amendment.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that, in introducing this kind of amendment, the 
hon. member for Saint-Hubert was trying to make it very clear that 
there is currently some discrimination, and the comparison made 
by the previous speaker between a nursing program and a medicine 
program is not valid, since, in one case, the program does not 
necessarily lead to university degree.
<P>
	As for law, I think all the hon. members must realize that a 
bachelor's degree is required and that future lawyers all undergo 
the same training for three years. This means that, if each of us here 
picked at random and visited any law faculty, whether at 
l'Université de Montréal or at any other university in Quebec, we 
would find future notaries attending classes alongside future 
lawyers. The hon. member for Outremont should know, since he is 
himself a lawyer. The core curriculum, including securities theory 
and constitutional law, is the same for all three years.
<P>
	I think it would be interesting if those who oppose the official 
opposition's amendment told us why a person with legal training, 
training identical to that of notaries except for the last year of the 
bar, should be authorized to deliver judgment from the bench or to 
practice law by joining the judicial branch.
<P>
	I think that the hon. member for Saint-Hubert is right and I know 
she is sensitive to any form of discrimination. We must fight side 
by side. I think that the hon. member for Saint-Hubert is right to 
say that the government would fail miserably if it had to pass the 
discrimination test under the Charter, as it intends to perpetuate 
discrimination by rejecting this amendment.

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am confused by the arguments 
being presented by the Bloc members opposite.
<P>
	The reason I am confused about the hon. member's amendment 
is that the request that is being made is for the appointment of a 
judge to a tax court. Where we have to draw from the pool and the 
pool has to be drawn from the pool of lawyers, constitutionally it 
says that judges of the courts of Quebec shall be selected from the 
bar of that province. It behoves me to understand where the Bloc 
would not be siding on a rule of law that is stated in the 
Constitution and a rule of law that is stated in the province of 
Quebec where it says the judges of the courts of Quebec shall be 
selected from the bar of that province. Notaries are not members of 
the bar.
<P>
	The Bloc opposition is trying to mix apples and oranges. We are 
not talking about a constitutional correction. We are talking about 
where the pool is being drawn from. The pool is being drawn from 
the bar of the province and notaries are not members of that bar.
<P>
	Why hold us to something that is law in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> While committee of the whole 
procedures are a little different, I wonder if the member for St.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise for debate on 
this bill which incorporates amendments to the Railway Safety 
Act. We on this side of the House believe this will be a very useful 
piece of legislation and we propose that the bill be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Transport before second reading.
<P>
	The Railway Safety Act is a relatively new piece of legislation 
which came into effect in January 1988. As is often the case with 
new legislation, the act required that a statutory review of its 
provisions be undertaken five years after coming into force. Such a 
review was carried out in 1994. The report of the committee that 
reviewed the Railway Safety Act was tabled in this House on 
February 15, 1995 and the government moved very quickly with a 
response which was tabled on June 8, 1995.
<P>
	I am happy to say that the review found Canadian railways to 
have a good safety record when compared with other modes of 
transportation and when compared with other countries. On page 
16 of its final report, the committee concluded that ``railways in 
Canada operate safely. On the basis of numerous evaluative 
measurements and comparisons with other nations and modes of 
transportation, the railway mode is an extremely safe means of 
moving freight and people in this country''. The committee also 
indicated in its report that the ``work related safety of railways and 
the manner in which their operations are carried out have clearly 
shown improvement''.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The committee looked at the statutory structure and emphasized 
that the underlying principles of the Railway Safety Act remain 
valid and these key principles can be summarized as: one, the 
government sets the standards; two, railway companies decide how 
to meet these standards; and three, government monitors for 
compliance and enforces where necessary.
<P>
	The changes made with the passage of the Railway Safety Act in 
1988 were significant in that they marked a deviation from the old 
command and control approach to railway regulation that had been 
the norm until that time. I am pleased that the review committee 
confirmed that this enlightened approach to regulation is very 
appropriate.
<P>
	The committee made a number of recommendations for 
improving the railway safety regime in Canada. The amendments 
before the House represent the legislative changes that are required 
to implement many of those recommendations.
<P>
	Let us address the consultative process. Last summer Transport 
Canada carried out extensive consultations on the form of the 
legislative amendments. An industry group was established with 
representation from the railways, railway labour, the Canada Safety 
Council and  the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to review 
the various proposals.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that the parties worked diligently and 
achieved consensus. There was a high degree of unanimity on 
safety matters and the various views expressed are reflected in 
these particular amendments. Of course there was not complete 
unanimity, but this was an excellent opportunity for all points of 
view to be aired and to resolve many, many of the differences.
<P>
	Our government has also discussed these amendments with 
provincial representatives who made a number of suggestions. 
These suggestions have been incorporated into the amendments.
<P>
	The amendments to the Railway Safety Act that are being 
proposed cover the majority of the recommendations put forward 
by the review committee. One of the key amendments relates to the 
problem of train whistling in communities. The whistle is an 
important safety feature but it can be very disruptive for people 
who live close to a railway line. We are probably all familiar with 
some of our constituents who have approached us on this issue.
<P>
	The government's proposal, which was endorsed by municipal 
representatives from across the country, is as follows: Where a 
municipality has passed a motion and where the location meets 
Transport Canada conditions for whistling cessation, the trains 
would be required to cease whistling. I believe this is a workable 
solution to what has been a very difficult problem.
<P>
	Railway highway crossings contribute to the greatest number of 
rail related accidents, deaths and injuries. The review 
recommended that Transport Canada prepare a plan aimed at 
reducing the number of crossing accidents by 50 per cent within 10 
years.
<P>
	There are a number of items that will require additional 
legislative powers and these are included in the proposed 
amendments. They include measures to promote crossing closures 
as well as to control the way in which key crossings are used.
<P>
	A number of the more technical amendments will streamline the 
regulatory process and reduce bureaucratic burden. They will 
reduce government involvement in unproductive areas but will 
allow government to continue to cover the essential items.
<P>
	It should be noted that some of the recommendations, such as 
those relating to branch line abandonment, have already been 
covered through the Canada Transportation Act, Bill C-14.
<P>
	A number of the recommendations, particularly those relating to 
co-ordination with provinces, grade crossing improvements and 
studying the effects of train whistle cessation at crossings do not 
require legislation and Transport Canada is already working to find 
a solution to these.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4044"> 4044 </A></B>
<P>
	The Railway Safety Act has fostered consultation between all 
parties that have an interest in safety. A number of other 
legislative changes will streamline the regulatory process and 
provide even greater involvement of railway labour in the 
development of new rules.
<P>
	The review committee recommended that the statutory 
framework be changed so that the railways could propose 
performance standards and a comprehensive safety plan, both of 
which would be approved by Transport Canada. Once again these 
proposals will permit this to take place.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	We are also taking this opportunity to revise and update railway 
security provisions. Problems can arise from terrorist acts and 
occurrences such as bomb threats. We do not see these as 
significant threats to the railway system at present. This therefore 
is the time when we should take care to ensure that we have the 
right statutory underpinning should such powers be necessary in 
the future.
<P>
	The security provisions in the legislation have been recast using 
our model, the Marine Transportation Security Act, a most recent 
piece of security legislation. We hope these provisions will not be 
necessary, but we are happy we will have them in place as a good 
basic foundation should such measures become necessary in the 
future.
<P>
	Finally let us examine the broader aspects of the legislation. The 
review of railway safety concluded that our railways have a good 
safety record and that we have reason for confidence in the 
regulatory regime. When dealing with a topic such as safety, 
however, we must be diligent. We must continually be seeking 
better ways to do things. We should always strive to improve our 
record.
<P>
	The government has taken a number of steps to revitalize 
Canada's rail sector, such as the privatization of the Canadian 
National last year. These initiatives will go a long way toward 
strengthening Canada's transportation infrastructure and 
establishing a sound base to carry our railways well into the next 
century.
<P>
	However and in spite of these changes the government will 
continue to place emphasis on the most important aspect of all: 
safety. We will continue to be diligent where safety is concerned. 
The proposed changes before the House today will streamline and 
improve the legislative base for railway safety in the years to come.
<P>
	I therefore urge all my hon. colleagues in this place to support 
the legislation and agree to refer the bill to committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-43, an act 
to amend the Railway Safety Act and to make a consequential 
amendment to another Act.
<P>
	I would love to share the optimism of the parliamentary 
secretary. Unfortunately, certain statistics tell me that, while this 
bill seeks to correct certain significant technical flaws and while 
the official opposition may help improve it during the review by 
the committee, some major issues linger with regard to railway 
safety in Canada.
<P>
	Let me give you a few figures. In 1994, a total of 1,189 accidents 
were reported to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. That 
was 17 per cent more than in 1993. There was a net increase of 8 
per cent in the accident rate, which climbed to 14,4 accidents per 
million of train-miles travelled.
<P>
	Then there is the fact that most accidents on main lines occur at 
level crossings. This suggests that improvements could be made, 
and that human or technical errors are often to blame.
<P>
	It is also reported that, each year, some 300 accidents involve 
transporter cars. Worse still is the fact that, in 1994, 114 people 
died in train accidents. These figures make us realize that the 
situation is much more worrying than the government would lead 
us to believe.
<P>
	Some of the objectives of the bill are to: ``provide for greater 
involvement by interested organizations in making rules about 
railway operations; provide for the regulation of the use of train 
whistles in municipalities; strengthen and clarify provisions 
dealing with railway security''. No major initiatives are taken to 
correct existing problems.
<P>
	The government's good intention to tackle the issue should be 
reflected in amendments to the bill that would give it more 
substance and to face the real issues relating to railway safety.
<P>
	The bill is silent on a very real problem, particularly in Quebec. 
They say there are 3 to 10 times as many defects in the tracks 
located in Quebec, because they are older and less well maintained, 
a result of the available resources and the fact that rail has long 
been considered a sort of homespun way of travel and not given the 
chance to become a tool of development. Today, we are paying the 
price for this.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	To add insult to injury, it has just been announced that the 
Charny maintenance shop, in the riding of my colleague from 
Lévis, is to be closed. The job loss is regrettable. True, 90 jobs in 
such a region is not all that significant, but on top of that there is 
the significant impact on safety, since now the only track 
maintenance shop for the whole of eastern Canada will be located 
in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
<P>
	Imagine, then, that on the CN lines in Quebec there are 51 
defects per 65 miles, or 100 km of track, and on the CP lines 31 for 
the same 65 miles or 100 kilometres. Yet these figures are not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4045"> 4045 </A></B>
<P>
likely to improve in future because, as well as not having 
maintained the track properly, now they are moving the people with 
responsibility for maintenance further away, and their territory is 
being increased still further. This is tantamount to abdicating from 
any responsibility for safety.
<P>
	The federal government must be judged clearly by the public on 
this. Yes, it is entitled to want to propose choices, to privatize 
companies. It is entitled to make those choices. We are entitled to 
judge the choices, or the way they were made, as the right ones or 
not, but there is one thing that must not be sloughed off: the 
responsibility for safety.
<P>
	In this connection, Bill C-43 really contains no measures for 
dealing with the situation, or for improving it to any significant 
extent. A major debate needs to be held. There are, for example, 
newspaper reports stating that the Transportation Safety Board of 
Canada contradicts the CN on the number of accidents, yet this is 
the body responsible for providing a true picture of the situation 
and it is also less in conflict of interest than the companies 
operating the railways.
<P>
	Questions will have to be asked in committee as to why the 
statistics I have just given you have not been able to be improved, 
and what should be done in future to remedy the situation. We are 
told that the number of railway accidents has been constantly on 
the increase for the past five years. This again comes from the 
Transportation Safety Board. They arrived in February 1996, when 
two derailments had just occurred in the Quebec City region within 
two weeks.
<P>
	There is regularly talk about accidents, every month, as I 
mentioned in talking about level crossings earlier, for example. So 
clearly we have to look a lot deeper at the Railway Safety Act than 
the government is doing. At the moment, we could say it is doing 
nothing more than fulfilling its obligation to review the Act every 
five years. Review does not just mean simply making technical 
changes. The point of the review is to ensure that our railway 
system is the best it can be. If we have in fact under-used and 
under-maintained the rail systems in Quebec and Canada, we must 
ensure today, with the vision we want for our system, that we take 
every means possible to remedy the situation.
<P>
	Railway transportation was declining 10 or 15 years ago. Today, 
it is on the rise with the use of containers. Furthermore, VIA Rail 
for one is trying to revitalize operations and must therefore break 
the vicious circle in which rail transportation is not used because it 
is inefficient and because it is inefficient less money is allocated to 
its operation and maintenance. The end result is poor service that 
fails to meet the needs of the people.
<P>
	It will therefore be important, when this bill is being studied in 
committee-because the government has decided to go directly to 
committee rather than do an  in-depth analysis at second 
reading-to study it thoroughly. There will be experts of different 
sorts, no
<P>
doubt employees who know something about such things. I think 
they should enjoy a certain impunity in committee, so that we get at 
the truth, can see things as they are, can propose amendments and 
make relevant changes.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	This way, when the law is next reviewed, perhaps in five years, 
we will be able to say results were achieved and the statistics, 
instead of increasing by 17 per cent, will be stable at least. We will 
have made it so that the cause of accidents will only be unexplained 
human error, and not the system, poor operation or an insufficient 
investment in prevention.
<P>
	In conclusion, the official opposition intends to be very vigilant 
and to ensure that our rail service operates totally safely for the 
welfare of individuals and for an improved economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I realize there is very little time before we vote. However I 
think it will be quite sufficient for what I have to say today.
<P>
	I listened to my colleague who just spoke. I am not in 
disagreement with the basic concepts he has raised. I look forward 
to the matter going to committee so that we can study it in depth.
<P>
	I find it very interesting that major rail bills like the privatization 
of CN Rail, a very big and very controversial bill, was not debated 
in the House at second reading. Instead it was forced by the Liberal 
government into committee before the debate took place.
<P>
	I objected to that at the time. I objected to it after the fact. All the 
rationales used by the government regarding why it should be 
rushed into committee fell by the wayside.
<P>
	Today we have something that does not have the impact of 
something like the privatization of half of Canada's national rail 
system. We find ourselves debating it in the House of Commons in 
the last week of Parliament, in the dying hours. We are even using 
extended hours to debate the bill.
<P>
	Why is the government trying to tie up the House of Commons 
and members of Parliament? House employees and staff are 
working overtime, costing something in the range of $50,000 an 
hour. That amount is charged to the taxpayers so that we can debate 
sending legislation to a committee before Parliament rises for the 
summer, and the committee the bill will go to is not meeting until 
next fall.
<P>
	It is a horrendous waste of the taxpayers' money. Why is the 
government wasting the time of the House debating bills like this 
one instead of getting on with important  bills, if it has any to bring 
forward? Is the government simply stalling until its absolutely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4046"> 4046 </A></B>
<P>
unconstitutional Bill C-28 comes once again back from the Senate? 
Is it just trying to find excuses to hang on until then?
<P>
	There are problems with the bill that we can deal with in 
committee. I will recommend to our party that we give tentative 
support to the bill going to committee, at which time we will see 
what concerns are brought forward by the public, the users, the rail 
companies and those involved with them; what amendments are 
offered both by the government and by opposition; and what is 
done with them. Then we will make our final decision to support or 
not support the bill when it comes back to the House and will have 
a purpose for being before the House.
<P>
	I hope the government will move on if it has something 
substantial. If it is worth paying $50,000 an hour in taxpayers' 
money to keep the House running in overtime, the government 
should bring it forward. If it does not have anything it should have 
the decency to say so and to adjourn the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is every indication 
there are other members who wish to participate in the debate. I am 
somewhat reluctant to give the floor to someone to speak for all of 
one minute.
<P>
	Therefore I ask the House for unanimous consent to call it 5.30

members' hour. Does the House give its consent to calling it 5.30

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAELECTIONSACT">CANADA ELECTIONS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-276, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act (registration 
of political parties), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to address this issue 
again. It was discussed on September 27, 1994 in a similar bill 
which called for changes to the Canada Elections Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4054"> 4054 </A></B>
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to amend the Canada Elections Act 
to allow registration of political parties by the chief electoral 
officer only when the party nominates a candidate in at least seven 
provinces that have in aggregate at least 50 per cent of the 
population of all the provinces and at least half of the electoral 
districts in each of those provinces.
<P>
	For democracy to work people have to participate. We had seven 
byelections a few months ago, five in the province of Quebec, one 
in Etobicoke North in metro Toronto and the other in 
Newfoundland. At that time the Bloc Quebecois, who are supposed 
to be the official opposition in this Parliament, declined to run 
candidates in Etobicoke North and Newfoundland because its 
agenda is not of national concern.
<P>
	Yesterday a byelection was held in Hamilton East. The Liberal 
candidate, Sheila Copps, won the riding. Again the official 
opposition did not put forward a candidate. By definition official 
opposition means a party waiting to form the next government if 
the government in power falls so it can start a new process, a new 
beginning, with its own party. But in this case the official 
opposition totally ignored the fact it represents constituents and 
those constituents have the right to be heard and to discuss the 
issues.
<P>
	On the other hand, the third party is the Reform Party with 
headquarters in Calgary. Its members claim it is a national party. 
Two weeks ago the Reform Party held a convention in Vancouver. 
Only 15 delegates from the province of Quebec showed up. The 
province of Quebec is 25 per cent of the population of Canada. 
Approximately seven million Canadians live in Quebec. However, 
only 15 people from Quebec went to the Reform national 
convention which had about 1,500 delegates. Only 1 per cent of the 
delegates at that convention were from Quebec.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a new party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> My colleague across the way says it is a new 
party. It has been around for nine years. How long is it going to be 
new? Its members sit in the House of Commons and claim they are 
the national opposition, and at the same time they claim they are a 
new party. There is no such thing as a new party.
<P>
	I go back to the Hamilton East election. They forced the deputy 
prime minister to resign and the Prime Minister called a byelection. 
What happened? Five hundred thousand dollars of taxpayers' 
money was spent to conform to Reform Party policies. The Reform 
Party spent $45,000 to promote their candidate. What happened? 
Their candidate got 2,688 votes only. If we divide 2,688 into the 
$45,000 they spent, it means they spent over $15 per vote of 
taxpayers' money for no reason at all.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	What happened to the Bloc Quebecois? It did not even bother 
putting up a candidate.
<P>
	I hope the House passes my motion. The last time the Reform 
and Bloc Quebecois ganged up to defeat this bill. They did not 
allow it to be votable because the leader of the Reform Party and 
Lucien Bouchard are two sides of the same coin. They are both 
regional parties. They both sang the same tune every day of the 
week for the last almost three years. They have been dividing the 
country through their regional interests and Canada as a nation 
cannot benefit from in this process.
<P>
	In the last election in 1993 there were 295 ridings. Thirteen 
political parties participated. All of them put candidates in each 
and every province, including Reform. It put candidates in all 
provinces except the province of Quebec. The Natural Law Party 
ran 451 candidates. Somehow Reform members do not accept the 
fact that they should become a national party and that is why they 
oppose my bill.
<P>
	Marxist-Leninist Party put forward 51 candidates. The Bloc 
Quebecois put up 75 candidates in one province, the province of 
Quebec, which qualifies them to be a national party. It won 54 seats 
and became the official opposition. The Reform Party complained 
and asked why does the official opposition have to be separatists. It 
claims to be federalist and with only one seat less than the Bloc 
Quebecois so Reform members believe they should be the official 
opposition.
<P>
	A party has to earn the title of being official opposition or 
national opposition. A party cannot be the official opposition or 
national opposition in this system if it is a separatist party or if it is 
a regional party.
<P>
	When my bill was before the House previously I mentioned in 
my speech that when I was running for the Liberal Party in Don 
Valley North I saw signs in my riding which said: ``We will run the 
country the way we run the campaign''. Reformers ran in the 
campaign without Quebec. They ignored Quebec totally. If this is 
how they are going to run the country, God save us from the 
Reformers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> You don't understand what the words mean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> I just read the sign I had in my riding which 
said: ``We are going to run the country the way we run the 
campaign'' and the way they ran the campaign was without 
Quebec.
<P>
	In my riding of Don Valley North people had no chance to say 
who is to be the official opposition. If the system is to work, 
Canadians from coast to coast must be given a chance to decide 
who is going to come here and in what capacity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4055"> 4055 </A></B>
<P>
	They voted massively for the Liberal Party. We formed the 
government and everybody is happy. The fact is 66 per cent of 
the population are voting yes after three years of our government 
policy.
<P>
	Nobody in my riding, in my province and in the nine other 
provinces ever had a chance to vote and say who is going to be the 
official opposition. This has to be changed. All Canadians from sea 
to sea have the same rights, the same obligations toward the 
country and toward each other.
<P>
	My motion addresses that issue. I know the Bloc Quebecois and 
the Reform Party ganged up in the committee. They would not 
allow this motion to be votable.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>

	I hope soon after this House is dissolved with our second 
election these people will come in with a low number. We will have 
a decent opposition party which is a national opposition to our 
government, to our party. They will change their minds and support 
this bill. We have to have a democracy that works, a democracy 
that flourishes and allows people to participate.
<P>
	The way it is, the people in Don Valley North are being denied 
the right to say who is to be the official opposition in this 
Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> They can elect whoever they want. They elected you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> They elected me to be on the government 
side and they elected the hon. member to be in the opposition the 
rest of his life. That is the problem. We will go into the year 2,000 
and again he will be in opposition. He is going to be less than what 
he is today.
<P>
	The hon. member reminds me-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The House 
will deal with one speaker at a time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Madam Speaker, what has happened to the 
Reform Party? It has come here. It has complained about our 
policies. It has destroyed whatever we have tried to build here. It 
says that it has to listen to the people, and what has happened? Let 
us listen to the people.
<P>
	There was a byelection in Hamilton. Reform got 10.1 per cent of 
the votes. After three years of knocking down our policies day in 
and day out, of ganging up with the Bloc Quebecois against us, if 
this is the best Reformers can do with 10.1 per cent, then the best 
thing that can happen to us is to keep the Reform Party and the Bloc 
the way they are so we can be the government into the next century.
<P>
	Let us put partisan issues aside. Let us help Canada to build a 
stronger democracy. Let us allow people a chance to participate, 
including the Reform Party and even the Bloc. The numbers may 
be too many as far as I am  concerned. Maybe five, six or ten will 
do the job so there will be a presence here. Basically that is what we 
should do.
<P>
	Those who wish to take advantage of the system have to 
participate. Every time they spend a penny in an election taxpayers 
of this land finance their campaign on the first $100 or $75 of each 
dollar. If that is the case then we should allow each and every 
Canadian to participate no matter where they come from, which 
party they belong to and whatever their origin. We should not send 
them to the back of the bus when they want to participate in this 
system.
<P>
	I would like to share my time with my hon. colleague from 
Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
after hearing the hon. member for Don Valley North, I feel like 
saying, as they do in criminal proceedings: I rest my case. But I 
will still say what I have to say.
<P>
	That a bill like this one can be introduced is not a major step 
forward for democracy. Let us calmly sum it up for those who 
would like to know what it is about. This bill would allow 
registration of a political party in Canada only if this party 
nominates candidates in at least half the ridings of seven Canadian 
provinces representing 50 per cent of the population.
<P>
	This is not a minimum, but a mountain. Especially since the hon. 
member knows full well that the Bloc Quebecois, the official 
opposition, only nominates candidates in Quebec. As a result, there 
is no way we could comply with the provisions of this bill. As 
everyone knows, the Bloc Quebecois' goal is to promote Quebec 
sovereignty, a mandate given to us by the people of Quebec. It 
would be surprising, to say the least, if there were a Bloc Quebecois 
candidate in the riding of Beauséjour or Madawaska-Victoria. 
Your constituents would have trouble understanding this, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	We have no extraterritorial ambitions, as the Helms-Burton law 
does, and although we have many friends outside Quebec, in 
particular in the francophone and Acadian communities, we 
display no imperialistic tendencies.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	If this bill were passed-and I thank the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs for not making this a votable motion, 
which more or less settles the fate of this bill-we would be 
condemned to remain forever in opposition and, most of all, to the 
status of a group of independent members. That is to say, only the 
election expenses of candidates who receive 15 per cent of the vote 
in their ridings would be reimbursed, so our party would not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4056"> 4056 </A></B>
<P>
entitled to a 22.5 per cent refund of  its expenses at the national 
level. This would be a major setback.
<P>
	The Reform Party would also be in a precarious position, as it 
first burst onto the scene with the election of the hon. member for 
Beaver River to this House. All regional based parties would not 
have been so lucky.
<P>
	We can say one of the good things about Canadian democracy is 
that it allows regional parties to emerge, parties like the Bloc 
Quebecois or any regional party that may emerge to promote the 
interests of one region or another of Canada.
<P>
	Just the same, the chance of promoting regional interests that 
comes with a political system must be recognized. It existed in the 
days of the CCF, the New Democratic Party at the federal level, and 
of the Progressive Conservative Party. It has always existed.
<P>
	I do not think that just because an election gave the results it 
gave, the 35th Parliament has wiped off the political map a former 
national party-we are not going to change the law to prevent them 
from trying their luck again. The democratic rules by which the 
vast majority of members of this House abide must be respected.
<P>
	I think that the more we value democracy, the more important we 
feel it is that the rights of our minorities be respected. Because if all 
democracy stands for is the rights of the majority, the majority 
always wins in the end anyway. When a vote is taken by a show of 
hands, the majority wins. The guarantees given to the minority are 
rights that we must respect because the minority is always at a 
disadvantage. That is why we have charters protecting the rights of 
minorities, charters that we generally respect.
<P>
	This is a bill calling for a form of intolerance, a bill designed to 
make quick political hay, that completely misses the mark. I think 
that the hon. member who introduced this bill will not score very 
many points with this bill. For these reasons, I obviously cannot 
support this bill. I did not have to tell you since we will not be 
voting on the bill. But in the unlikely event a vote were taken, I 
would vote no. I will also gladly refuse consent if unanimous 
consent is sought to put this bill to a vote.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
believers in democracy, real democracy, who have taken the time to 
read through private members' Bill C-276 will have realized that 
there are at least two possible ways of interpreting the intent of this 
bill.
<P>
	One of those interpretations would lead us to conclude that the 
member who introduced the bill is motivated by a patriotic love for 
Canada. Unfortunately though, it is also possible to interpret the 
bill as a direct attack, inadvertently I hope, on democracy itself.
<P>
	Because of the seriousness of the second possible interpretation, 
I will deal only with that specific aspect of  the bill in the hope that 
the member who introduced it will recognize the flaw and will 
agree to withdraw the bill before it goes any further.
<P>
	The plain fact is that Bill C-276 has the potential to place such 
unreasonable restrictions on freedom of assembly and equal rights 
that many people would be tempted to describe it as irresponsible 
and repressive.
<P>
	Enactment of its provisions would severely curtail the formation 
and growth of new parties in Canada, while the old line traditional 
parties with their worn out ideologies would be protected by 
legislation from the challenge of new and open discussion about 
Canada's future.
<P>
	This bill reminds me, sadly I will say, of a bill that was passed 
unanimously by the PCs, Liberals and NDP in this House prior to 
the 1993 election. That bill also attempted to protect the turf of the 
old line parties at the expense of new parties by requiring the 
election of 12 members to this House in order to receive official 
recognition as a party.
<P>
	As we all know, that arrogant attack on the principles of 
democracy backfired on the perpetrators in a major way. Two of the 
parties which supported that repressive bill, the PCs and the NDP, 
ended up with fewer than 12 seats in this Parliament and are no 
longer recognized as parties. The PCs and the NDP in effect were 
hoisted on their own anti-democratic petards while the group or 
groups they intended to suppress were supported by enough of the 
voters of Canada that they ended up as officially recognized 
parties.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	It was the voters exercising their democratic rights who 
determined the fate of these parties, and it is with the voters that the 
power of democracy should stay. Neither the government nor 
individual members of this House should be proposing or passing 
repressive legislation which interferes with the ability of the people 
to meet, organize and run for office under a common party banner.
<P>
	Those who think it is their prerogative to try to legislatively 
influence the outcome of elections through bills like Bill C-276 
should recognize that they are playing with fire and that severe 
burns are most likely going to be the result. It is not the right of 
members of this place to try to preserve their own futures by 
restricting the organizational and voting rights of the people who 
pay their salaries.
<P>
	If members have read Bill C-276 they will have noticed that in 
order to achieve party status the bill requires a group to nominate 
candidates in at least seven provinces containing at least 50 per 
cent of the population and 50 per cent of the electoral districts of 
Canada. In other words, Bill C-276 makes the arrogant assumption 
that there is no value to a party which has its roots in just one or two 
provinces and would deny the right of voters to  determine for 
themselves whether a new party, regional or not, has candidates 
who are capable of representing their constituents in this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4057"> 4057 </A></B>
<P>
	If this bill had been in effect in 1988, it would have prevented the 
Reform Party of Canada from being recognized as a party. As a 
direct result it would have prevented the name Reform from 
appearing on the ballot. Voters would have been unable to 
determine which independent candidates listed on the ballot were 
actually Reform Party of Canada candidates, leaving the traditional 
parties with an unfair advantage. Luckily, Bill C-276 was not in 
effect at the time and the Reform Party candidates captured a large 
enough percentage of the votes to achieve public and media 
recognition which in turn led to further growth and further support.
<P>
	At the following election in 1993, candidates were run in almost 
every province and 52 Reform members were elected representing 
five of these provinces. At the same time, PCs dropped to just two 
members with no representation west of Quebec, and the NDP 
dropped to nine members with no representation east of 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	If we want to talk about regional parties, we need look no further 
than the NDP and the PCs who thought they were invincible, just as 
the Liberal side of the House thinks it is today. The fact is we are in 
times of great political upheaval and even the smug members on 
the government side of the House need to begin thinking about the 
future of their party. There is no guarantee that the Liberal Party of 
Canada, if it refuses to become more democratic, can survive the 
enormous changes which have to take place in this federation over 
the next decade or two.
<P>
	The people of this country want more say in the decision making 
process. They want to see truly free votes taking place in this 
House on government bills. They want to see MPs representing the 
will of their constituents ahead of the party line or their own 
personal biases. They want governments at all levels to begin 
acting as servants of the taxpayers rather than benevolent 
dictatorships.
<P>
	I will return for a moment to the example of the Reform Party of 
Canada. There is no doubt that Bill C-276, had it been law prior to 
1990, would have severely restricted the ability of the party to grow 
even though the Reform Party of Canada had, and still has, policies 
which are national in scope. All of the policies of the party are built 
upon three major foundation blocks: fiscal responsibility; justice 
and family safety; and democratic reforms which would improve 
the way government functions.
<P>
	These policy foundations are national in scope and always were, 
but Bill C-276 could easily have prevented the party from growing 
to the point where it has over 50 members in the House of 
Commons and can deliver its message to voters all across Canada. 
This might have  suited the Liberal Party, but it would not have 
been democratic. Even if the Reform Party of Canada had not 
developed policies which are national in scope, what makes 
politicians in Ottawa think they have the divine right to arbitrarily 
decide on behalf of their voters whether or not a political party can 
exist based solely on whether it is regional in nature?
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	If we believe in democracy, it is the people of Canada who have 
the right to decide whether they want to vote for a regional party, a 
national party or simply no party at all. No member in this place 
should be attempting to interfere with that freedom to choose even 
if the outcome of a subsequent election is not to their liking.
<P>
	Certainly there is the potential to end up with situations like the 
one we have in the House today where the official opposition is a 
party which makes no secret of the fact that it wants to facilitate the 
separation of Quebec from Canada and has no desire to become the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	If the member who sponsored this bill does not like having the 
Bloc sitting as official opposition, he should work on changing the 
attitudes of his colleagues on the Liberal side who collectively have 
the power to correct the situation without passing restrictive bills 
like the one before us today.
<P>
	This bill throws the baby out with the bath water. Despite the 
claims of the government member, it is not crucial that every party 
in the House be a national alternative. Neither is it the business of 
this House to decide whether regional parties should get the same 
tax status rights as national parties.
<P>
	If the members opposite truly believe in the equality of all 
citizens and are not just paying lip service to the concept, then they 
are obliged to retain equality of opportunity for all political parties 
and their supporters whether regional or not.
<P>
	If the end result of this democratic freedom leads on occasion to 
a less stable political climate than we would like, it is too darn bad. 
We will all have to work a little harder as MPs when these 
situations occur.
<P>
	The member who introduced Bill C-276 was probably well 
intentioned but the bill contains restrictions on political freedom 
which are inappropriate in this parliamentary process. It is my hope 
that members will join me in opposing this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak on Bill C-276 which calls for the 
government to consider allowing the registration of a political 
party only when the party nominates candidates in at least seven 
provinces that have in aggregate at least 50 per cent of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4058"> 4058 </A></B>
<P>
population of  all of the provinces and at least half of the electoral 
districts in each of those seven provinces.
<P>
	The hon. member for Don Valley North raises the important 
issue of access to public funding by federal political parties and the 
registration process which primarily governs this access. Public 
funding of political parties has several important purposes, and I 
would like to mention two.
<P>
	First, it is seen as a means to broaden the base of party finance. A 
broader financial base provides for greater financial stability which 
allows a political party to mount effective campaigns including 
access to the mass media. Second, it also helps to lessen a political 
party's dependence on large contributors. In this way it provides for 
a more level playing field for all political parties, thereby 
increasing electoral democracy and ensuring meaningful freedom 
of speech.
<P>
	Although there is widespread agreement about the desirability of 
public funding for political parties, there has been much debate on 
the conditions for access to public funding. The most important of 
these conditions is the registration process.
<P>
	The registration of political parties was introduced in 1970. Two 
key criteria for registration set out then and still in force today are 
that a political party must either have had 12 MPs when Parliament 
was dissolved or nominate 50 candidates by the 28th day before the 
election, nomination day. If either criteria is met, the political party 
gains access to public funding primarily in the form of income tax 
credits, partial reimbursement of electoral expenses and access to 
free broadcasting time.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Don Valley North in proposing stricter 
conditions for registration may be concerned that scarce public 
resources should not be spent on political parties that receive 
marginal or trivial voter support. Many of us in this House agree 
with this viewpoint. This is why we gave our support to private 
members' Bill C-243 by the member for Edmonton Southwest. It 
proposed that reimbursement of election spending for registered 
political parties be tied to voter support. Currently, reimbursement 
is tied to a proportion of the political party's electoral spending. 
This bill is now before the Senate.
<P>
	The hon. member for Don Valley North may also be concerned 
about party stability in Canada and in promoting political parties 
that have a broad geographical base. This also is a laudable 
objective. However, I would not like to see this bill being 
interpreted as erecting barriers to new and emerging political 
parties, many of which may be regionally based.
<P>
	In balancing the need for fiscal restraint and encouraging the 
promotion of national parties, we must not lose sight of the need to 
enhance access to the  political system. There must be a balance 
between these often conflicting objectives.
<P>
	It is worthwhile to point out that any reforms we consider should 
be assessed against the rights of individuals and groups to associate 
and speak freely. Major restrictions to these rights as represented in 
this bill would likely be challenged under the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. We must fine tune our reforms to ensure that 
the electoral rights of all Canadians are not restricted.
<P>
	We should not forget the past work of the Royal Commission on 
Electoral Reform and Party Financing, the Lortie commission, and 
the all-party special House committee on electoral reform that 
studied the Lortie report in 1992 and 1993. It may be instructive to 
note that the Lortie report after undertaking an in depth study of the 
registration process concluded that the 50 candidate threshold 
should remain unchanged.
<P>
	The commission noted that a political party, which nominates 
candidates in 50 constituencies would demonstrate serious intent to 
engage in the rigours of electoral competition at a level that 
indicates relatively broad appeal for its programs and ideas. 
Moreover, experience since 1974 shows that this level is neither 
unduly onerous nor lenient for registration. The report goes on to 
say that this threshold should continue to serve as a benchmark in 
determining which parties may be registered under the Canada 
Elections Act.
<P>
	The all-party special committee agreed with the Lortie 
commission in this respect. However, time did not allow 
consideration of some of the Lortie commission's other 
recommendations on registration.
<P>
	For example, the commission also recommended that a political 
party qualify for registration between elections following 
submission of a valid application that would include the declared 
support of 5,000 voters who are members in good standing of the 
party. This and other recommendations were to be considered at a 
future full scale review of the electoral legislation.
<P>
	More recently, the chief electoral officer, in his annex to the 35th 
general election released in February 1996, stated his conclusion 
that the current provisions of the act should continue to remain 
unchanged. In his view, the 50 candidate threshold still provides a 
good balance allowing a good proportion of new parties to enter the 
system while excluding from the system parties that have declined.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer based his conclusion in part on the 
work of F. Leslie Seidle of the Montreal Institute for Research on 
Public Policy. Mr. Seidle's research suggested that although there 
is room for further debate about the registration criteria, it is clear 
that the 50 candidate threshold has not been a roadblock to new 
parties.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4059"> 4059 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	He noted that although each of the last three national elections a 
handful of new parties have not met the registration requirements, 
several others did. For example, in 1993 six additional parties were 
registered. Two recently formed parties, the Reform Party and the 
Bloc Quebecois, now hold seats in this House. He also noted that 
the 50 candidate threshold served to exclude from the system 
parties that have declined. For example, of the six parties registered 
in 1974 two, the Social Credit and the Communists, are no longer 
registered.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to congratulate and thank the hon. 
member for bringing the House's attention to the important issue of 
registration of political parties and its effect on our electoral 
system. In my view, more work needs to be done. Our approach to 
the issue must be comprehensive to ensure that all the impacts are 
adequately investigated before changes can be contemplated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a delight 
to be able to enter into this debate today on a subject that is very 
dear to my heart. It is the subject of freedom. It is the subject of 
democracy. It is the subject of representation of the people. It is the 
subject of the use of the taxpayers' money. It is a subject in which I 
have a great interest.
<P>
	I respectfully indicate to the member who has brought this bill 
forward that it is a very ill-advised bill. It is ill advised primarily 
because there is a proposal here to manipulate the democratic 
process from Ottawa, from a central government. That is not a 
democratic process. We take away people's freedoms when there 
are all of these different restrictions, especially the ones which are 
being promoted here.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the member that it is not the 
government that funds the parties. The reason to have the 
registration of individuals for the voting process is to get them on 
the ballot. The only reason they would want to be organized into 
parties would be in order for them to effectively communicate a 
party policy and platform.
<P>
	There is nothing preventing individuals from running as 
independents. That freedom must be preserved. If people in a 
community want to elect an independent, they should be able to do 
so. One might say he or she has that freedom but the problem with 
the current registration system is that they have that freedom at 
their own expense while the others have it at public expense.
<P>
	It is not the government, it is not Ottawa, it is not the Liberal 
Party nor any other party that funds the elections. It is the taxpayer. 
The root of the problem we are dealing with here is that there are 
politicians in Ottawa who presume to pluck the money out of the 
pocket of the taxpayer and they decide who then gets to use it.
<P>
	The finest solution to this would be to eliminate the funding of 
elections by Elections Canada, by the people of the country, 
through this process. Let us stop to ask the question: Why should I 
as a taxpayer send a bunch of money to Ottawa, let the bureaucrats 
spin it around and see how much spills over back to me if I qualify 
according to some arbitrary rules? When it comes to electing 
representatives to this place, each one of us as Canadians should 
have the right to use our money for whatever purpose we want and 
not be controlled by a centralist government which may have 
opposite political views.
<P>
	I will relate a practical incident of this. For many years I was a 
member of a union. I had no choice in the matter. I know I could 
have chosen a different profession but it just so happened that I 
went into the teaching profession. Both at the secondary and 
post-secondary levels it was a condition of my employment that I 
belong to that union or association.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	I was very annoyed when the union to which I was forced to 
belong gave donations to a political party, namely the NDP. I 
strongly disagreed with that but I had no choice. My democratic 
right, my democratic freedom was beat upon by that principle. 
They said: ``It is democratic. There was a majority vote in our 
union meeting to send $100,000 to the NDP''. I said that did not 
matter, that in this instance they were engaging in an activity I did 
not personally agree with and which had nothing to do with 
representing me to my employer.
<P>
	We are talking about the same thing here. We are talking about 
the Liberal government or a Conservative government in the past, 
maybe even a Reform government in the future. I do not think we 
want to give any of those governments the right to say: ``We are 
going to allow the taxpayers to put their money into the pot and 
they will get it back if they meet certain restrictions, but if they do 
not they are not permitted to''. That is a violation of equality. It is a 
violation of the principle of economic freedom.
<P>
	Another thing of importance is I have had a lot of representations 
from my constituents and I share the concern many of them have 
expressed with respect to the official opposition in this House. I am 
sure there are a lot of people on the government side who despair of 
the fact that there are separatist opposition members and Reform 
opposition members. That is just how democracy works. That has 
always been my response.
<P>
	I have had people say to me: ``Is there not something in our 
Constitution that we could use to get those separatists out of here? 
What right do they have to be here if their goal is to tear the country 
apart?'' I always answer that I do not like it either but the fact is 
that by some means they won the support of the people in their 
constituencies. Indeed in the last election 54 of 75 seats in Quebec 
were won by separatists, by members of the Bloc  party and I for 
one will not be the one who says that those people in those 
constituencies do not have the right to send to this place whomever 
they will. That right must be preserved. We must not intrude upon 
that by giving funding preferentially to one group or the other, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4060"> 4060 </A></B>
<P>
arbitrarily decided by the government of the day. I would not want 
to be a part of that.
<P>
	Meanwhile I believe it is a proper role of government to so 
arrange its affairs that people in this country will not want to leave 
it. I do believe this is such a wonderful country that I would never 
want to leave it. I would not want to do anything to cause this 
country to fall apart.
<P>
	It often hurts me as a staunch, loyal Canadian with great loyalty 
to my country when members on the government side falsely 
accuse that Reformers are here to tear apart the country. That is not 
true. We are here to keep this country together, to help build it, to 
become strong, to keep our economic independence from other 
people in the world, other countries, but also to have economic 
independence for the citizens of this wonderful country.
<P>
	It is true we disagree with the governing party of the day on how 
some of these things must be done. I for one believe it is very 
healthy for the Reform Party to be here. It is very healthy for us to 
have the voice that says we should not be spending endless money 
that our children and grandchildren will have to repay. We have a 
role to play in holding this government financially accountable.
<P>
	I will not claim that we have had the total success we wanted to 
have. It is true that the current government is spending less than the 
previous government did, but it is still adding to the debt. I have the 
right on behalf of my constituents to voice that and to express it 
strongly here.
<P>
<B>(1915 )</B>
<P>
	I also point out that by the rules proposed by this member I 
would not have been eligible to receive the rebate on my election 
expenses because, according to him, my party would not have been 
registered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> That's not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> I stand corrected. As an individual candidate I could if 
I got 15 per cent of the votes, but as a party we would not be 
eligible because we would not have been able to register as a party. 
I think that is wrong.
<P>
	I won every poll in my riding. The people in my riding said: 
``That is the person we want to send to Ottawa''. They have the 
right to do that. I will not put a single restriction in their way. 
Consequently, I must speak very strongly against this bill. It is well 
intentioned. I believe the member wants to do what is best for the 
country. It is just that he has not properly analysed the 
consequences of what his bill is proposing.
<P>
	I would like to say very simply that good ideas always start 
small. We would do very well to promote the extension of little 
groups. If a group has a good idea it  will grow. If it has bad ideas it 
will go into oblivion soon enough. The Conservative Party taught 
us that lesson.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will begin by correcting an impression of my colleague 
from Elk Island.
<P>
	Bill C-276 does not affect the ability or the right of a person or a 
group of people to run as candidates in an election. It addresses the 
right of a group of people to become a registered political party 
whereby they would be entitled to certain remunerations, certain 
tax breaks and equal broadcasting time during an election.
<P>
	This is quite a proper thing for government to concern itself with 
because we are a national democracy and we define our country by 
how we define our members of Parliament. We choose to define 
our members of Parliament by political parties which receive some 
government funding based on the number in that party; the present 
law requires 50. Or, as in the case of Bill C-276, it would be 
required that the members of a political party that receives 
government funds would have to have nominees in seven out of ten 
provinces.
<P>
	Bill C-276 is fundamentally directed against the concept of 
provincial parties, against parties which instead of coming to 
Ottawa to represent and to debate the interests of all parts of the 
country, come to Ottawa to debate only the interests of one part of 
the country, specifically a province.
<P>
	We can test the wisdom of the concept behind Bill C-276 by 
extending the idea to its ultimate extreme. Consider a House of 
Commons in which there is nothing but regional and provincial 
parties where every group of people represents only the provinces 
in which the members of Parliament were elected.
<P>
	Then we would have a House of 10 parties. We would not need to 
have a federal election at all. We could simply use the members 
from the 10 provinces and territories to come to this place one or 
two times a year to debate and pass laws. We know what would 
happen. It would not work because each group would represent 
only its provincial interests and we could be described by that 
famous term which is relevant even today. We would have a total 
balkanization of the country where only provincial interests were 
represented.
<P>
	The bill is aimed directly at that. It is aimed even more 
specifically at the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	We heard earlier the hon. member for Bellechasse admitting that 
the Bloc Quebecois would have a great deal of difficulty with this 
legislation if it were to pass because the Bloc Quebecois represents 
only the interests of Quebec. That is how the Bloc Quebecois 
defines itself.
<P>
	The member for Bellechasse conveyed the impression that 
because the Bloc Quebecois represents only one province-and it 
is a province that seeks some sort of sovereignty association 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4061"> 4061 </A></B>
<P>
relationship with the rest of the country according to its current 
government-he made the assumption that the Bloc Quebecois 
would have no relevance in running members of Parliament in 
other parts of the country. Here I disagree most wholeheartedly 
with him.
<P>
	In the recent byelection in Hamilton East 13 candidates ran as 
well as candidates from the major parties. Absent was a candidate 
from the Bloc Quebecois. I asked myself what would have 
happened if a member of the Bloc Quebecois would have run in 
that byelection. How would that candidate have been greeted by the 
people in Hamilton East?
<P>
	I occupy a riding not very far from Hamilton East. I imagine a 
Bloc MP running in Hamilton East and being received very well by 
the people. I know, Madam Speaker, you might find that statement 
surprising coming from someone like myself who is certainly very 
much a federalist.
<P>
	I have considered some of the important issues I heard the Bloc 
Quebecois express many times on behalf of Quebec. One of them is 
self-determination. The people of Hamilton East would understand 
the concept of self-determination very readily. I could tell my 
colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois that the people around 
Hamilton East have a very proud sense of their territory, a sense of 
the region.
<P>
	Indeed, there is quite a sense of rivalry between Hamilton and 
Toronto. There is a great desire in the people from Hamilton, and 
particularly in Hamilton East, for a kind of self-defining and 
self-determination. If a Bloc Quebecois member ran in Hamilton 
East and tried to express the concept of self-determination for 
Quebec, he or she would be understood.
<P>
	If the Bloc Quebecois ran a candidate in Hamilton East and 
spoke about the need to preserve language, the people in the 
audience in Hamilton East would understand him precisely because 
those in Hamilton come from many origins. In that part of the city 
there are predominantly people of Italian origin.
<P>
	The people in Hamilton East are of many different language 
groups and sometimes of a different first language. It is often 
Italian, sometimes Greek, Portuguese, Spanish and sometimes 
French I might add. They have a great sense of pride in their 
language. They would understand a candidate who aspired to being 
a member of Parliament who wanted to defend a language; who felt 
a language and a culture was worth defending. They would 
understand that.
<P>
	Again that certainly follows with the concept of a distinct 
society. I know the Bloc Quebecois has not exactly supported the 
Liberal initiative in that regard. Nevertheless it is a principle that 
underlies much of what Quebecers refer to as nationalism or at 
least sovereignty. I still see it as a kind of provincialism, in the 
sense of province, not in the sense necessarily of being narrow.
<P>
	People in Hamilton East would understand it if a Bloc Quebecois 
candidate explained things like the difference of the civil code, the 
difference of the traditions in Quebec. Even better, it would give 
them an insight into what motivates so many people who do 
support the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois. It would help 
enormously in their understanding. They could relate to it in a 
sense that in my part of Ontario there is a very strong sense of pride 
at being from Ontario. Indeed around Hamilton, MPs are expected 
to serve the interests of their province and their city.
<P>
<B>(1925 )</B>
<P>
	I submit that there is not a great deal of difference between that 
and Bloc Quebecois members who get up and want to represent, 
somewhat narrowly perhaps, the interests of Quebec. There would 
not be much difference there.
<P>
	I could go on. I have often seen the Bloc Quebec members in the 
House defending, very expertly, social and cultural issues. 
Sometimes it has been an irony to hear the Bloc Quebecois more 
effectively attack the government when it is talking about cutbacks 
to major cultural institutions like the CBC. It has often been the 
Bloc Quebecois that has sprung to the barricades, rather than the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	That would be understood, certainly, in Hamilton East as well 
because there is a great sense of pride in cultural institutions, in 
song and dance, and the need to communicate among us.
<P>
	I do not think, for the most part, a Bloc Quebecois candidate in 
Hamilton East would have much difficulty in delivering a message 
to which people would listen quietly and with great attention.
<P>
	The only place where the Bloc Quebecois candidate would have 
difficulty is with the concept of sovereignty. We each define 
sovereignty differently in our minds. However, when the concept of 
sovereignty is extended to the idea of actually breaking away from 
the country, actually separating from Canada, I have to admit that 
no Bloc Quebecois candidate would get much support. On the other 
hand, the Bloc Quebecois candidate would do much for the good-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will give the 
hon. member 30 seconds for his conclusion. I apologize for 
disturbing him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. I will come to a 
conclusion very rapidly.
<P>
	The point I wish to make is this. The opportunity to speak across 
the country, even when someone represents only regional interests, 
is what a national party should be all about. It does not matter 
whether it ultimately has regional interests at heart.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4062"> 4062 </A></B>
<P>
	I support in principle in Bill C-276 because it would force a 
party like the Bloc Quebecois or any other party that would want 
to represent only a province to get out of that province and deliver 
their message to the rest of the country so that the rest of the 
country could better understand it.
<P>
	It is when we are separate, when we represent only regions, then 
we become strangers.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RAILWAYSAFETYACT">RAILWAY SAFETY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-43, 
an act to amend the Railway Safety Act and to make a 
consequential amendment to another act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wish to begin by condemning the fact the 
Liberal government has put this bill on the order paper at the last 
minute, without any advance notice. Our speeches today should 
therefore be considered preliminary only and not definitive. 
Overall, judging by our first cursory overview, we are in favour of 
the bill, but will certainly have certain reservations and 
amendments to make at committee.
<P>
	I wish to address one particular point, the new section 23.1, 
which I shall read to you:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>23.1 (1) No person shall use the whistle on any railway equipment in an area 
within a municipality if:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the area meets the requirements prescribed for the purposes of this section; 
and</BLOCKQUOTE>
-this therefore involves the area of a municipality-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the government of the municipality by resolution declares that it agrees that 
such whistles should not be used in that area and has, before passing the 
resolution, consulted the railway company that operates the relevant line of 
railway and has given public notice of its intention to pass the resolution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	The reason why I wish to address this particular point is that it 
deals with a problem that is a very real one in our region; cities 
such as Sainte-Thérèse, Rosemère or Blainville are bothered at 4 
a.m. by a train coming through and waking everyone up.
<P>
	This clause banning the use of the whistle under certain 
circumstances must be viewed with favour, in principle, provided 
safety is not compromised by the absence of an audible warning. 
Level crossing safety is ensured by the use of the whistle, then the 
bell and finally a flashing red light. All that would be left is the 
flashing lights and the bell.
<P>
	In many countries, level crossings are protected by barriers, but I 
do not believe that is necessary here, because of their high cost. 
There is absolute safety with such an arrangement, but it is very 
costly and we are not calling for that much.
<P>
	This clause on not using the whistle in an area within a 
municipality contains two noteworthy points: it is not general, and 
assumes that the municipality concerned has passed a resolution 
declaring that it is agrees that whistles not be used. This is a good 
thing, because obviously it is better that the decision-making power 
rests with the municipality, the government level that is closer to 
the population than Ottawa, when the decision is to be made as to 
whether or not whistles are to be used, for the sake of peace and 
quiet, while not compromising safety.
<P>
	It is therefore a good thing that the municipality takes the 
decision. If it wants whistles not to be used, it passes a resolution. 
No resolution, no ban. That is reasonable.
<P>
	Another aspect which strikes me as less reasonable is clause 
23.1, which states that no person may use the whistle in an area 
within a municipality if the area meets the requirements prescribed 
for the purposes of this section. This assumes that the minister has, 
under this bill, the power to set regulations and impose them on the 
municipalities, so that their resolution approving the whistle ban 
may be enforced. The municipality must therefore comply with 
certain conditions set by the federal government.
<P>
	Here we see that, once again, the federal government has not 
been able to resist the temptation to take advantage of any new 
legislation to try to interfere with areas of provincial jurisdiction, 
for municipalities are under provincial jurisdiction. They are 
creatures of the province and their powers are under trusteeship 
from the provincial level. Now we find the federal government, 
once again, trampling over the powers of the municipalities, if I 
understand this clause properly, stating that they, the federal 
government, the Minister of Transport, will set out requirements to 
which municipalities must comply with if their resolutions banning 
the use of the whistle are to be implemented.
<P>
	At this point, I believe that this clause must be condemned, for it 
goes over the heads of the provinces and thumbs its nose at their 
areas of jurisdiction, one of which is the municipalities. It is, 
therefore, obvious that we shall have an amendment to propose 
concerning the second paragraph of section 23.1.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to stress, as did the first speaker, that we agree 
withe the bill's principle.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	It claims to improve railway safety, and who can fault virtue. 
Overall, these provisions seem to us to be good ones, but we will 
have a few reservations to express. These will take the form of 
amendments. In closing, I reiterate my protest against the cavalier 
fashion in which the bill was presented to us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4063"> 4063 </A></B>
<P>
	You will recall that today's session started in the same casual 
way. The Minister of Foreign Affairs also made an impromptu 
statement and took us unawares. Now we are closing the day on 
the same note, so it is bracketed at both ends by high-handed 
actions, and one might well wonder whether the government's plan 
B has now been brought to bear on the committees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the debate on Bill C-43, on railway safety.
<P>
	First, the closure of the rail maintenance shop in Charny, the 
Joffre shop, was recently announced. A look into the matter 
because of the closure reveals that, by region, track defects are 
between 3 and 10 times higher in Quebec then elsewhere in the 
country. This why rail safety is of particular concern to me.
<P>
	In the case of Charny, the first thing is the loss of 93 jobs, which 
is very important. But the Joffre shop also used subcontractors. 
There were 150 firms in the Quebec City region working with the 
Joffre shop with a total payroll or the equivalent of the payroll of 
these 93 employees plus materials. In all, this decision means $5 
million less in economic benefits for the Quebec City region.
<P>
	What is the decision exactly? There were three shops of the same 
type in Canada maintaining tracks. There was one at Charny for all 
of eastern Canada, one in Winnipeg and the other in British 
Columbia. The CN decided to concentrate things in Winnipeg. Last 
year, we in the Bloc did not oppose the bill to privatize the CN, 
because it was time decisions were made as much as possible from 
a business standpoint.
<P>
	The principle is a good one. However, in practical terms- I will 
start with the president, Mr. Tellier, who comes from a political 
background, and who, after doing some dirty work, if I may use the 
expression, in terms of cuts when the CN was a crown corporation, 
contributed to the deterioration of rail lines particularly in Quebec. 
There were other decisions at CN such as the decision to transfer 
the pay service to Winnipeg, although head office remained in 
Montreal. This is a bit odd.
<P>
	As far as orders and so on are concerned, that section is in 
Toronto. In the case of other services, part of the head office was 
moved to eastern Canada. CN's head office is an increasingly 
empty shell. It is not yet empty, but increasingly so. This leads me 
to point out that, as far as the tracks are concerned-and I say this 
on my own, it is not the official stand of the Bloc-I would say 
there is a deliberate plan to try to deprive Quebec of its primary rail 
resources. The Joffre shop in Charny is one example.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	Somewhat paradoxically, last year, just before the referendum, 
this shop, also called La Rotonde, was designated a historical site 
by the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> On a point of 
order, the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I am trying my 
hardest, but the hon. member has given a five to ten minute speech 
and he has said nothing, not a word, about what we are debating 
here, the Railway Safety Act and the amendments to that bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> That is not a 
point of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, as I have very little time, I am not 
going to spend it on a member who is not paying attention. For five 
minutes now I have been speaking about the only railway track 
maintenance shop in eastern Canada, which is located in Charny, 
and that concerns railway safety.
<P>
	If he wants statistics, I will give him some. The Transportation 
Safety Board of Canada said that in 1994, 1,189 accidents were 
reported, 17 per cent more than in 1993. This is worrisome. Most 
accidents on main tracks took place at level crossings. In 1994, 30 
per cent of the total number of accidents took place at level 
crossings and 13 per cent of derailments took place on main tracks.
<P>
	Every year there are 300 accidents involving cars carrying 
dangerous materials. Three hundred accidents involving dangerous 
materials is hardly trivial. They say only goods are involved. In 
1994, 114 people lost their lives in railway accidents. Am I being 
relevant, sir, am I talking about railway safety? I am giving you the 
statistics.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry, but 
could the hon. member please address his remarks to the Chair?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, the member has got me going. I 
came back from dinner and was feeling a bit sleepy. He has woken 
me up and he will be sorry, he will come to regret it. I apologize to 
you, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	In 1994, 158 derailments were reported on main tracks, a 24 per 
cent increase. I asked for newspaper clippings so that I could look 
over the accident headlines. I will not be able to mention them all, 
but I will cover the main ones. On February 5, 1996, <I>Le Soleil</I> 
carried the following story: ``CN claims there are fewer accidents. 
The Transportation Safety Board says the opposite. While the 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada reports an increase in train 
accidents in Canada in the last five years, Canadian National, now a 
private company, has statistics to show that the carrier has 
apparently had fewer accidents''.
<P>
	I will quote from another article from <I>Le Soleil</I> dated February 5, 
1996: ``Steady increase in number of accidents over past five 
years''. I do not have a lot of  time. Still from <I>Le Soleil</I>, this time 
from July 29, 1995: ``There is a terrible dispute over the results of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4064"> 4064 </A></B>
<P>
an investigation into the Transportation Safety Board and CN. They 
are not in agreement''.
<P>
	Obviously, when I asked him a question on the topic this week, 
the minister defended himself with statistics provided by CN. But 
his own railway safety bureau contradicts the people at CN. The 
Minister of Transport should use the data put out by his own 
department, but he prefers those produced by CN saying things are 
not so bad. They are making a business decision.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you come from New Brunswick, and I am sure 
your constituents in Edmunston are not happy when they think that 
if there is a railway problem, they will have to call Winnipeg. I 
know there is only one line in your riding connecting with the main 
track and that things will be held up until someone comes from 
Winnipeg to repair it. You know how far it is between Edmunston 
and Winnipeg. This decision is incredible.
<P>
	Along with the Railway Safety Act, government is amending 
another act because it must do so every five years. They are trying 
to tell us that this is not serious, that everything is fine, and yet 
there are accidents.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	I was saying that in Quebec there were ten times more defects 
than in certain regions. What I am proposing is that the Minister of 
Transport table a bill, that is right, but the people working in this 
service must be on the lookout. There must be planning in order to 
avoid accidents. Anyone who owns a car knows that proper 
maintenance is the way to avoid breakdowns. And that must be 
planned.
<P>
	Right now, as far as the railway in Quebec is concerned, the 
service in question only repaired things that were not working well 
in order to prevent derailments. The shop in Charny lacked 
resources. It was so lacking in resources they had to work overtime, 
but that only depleted even more their resources. It was not enough. 
It had to subcontract half of its contracts in the Quebec region in 
order to try to repair the system.
<P>
	But not enough is being done in the long term. Not enough is 
being done in terms of prevention. It is too bad that when we 
mention safety to people from the transport department, they talk 
to us about the number of accidents. It is like waiting for someone 
to get burned before you start worrying about fire prevention. It is 
the same thing.
<P>
	We should be talking about the condition of the railway. We 
should be talking about the equipment we have, the number of 
people that should be assigned to correct the situation. I say that 
this government is slacking off on railway safety, and that a few 
changes to the act will not be enough to silence the member for 
Lévis, when they are eliminating 93 jobs in Charny.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise on Bill C-43 amending 
the Railway Safety Act.
<P>
	This bill, you will recall, to provide a bit of a background, was 
introduced in the House of Commons on May 30 by the Minister of 
Transport to amend the Railway Safety Act. It aims to give the 
railway companies greater responsibility in the management of 
safety, although Transport Canada will continue to set 
requirements.
<P>
	Bill C-43 provides as well for more feedback from the public and 
interested parties on matters of railway safety.
<P>
	It also establishes a framework for communities wanting to stop 
the use of the train whistle. I would like to add to the comments 
made earlier by my colleague, the member for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, who said that we agreed with most 
of the provisions of this bill and particularly a certain relaxation in 
the use of the train whistle. When I was the Bloc transport critic, I 
received many representations from residents of municipalities 
requesting the discontinuation of train whistles. These include the 
people of Rimouski and of the Cap-Rouge sector of the riding of 
Louis-Hébert.
<P>
	The amendments in this bill are drawn from the 
recommendations made by the committee reviewing the Railway 
Safety Act in the report it tabled in February 1995 entitled: <I>On 
Track: the Future of Railway Safety in Canada</I>. We should note that 
Transport Canada accepted 60 of the 69 recommendations.
<P>
	Those of my colleagues who spoke before me expressed the Bloc 
Quebecois' position on this bill. We must criticize the Liberal 
government, which arrives at the last minute and puts this bill on 
the Order Paper without any prior warning.
<P>
	I also want to say that I am very surprised by the attitude of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, the member 
for Hamilton West, whom I sat with on the Standing Committee on 
Transport. I do not know if the parliamentary secretary's new job 
has-dare I say ``gone to his head'', I have to watch my language. 
The member for Hamilton West has really changed his attitude. He 
was much more flexible when he was with us on the transport 
committee. This does not bode well for the future. Perhaps he is 
thinking about his personal career, a spot in the next cabinet 
shuffle, but, in any event, that is the attitude he has adopted.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	This aggressiveness by the Liberals is all the more unjustifiable 
in light of the fact that we did not systematically oppose all the 
measures proposed in this bill. We would have liked to co-operate 
with the government in order to improve this legislation, but the 
government preferred confrontation, adopting a strategy of holding 
a gun to our head. The official opposition is  worried and hopes that 
the government's plan B with respect to constitutional matters, 
which has become the government's policy, is not making itself felt 
in transportation issues.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4065"> 4065 </A></B>
<P>
	The Railway Safety Act review committee must examine the act 
every five years, an initiative we feel is useful for all concerned. 
The official opposition views the ongoing improvement of railway 
safety as a constant concern and priority. Nonetheless, we note that 
the federal transport minister has created an advisory committee on 
railway safety composed of members chosen by him, a 
representative of the railway companies, shippers, railway 
workers' organizations, the public and so on. Provincial transport 
departments or their representatives are not members of this 
committee. We feel that the transport department of Quebec, and of 
other provinces as well, should be on this committee.
<P>
	One concern was raised by the Government of Quebec with 
respect to level crossings. It feels that the federal government has 
devoted a large part of its bill to the safety of level crossings and to 
intrusions, but it has proposed nothing to improve safety in yards, 
even though these accidents, as the government has already 
admitted, often involve dangerous goods representing a high safety 
risk.
<P>
	Railway companies like CN and CP have the expertise, the 
experience and the responsibility to manage safety in their yards 
and sidings, but the number of accidents in these areas continues to 
increase. The number went from 191 accidents in 1989 to 358 in 
1993 and 460 in 1994. It should be pointed out that most of these 
accidents involve dangerous goods. Such cases involve not just 
railway safety but public safety.
<P>
	For your information, main track derailments have increased 
15.9 per cent between 1989 and 1994, and approximately 20 per 
cent of derailments recorded in 1994 involved dangerous goods.
<P>
	Under another part of the bill, short line railways, or SLR, will 
be required to call upon their own expertise to develop safety 
measures, including performance standards, security plans, 
building standards, maintenance standards and so on. This change 
could indeed prove to be a good thing, but somehow we doubt that 
SLRs are prepared to take on this responsibility. Short lines may 
not have the technical expertise or the human and financial 
resources required to fulfil this responsibility. Bill C-43 should not 
increase the risk of rail safety deterioration.
<P>
	Finally, the last comment I would like to make is the following. 
The bill calls for Transport Canada to set up a co-ordinated and 
nationally applied mechanism for the regulation of railway safety.
<P>
Quebec, however, has its own legislation, the loi sur la sécurité du 
transport terrestre guidé, and its own inspection mechanisms, so 
why should it take part in this co-ordinated process? Quebec does 
not necessarily need a co-ordinated national  mechanism to 
regulate railway safety in order to co-operate with the federal 
government in certain specific instances for inspections or ad hoc 
investigations.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois criticizes the Liberal 
government, the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport and member for Hamilton West in particular, 
for having rushed this bill in without any consultation, when the 
basic bill had little basis for contention in it, the official opposition 
readily lending its support.
