<P>
	The Parliament which had been prorogued on February 2, 1996, 
met this day at Ottawa for the dispatch of business.
<P>
	The House met at two o'clock, the Speaker in the chair.
<P>
	The Speaker read a communication from the Secretary to the 
Governor General announcing that His Excellency the Governor 
General would proceed to the Senate chamber at 1.50 p.m. on this 
day for the purpose of formally opening the Second Session of the 
35th Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	A message was delivered by the Gentleman Usher of the Black 
Rod as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, His Excellency the Governor General desires the immediate 
attendance of this honourable House in the chamber of the honourable the

THE SECOND SESSION 
THIRTY-FIFTH PARLIAMENT OF CANADA</A></H3>
	February 27, 1996
<P>
	<I>Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate;</I><BR>
<I>	Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:</I>
<P>
	A year ago when I became Governor General, I spoke about the 
generosity and the compassion of Canadians. I spoke especially of 
the unsung heroes, the volunteers and helpers who encourage and 
care for their communities.
<P>
	Since then, travelling to almost every province, I have seen how 
much Canadians love their country and how generous and open 
they can be to those in need. I have discovered the great strength of 
those currents of generosity and compassion.
<P>
	In the schools and the Scout troops and in every part of life, from 
the nurseries of the newborn to palliative care for the dying, 
Canadians give endless help to one another. Surely this must be the 
most giving of countries.
<P>
	We are developing a new award to recognize the unsung heroes 
of Canada; and hundreds of Canadians have already put forward the 
names of their fellow citizens, to honour their constant help and 
their open hearts.
<P>
	On the opening of the second session of this Parliament, and on 
behalf of the Government of Canada, I make the following brief 
statements of government policy. The Prime Minister and 
Ministers will expand on this in coming days. Legislation and other 
administrative measures will follow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2"> 2 </A></B>
<P>
	Twenty-eight months ago, Canadians elected a new Parliament 
and chose a new government. Since then, the  Government has 
acted to meet its commitments to the Canadian people. Ministers 
have insisted upon the highest standards of integrity and honesty in 
fulfilling their mandate.
<P>
	The Government approaches the second half of its mandate 
confident that what unites us as Canadians is far greater than what 
divides us; certain that the values we share as Canadians are as 
relevant today as they have been at any time during our history; and 
determined to apply basic Canadian values and principles to the 
new policies and fresh approaches that are required to prepare 
ourselves and our national institutions to deal with the challenges 
of the 21st century.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned about economic uncertainty, the 
sustainability of social programs and the unity of the country. The 
scope and enormity of the challenges are such that no individual, 
municipality, province or region acting in isolation can expect or 
hope to address them successfully. It will take the will to reason 
together and to pull together. Each of us must join with those with 
whom we have the most in common, with whom we share the most 
at the most basic level-at the level of values. And when we reflect 
on it, we realize it is with other Canadians that we have the most in 
common. And when we look at our history, and at our place in the 
world, we know we can solve our problems.
<P>
	Ensuring Opportunity: A Strong Economy
<P>
	A strong economy is the essence of a strong society. A strong 
economy creates the ability to translate into reality the values of 
equality of opportunity, compassion for the underprivileged and 
protection of the vulnerable.
<P>
	Government has a necessary and essential role in facilitating 
change in society. Many Canadians are concerned about their 
security, and particularly their security of employment. The 
Government will work with the private sector and the provinces to 
make the collective investments required to produce hope, growth 
and jobs. Because government does not have the resources to do 
everything, it must be strategic in its approach. It must invest in 
people. The Government will focus its new initiatives on youth, 
science and technology, and trade.
<P>
	Youth
<P>
	Young Canadians want the opportunity to put their energies and 
talents to use. Young Canadians deserve a climate of opportunity. 
This must be a national objective.
<P>
	It is time to harness the energy of the Team Canada partnership 
abroad between the federal and the provincial governments and the 
private sector to create hope, opportunity and jobs for young people 
at home. The Government will challenge the provincial 
governments and the private sector to enter into a domestic Team 
Canada partnership to create such opportunity for young people. In 
particular:
<P>
	-The Government will announce measures to double the 
number of federal summer student jobs this summer. The 
Government challenges the business community and provincial 
and municipal governments to do likewise.
<P>
	-The Government will work in active partnership with the 
provinces, the private sector and young people themselves to 
prepare initiatives to enhance youth job opportunities so that young 
Canadians can get work experience.
<P>
	-The Government will challenge business and labour and all 
levels of government to work together to create new approaches to 
assist young people in finding their first job.
<P>
	Science and Technology
<P>
	To create enduring jobs for Canadians in the economy of the 21st 
century, investment in knowledge and technology is essential. The 
Government will establish guiding principles to improve the 
effectiveness and focus of the federal science and technology 
effort. In particular:
<P>
	-The Government will make specific proposals to support 
technology development in the aerospace industry, in 
environmental technologies, and in critical enabling technologies 
such as biotechnology. Further measures will be taken to promote 
technology diffusion, including the launch of a Canadian 
technology network.
<P>
	-The Government will support technological innovation by 
providing a predictable policy and regulatory framework for the 
information highway.
<P>
	-The Government will continue to expand the access to the 
School Net and Community Access programs so that Canadians, 
particularly those in rural communities, will be able to use 
technology to increase their knowledge and access to each other 
and to the rest of the world.
<P>
	Trade
<P>
	Canadian jobs and growth depend heavily on our exports. Every 
one billion dollars of exports means 11,000 Canadian jobs. The 
success of ``Trade Team Canada'' demonstrates the value of 
working together to succeed in world markets and therefore create 
job prospects at home.
<P>
	Further ``Trade Team Canada'' missions will be undertaken 
under the leadership of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	To create jobs at home, the Government will announce new 
measures to enhance export development and financing, with 
emphasis on developing new products and new exporters and 
attracting new foreign investment.
<P>
	The Government will continue efforts to expand NAFTA and 
will work towards more world trade liberalization.
<P>
	Where there are trade disputes, the Government will spare no 
effort to promote and defend legitimate Canadian trade rights and 
interests.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	A Climate for Economic Growth and Job Creation
<P>
	In the first half of its mandate, the Government has taken steps to 
ensure that the economic and fiscal conditions are in place for 
sustained growth and job creation. The Government has made 
major structural reforms. The deficit has been cut. International 
trade and investment initiatives have been undertaken. Much has 
been accomplished. Canadians are beginning to see dividends, 
particularly with lower interest rates.
<P>
	But the job is not yet completed. The Government will continue 
to take appropriate action to promote a proper climate for 
economic growth and jobs. In particular:
<P>
	-The 1996 Budget will set out how the Government will attain 
its deficit-reduction targets, bringing the deficit down to two 
percent of gross domestic product in 1997-98 and ensuring that 
further progress will be realized in 1998-99 and beyond.
<P>
	-The Government will work with the provinces to conclude 
discussions on sales tax harmonization and establish a process to 
replace the GST and provincial sales taxes with a national sales tax.
<P>
	-The Government will introduce proposals to strengthen the 
economic framework with legislative improvements in the areas of 
competition, bankruptcy and copyright.
<P>
	-The Government will introduce proposals to update 
legislation governing financial institutions to ensure that it 
continues to be relevant to the emerging needs of businesses and 
consumers.
<P>
	-The Government will propose a modernization of the rules 
governing labour relations under federal jurisdiction through 
changes in Part I of the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	-The Government will ensure through regulatory reform that 
requirements are strong and clear, delays are minimized and 
activities co-ordinated between departments and between levels of 
government.
<P>
	-The Government is committed to the economic renewal of 
rural Canada. The Government will address the problems facing 
rural Canadians in a way that is tailored to their needs. Rural 
Canada is rich in natural and human resources and faces different 
challenges than urban areas. The Government will move forward in 
the coming session to make sure that all Canadians benefit from 
economic prosperity.
<P>
	Ensuring Opportunity: Security for Canadians
<P>
	Economic growth is not an end in itself. Government has the 
obligation, in accordance with basic Canadian values, to ensure 
security for Canadians in a rapidly changing world. Our legacy to 
future generations must include the assurance for all Canadians, 
wherever they live, that there will be a modern and accessible 
health care system; that a helping hand will be available when a 
helping hand is needed; that a public pension system will  be there 
to support people in their old age; that our environment is 
protected; and that Canadians will be safe in their homes and 
communities.
<P>
	A Secure Social Safety Net
<P>
	The Government is committed to ensuring opportunity through a 
sustainable social safety net for the future. The Government will 
secure Canada's social union for the future and will adapt our 
federal arrangements as necessary to meet current challenges and 
to prepare for the next century. The Government is open to new 
ways and new directions to pursue our values. In particular:
<P>
	-The Government will work with the provinces and Canadians 
to develop by mutual consent the values, principles and objectives 
that should underlie, first, the Canada Health and Social Transfer 
and, building on this, the social union more generally.
<P>
	-The CHST consists of tax points and cash. The Government 
will announce plans to put a floor under the cash transfer 
component to provide a guarantee of continuing federal cash to the 
provinces. This will serve to secure Canada's safety net, 
particularly medicare.
<P>
	Canadians attach high priority to our health care system and to 
the principles of medicare. The Government reaffirms its 
unwavering commitment to the five principles of the Canada 
Health Act. The Government will continue to work with the 
provinces to ensure the future of our publicly financed health care 
system.
<P>
	Canadians expect to have secure elderly benefits and pensions 
available to them when they retire.
<P>
	-The Government will propose to Parliament measures to 
sustain Canada's elderly benefits system for the future.
<P>
	-The Canada Pension Plan will be made sustainable for future 
generations. Discussions are already under way with the provinces 
on possible changes. A joint federal-provincial paper setting out 
the problems and challenges facing the Plan has already been 
released for public consultation. And reforms will be legislated 
once the required provincial consent has been obtained.
<P>
	Equality of opportunity is a basic Canadian value. It begins with 
children. The Government will announce measures to improve 
Canada's child support system, with the particular objective of 
helping single parents and low-income working families.
<P>
	Security for Canadians means ensuring that people who are out 
of work can get help while they are unemployed and can get help to 
go back to work.
<P>
	-The Government will implement a new Employment 
Insurance System beginning July 1, 1996. The Government will 
ensure that the legislation, while respecting the fiscal parameters of 
the proposed reforms, is responsive to the realities of the Canadian 
job 
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="4"> 4 </A>
<P>
market  and that the impact of changes does not fall unfairly on 
workers who are most in need of support.
<P>
	-The Government will accelerate its current discussions with 
the provinces on labour market training and development to ensure 
the orderly withdrawal of federal activity in training, and to explore 
new approaches and the appropriate roles and responsibilities of 
each level of government for strengthening national and local 
labour markets.
<P>
	Environmental Security
<P>
	While sustaining the social safety net is an essential element of 
security for Canadians, it is not all. The quality of Canada's natural 
environment is a matter of national pride. Security for Canadians 
means sustaining our environment. All Canadians must work 
together to protect the environment. In particular:
<P>
	-The Government will propose the modernization of the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	-A federal Endangered Species Protection Act will be 
introduced.
<P>
	-Legislation to ratify the UN Straddling Stocks Agreement and 
the Law of the Sea Convention will be presented to Parliament.
<P>
	-The Government will promote the long-term conservation and 
revitalization of the Pacific salmon fishery and continue with the 
revitalization of the east coast fishery.
<P>
	National parks are the heritage of a nation. The Government will 
seek agreements with provincial and territorial governments and 
with First Nations to establish new national parks and national 
marine conservation areas.
<P>
	The solutions to many environmental problems lie outside our 
borders. The Government will continue to play an environmental 
leadership role both at home and in the international arena.
<P>
	Personal Security
<P>
	The non-violent character of our country-safe homes, safe 
streets-is also an essential element of security for Canadians. The 
Government will focus corrections resources on high-risk 
offenders while increasing efforts to lower the number of young 
people who come into contact with the justice system. The 
Government will develop innovative alternatives to incarceration 
for low-risk offenders. Criminal procedures will be reformed to 
better serve victims of crime.
<P>
	International Security
<P>
	In an interdependent world, security means taking an active role 
on the international stage. All Canadians strongly identify with, 
and take great pride in, the role Canada plays in the world. The 
Government will continue to work in the G-7, NATO and the 
United Nations for a more stable and peaceful world. It will  pursue 
a wider spread entrenchment of democracy, and greater respect for 
human rights.
<P>
	In keeping with its commitment to advancing human rights and 
dignity, the Government will make the rights of children a 
Canadian priority and seek an international consensus to eliminate 
exploitative child labour.
<P>
	The Government will pay special attention to addressing the 
growing crisis of confidence in the United Nations, which 
Canadians rightly regard as the most important multilateral 
organization to ensure international peace and security.
<P>
	Canada will also do its part to help keep and build peace in 
Bosnia, Haiti, the Middle East and elsewhere.
<P>
	A Modern and United Country
<P>
	Canadians have a common history, a common collective 
experience, a shared territory, and institutions that are uniquely our 
own. The Government will act to preserve this heritage.
<P>
	Canadians also agree upon the values and principles which bind 
us together and give us confidence in ourselves and in each other.
<P>
	On October 27, the people of Canada came together in their own 
communities and in Montreal to demonstrate as never before the 
will to stay together. On October 30, the people of Quebec voted in 
a referendum to stay in Canada.
<P>
	At the same time, the referendum result gave a clear message 
that Quebeckers want change in the federation. This desire for 
change is broadly shared across Canada. The Government will act 
on a responsible agenda for change for all of Canada.
<P>
	In the last two years, the Government has made significant 
changes in a number of areas. The Government will work with the 
provinces and individual Canadians to ensure that the Canadian 
federation is modernized to meet the needs of the 21st century. This 
modernization must be respectful of our diversity and be based on 
partnership and dialogue. Canadians want and expect governments 
to be flexible and to operate efficiently and effectively so that the 
country functions well. In particular:
<P>
	-The Government will not use its spending power to create new 
shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction 
without the consent of a majority of the provinces. Any new 
program will be designed so that non-participating provinces will 
be compensated, provided they establish equivalent or comparable 
initiatives.
<P>
	-There are areas where, in the 21st century, the federal 
government does not have to be involved. For example, 
components of Canada's transportation infrastructure are being 
transferred to community-based groups, municipal authorities and 
the private sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5"> 5 </A></B>
<P>
	-The Government is prepared to withdraw from its functions 
in such areas as labour market training, forestry, mining, and 
recreation, that are more appropriately the responsibility of others, 
including provincial governments, local authorities or the private 
sector.
<P>
	-The federal government will propose to the provinces a much 
strengthened process to work in partnership, focussing on such 
priorities as food inspection, environmental management, social 
housing, tourism and freshwater fish habitat.
<P>
	The federal government has an important contribution to make 
in preserving and modernizing Canada's social union so that the 
caring society remains Canada-wide in scope. In particular:
<P>
	-The Government will work with the provinces and Canadians 
to develop agreed-upon values and principles to underlie the social 
union and to explore new approaches to decision making in social 
policy.
<P>
	-The Government will continue to protect and promote 
unhampered social mobility between provinces and access to social 
and other benefits, and will work with the provinces to identify new 
and mutually agreed approaches.
<P>
	The federal government has a major role to play in strengthening 
the Canadian economy and the Canadian economic union. The 
Government will work with the provinces to take concrete steps to 
further improve the functioning of the Canadian economic union. 
In particular:
<P>
	-The Internal Trade Agreement, which came into effect in July 
1995, must be improved. The government will work with the 
provinces and the private sector to achieve a much more open 
agreement.
<P>
	-The Government is prepared to work with the provinces and 
other partners to reduce or eliminate remaining barriers to labour 
mobility.
<P>
	-The Government is prepared to work with interested provinces 
towards the development of a Canadian Securities Commission, a 
single food inspection service, and a national revenue collection 
agency.
<P>
	The Government welcomes public participation in the debate 
about Canada. It will encourage Parliament to reach out to 
Canadians to seek their views on the specific components of an 
agenda for change.
<P>
	A First Ministers meeting will be called in the months ahead to 
discuss how governments can better work together for job creation 
in Canada, how to secure the social safety net and how to put into 
place a common agenda for change to renew Canada.
<P>
	The Government intends to focus its energies on positive action 
to prepare Canada for the 21st century. The Government welcomes 
the commitment of the new government of Quebec to focus all its 
energies on the  real problems of its citizens. The Government will 
work in collaboration with the Government of Quebec and all 
provincial governments on an agenda of economic renewal and job 
creation.
<P>
	But as long as the prospect of another Quebec referendum exists, 
the Government will exercise its responsibility to ensure that the 
debate is conducted with all the facts on the table, that the rules of 
the process are fair, that the consequences are clear, and that 
Canadians, no matter where they live, will have their say in the 
future of their country.
<P>
	The Government recognizes that national unity is more than a 
re-balancing of roles and responsibilities of levels of government.
<P>
	At a time of globalization of the economy, Canada is especially 
well placed to compete because of two official languages and the 
many Canadians who speak languages other than English and 
French. The Government recognizes that because of the minority 
status of the French language in North America, French-speaking 
Canadians have legitimate concerns. The Government affirms that 
it is particularly important to reinforce a Francophone presence at 
home and abroad. Such a presence contributes to our national 
identity and is a source of strength and enrichment for our country.
<P>
	Action has already been taken to recognize Quebec as a distinct 
society within Canada and to guarantee that no constitutional 
change affecting any major region of the country will take place 
without the consent of that region. The Government supports the 
entrenchment of these provisions in the Constitution.
<P>
	National unity means reminding Canadians of what they have in 
common. The Government will put forward a series of measures 
with special emphasis on helping Canadians, particularly young 
Canadians, to broaden their experience of Canada and to learn 
more about their country. A new Citizenship Act will be introduced 
to better reflect contemporary views of the rights and 
responsibilities of citizenship.
<P>
	Culture is at the core of our identity as Canadians. The 
Government is committed to strong Canadian cultural industries. 
The Government will propose measures to strengthen culture in 
Canada and will ensure continued access to our own cultural 
products in order to maintain a balance between Canadian 
perspectives and those from abroad. The Government reaffirms its 
commitment to ensuring the long-term vitality of the CBC, the 
National Film Board and Telefilm Canada as institutions which 
interpret Canada to Canadians and to the world.
<P>
	The Government believes that one of the tests of Canadian 
values is our ability to incorporate the aspirations of Canada's 
Aboriginal peoples. The recent historic Nisga'a agreement in 
principle shows that this is possible. The Minister of Indian Affairs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6"> 6 </A></B>
<P>
and Northern Development will continue to pursue other initiatives 
in  partnership with Aboriginal people and other governments.
<P>
	<I>Honourable Members of the Senate;</I><BR>
	<I>Members of the House of Commons:</I>
<P>
	In looking to the 21st century, it is essential that the federal 
government, in its own policies and programs, be dedicated to 
providing modern, flexible public services-services that are 
accessible, affordable and responsive to the needs of clients and 
citizens. The Government acknowledges the contribution of the 
Public Service of Canada to the continuing achievement of its 
goals. Further measures will be introduced to enable more flexible 
and innovative methods of service delivery.
<P>
	By working in partnership throughout Canadian society to create 
jobs and economic opportunity, to provide the security of a modern 
social safety net, and to preserve national unity, the Government 
affirms that a legacy of hope can be left to future generations.
<P>
	<I>Members of the House of Commons:</I>
<P>
	You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out 
the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
<P>
	May Divine Providence guide all of you in your deliberations.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Mr. Bob Kilger, member for the electoral district of Stormont-Dundas, 
be appointed deputy chairman of the committee of the whole House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am rising 
on a point of debate with regard to this motion.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words with regard to this motion and 
the appointment of deputy chairman of committees of the whole 
House. I am not taking exception at all with regard to the person 
who is appointed. I certainly give due respect for that person.
<P>
	I am rising on the basis of principle. I raise a matter which was 
brought into the House of Commons via the Liberal red book and 
also under a paper entitled ``Reviving Parliamentary Democracy: 
the Liberal Plan for the House of Commons and Electoral 
Reform''. This paper was submitted at an earlier date by members 
of the opposition, at that time, the member for Cape Breton-East 
Richmond; opposition House leader, the member of Saint-Léonard; 
chief opposition whip, the member for Kingston and the Islands; 
assistant House leader, the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	In their statement they agreed to the independence of the Chair:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce 
the level of partisanship, when the Speaker is from the government party, two of 
the junior chair officers should be from the oppositions so that the four 
presiding officer positions are shared equally by government and opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The paper further suggests that the Speaker and Deputy Speaker 
positions could alternate between government and opposition, the 
Deputy Chairperson could be from the government, and the fourth 
person from the opposition. There would then be equity and 
balance between the two sides of the House.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	In the Liberal red book the Prime Minister stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So you can come with this book every week in front of me after I'm Prime 
Minister and say: ``Where are you with your promises?''</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7"> 7 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised he would carry out this policy of 
his caucus, which he is not doing today.
<P>
	I used the privilege of giving prior notice to the Prime Minister 
on February 7, 1996 by letter, quoting the policy of the 
government: ``I would appreciate your examination of this and in 
this House, the second session of the 35th Parliament, that you 
would introduce this new policy''.
<P>
	Again the Prime Minister has forgotten about the red book. He 
has forgotten about the promises to Canadians and has turned down 
that policy. I ask clearly of the Prime Minister today, why did he 
not keep his promise? He still has a chance before we finalize this 
motion to allow an opposition member to be appointed to the 
position we have now discussed. It is incumbent upon the Prime 
Minister, if he is unable to do it, to explain to the people of Canada 
why he has again broken a red book promise that should be held.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief. During the first session we realized that the 
government was having a lot of trouble keeping its promises, and 
the speech from the throne we just heard does not bode well in this 
respect.
<P>
	There was a suggestion in the famous red book, which I will read 
to you, since on the other side of the House they have made a habit 
of reading from the red book, although practising what it says is 
another matter altogether. I read this to refresh the government's 
memory: ``In order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in 
an effort to reduce the level of partisanship, when the Speaker is 
from the government party, two of the junior chair officers should 
be from the oppositions so that the four presiding officers' 
positions are shared equally by government and opposition''. It 
seems this was discussed during the election campaign. I admit we 
did not hear much about it in Quebec, but apparently it was a very 
popular topic in the rest of Canada. There was some reference to 
the British habit of giving presiding officers' positions to members 
of the opposition.
<P>
	To give the government a chance to keep one of its promises, for 
a change, we intend to support this motion. This should be a simple 
matter, because although it seems they have a lot of trouble 
convincing the public, this time it would just be a matter of 
convincing the caucus. I know that in some areas, the Prime 
Minister has trouble convincing not just his caucus but his cabinet 
as well. We are giving him a chance here. It seems pretty 
straightforward, and I hardly think it would create too many 
problems in caucus to find two positions for the people who would 
otherwise be appointed Chairman and Deputy Chairman. I may add 
this is no reflection on the qualifications of the people who are 
being proposed, including the hon. member whose name was 
proposed just now and for whom I have the greatest respect.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the House leaders of the two opposition parties have made some 
interesting suggestions.
<P>
	My first response is that my recollection of what has been quoted 
is with respect to a document published some months before the 
red book and is not in the red book as such. I suggest this would be 
a topic worthy of consideration by the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs when it is constituted later on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition in the 
House for his support of the British usage. It is very interesting to 
see this support for the British usage, which is fundamental to the 
whole of Canada's constitutional context.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois for 
support of British usage because this is one of the foundations of 
what we are proud to see as one united Canada from sea to sea to 
sea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to indicate to those members of the House who may not 
know that the recommendation that the speakership be more 
non-partisan by having members of the opposition appointed to 
various positions in the chain of command from the Speaker on 
down was considered by a standing committee of the House in the 
last Parliament. It was unanimously recommended by a standing 
committee of the House of Commons in the last Parliament and 
was approved by the Liberals at that time. It did not originate in the 
red book nor did it originate with the people who are now on the 
government side. It originated from a careful consideration of what 
would be in the interests of Parliament by members of all parties in 
the last Parliament.
<P>
	The recommendation was made and I see no reason why it 
cannot be lived up to. Therefore, I would like to join in whatever 
criticism is being offered to the government for not living up to that 
promise.
<P>
	I might also say that when we listen to rhetoric about the House 
and co-operation and non-partisanship, I as the NDP House leader 
have been around all day and no one from the Reform Party took 
the time or the courtesy to let me know this was going to happen. If 
we want to work together and we want to talk about 
non-partisanship, then let us work together and not surprise each 
other in these ways.
<P>

<P>
	<I>Before the taking of the vote:</I>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
a point of order.
<P>
	There appears to be some debate whether or not the matter to be 
voted on is a matter that is included in the so-called red book. I 
have had an opportunity to review the red book, in particular 
appendix B, which is platform papers. The appendix refers to a 
document dated January 19, 1993 entitled ``Reviving 
Parliamentary Democracy: The Liberal Plan for House of 
Commons and Electoral Reform''.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member rose on a point of order. I would 
ask him to put his point forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of the concern, I would ask 
that you seek the unanimous consent of the House prior to the vote 
to have the appointment of officers referred to a committee to give 
consideration to the commitment that would appear to be in the red 
book.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the member have unanimous consent to put 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question is on the motion.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="APPOINTMENTOFASSISTANTDEPUTYSPEAKER">APPOINTMENT OF ASSISTANT DEPUTY SPEAKER</A></H4>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais, member for the electoral district of 
Madawaska-Victoria, be appointed Assistant Deputy Chairman of Committees 
of the Whole House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say again 
to the Prime Minister that we in this House would like to give him a 
second chance to meet the commitment he made to Canadians 
through the red book. The hon. member pointed out very clearly 
that the policy of the Liberal government is there in appendix B, 
endorsed, enunciated, clarified and committed to by this 
government. However, the government is not prepared to live up to 
those commitments. When will the government do that? It is very 
clear that it should at this point in time.
<P>
	We are going to vote against the motion. Again it will be on 
principle, but it will be a little different from the  other one. We do 
not agree with the Prime Minister's appointment in this case. 
Therefore, it is for two reasons that we will vote against the motion 
if it is to proceed.
<P>
	I want to say this clearly and I want it on the record. On the last 
motion we voted on principle to reject the motion. We did not reject 
the appointee. The person named by the Prime Minister in that 
motion is acceptable to the Reform Party. However, in this 
instance, the hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria is not 
acceptable as far as we are concerned.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I believe that we must set the ground rules in this House so they 
are fair to all members of the House, whether they are on the 
government side or the opposition side. The ground rules for the 
second session of the 35th Parliament are being set in a manner that 
is going to be unfair with respect to the openness and the 
opportunity for us to debate in a fair manner. That is the way it is.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to say clearly to you it is our intent to vote 
against this motion and to have a standing vote not only to record 
the Prime Minister's rejection of his own policy but also to indicate 
our lack of support for the appointee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will also vote against this motion, and not because of 
the choice of the individual, particularly because she is a woman, 
and I think women should be given prominence in this House.
<P>
	What we do oppose, however, is the method being used. The 
party in government should give some thought to the fact that it 
could still keep one of its promises without too much difficulty. We 
will therefore await its decision. It could perhaps make this motion 
with respect to other committees or other positions, but in this 
particular case, I think it should recall the red book. We are not 
opposed to the individual, but rather to the approach and the many 
forgotten promises, need I say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems to me this whole unfortunate mess could have been avoided 
if the government had shown a little imagination and innovation by 
living up to its own commitments. They are not radical 
commitments but things that have been done in other Parliaments 
and other legislatures that were quite doable.
<P>
	Having said that, I regret that the Reform Party has made this a 
personal matter with respect to the appointment. I say on behalf of 
the NDP that we will continue to vote against these motions as a 
way of registering our objection to the fact the government did not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10"> 10 </A></B>
<P>
take the opportunity to bring in these reforms. It is  not because we 
are making any statement about the person who has been suggested 
by the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise and speak to the motion before us 
concerning the appointment of the assistant deputy chair.
<P>
	In the much vaunted Liberal red book the government indicated 
it would enact certain reforms to ensure the House functioned in a 
more democratic and open process. As part of that promise the 
Liberals said that two of the junior chairs or deputy chair positions 
would go to the opposition parties.
<P>
	While in opposition the Liberals submitted a paper entitled 
``Reviving Parliamentary Democracy''. This paper was signed onto 
by the chief government whip. One of the recommendations was 
that in order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an 
effort to reduce the level of partisanship, two of the junior chair 
officers should be from the opposition side of the House.
<P>
	Like so many other Liberal initiatives, it would appear to be a 
case of saying one thing while in opposition then doing nothing or 
another thing once in power. Like so many other Liberal promises, 
the commitment to enhancing democratic practice in the House of 
Commons will not be served by this motion to appoint both deputy 
chairs from the government side.
<P>
	In particular the motion appointing the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria is as much an affront to the principles of 
fairness in this House as it is counterproductive to the goal of 
enhancing the independence of the Chair. It is on this point that I 
would like to elaborate for members in this Chamber.
<P>
	There has been much comment lately about the chief 
government whip's intention to bring the Reform House leader 
before the Bar of the House on a charge of contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	Given the hon. member's shortcomings as joint chair of the 
Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages, the motion to 
appoint the member for Madawaska-Victoria as assistant deputy 
chair can rightly be viewed by Reform MPs as contemptuous. As 
chair of the standing joint committee the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria-
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, on the matter of debate, your Speaker 
gives every latitude in the debate itself but I would appeal to the 
hon. member to be very judicious in his choice of words. I would 
ask him to keep that in mind for the remainder of his address to the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, as joint chair of the 
standing joint committee the member for Madawaska-Victoria 
has shown nothing but condescension for her opposition colleagues 
when addressing their concerns. On several occasions the  member 
in question has gone so far as to not even allow the committee clerk 
to answer the questions of opposition MPs. Sadly, this member in 
her duties as joint chair has even impeded the ability of Reform 
members to bring forward motions.
<P>
	In terms of being able to apply the standing orders of the House 
in a fair and even-handed manner, the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria has been unfair in the application of those 
very standing orders in committee on everything from the election 
of co-chair to not permitting votes on whether the chair should be 
sustained in her rulings. The hon. member has run roughshod over 
the legitimate responsibilities of fellow committee members, yet 
the government has the audacity to put this member's name 
forward for consideration as assistant deputy chair. What is even 
more ludicrous is that the government expects it to go uncontested 
by fair minded members who deserve and expect that the Chair be 
objective in its dealings with all members.
<P>
	While in this House and during a debate on the MP pension plan, 
the member for Madawaska-Victoria showed a penchant for the 
type of close physical contact that appears to be the trademark of 
members across the way. Given the hon. Prime Minister's recent 
actions at a flag day ceremony in Hull, this would perhaps serve to 
explain the rationale behind the motion to appoint the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria as assistant deputy chair.
<P>
	In closing, if this motion is to stand as a reflection of the 
government's commitment to enhance democratic procedure in the 
House, then Canadians might well ask whether they are well served 
by this government at all. Furthermore I call on members from both 
sides of the House to reject the appointment of the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria as assistant deputy chair.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
intend to be as long in my remarks but I will intervene to go on the 
record today that we are opposed to the motion. It is not for 
personal reasons, not for the reasons that my colleague just evoked 
and certainly not for personal reasons in regard to the motion that 
was just voted on in the House of Commons. It is that the 
government made a commitment and clearly has not lived up to 
that commitment. It is also my understanding that in these matters 
the government would usually consult with the opposition parties 
with regard to the nominations if only out of courtesy and in 
respect to the functioning of the House of Commons.
<P>
	As I comment on why we are equally opposed to this motion, I 
cannot miss the opportunity to point out the incredible hypocrisy of 
Reform Party members. They have the gall to talk of fairness to all 
members as they speak and the same hypocrisy of a political party 
whose members ran saying that they would not apply personal 
politics to the House of Commons, that they would not behave the 
way other parties have behaved.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11"> 11 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Can you hear them now, Mr. Speaker, trying to 
shout me down? This is the same group of people who said that 
they could do politics differently. I hope Canadians will judge as 
they can judge all members of the Reform Party, including their 
colleague, Sugar Ray Grey.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak specifically to the principle involved here. I am 
looking at the red book put forward by the Liberals.
<P>
	Quoting page 91, in the last election the Liberals said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadians have always prided themselves on the quality of their democratic 
institutions. Yet after nine years of Conservative rule, cynicism about public 
institutions, governments, politicians, and the political process is at an all-time 
high.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I parenthesize here to state that they had not taken into account 
their own hypocrisy with respect to the commitments they were 
making to the people in the red book because in 1996 it is even 
higher than it was in 1993.
<P>
	I continue from the red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honest and 
integrity in our political institutions must be restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable. There is evidence today of considerable 
dissatisfaction with government and a steady erosion of confidence in the 
people and institutions of the public sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This erosion of confidence seems to have many causes: some have to do with 
the behaviour of certain elected politicians, others with an arrogant style of 
political leadership.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A few minutes ago the House leader for the Liberals talked about 
the statement that there were to be people elected from the 
opposition parties to fill the role of deputy chair. His direct 
inference-he is welcome to correct me if I misunderstood 
him-was basically that because it was not in the body of the red 
book it was not a promise.
<P>
	On the back page of the red book, appendix B, platform papers, it 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These policy statements were released by the Liberal Party on the dates 
shown. Copies may be obtained by writing to the Liberal Party of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One of the listings is <I>Reviving Parliamentary Democracy: The 
Liberal Plan for House of Commons and Electoral Reform</I>.
<P>
	I draw to the member's attention, and if there are any fair minded 
Liberals in the House I draw this to their attention, that my House 
leader was reading from <I>Reviving Parliamentary Democracy: The 
Liberal Plan for House of Commons and Electoral Reform</I>, the 
document referred to in the appendix of the red book.
<P>
	Although it appears within the binding of the red book as 
appendix B, if the House leader and the rest of the Liberals are 
saying that because this document was not quoted and not included 
in the body of the red book we cannot take the Liberals seriously, I 
suggest what we have been subjected to as Canadians with the red 
book is a trick, a ruse and a deception. There is no other way around 
it.
<P>
	I call on all fair minded people in the House to take into account 
that the Minister of Health, the Minister of Labour, the member for 
Kingston and the Islands, and the Liberal government whip applied 
their names to this document which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce 
the level of partisanship, when the Speaker is from the government party, two of 
the junior chair officers should be from the opposition, so that the four presiding 
officer positions are shared equally by government and opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	If this was said by those four members, and indeed their names 
are applied to it, and if this document is referred to within the 
covers of the Liberal red book, I ask any fair minded member of the 
Liberal Party to at least abstain and if they have any backbone to 
vote against this appointment. Otherwise they will be failing on a 
matter of personal principle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I completely and unequivocally support the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria
<P>
	It is unfortunate and regrettable that the Reform Party has 
personalized this rather important procedure we are going through. 
It now has gone beyond whether there was a commitment in the red 
book to have two of the junior officers from the opposition parties. 
This is the first time in the 11 or 12 years I have been in Parliament 
that the appointment or the election of the Speaker, the Deputy 
Speaker or junior officers of the chair has been politicized and 
personalized to the extent it has been today.
<P>
	In order for you, Mr. Speaker, to be effective and in order for the 
Chair to be effective, you must together with your junior officers 
have the support and respect of all members and all parties in the 
House.
<P>
	The moment the election of a Speaker or Deputy Speaker is 
decided on a partisan or party basis and once the matter becomes 
personalized, it is a very sad reflection on Parliament as a whole.
<P>
	Earlier I tried to have the matter referred to a committee for 
further consideration. Some members of the House in their wisdom 
decided they would rather have a vote and personalize and 
politicize the election of the junior officers.
<P>
	I abstained in the first vote because I believe that if we made a 
commitment in the election we should keep that commitment. I 
intend to abstain from this vote as well,  not because I disagree in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12"> 12 </A></B>
<P>
any way with the appointment of the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria but because I disagree with the manner in 
which this matter is being dealt with today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will speak briefly to this matter because it is 
something I was involved with earlier in my role as House leader 
for the Reform Party in the previous session of this Parliament.
<P>
	It is not that the government was not aware of this promise. We 
talked about it in the procedure and House affairs committee and in 
the House. A commitment was made, a promise to change the way 
Deputy Speakers are selected. The government recognized and 
acknowledged in committee and in the House that it was a policy it 
had endorsed and that its party stood behind.
<P>
	We are two years into the 35th Parliament and nothing has 
happened. Now there is a motion before us today to debate. This is 
a free country and we are allowed to speak. We should be consulted 
about who is being proposed. However, we were told who was 
being appointed. That is not consultation. We were not asked to 
work with the government in choosing Deputy Speakers. We were 
just told this was the way it was to be.
<P>
	It is quite appropriate for those who have to deal with the Chair 
to be able to make comments before a person is appointed.
<P>
	We have worked in committee and in the House with the person 
proposed to fill this position. At various times we have been slurred 
by this person. This person has been unparliamentary toward us. 
This person has denied us our parliamentary privileges. Certainly 
we cannot speak after a person is appointed. That is not the time to 
speak. The time to speak is before the damage is done while we can 
still fix it and help the Liberal government to fulfil a promise it 
made.
<P>
	Today is an important day. It is the first day of the second session 
of this Parliament. The governor general has just read the speech 
from the throne and expects Canadians to believe the government 
will keep its promises and keep its commitments to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Here is one of the simplest promises the government could have 
kept. It ignored it. It has flaunted us with its failure to keep its 
promises. Then it expects us and Canadians to believe it will keep 
its word, its commitment to Canadians about jobs, its commitment 
to Canadians about good reform to social programs. I doubt it. The 
government is playing games. It is playing with words. It does not 
prove its actions by its deeds.
<P>
	The government could withdraw this motion. It could consult 
with us properly. It could commit to its promises. Then we would 
have a better Parliament. We would have  a better situation in the 
House and we would be able to get on with the nation's business in 
an appropriate way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a sad day for parliamentary democracy, in my 
opinion, when certain members choose to launch a personal attack 
on someone whom I believe to be worthy of the confidence of 
everyone in this House. The member for Madawaska-Victoria has 
a most distinguished career to her credit, both politically and 
personally.
<P>
	She has studied at l'Université de Moncton and l'Université 
Laval and holds both a bachelor's and a master's degree. She has 
rendered distinguished service as deputy speaker of the legislature 
in her home province of New Brunswick, bringing the wealth of 
that experience with her to this House when she was elected to it. 
Furthermore, she has been a member of the New Brunswick 
chapter of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and has 
acquitted herself in a distinguished manner during several missions 
as an election observer. I believe that her outstanding contributions 
should make all of us parliamentarians proud to have someone of 
the calibre of the hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria as a 
colleague.
<P>
	It is rather sad to see something like this happening. Certain 
members of the Reform Party have every right to say that a 
government could have made a promise, ought to have, or 
whatever. It is certain that the government, as it has indicated today 
in the speech from the throne, has already fulfilled close to 75 per 
cent of its commitments by this mid-point in its mandate, with 
more yet to come. The House leader also brought to our attention 
today the government's readiness to refer the matter to a 
parliamentary committee. He made that same offer, moreover, a 
little earlier on, when speaking about another appointment.
<P>
	It is now obvious that this was not what the Reformers wanted. 
Some of them, in fact, have indicated that what they had in mind 
was not referring the matter to a parliamentary committee-since 
that was what the House leader was offering to do-but rather 
attacking a subsequent appointment, choosing as their victim not 
only another colleague in the House, not only the only woman 
among the four nominees, not only a member of a francophone 
minority community, but also a distinguished parliamentarian, one 
with experience in the Chair and in a legislative assembly. Let them 
go ahead and do so. The people of Canada will judge them for their 
actions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my remarks will be brief, but I am sure I speak for my 
colleagues in the official opposition in roundly criticizing attitudes 
targeting individuals who hold values that the official opposition is 
proud to defend.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13"> 13 </A></B>
<P>
	There is such a thing as respect for people, and I think that, 
when Canada's Parliament allows respect for individuals to fall 
by the wayside through comments made, we must speak out, and 
I am grateful to my colleague for having talked about this totally 
unacceptable attitude.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few comments I would like to add to the debate. What we 
are really debating is the integrity of the government and its 
willingness and ability to keep its promises.
<P>
	It is very symbolic on the day of the throne speech at the start of 
the second session of this Parliament to hear the general statements 
made. I know this is not a debate on that speech, but with those 
general promises Canadians have good reason to wonder that if 
they cannot trust the government on the small things, can they trust 
it on the larger ones?
<P>
	As was pointed out by government members, a promise was 
made to appoint deputy chair positions from the opposition 
benches. This seems to follow the trend on any democratic reforms 
which the Liberal government has talked about, which is the 
tendency to ignore the very things on which it campaigned.
<P>
	For example, we have yet to see free votes in the House of 
Commons. Where are they? They are not here. It is a sad thing and 
something which could easily be remedied by a statement from the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	In a few days we will go through the charade of the election of 
the co-chairs of committees. When that comes up we will again see 
what will happen. The whip will tell party members who will be the 
chairs. The people sitting opposite are just voting machines. They 
are robots. They are seals. That is a shame because there are some 
very competent people over there who could be doing much more.
<P>
	The government appointed an ethics counsellor. The ethics 
counsellor does not report to the House, but to the Prime Minister 
behind closed doors. That is not an ethics counsellor. That is 
someone who barks on demand. That is not good enough.
<P>
	Now we have the latest broken promise, a promise printed in 
black and white in the red book: to appoint the chairs from the 
second and third parties.
<P>
	I also have to comment on some of the things which have been 
said regarding the way this person was selected. I have heard three 
comments made in the House which have indicated that the reason 
this person should be selected is because she is female and she is 
from a minority position in a province.
<P>
	The government has done itself a disservice. There are many 
competent women in the House who could fulfil  the role. 
However, the government needs to look for a consensus among the 
parties for the people that have the respect of the parties and of all 
members to hold that chair; that neutral position. That is what 
should determine it, not the gender of the person.
<P>
	I do not think anyone here, of either gender, would say that they 
have in the past felt slighted because someone of another gender 
was in the Chair. That is ridiculous. It is a preposterous way to 
choose someone for the position. It is a mistake to select people 
based on their gender for the very important role about which we 
are talking today.
<P>
	I would like to add that after the hon. member for Sherbrooke 
rose to add his particular brand of whatever one would call it to this 
debate, I have to say that we have nothing to learn from the 
Conservatives when it comes to democratic reform. Absolutely 
nothing.
<P>
	We watched in disdain from afar his government over eight years 
use one example after another of absolutely contemptuous 
behaviour toward the House of Commons and the people in it. The 
only thing he is right about is that it seems the members over there 
on the Liberal side have learned well. It is a shame on them. It is a 
shame to this Parliament. It brings about the entire issue that this 
whole thing is symbolic of: You cannot trust the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government whip said that this is a sad day in the 
House of Commons and I have to agree with him. It is a sad day in 
the House when another promise contained in the Liberal red book 
has been broken once again.
<P>
	Reform members have sat here day after day for the last two 
years and have watched over and over again as the government has 
failed to fulfil promises which it made in its infamous red book. 
Congratulations, once again, to the Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. government whip mentioned in his comments two 
words, confidence and trust of this House. I am sure hon. members 
will agree with me that the characteristics of confidence, trust and 
respect are not something that is taken on as a mantle with this 
appointment. Indeed, confidence, trust and respect must be earned. 
It is not something that is bestowed on a person.
<P>
	As members of my party have pointed out earlier, the member 
for Madawaska-Victoria in her duties on the committees that she 
has chaired has not exhibited the characteristics of confidence and 
trust. This party would not be comfortable with having that person 
in the chair as Acting Speaker.
<P>
	For this reason I must oppose the appointment of this person as 
well as the mechanism by which this appointment is being made, in 
blatant disregard of the promise of the Liberal red book.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14"> 14 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also like to refer to the statements made by the member 
for Sherbrooke in respect to his comments of our party talking 
of hypocrisy. Let me remind the House that this is the same 
member who not more than a year ago on national television said 
that some day Canadians will realize what a great Prime Minister 
Brian Mulroney was. Enough said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a short comment for the record to clarify or counter 
what was said by the other side of the House.
<P>
	I want to make it absolutely clear that when we vote against the 
person proposed it is not because she is female, it is not because of 
where she is from, it is not because of her French connection. There 
is a certain level of partisanship in this House. I get along with 
some people on the other side of the House very well. They are 
very fair-minded. I may disagree with them. I may agree with 
them. But it does not alter the fact that they are presenting their 
views very clearly and very fairly.
<P>
	There are some on the other side of the House that come from the 
west that are male, that are anglophone, that I would not want to see 
in that position either. We are voting because of the characteristics 
of the partisanship of this individual, not because of gender, 
language or any other factor.
<P>
	There is a history in this Parliament in the first session of very 
credible people sitting in the chair that you now occupy, Mr. 
Speaker. At the very least the Liberal government should keep up 
that tradition.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add to the statement of my colleague. This is exactly 
what we are on about. It is not a personalized instance at all.
<P>
	Basically what we are talking about is merit and how we 
perceive it. There are other choices in this House and we feel that 
based on merit that this is not a good choice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enter this debate by recollecting the day that you were elected as 
Speaker of this House. I was so impressed as a rookie MP coming 
into this House to see how the Speaker was elected to the office, the 
august position that you hold, to keep impartial judgment of what 
happens and to apply the rules in a fair and accurate manner so that 
everybody would be treated fairly.
<P>
	I commend you for all the good things you have done and I 
commend the Liberal Party, the government, for the way in which 
this House started. It was wonderful. However we have seen that 
degenerate to the point where we are today debating a promise that 
was made and is now being ignored. There is a denial of the very 
good place where this House started, the way in which you were 
elected, Mr. Speaker. I honour and respect and have great 
confidence in that.
<P>
	We are now seeing a degeneration of that very noble start into 
something that has become partisan, that has become personal. It is 
a denigration of the respect that this House should enjoy in the 
hearts and the minds of every Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	I am not proud to have to say this today. Mr. Speaker, I appeal to 
you that this motion be withdrawn and that a fair and accurate 
election take place of this individual to the office of Acting Speaker 
at the level that is being proposed in this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all I have to say to you is that I am certainly 
glad you do not have to be appointed today.
<P>
	As I sit here and listen to the debate I am particularly concerned 
about the way it has been personalized. The hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria is a very intelligent young person who has 
had considerable experience. The government promised that when 
it got into office it would put responsible people into responsible 
positions.
<P>
	The hon. member for Surrey North said that it is not a 
personalized matter, yet the hon. member for Lethbridge started the 
debate by saying that Reform members personally did not support 
the person who has been nominated. It was made a personalized 
matter by the Reform Party this afternoon.
<P>
	I was interested in another comment made by the hon. member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster who accused others of playing 
games in this House. The hon. member for Fraser Valley East 
talked about integrity. He said that they had nothing to learn from 
the Conservatives. They have learned too much from the 
Conservatives. Today we have heard about hypocrisy and so on.
<P>
	The hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria has my total 
confidence. She has the total confidence of her constituents, the 
people in that region and right across Canada. If we are going to 
have confidence and trust in office-this is a very key point down 
the road-and this debate has made it a personal matter, what is 
going to happen when the hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria 
takes the chair?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> This is the very point.
<P>
	Every member in the House has a right to take a responsible 
position but never in the history of Parliament or ever in the history 
of Parliaments to come should the Chair be condemned because of 
a personal battle. It has become that today. I heard one member go 
on at great length about how the member for Madawaska-Victoria 
handled the chair in a committee. When it comes to the chair of the 
House of Commons no member in this House should be thinking 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15"> 15 </A></B>
<P>
about carrying  personal grudges or old debts against the person 
sitting in the chair of the House of Commons.
<P>
	I am very sorry this has been made a personal matter by the 
House leader of the Reform Party and others. They came into the 
House saying that they were going to lay down new conduct in the 
House of Commons. They cannot do that if they are going to attack 
people personally. We are here to debate but this chair here must 
have the confidence of all members in the House when a person is 
put in it.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I say to you that we should let the vote go forward 
as long as we do not have a whole batch of other speakers to hold 
the House up today. Let us elect this person to the position of chair 
in a democratic fashion on the floor of this House.
<P>
	The conduct of the Reform Party today has been to accuse others 
of hypocrisy. They have spent a lot of time talking about new ideas 
of being civil in the House of Commons and so on. One cannot 
accuse an individual of not being capable of taking the chair when 
one has the background the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria has.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Today when the hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria is 
elected by a vote in the House of Commons as one of the 
chairpersons, it is up to the Reform Party to respect her when she is 
in the chair on future occasions and not carry the old grudges from 
Parliament or committees into the House. Let us run this in a 
civilized manner. However, the House can run in a civilized 
manner only if the people who say they came here to change the 
House run it in a civilized manner themselves. It is not up to just a 
few people to be civil; everybody must be civil.
<P>
	In fairness, let us get on with the democratic vote and let the 
chips fall where they may. However, after this person is elected let 
us respect the Chair of the House of Commons of Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
proposal from the committee was intended to eliminate 
partisanship from the management, if I may put it that way, of the 
debates in the House. Had the government implemented it, we 
would not have had this debate, which, far from eliminating 
partisanship, does the very opposite.
<P>
	I regret the fact that, in their defence of their position, the 
members of the Reform Party are in fact helping to make it 
partisan. Had the government done what it ought to, our Reform 
colleagues would have proposed someone as deputy speaker, I hope 
it would have been a woman, and I would not criticize her, 
particularly on the basis of incidents that allegedly occurred in a 
committee where I was not present.
<P>
	I think the spirit was to have each party participate in the 
management of the House and therefore each party believed that 
those it proposed were best suited to ensure that debates were 
appropriate to the institution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening to this debate and I bring forward a 
slogan taught to me as a child. It is something we have forgotten 
about today.
<P>
	I was always taught that an ounce of prevention was worth a 
pound of cure. Today we heard a throne speech in which the 
government made commitments to bring unity to the country, to 
depend on provinces and negotiate with them under the 
circumstances of honour and trust. The government knew there 
were hard feelings on some of these issues. If it had wanted to 
prevent this it could have exercised an ounce of prevention. It could 
have been very easily done if it had consulted with all the House 
leaders and had put forward all of the people it wanted to put into 
the chair.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the way you have run the House. I 
know I am probably not one of your favourite constituents but I 
still respect and honour you for what you have done. However, 
what the government is trying to do right now is going against 
exhibits you have shown to the House such as fairness, respect and 
discipline. If we want to correct that we will have to put pounds of 
cure into the House to ever receive the trust of the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess it is 
politics as usual. I know when this 35th session of Parliament 
started we had promises of things being done differently from the 
Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The opposition parties have referred to some appendices 
included in the red book. We hear the carping coming our way from 
the members of the third party. There were issues stated in the red 
book such as gun control which they very much wanted the 
government to oppose. We did not. We kept our promises.
<P>
	They wanted us to reject the infrastructure program in the body 
of the red book. They wanted us to gut national health care. We had 
it in the red book. We kept those promises. They did not want us to 
keep our promise of reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP in 
three years.
<P>
	When they talk about some appendices of the red book, when 
they have done nothing but stand up and oppose what we have done 
in terms of keeping the commitments spelled out in the red book, it 
is a degree of hypocrisy in terms of the arguments. As far as 
personal attacks on the proposed junior officer, again I say to the 
Reform Party, shame.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before we proceed to the consideration of the 
speech of His Excellency the Governor General of Canada, I wish 
to address the matter of the designation of the official opposition. 
Members will recall that in the last session on December 14, 1995 
the hon. member for Lethbridge raised a point of order and 
presented arguments supporting his contention that the Reform 
Party should be designated the official opposition.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform 
Party are now tied with 52 seats each in the House. It is within this 
new context that I must address the House today. While 
prorogation terminates all outstanding business before the House 
including points of order, in this case there are mitigating 
circumstances that compel me to refer to arguments presented by 
hon. members last December.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before doing so, I want to make a few remarks concerning the 
role of the Speaker in situations such as this. In some jurisdictions 
faced with similar questions, the laws or rules of those legislatures 
give the Speaker precise powers to designate the official 
opposition, or specify the criteria upon which the designation of 
official opposition is to be made. In such cases, the Speaker is left 
with no discretion in the matter. I would refer hon. members to the 
Ministerial and other Salaries Act, 1975, of the United Kingdom, 
and the Legislative Assembly and Executive Council Act, of 
Saskatchewan as examples.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Here in the House of Commons, however, there are no such rules 
or guidelines. On December 14 several members who contributed 
to the discussion contended that it was up to me as Speaker to 
decide this question. The hon. member for Elk Island, after raising 
the idea that the official opposition may be considered as a 
government in waiting, went as far as to state on page 17677 of the 
debates:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of the decision you are 
about to make in the next six weeks. You are being called upon to decide who 
would form the Government of Canada in the event the Liberals resigned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you decide Canadians are best served by a party whose stated objective, 
which it has demonstrated in the last two years consistently, is to break the 
country into two pieces, you would err greatly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I must respectfully differ with the hon. member. Your Speaker of 
the House has no role to play in the selection of a government. In 
our system the Speaker chooses neither the government nor the 
government in waiting. That prerogative belongs to the Governor 
General of Canada on the advice of his privy council.
<P>
	To put the Speaker in a position in which he would be choosing 
not only the official opposition but perhaps the next government 
based not on any objective criteria such as numbers in the House 
but rather on a qualitative judgment about the performance of the 
current official opposition party seems to me an untenable 
proposition. It would also be an encroachment on the royal 
prerogative and a violation of our long established constitutional 
practices.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unless the House wishes, either in the rules or in legislation, to 
give the Speaker precise powers and guidelines by which to 
designate the official opposition, I must state at the outset that I do 
not feel it is within my power to make such a decision, based on the 
argument advanced by the hon. member for Elk Island.
<P>
	As I did when preparing my June 16, 1994 ruling on the 
designation of party status for members of the New  Democratic 
Party, I have again looked to the rulings of my predecessors for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17"> 17 </A></B>
<P>
guidance in understanding my role in dealing with such 
unprecedented cases. In 1963, Speaker MacNaughton was asked to 
rule on the question of seating of opposition parties in the 
Chamber. At that time, he commented at length on what he 
perceived to be the role of the Speaker in such matters. This 
statement can be found at pages 385 to 388 of the <I>Journals</I> for 
September 30, 1963. I feel that much of what he said is relevant to 
the current circumstances and have used his words as a guide in 
examining the matter.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to quote again certain sections of Speaker 
MacNaughton's statement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The legal rights and duties of the Speaker are to be found in the Statutes of 
Canada, the Standing Orders of the House, in the Constitutional and 
Parliamentary authors and finally in the customs and precedents which have 
become constitutional conventions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to Campion, the Speaker is the representative of the House itself, 
in its powers, proceedings and dignity and the chief characteristics attaching to 
the office of Speaker of the House of Commons are authority and 
impartiality-.It is in consequence among the duties of the Speaker to see that 
the Standing Orders of the House are followed in the course of its procedures 
and that the privileges of the House, once they have been defined and 
recognized, are protected. It is also the duty of the Speaker to be impartial and 
removed from politics-.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Allow me to refer once more to the special traditions that surround the Office 
of the Speaker. While he is the servant of the House he is, at the same time, its 
spokesman and its symbol. His value to the House and its Members continues 
effectively only when the House assists him in every way to maintain his dignity 
and his impartiality-.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It seems to me that-a situation such as that now facing the House must be 
resolved by the House itself. It is not one where the Speaker ought by himself to 
take a position where any group of members might feel that their interests as a 
group or a party have been prejudiced. Nor should the Speaker be put in a 
position where he must decide, to the advantage or to the disadvantage of any 
group or party, matters affecting the character or existence of a party, for this 
surely would signify that the Speaker has taken what is almost a political 
decision, a decision where the question involves the rights and privileges of the 
House itself.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The designation of the official opposition has never been decided 
on the floor of the House of Commons. As Speaker, I am entrusted 
with the responsibility of ensuring the orderly conduct of business 
in the House. To do so, I must now determine, in light of the tie 
situation and the point of order raised, which party shall form the 
official opposition.
<P>
	It is a cornerstone of our democratic tradition that government 
rests on the consent of the governed. This means that the minority 
accepts the right of the majority  to make decisions provided that 
the right of the minority to be heard, to dissent, to air grievances 
and to promote alternative policies is respected.
<P>
	The role of an opposition in our form of parliamentary 
government is therefore fundamental. Its leadership is equally 
important.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For this reason, Parliament has seen fit to acknowledge the 
importance of the individual holding the position of Leader of the 
Official Opposition by providing this person with support and 
allowances similar to those granted to the Prime Minister. As well, 
in its procedures the House recognizes the significance of this 
position, despite the lack of any official definition thereof.
<P>
	The position of Leader of the Official Opposition is firmly 
anchored in our parliamentary system of government through 
practice and the implementation of various statutes and rules of 
procedure. The importance of the Official Opposition and its leader 
has been commented on both in Canada and in other countries with 
Westminister style Parliaments for well over a century.
<P>
	The question of which party would assume the role of the official 
opposition, however, has never been an issue in our House of 
Commons until now. As the hon. member for Lethbridge pointed 
out, perhaps it is for this reason that there has never been any 
definition or method of designating the official opposition or the 
leader of the opposition in either our statutes or standing orders.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Without written rules detailing the procedures for the selection 
of the official opposition, the title has traditionally been assumed 
by the party which held the second highest number of seats in the 
House of Commons. The one exception occurred after the 1921 
general election when the Progressive Party won the second highest 
number of seats but, because of their support of the government of 
the day, declined to assume the role of official opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his submission, the hon. member for Lethbridge cited three 
precedents to support his claim that the Reform Party should be 
designated the official opposition. The first precedent the hon. 
member cited illustrated his contention that, in the case of an 
equality of seats, popular vote and the range of interests 
represented by a party should determine which party is designated 
the official opposition. The other two precedents, he suggested, 
indicated that where doubt exists in the choice of the official 
opposition, members of the opposition have been allowed to select 
their leader; the Speaker has had a role to play in this process; and  
parties which have not had the second highest number of seats in 
the legislature have become the official opposition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="18"> 18 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While all three precedents occurred in circumstances quite 
different from our present situation, for the benefit of hon. 
members I would like to comment on each.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first precedent referred to by the hon. member was the ruling 
of Speaker Amerongen in Alberta in 1983. I have reviewed this 
ruling and the circumstances in which it was given.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, this matter was raised at the 
beginning of a new legislature following a general election. The 
opposition was composed of two New Democrats and two 
independent members. Both the leader of the NDP and the then 
member for Little Bow, who is currently the hon. member for 
Lethbridge in our House, had sought recognition as leader of the 
official opposition. As the hon. member pointed out, the Alberta 
speaker based his decision to grant official opposition status to the 
New Democratic Party, in part, on the popular vote received by the 
New Democratic Party.
<P>
	However, in a ruling on the designation of the New Brunswick 
official opposition given by Speaker Dysart on December 16, 1994, 
a ruling referred to by the chief government whip, the Chair 
rejected the Alberta precedent based on popular vote as being 
unsound and as setting an undesirable precedent. I must concur 
with Speaker Dysart when she stated on page 3752 of <I>Hansard</I> of 
the Legislative Assembly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Basing a decision on factors outside Parliament opens the door or invites 
future decisions with no basis in parliamentary precedents or practice. With the 
one noted exception,-</BLOCKQUOTE>
that of Alberta-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Official Opposition has been determined by the number of seats held by 
the party, not by their popular vote.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The second precedent referred to by hon. members concerns the 
outcome of the first post World War I general election in Great 
Britain. The situation was very complicated and I would like to 
describe the circumstances faced by the British Speaker at that 
time.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Lethbridge noted, the government 
elected in December 1918 was a coalition of 383 
Conservative-Unionists, 133 Coalition Liberals and 10 Coalition 
Labourites led by the Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George. 
The main opposition groups in descending order of seats were the 
Labour Party, a number of anti-coalition Liberals, and the Irish 
Nationalists. Members of the Sinn Fein, the largest party in 
opposition with 73 members, refused to take their seats at 
Westminster.
<P>
	The anti-coalition Liberals under Herbert Asquith, had suffered a 
severe election defeat and Mr. Asquith himself  had lost his seat. 
Until he could return to the House in a byelection, the Liberals 
chose Sir Donald Maclean, the former deputy speaker, as the 
party's parliamentary leader.
<P>
	The Labour Party, whose defection from the wartime coalition 
government had in part precipitated the election, increased its 
representation in the House, but the party's leaders were defeated 
in their own seats. William Adamson, a returning member from 
Scotland, was selected as the Labour leader in the Commons since 
the majority of the Labour members were new members without 
parliamentary experience.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	From my research, it would appear that the situation as described 
by the hon. member for Lethbridge was not completely accurate. In 
Volume II of <I>A Speaker's Commentaries</I>, the memoirs of the then 
British Speaker James Lowther, at pages 251 and 252, he describes 
the situation as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Before the new parliament met I was confronted with the difficulty of having to 
decide which party constituted His Majesty's Opposition. The Liberals only 
mustered 26, whilst Labour numbered 59. The latter, therefore, claimed to have 
become the official Opposition. I was interviewed by Mr. Adamson, who was then 
the chairman of the Labour Party, and strongly urged their claims. He argued that 
there were 59 Labour Members representing a distinct and independent Party, that 
Labour candidates had received the support of more than 2 1/4 million voters at the 
recent Election, that the Liberals numbered only 26, and that even those 26 were 
only a minority of a Party which was identified with and formed part of the 
Coalition Government. On the other hand, some Members of the Liberal Party 
argued to me that their discomfiture was only temporary and that they were the real 
``Simon pure'', with great historical traditions behind them, which should not be 
lightly set aside by reason of a passing failure at the polls. It was a difficult 
situation. I pointed out to Mr. Adamson that my share in determining the question 
of the leadership of His Majesty's Opposition was a very small one, and was 
limited to determining who on the front Opposition bench should, every 
Thursday, ask the formal question as to future business; that if the question of 
determining the official Opposition was to be solved by numbers, the Sinn Fein 
Party, who had not then decided whether they would come to Westminster or not, 
outnumbered the Labour Party by a dozen or more; and that the application of a 
strict arithmetical rule might lead to some embarrassment and might compel me, 
in the event of the Opposition parties becoming about equal in numbers, through 
the decision of by-elections, to resort to a weekly census. I therefore solved it in the 
usual British fashion by a compromise, in the nature of Solomon's judgment, 
suggesting that the leadership should be divided between Sir Donald Maclean and 
Mr. Adamson. This course was adopted, and during the duration of the Parliament 
Sir Donald and Mr. Adamson used in alternate weeks to exercise their privilege as 
leader, of asking the formal questions as to the future business of the House, the 
only Parliamentary act which by tradition is the prerogative of the leader of His 
Majesty's Opposition. In the matter of initiating or winding up debates on behalf 
of their  parties, they both took part, dividing the honours between them so far as 
possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My understanding of the events and recollections of Speaker 
Lowther is that there was no formal decision rendered by the 
Speaker. Rather, he simply offered a suggestion which the two 
parties accepted. The consultations which occurred took place 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="19"> 19 </A></B>
<P>
outside the Chamber before the new Parliament met, and before 
Speaker Lowther was re-elected.
<P>
	Nothing in the <I>Debates</I> indicates that Sir Donald Maclean of the 
anti-coalition Liberals was Leader of the Official Opposition. In 
fact an examination of the <I>Debates</I> in the House of Commons for 
that session of Parliament confirms that the two party leaders did 
alternate in asking the Thursday business question, but in debate 
Mr. Adamson was given precedence over Mr. Maclean. It should 
also be borne in mind that in Britain the leader of the opposition did 
not receive an additional allowance until 1937.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Thus even with much less serious consequences, Speaker 
Lowther was reluctant to play a role in determining the leader of 
the opposition and limited his role to suggesting a compromise. 
This precedent in my view does not support the position of the hon. 
member for Lethbridge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The third precedent cited by the hon. member concerns events 
which occurred in Australia during the second world war. The 
situation in the House of Representatives at that time was as 
complex as that of Great Britain in 1918. The Australian 
government at that time was a coalition of the larger United 
Australia Party or UAP, under Mr. Robert Menzies, and the smaller 
United Country Party or UCP, under the leadership of Mr. Arthur 
Fadden. Mr. Fadden, however, was the Prime Minister. On October 
7, 1941, the coalition was defeated in the House, the government 
resigned and a Labour Party government was sworn in.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Australia and Country Parties remained a coalition going 
into opposition. As leader of the larger of the two parties, Mr. 
Menzies normally would be expected to become leader of the 
opposition. However, as the outgoing prime minister, Mr. Fadden 
also had a claim to the position.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge stated that the United Australia 
Party settled its own leadership and then in a joint meeting, 
presided over by the Speaker, elected the leader of the United 
Country Party as leader of the opposition.
<P>
	The events, however, were far more complicated. According to 
<I>Australia's Commonwealth Parliament, 1901-1988</I> by G.S. Reid 
and Martyn Forrest, at pages 58  and 59, at a meeting of the 
Australia Party Mr. Menzies tried to convince his colleagues that 
the opposition leadership should not be left to Mr. Fadden. He also 
suggested the Speaker of the House, Walter Nairn, should preside 
over the joint meeting.
<P>
	Mr. Menzies' motion concerning the opposition leadership was 
soundly defeated by his party colleagues and as a result Mr. 
Menzies declined to seek renomination for his party's leadership. 
The result of the joint meeting, convened immediately after the 
UAP meeting, saw the selection of Mr. Fadden as leader of the 
opposition supported by many Australia Party members. 
According to Reid and Forrest, press reports of the period stated 
that Mr. Fadden's election was unanimous.
<P>
	It should be noted that where the number of seats in the 
Australian House did not clearly determine which party should be 
the official opposition, the opposition parties took it upon 
themselves to meet outside the chamber to try to resolve the 
difficulty.
<P>
	With information obtained directly from the Australian House of 
Representatives, it cannot be confirmed that Speaker Nairn 
presided over the joint meeting. However, as Speaker Nairn was a 
member of the Australia Party, he would probably have been 
present at the meeting, as it was common practice then and still is 
the practice for the Australian Speaker to attend his party caucuses.
<P>
	Since no records of these meetings have been published, I am 
unable to determine with any certainty who presided over this 
meeting. If Speaker Nairn had chaired the meeting he probably 
would have done so in a party role and not as an impartial Speaker 
of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the Canadian House of Commons, the election of the Speaker 
by secret ballot affects his or her political relationships. It places 
upon the Chair occupant an even greater obligation to set aside his 
or her parliamentary party connections while serving as the 
Speaker for all members of the House. Once elected, the Speaker 
therefore does not attend any caucus. If any group of members 
wished to meet outside the Chamber to deal with some matter, and 
indicated their wish for me to chair such a meeting, I would of 
course offer my services as an impartial, neutral facilitator. I am 
sure that no member of this House would want to see the Speaker 
involve himself in partisan matters.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore the Australian precedent does not assist me in the 
matter currently before me. Having listened to the presentations by 
hon. members, having examined the precendents referred to by the 
hon. member for Lethbridge as well as others from provinces and 
other countries, and having taken into account our own  traditions, I 
can find nothing which would have supported the contention of the 
hon. member for Lethbridge that the Speaker of the House of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="20"> 20 </A></B>
<P>
Commons may decide to grant official opposition status to the 
second numerically important party in opposition.
<P>
	By convention the number of seats held by a party in the House 
has been the determining factor.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to address the new reality which the House 
faces today, and that is the issue of the equality of seats of the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party.
<P>
	At the beginning of this Parliament the Bloc Quebecois, the 
largest minority party in the House, assumed the role of the official 
opposition with their leader taking up the duties of the Leader of 
the Official Opposition. As a result of a byelection and the 
resignation of the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean on January 15, 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party now have the same 
number of seats in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Just as Speaker Dysart of New Brunswick was required to do in 
1994, I must answer the following question: is the existence of a tie 
sufficient to overthrow or displace the recognized official 
opposition? From my examination of the precedents from other 
Canadian jurisdictions, including the most recent precedent from 
New Brunswick, I must conclude, just as Speaker Dysart and other 
Speakers have, that in the case of a tie during the course of a 
Parliament incumbency should be the determining factor and the 
status quo should therefore be maintained.
<P>
	An equality of seats in the two largest opposition parties should 
neither deny the members of the Bloc Quebecois their position 
today as the official opposition nor prevent them from choosing 
from among their members the leader of the official opposition. 
Thus the Bloc Quebecois will currently retain its status as the 
official opposition until a further review of this status is warranted.
<P>
	I hope it is clear to all members that in this matter the role of the 
Speaker is to ensure the business of the House is conducted 
according to the standing orders and our practices. It is my duty to 
ensure that any matter which may be legitimately brought before 
the House meets the procedural requirements for the form in which 
it is presented.
<P>
	As I noted earlier, the designation of the official opposition has 
never been decided on the floor of the House, and the House has 
never put in place a procedure for the selection of the official 
opposition. My comments are obviously made in relation to the 
present context of the number of seats on the opposition side of the 
House and in the absence of any statutory authority or rules or 
guidelines for the Speaker to act on if required to  intervene in 
determining which party should at a certain point in time become 
the official opposition
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to thank the hon. member for Lethbridge for raising the 
point of order and all other members for their contributions, as well 
as their patience in listening to this lengthy but important 
statement.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of the speech 
delivered by His Excellency the Governor General at the opening 
of the session.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure and some relief that at last I rise to 
move the motion on the address and reply to the speech from the 
throne.
<P>
	To you, Mr. Speaker, welcome back. Like you, I do look forward 
to the second session of this 35th Parliament. It is clearly a place 
for open debate.
<P>
	Although it has now been some time since we heard the speech 
from the throne, at that time I was reflecting on all that has 
happened in the 28 months since the election brought us here to the 
Chamber. In the intervening period I have had time to consider it 
even more closely. Unlike what I have just heard from members 
opposite, my memories of the red book are quite different. I 
remember it as an ambitious plan, a plan taken to the people by our 
Prime Minister in 1993, a plan overwhelmingly endorsed by the 
Canadian electorate from coast to coast, a plan that has been put 
into action.
<P>
	Only half way into our mandate the government has already 
delivered on the vast majority of commitments in the red book and 
in the first throne speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The two-fold objective to stimulate job creation and economic 
growth while reducing the debt and the deficit lay at the very heart 
of the action plan. The emphasis on jobs and the economy helped to 
create half a million new jobs and achieve a rate of economic 
growth that ranked among the highest in the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having clearly set out fiscal targets in the first budget, we 
consistently met those targets. How did we do that? By sticking to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="21"> 21 </A></B>
<P>
the economic fundamentals, keeping inflation low and reducing the 
deficit from over 6 per cent of GDP when we took office to a 
projected 2 per  cent by 1997-98. The government has always 
believed in a balanced approach.
<P>
	We have remained true to the words of my colleague the hon. 
member for Madawaska-Victoria who, though perhaps ill 
qualified as a defensive back, will make a very good Speaker upon 
the opening of the 35th Parliament. She said: ``A Liberal 
government will have a social conscience while being fiscally 
responsible. A lean government does not have to be a mean 
government''.
<P>
	We are proud of our record in the first half of our mandate but 
this no time to grow complacent, and that is what brings us here 
today. Today's throne speech represents a reaffirmation of our 
initial goals. Its purpose is to set out our plan of action for how we 
will build on past accomplishments during the second half of our 
mandate.
<P>
	The throne speech focused on three priority themes: jobs and 
growth, security for Canadians and modernizing the Canadian 
federation to ensure unity.
<P>
	Canadians do not want nor do they expect government to do 
everything. Canadians expect government to make strategic 
choices. By forming partnerships with the provinces and the 
private sector we can succeed in helping Canadians achieve the 
dignity of work.
<P>
	When I think of work I think of youth. What immediately comes 
to mind are my own 19-year old twin boys who happen to be here in 
Ottawa today. Their existence has a lot to do with my concerns for 
ensuring there are job opportunities for our youth. I do not suffer 
from any empty nest syndrome. These boys need to get out of the 
house. They need to get jobs.
<P>
	The priority of this issue was brought home to me again last 
week. The University of Saskatchewan is in my riding in 
Saskatoon. USSU vice-president Robert Millard, to use our finance 
minister's expression, keeps my feet to the fire on this issue. He 
and students across the country will be happy with today's throne 
speech announcement that we will double the number of federal 
student jobs this summer.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	I read in yesterday's newspaper that youth are exiting 
Saskatchewan in record numbers because there are no jobs. Last 
night I heard the same thing on a local Ottawa station in the hon. 
whip's riding of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	The announcements made in today's speech are directed at 
exactly that problem. The government has shown its commitment 
to our youth by announcing initiatives that will help them make the 
transition from school to work and find real jobs in the future, a 
good example of our reaffirmation of our commitment to be an 
innovative technology leader
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By concentrating our efforts on science and technology, we will 
help Canadians take advantage of the creation of knowledge-based 
industries, which will generate more jobs, better jobs and durable 
jobs for Canadians young and old.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Jobs in areas such as agricultural biotechnology, the aerospace 
industry, environmental technologies are opportunities that 
currently exist in Innovation Place in my riding of 
Saskatoon-Humboldt and which will be further enhanced by 
today's announcement.
<P>
	Another aspect mentioned in today's speech is the importance of 
trade. Last week we had the pleasure of a visit from the Secretary 
of State for Asia-Pacific in Saskatoon to discuss the importance of 
national trade in creating jobs and growth.
<P>
	The tremendous success of the Team Canada trade missions led 
by the Prime Minister, most recently in Asia, has resulted in 
billions of dollars in business deals for Canadian companies and 
tens of thousands of new jobs. The government will continue to 
enhance export development and financing and encourage 
Canadians to be key players in world markets.
<P>
	The next theme we discussed earlier today was security for 
Canadians. When I was in my riding during the January recess a 
consistent message I heard from my constituents was the value they 
place on the maintenance of our social programs. They and many 
other Canadians who share their concerns will be heartened by 
today's commitment to safeguard the principles of medicare, to 
reform and sustain the public pension system and to implement a 
new employment insurance program.
<P>
	Perhaps nothing unites us as a nation like our belief in the need 
to preserve the fabric of the Canadian social safety net. It is one of 
the attributes that has earned us the status of the best country in the 
world. This is high praise to our modest Canadian way of thinking, 
making us far too prone to blush, to brush it aside, little realizing 
with what envy our nation is eyed by others around the globe.
<P>
	This does not mean we can afford to take our federation for 
granted. The throne speech indicated the commitment of the 
government to keep Canada together. To remain strong and united 
we must be open to changing needs and circumstances, ready to be 
flexible and adapt to the needs of all parts of the country as we 
enter the next century.
<P>
	This pledge is not lightly given. Like the other commitments in 
the throne speech, it is a promise to be kept. ``The most important 
asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the citizens to 
whom it is accountable''. That quote appeared in chapter 6 of the 
red book under the heading ``Governing with  Integrity'', from 
which, I was pleased to see, the hon. member from Kootenay East 
was quoting earlier this afternoon. I was pleased to see he has a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="22"> 22 </A></B>
<P>
copy. I am equally pleased to see he has read it. I am pleased to see 
that he can read.
<P>
	If members think back to the time of the next election, they will 
recall that no longer did Canadians perceive their elected officials 
as the trusted servants of the people. Again we heard the member 
for Kootenay East quoting from the red book to suggest that after 
years of scandal and patronage, by 1993 politicians did not enjoy 
the best of reputations. Perhaps after the comments from the 
member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley his leader may be 
distressed to learn this member pines for the days of Brian 
Mulroney.
<P>
	The difficulty we faced at the time of the last election was that 
Canadians had lost faith in the political leadership to maintain the 
integrity of government institutions.
<P>
	In the months leading up to the last election, I too was among the 
ranks of despairing Canadians who had lost faith. Like many other 
rookie members of the House, I would say from all parties, at that 
time I had finally reached the point at which action had become the 
only antidote for the cynicism and discontent tormenting me. 
Although I had not held political office before, I decided the time 
had come to get involved.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	As I mentioned from chapter 6, restoring integrity to our 
political institutions, a personal priority for the Prime Minister, 
became one of the first orders of the day. As my boys will tell you, I 
say with annoying regularity actions speak louder than words. We 
have only to look to the example set by the Prime Minister, his own 
long political career, his unblemished record of honourable service 
to his country to find out what standard is required. Having 
regained the trust of the Canadian electorate in 1993, the Prime 
Minister received a mandate to begin the process of restoring the 
faith of Canadians.
<P>
	I mentioned a few moments ago that I have the honour to 
represent the riding of Saskatoon-Humboldt. It is a long way from 
Ottawa. Canada is a big country. In spite of the convenience of air 
travel, what with the time change and connections required, it takes 
me a good six hours to get from door to door; back to the riding on 
Friday for the weekend and back on the plane Monday to work in 
Ottawa. Many Canadians perhaps do not realize that when the 
House is in session this is a weekly commute.
<P>
	Before you get too choked up with this sad story, Mr. Speaker, let 
me say I am lucky. I live in the city of Saskatoon. When I get off 
the plane I am home. Many of my colleagues who live in rural 
Canada have yet another  leg of the journey ahead, a long lonely 
drive usually in the dark after a gruelling week and a long flight.
<P>
	I think in particular of my colleague from Saskatchewan, the 
member for Souris-Moose Mountain, a young lad of 27; clearly 
the driving has taken its toll.
<P>
	Members from other geographically distant areas, the territories, 
the interior of British Columbia, northern Ontario, rural Quebec or 
Atlantic Canada, know exactly what I am talking about. Even when 
we are in our ridings, often in the rural areas declining populations 
are so scattered over such vast geographical areas that travelling is 
a real challenge. Even worse, it makes personal interaction between 
the MP and the constituent increasingly difficult.
<P>
	Members representing urban ridings face the same outcome but 
for entirely different reasons. Though geographically manageable, 
ridings in large centres such as Vancouver or Toronto have 
undergone tremendous population increases. I think of my 
colleagues, the member for Mississauga West and the member for 
North York, whose ridings have populations of over 300,000.
<P>
	We have shifting population patterns, the challenges presented 
by time and distance and the increased workload in Ottawa 
severely taxing the ability of the MP to maintain direct contact with 
the constituent.
<P>
	Consider my own riding of Saskatoon-Humboldt. It is a 
rural-urban split. It is located virtually in the heart of the province 
of Saskatchewan. It includes one-third of the city of Saskatoon and 
large rural area to the north and east. It is bounded on the west by 
the South Saskatchewan River, putting to rest any popularly held 
misconceptions that there is no water in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	If you were to accompany me on a tour of the riding, Mr. 
Speaker, first we would make our way through a well treed 
residential area. Myth number two debunked, we have trees. We 
would end up at the University of Saskatchewan, established just 
after we became a province in 1905. On that campus we would find 
a variety of colleges including law, engineering, fine arts, medicine 
and agriculture. We would find the Royal University Hospital. We 
would find the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory and finally 
on the outer edges, Innovation Place with its thriving ag-biotech 
community.
<P>
	Travelling beyond that we would end up at the edge of the city 
where in the interest of time we would have to transfer to a 
helicopter to view the hundreds of square miles that make up the 
rural portion of Saskatoon-Humboldt. Flying over this vast area 
we would see First Nations communities, grain farms, agricultural 
manufacturing, beef and pork operations, schools, churches, town 
halls, post offices, curling rinks and that prairie landmark, the grain 
elevator. Most important, we would see the people who live in that 
riding, the constituents.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="23"> 23 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Who are these people? We would see a young mother working on 
aboriginal justice initiatives; a first year engineering student who 
wonders where the money will come from for next year's tuition; a 
hospital cafeteria worker who is worried about special care for her 
diabetic preschooler; a particle physicist who does not want to have 
to leave Canada to continue her research; a new Canadian pumping 
gas who devotes his spare time to the jazz festival; a feedlot 
operator linked to the Internet for market prices who keeps a .22 in 
the corner to shoot gophers; a farm woman who drives a school 
bus, works at the credit union and who cannot find decent child 
care; a Roman Catholic priest with an aging flock; and finally, one 
of my favourites, an 86-year old francophone lady who cannot get 
out any more but who crochets like a demon and sends me 
Christmas cards.
<P>
	There is not a member in the House who could not produce an 
equally lengthy, diverse or interesting profile of the Canadians in 
his or her own riding.
<P>
	If we stitch all of those ridings together we end up with a map of 
Canada, a tapestry of rich and varied hue reflecting the myriad of 
constituents whose interests,both individual and collective we have 
been sent here to represent.
<P>
	There are so many different strands of opinion. There are 
different strands of thought, religious belief, education, ethnic 
background, income brackets, age groups and loyalties.
<P>
	Our challenge as parliamentarians, as Canadians, is to be the 
loom that will take those many strands, all those different colours, 
all those different fabrics and strengths, and weave them into a 
strong, beautiful, sheltering Canada.
<P>
	As was stated in the throne speech, the government approaches 
the second half of its mandate confident that what unites us as 
Canadians is far greater than what divides us. The commitment 
made today is to find those precious threads that strengthen the 
national fabric without constricting those within its folds; to call 
upon our shared Canadian values; to build an independent nation, 
economically strong, socially just, proud of its diversity and 
characterized by its integrity, compassion and competence.
<P>
	I have no doubt this challenge can be met and that the 
opportunity is there. As we head into a new session of Parliament I 
urge all members of the House to reflect on what we cherish about 
Canada, to recognize the privileged responsibility we share and the 
sacred duty we owe to the Canadians we represent to strengthen 
and preserve this country.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a real privilege to speak in support of the Address in Reply to the 
Speech from the Throne before it gets dated.
<P>
	As the representative of the electoral district of Ottawa-Vanier, 
which is in many ways a microcosm of this great country of ours, it 
is with a mixture of pride and humility not to mention trepidation 
and some nervousness, that I accepted the Prime Minister's 
invitation.
<P>
	It is also with gratitude; gratitude because the speech from the 
throne speaks of the values that unite us. It speaks of the 
sustainability of our social programs. It speaks of ensuring 
opportunity, in particular for our young people. It speaks of fiscal 
responsibility guided by equity, fairness and balance. It speaks of 
safe and clean communities. It speaks of a rejuvenated, flexible and 
exemplary public service. It speaks of a proud and effective 
participant on the international stage. It speaks of our Canadian 
identity, of our cultural institutions, of our future, of the hope we 
all share for a better tomorrow. Most important, it speaks of and for 
a united Canada. On this very date last year, a scant four days after 
having been sworn in, I sat in the Chamber and listened to the 
Minister of Finance introduce the 1995 budget. These were his 
words: ``Mr. Speaker, there are times in the progress of a people 
when fundamental challenges must be faced, fundamental choices 
made, a new course charted. For Canada, this is one of those times. 
Our resolve, our values, our very way of life as Canadians are being 
tested. The choice is clear. We can take the path too well trodden of 
minimal change, of least resistance, of leadership lost. Or we can 
set out on a new road of fundamental reform, of renewal, of hope 
restored. Today we have made our choice. Today we take action''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="24"> 24 </A></B>
<P>
	That budget charted the course of our economic recovery. The 
actions taken that day and since have inspired in the country a 
sense that we are on the right path. When was the last time the 
national government spoke with any credibility of a $17 billion 
deficit target? Yet that is the target reaffirmed in the throne speech 
for fiscal 1997-98.
<P>
	The government has met its targets and will continue to do so for 
the betterment of the country. Next week the government will table 
its third budget, once more reflecting the priorities of Canadians. 
While our goal of progressively lowering the deficit and eventually 
eliminating it is essential in maintaining the confidence of our 
financial markets, lenders are not the focus, nor the reason, of the 
deficit reduction strategy. Rather, the focus is the need to foster a 
climate for wealth creation, a climate within which the private 
sector can prosper, grow and create employment. The creation of a 
variety of productive opportunities for Canadians, the creation of 
work, that is our primary focus.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As Félix Leclerc stated so very aptly in one of his songs, the best 
way to finish a man off is to pay him to do nothing. All too often 
loss of work leads to loss of spirit, loss of hope, dropping out of 
society, fear, crime. The speech from the throne represents a great 
challenge, a magnificent challenge to us all, a noble challenge, a 
challenge that requires all of the creativity and all of the resources 
of both our government and the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not an easy challenge. Nowhere has it been felt more than in 
the nation's capital. The federal government's decision to reduce 
its workforce by some 45,000 has had profound effects on the 
national capital region where residents make up one-third of the 
government's workforce.
<P>
	While it has a history of dependence on the federal government 
for employment, the national capital region has chosen to ride the 
wave of change rather than drown in it. History is rife with 
examples of communities stagnating or disappearing because they 
were unable to adapt to change. I assure the House that this will not 
be the case in our region.
<P>
	The national capital region has changed. It has a strong and 
vibrant private sector. Tourism, high technology industries, 
biotechnology industries, colleges and universities, research 
centres and a myriad of trade related businesses have turned our 
community into a dynamic region, a region focused on success, a 
region preparing to compete head on in the international arena.
<P>
	A word of caution however. As the former member for Sudbury, 
the Hon. Doug Frith, said in his remarks in support of the Address 
in Reply to the Speech from the Throne in 1980:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The development of the various regions of Canada need not be at the expense 
of others. Surely as Canadians we realize that a strong western and Atlantic 
Canada are as important to the confederation as a strong central Canada. We 
must begin to understand that by strengthening the parts we strengthen the 
whole, and that by promoting regional cannibalism, we begin to road to 
self-destruction. The strength of confederation has been the ability of the 
federal system to share and redistribute the resources of the various regions of 
Canada in order to preserve an economically and socially progressive 
federation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Our region will continue to absorb its fair share of reduced 
spending. However, our people are hurting too. Unemployment in 
our region is now higher than the national average. Also, there are 
more people dependent on social benefits in our region alone than 
in all of Saskatchewan, with all due respect to my colleague across 
the aisle.
<P>
	Therefore, we too will need some tender loving care, not 
necessarily in the form of large cash infusions but perhaps along 
the lines of removing barriers and facilitating economic 
development projects.
<P>
	Just as economic development is the focus of our deficit 
reduction plans, the ability to maintain meaningful and necessary 
social programs is its raison d'être.
<P>
	By continuing to increase the nation's debt we only reduce 
opportunities to provide for the needy. On the other hand, by 
reducing the debt relative to the gross domestic product and 
eventually by reducing it in absolute terms, the country will be able 
to guarantee the long term viability of our social programs.
<P>
	Think of the day when we will start paying off the debt, which is 
not too distant in the future. Think of the perpetual annual savings 
of $80 million or so every time we knock a billion dollars off the 
debt. As the ads state: ``Imagine the freedom''.
<P>
	Already the benefits of our strategy are becoming visible. The 
ability to introduce a cash floor in the Canadian health and social 
transfer is but a first manifestation of healthier finances.
<P>
	As the fiscal health is restored so will the ability to ensure the 
financial, physical and mental well-being of elderly people, 
physically challenged people and of those who cannot fend for 
themselves. In other words, the improving economic and fiscal 
situation will also improve the ability to redistribute wealth, one of 
the primary functions of any national government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Changing topics, I would like to talk a little bit about the riding 
of Ottawa, particularly its northern boundary, the Ottawa River. 
Crossing that river, as some 40,000 people from Eastern Ontario or 
West Quebec do every  day to get to work, one discovers the other 
component of the National Capital Region. Together we, that is

those on both sides, Eastern Ontario and West Quebec, comprise a 
single economic area, so much so that the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
committed an interesting slip in a page one headline after last 
year's byelections, which you will remember were in 
Brome-Missisquoi, Saint-Henri-Westmount and 
Ottawa-Vanier. To quote the <I>Globe and Mail</I>: ``Liberals win three 
Quebec byelections.'' You cannot win them all.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	In this National Capital Region of ours, we are so alike in the 
way we talk, the way we think and the way we live that an outside 
observer like the <I>Globe and Mail</I> would have trouble determining 
our province of origin. Our region straddles both provinces. 
Anglophones and francophones, both on the Ontario and the 
Quebec side, live in harmony with each other.
<P>
	This region is a good example and a wonderful symbol of our 
ability to live together. However, we are not the only symbol of this 
duality. A brand new symbol has now been added to the 
constellation of Canadian symbols: the two-dollar coin. What a 
marvellous symbol of a country where two official languages 
coexist, a country where two main cultural groups live together, a 
nation with two founding peoples. What a wonderful idea to design 
a bimetallic coin to reflect our bilingualism and our biculturalism.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélanger:</B> This new two-dollar coin, which is getting a 
rather rough ride in some quarters, is nevertheless an interesting 
reflection on the Canadian situation. Some people are trying to 
break it up, to divide it, to separate it, to separate one piece from 
the other by hitting it with a hammer or exposing it to the worst 
possible weather, to extreme conditions. No wonder that a few of 
the 70 million coins that were minted finally split in two.
<P>
	But why should anyone try to separate two sections that are part 
of a whole? Once separated, they no longer have the recognition or 
the value of the whole coin. Separated from each other, their 
distinctness diminishes and even disappears. Only when they are 
together do we see that each part is distinct from the other. Only 
when both pieces are fitted together, each in their proper place, 
does this coin have its full and proper value, and the same applies 
to our country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélanger:</B> So I say three cheers for those who designed the 
coin and, especially, three cheers for those who created this country 
129 years ago.
<P>
	I may add that the same analogy could apply to Canada's 
francophone communities. Imagine the francophone community 
without Quebec or imagine  Quebec separated from the one million 
francophones in the other provinces. In both instances, 
communities would be divided, and all francophones would come 
out losers, should the country break up. However, the value of 
francophone communities, in a united country, is beyond measure.
<P>
	I would like to thank the Prime Minister most sincerely for 
according me this badge of honour and especially for the privilege 
of seconding the address in reply to the speech from the throne. I 
am particularly grateful, because the speech from the throne 
prepares the way for reconciliation.
<P>
	In terms that are appropriate and in a manner that is direct, 
honest, and unequivocal, it deals with questions vital to the renewal 
of our federation and questions we will have to try to answer in the 
coming months. They include recognition of the distinct nature of 
Quebec society, a constitutional veto for Canada's regions and the 
enshrinement of these two important concepts in the Canadian 
Constitution.
<P>
	It also raises the thorny question of the division of powers. The 
genius of the British North America Act and its sections 91 and 92 
lies not in the creation of two levels of government: a senior and a 
necessarily junior one. It lies in the creation of two orders of 
government that may and can co-operate while keeping separate 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	All too often in this House and elsewhere in the country, we hear 
talk of two levels of government rather than two orders of 
government, of a national government and its responsibilities and 
authority and of provincial governments with their own 
responsibilities and authorities. One is not subordinate to the other 
nor subject to the other. Neither is better than the other, they are 
complementary.
<P>
	Like many, I believe in a strong national government, as do most 
of the people in Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	However, a strong central government does not mean a national 
government that does everything, has a finger in every pie, imposes 
its will on everything, in short acts like Big Brother. No. A strong 
central government means a national government that does a good 
job, a very good one even, in areas within its jurisdiction, in its 
public finances, in its relationships with other individuals, 
communities or governments.
<P>
	The throne speech reflects that spirit of respectfulness and 
open-mindedness toward the provincial governments. I feel we are 
on the right path. The path we have begun along today will lead us 
to our intended destination: a strong country that respects all of its 
constituent elements, a country where there is a sense of harmony, 
where all ethnic groups have a place alongside the two founding 
peoples, and where those two peoples live in harmony with each 
other and with those who were the  original occupants of this land, 
each adding to the strength of the other, understanding each other, 
<P>

<P>
accepting each other, helping each other out, growing and 
developing together.
<P>
	For this reason, I am pleased to support the motion of my 
colleague from Saskatoon-Humboldt on the address in reply to 
the speech from the throne.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, it is now the official 
opposition's turn. As I recognize the hon. member for Roberval for

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.) </B>moved: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Business of Supply be considered at the next sitting of the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a point of order concerning Motion No. 1. I think 
you will have to agree with the point I intend to make, which is that 
this motion is out of order.
<P>
	I would refer to arguments made by the present government in 
1991, when it was in the opposition, in response to a motion 
presented by the Progressive Conservative Party, the government 
party at the time, when it wanted to resurrect measures that had 
died on the Order Paper when the House was prorogued.
<P>
	At the time, the Conservative motion listed the bills in question 
and, if I remember correctly, there were six. The Liberal opposition 
argued that a general motion could not be debated and that the 
House would have to proceed item by item, motion by motion and 
bill by bill. I realize that, in this case, the government has avoided 
the pitfalls of the motion it condemned at the time by not 
specifying the bills it wants back on the Order Paper. The 
government is trying to resurrect all the bills that died on the Order 
Paper instead of taking them one by one.
<P>
	I would like to recall some of the statements that were made at 
the time. Mind you, all this was item by item. Speaker Fraser 
finally agreed with the arguments put forward by the opposition. 
These included, and I am reminded of what was said by the hon. 
member for Ottawa-Vanier at the time-his successor just made 
an eloquent speech-who is now a senator, who condemned this 
approach, referring to it as a legislative mess, and who called hon. 
members opposite-who were sitting where I am now but are 
sitting opposite today-government bullies. It seems to me that 
borders on the unparliamentary, but apparently it was accepted by 
the Chair.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The government is trying to do exactly the same thing today, but 
in a roundabout way. It is are trying to accomplish indirectly what 
it cannot accomplish directly. I realize that the government 
members have realized that their arguments were not totally 
convincing, since the approach has been an item by item approach, 
even if that had been condemned, as seen by the statements I just 
quoted.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the approach has been item by item, bill by bill. 
When the official opposition was consulted by the government, it 
was made clear to the government that we were prepared to 
examine each bill on its merits and that we would agree to a certain 
number of them. I am thinking, for instance, of the bill of my 
colleague for Québec making excision illegal. We are, of course, 
prepared to resume examination of that bill where we left it last 
December, but it would take a lot of gall to assume that we would 
agree to re-examine the Axworthy reform as the Young reform. 
There are limits.
<P>
	On these grounds I would ask you to consider this motion as not 
in order, as you cannot do otherwise, based on the arguments put 
forth several years ago by the government party in terms far more 
crude than mine.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
challenge the validity of the motion which has been put forward by 
the government with respect to reinstating bills and amending 
standing orders.
<P>
	The motion has many faults. It deals with two entirely separate 
matters and it deals with the reinstatement of bills and with the 
changing of the standing orders.
<P>
	The first half of the motion that deals with the reinstatement of 
bills contains within it over 30 pieces of legislation. I refer to 
citation 552(3) of Beauchesne's sixth edition:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There can be but one question pending at the same time, though there may be 
numerous matters of business in various stages of progress standing on the 
Order Paper for consideration during the session. The only exception from this 
citation occurs at the report stage of a bill, when the Standing Orders confer 
upon the Speaker the power to combine amendments or causes for discussion 
and decision.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="27"> 27 </A></B>
<P>
	How can a member responsibly take a decision on this motion 
put forward by the government today? We do not know which bills 
will be introduced. In essence we are signing blank cheque.
<P>
	The motion says that at first reading:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-if the speaker is satisfied that the said bill is in the same form as at 
prorogation, the said bill shall be deemed to have been considered and approved 
at all stages completed at the time of prorogation and shall stand, if necessary, 
on the Order Paper, or, as the case may be, referred to committee, at the same 
stage and under the same legislative procedural process at which it stood at the 
time of prorogation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is unacceptable. After we pass this motion we should leave 
it to individuals to decide, not the House. Since when does 
democracy act in this way? That is absolutely ridiculous and highly 
irregular.
<P>
	I refer to citation 566(5) of Beauchesne's:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any irregularity of any portion of a motion shall render the whole motion 
irregular.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Not only is the whole motion irregular but a portion of the 
motion is extremely irregular and extremely dangerous to the way 
we do business in the House or in any other legislative assembly.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	There was a heated debate in May 1991 led by the Liberal Party 
and many of the current sitting members of the House regarding an 
exactly identical matter. The Liberals argued not only against the 
ethics of reinstating bills without the unanimous consent of the 
House but the receivability of a motion to do so.
<P>
	The Mulroney motion of 1991 affected only five bills. This 
Liberal clone motion is far more sweeping. The government has 
taken the worst procedures from Mr. Mulroney's government of the 
day and has somehow managed to make them even more offensive. 
That is shameful and horribly unacceptable to this House.
<P>
	The motion before us today has the potential of affecting over 30 
bills and we do not even have the opportunity to know which ones 
will be considered for reinstatement. We are going to make a 
decision blindfolded and completely kept in the dark.
<P>
	Some members of this House may feel that all bills should have 
died on the Order Paper when the House prorogued and others may 
think all bills should be reinstated. Some may think that just private 
members' bills or just government bills or a combination of the two 
should be put back into this assembly.
<P>
	When we add the standing order changes we have got one big 
mess, a Charlottetown accord kind of mess. It is a mess. It is 
irregular and I declare and feel that it is certainly out of order as a 
motion before this august body here today.
<P>
	I will not waste the time of the House arguing that this cannot be 
done other than by unanimous consent  because that great 
parliamentarian, Mr. Brian Mulroney, set the precedent in the last 
Parliament. That is not good enough. Unfortunately though today 
the Liberals have chosen to adopt the Mulroney style of democracy 
in government and are again pursuing the Tory thrust that was in 
the last Parliament. We know where that led us.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the ethical consideration, Speaker Fraser in 
considering the Mulroney motion ruled that there cannot be just 
one vote on five separate pieces of legislation. The motion in 1991 
was intended to reinstate five separate bills. The motion put 
forward by this government today proposes to allow the 
reinstatement of over 30 bills. The 1991 motion referred to specific 
bills where today's motion deals with ``facilitating the business of 
the House''. That is very general. The effect is the same. Many bills 
will be reintroduced with one swoop and one motion. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I now refer you to the Speaker's ruling of May 29, 
1991, pages 733 to 735 of <I>Hansard</I>. The Speaker ruled the motion 
in order but used his authority to amend the motion. He referred to 
a ruling from another speaker on March 23, 1966 and I quote: ``It is 
only in exceptional circumstances and when there is little doubt 
about it that the Speaker can intervene and of his own initiative 
amend the resolution proposed by the hon. member''. The Speaker 
also cited citation 424(4) of Beauchesne's fifth edition which 
states: ``The Speaker has the unquestioned authority to modify 
motions with respect to form''.
<P>
	The Speaker decided at that time to allow one debate but a 
separate question for each bill. That is what happened. The Speaker 
established that there ought to be a separate vote for each one of the 
bills. That is the precedent we face here today.
<P>
	The question, Mr. Speaker, that you are faced with is similar. 
However, I believe there is a difference. You should not be bailing 
out the government at this time as the Speaker did in the last 
Parliament. The Speaker in that Parliament had no precedent for 
such a motion and that qualified as exceptional circumstances. This 
time around the government has no excuses. It knows what the 
precedent is. It is not up to the Speaker to bail out the government 
every time it presents an inferior motion, but that is what we are 
faced with here today.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you should rule this motion out of order and the 
government should come back with proper motions so that the 
House can take a responsible decision on each bill separately and 
on each one of the issues that are in that motion in a separate way. 
Fiscal discussions should be in one motion and bills should be in 
another. Then we can look at them as such. However as this motion 
is formed, it is highly unfair to the members of the House. It 
certainly should be unacceptable to you, Mr. Speaker, in its form.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the submissions by the House leaders of the 
Bloc and especially that of the Reform Party.
<P>
	The motion I would like to move involves a totally different 
approach to the motion in 1991 which is the subject of their critical 
comment. In 1991 the motion dealt with specific government bills 
but this motion simply provides a procedure or framework open to 
all MPs and not just ministers.
<P>
	Each bill affected by this order would have to be introduced 
separately with the question put separately. My hon. friend, the 
Reform House leader, has totally misunderstood the structure, 
point and purpose of my motion.
<P>
	My motion, if adopted by the House, would not restore a group 
of unknown, unlisted bills. Instead it would simply provide a 
framework enabling each minister and each private member who 
wished to do so the opportunity to have their bills introduced 
separately with the question put separately on each of those bills.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge, in particular, says that the 
motion will enable bills to be put forward whose identity we do not 
know anything about. I respectfully submit that the hon. member 
for Lethbridge again is quite incorrect in what he says because he 
obviously has not understood what my motion clearly states.
<P>
	My motion applies only to the bills that were on the Order Paper 
at the time of prorogation. Those bills are listed. The order paper is 
a public document. I am sure, contrary to what was suggested 
earlier in the debate, that the hon. member for Lethbridge is able to 
read the Order Paper. I would strongly disagree with anybody who 
suggests the contrary.
<P>
	There was concern about a motion like the one I want to present 
affecting the standing orders but I submit that a motion to amend or 
to suspend standing orders is always in order.
<P>
	I submit that the fact this motion deals with two different 
procedures does not in any way invalidate it. The House will recall 
that in 1994, I proposed a motion which was accepted by the Chair 
as being in order that amended dozens of standing orders affecting 
five or six procedural issues.
<P>
	The opposition parties did not get up at that time and say the 
1994 motion was out of order because it dealt with more than one 
subject. On the contrary, there were some words of praise for the 
reforms to our parliamentary procedure that were involved in that 
motion.
<P>
	I submit on the precedent of the motion that I presented to make 
permanent changes to the standing  orders in 1994, this motion is 
certainly in order even though like the one in 1994 it covers a 
number of different issues and standing orders.
<P>
	Again, that my motion is not intended to make any permanent 
changes to the standing orders but merely to provide a procedure to 
enable this House in a way that will be useful to all hon. members, 
not only ministers but private members on all sides of the House, to 
get on with the business of the House without repeating work that 
has already been carried out.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	I have just one or two other comments. An hon. member, 
criticizing my motion in the debate on this point of order, said that 
there was something wrong with individuals moving bills rather 
than the House as a whole. Every bill is presented to the House by 
an individual member moving the bill whether it is a government 
bill moved by a minister or a private bill moved by a private 
member. This is exactly what we do with every bill.
<P>
	The last precedent that I want to bring to your attention, Mr. 
Speaker, is one created by the hon. member for Lethbridge himself. 
Last fall he presented a motion to the House which was accepted as 
being in order and if adopted would have allowed the restoration 
after a prorogation of all private members' bills in one fell swoop. 
At that time he did not say: ``Oh, I am sorry. I made a big mistake. I 
should not have presented this motion because it covers all private 
members' bills''. No. He put it forward as a worthy reform of the 
procedures of the House of Commons.
<P>
	That motion was not ruled out of order by the Chair. It was 
accepted by the Chair and placed on the Order Paper. If that motion 
which dealt with private members' business was in order, then I 
submit that my motion which deals not only with private members' 
business but with government business is equally in order.
<P>
	On the basis of all the points I have made but especially on the 
basis of the words written down, submitted to the House and 
accepted by the House, by the Reform House leader, I submit that 
my motion is in order. He has proved it by his words and by his 
motion. Therefore, I suggest that the point of order is not in order 
and I should be permitted to proceed with my motion because it is 
in the interest not just of the government but of all the members of 
the House, private members on the government side and private 
members on the opposition side. If the hon. members were really 
interested in preserving the interests of private members they 
would readily accept my motion rather than present this point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has been very cute in proposing a motion which ties 
<P>

<B><A NAME="29"> 29 </A></B>
<P>
private members' business to government business in a way that 
obviously gives the  government House leader the opportunity to 
make the Reform House leader feel uncomfortable.
<P>
	However, I would like to speak to what I think is the larger point 
which is the fact that this is in effect, as was argued earlier by my 
colleague from the Reform Party, something in the nature of an 
omnibus motion.
<P>
	Certainly the government House leader will recall, having been 
here in 1982, when an omnibus piece of legislation, albeit 
legislation and not a motion, provoked 16 days of bell ringing. It is 
not just in this House but in many other legislatures and most 
recently in the Ontario legislature where omnibus bills provoke a 
particularly strong reaction on the part of elected members. Why is 
that? It is because it goes against the tradition established by 
Speaker after Speaker in so many contexts that the House should 
not be forced to rule on more than one matter at a time. People 
should not be put in that kind of position.
<P>
	It is somewhat misleading, although not deliberately so, for the 
government House leader to suggest that the framework which the 
motion establishes provides an opportunity for the question to be 
put on each and every piece of legislation that would be reinstated 
within this framework. What will happen is that the bill will be 
reinstated at the particular point at which it was when the last 
session came to an end. There will be no question put.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The government House leader suggests that there will be 
individual questions put on whether or not legislation is reinstated. 
That is the question we are debating here; not the questions that 
will be put at the various stages of legislation, but whether the 
legislation itself will be reinstated. That is the question that 
opposition members want put and those are the questions that will 
not be put if this framework motion is adopted.
<P>
	The government House leader suggests that somehow there will 
be individual questions put with respect to these 30 bills. The point 
was rightly made that we are talking about 30 bills, not just the five 
that we found so offensive and which the Liberals found offensive 
when the Conservatives tried to do a similar thing in May 1991.
<P>
	Is there no end to the parliamentary hypocrisy, call it what you 
like, which we see from Parliament to Parliament to Parliament 
where people get up on the government side and do in spades what 
they condemned in an even smaller form when they were in 
opposition? Is there no end?
<P>
	I have seen this happen on a number of occasions. I have seen 
Conservatives condemn Liberals and then do it. I have seen 
Liberals condemn Conservatives and then do it. In this case it is the 
Liberals who condemn the Conservatives and who now come 
before us with a motion which does in a much more exaggerated 
way the very thing that they found so heinous in May 1991. We  
had a bad decision in May 1991. That motion never should have 
been deemed acceptable by the Speaker at that time, a Speaker for 
whom I had a great deal of respect, but I have to say I did not agree 
with him on that occasion.
<P>
	We should not let that precedent be magnified now by the 
advancement of this particular motion. Basically if it is adopted it 
will create a situation in which the end of session and a throne 
speech really becomes just a PR opportunity for the government. It 
is not the end of a session and the beginning of something new. It is 
not what the end of session and the beginning of a new session used 
to be. It is basically just a little photo-op for the government 
because nothing stops. It does not have to take responsibility for 
the parliamentary timetable. If it cannot score with the goal posts 
the way they are and get its legislation through, this motion simply 
says move the goal posts.
<P>
	It says we can do anything we like with the standing orders any 
time we like. There is too much of that going on. Too much of it 
went on under the Conservatives for nine years where they just 
moved the goal posts. I remember one time they had a motion 
where they just said they could change any standing order any time 
in any way they liked.
<P>
	What we have here is a kind of parliamentary dictatorship when 
it comes to standing orders. The Liberals saw through it at the time. 
Yet now they do a very similar thing and it is very distressing. They 
ought to think twice before they do this. For once somebody should 
not do in government what they condemned in opposition. Indeed 
they should say that was wrong and we are not going to do a similar 
thing when we are in government. Would that not be a refreshing 
change?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see several members standing. I will go 
back and forth on this. I would ask all members to please not repeat 
any point that has already been made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to respond very briefly to some of the points that 
have been raised.
<P>
	First, there is a major difference between this initiative and the 
one of 1991. This time we are offering an enabling motion and the 
bills are reintroduced afterward. They are not introduced 
automatically by way of the motion. That is the first point.
<P>
	Second, Mr. Speaker will surely recognize and recall that there 
was a very interesting debate in which a member of the Reform 
Party, namely the member for Lethbridge, offered a very 
constructive suggestion to bring back bills that had already reached 
a certain stage in the previous session. In fact, what the government 
House leader has done is precisely that.
<P>
	I just heard a bit of heckling from an hon. member from the 
Reform Party who said that was only for private  members' bills. 
Imagine the following proposition. The government in a different 
Parliament had attempted to resuscitate only government bills and 
that was deemed to be wrong. Now the Reform Party's solution is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="30"> 30 </A></B>
<P>
to only reinstate opposition motions or bills and that would 
presumably, according to their criteria, make it right.
<P>
	As the hon. House leader stated, if the arguments made by the 
Reform Party some weeks ago were correct, then surely the 
arguments would apply equally to opposition members as they 
would to government members. In fact, the enabling motion 
offered by the government House leader today proposes a 
mechanism whereby members, if they wish, can revive their own 
bills within a 30 day time frame. It does not resuscitate or revive all 
bills, but for those members who wish to bring them back, it brings 
back to the House in an accelerated mechanism bills that had 
passed second reading. For instance, there could be bills where the 
solution has already been offered.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some parliamentarians may choose not to proceed with certain 
bills. That is their choice. We are still entitled in this House to 
adopt a practical mechanism such as proposed by the member for 
Lethbridge. However, if he were right, his reasoning in my opinion 
would have to apply to both sides of the House. Parliamentarians 
on both sides must be equally entitled to return bills to the stage 
they were at prior to prorogation.
<P>
	In brief, this is the decision the Chair will have to make to put an 
end to this debate. I hope the Chair will decide the government may 
proceed with the consideration of this motion.
<P>
	The Reform and Bloc members have not convinced the Chair, I 
think, or at least they have not convinced me of the merits of their 
argument. The argument remains perfectly valid in that we have a 
motion before us which is entirely in keeping with our rules.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, it is now 6.30 p.m. I think I 
have heard enough. The question is a very serious one. We will 
consider the point our colleagues have raised and rule on its 
admissibility as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly the House is adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
