	<B>The Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 100, I do now leave 
the chair for the House to go into committee of the whole.
<P>
	(House in committee on Bill C-5, an act to amend the customs 
tariff, Mr. Kilger in the chair.)
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> Shall clause 1 carry?
<P>
	On clause 1:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
assume that at this stage we can put questions to the minister 
before the bill's single clause is passed. Clause-by-clause 
consideration should not take very long!
<P>
	On second reading of Bill C-5 a few days ago, we expressed 
some reservations about this bill which mainly concerned two 
questions. Under the new GATT agreements, we will eventually 
have to reassess the preferential tariff for developing countries. 
The minister had said he intends to do this with the co-operation 
of the business community. The question we asked at the time, 
and which we are still asking, is: Does the minister intend to 
consult parliamentarians in any way, either in the House or at the 
very least in committee, either the Committee on Finance or the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> The general system provides for 
consultations with the business community on any issue at any 
time.
<P>
	No changes are made in the general preferential tariffs unless 
there is consultation with the business community. Any time we 
receive anything from a group of businessmen or an association 
that questions the level of the general preferential tariff it can be 
referred to finance officials and considered at that time.
<P>
	It is more important that the business community which is 
affected by that be consulted than individual members of 
Parliament. Of course any member of Parliament can bring their 
concerns to the attention of the minister or the Department of 
Finance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Chairman, we would like to see 
parliamentarians consulted about any changes in the GPT, 
simply because of the political overtones and possibly the 
political consequences that these changes might have.
<P>
	The reason I mention this-in fact, the hon. member for 
Louis-Hébert and I both brought this up in our speeches is that 
today, some countries that benefit under the GPT can no longer 
be called developing countries, and I am thinking specifically of 
Singapore and South Korea. If we reassess the relevance of 
granting these countries GPT status, I think this might 
eventually have a political impact on our relations with those 
countries.
<P>
	We also expressed the hope that respect for human rights 
would be a consideration in the case of certain countries 
benefitting under the GPT. One example is the People's 
Republic of China which, at 33 per cent, I think, is the main 
beneficiary of this general preferential tariff. My question is 
therefore whether we should eventually reconsider granting the 
GPT status to countries that openly violate human rights.
<P>
	I think parliamentarians should be able to consider any 
reassessment of the GPT status of the countries involved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, those were very important 
questions. There was first the graduation of countries from the 
GPT. Some countries have been graduated and I am sure the hon. 
member means South Korea and Singapore. They have been 
graduated by the Americans for example and are no longer in 
that group of countries. Others such as Europe and Japan have 
not done that to these countries.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	The question of whether these countries should be removed 
from this group which gets the advantage of the GPT is 
something we can look at at any time. If a member wishes to 
raise it for a particular country or if any standing committee of 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2162"> 2162 </A></B>
<P>
House decides it wants to examine any of these results that can 
be done at any time. It is not a closed situation at all.
<P>
	The question of whether Canada should graduate the countries 
the hon. member mentioned is one which could be considered at 
any time. It is not difficult to make a change but we have to 
realize it has not been generally accepted to do that.
<P>
	The other question was on the use of the GPT as a lever to 
human rights questions. That has been done on occasion. Where 
there is a general consensus usually through the United Nations 
or something similar that has happened. It is possible to do that.
<P>
	With respect to China, I remind the hon. member that China is 
a major developing market and its record on human rights may 
have some questions. China is a major developing market for 
Canada. Canada has had a great interest in the opening up of 
China right from the very earliest times. We were one of the first 
western countries to recognize China and we have had very good 
relations.
<P>
	It is extremely important that we retain our influence in China 
through the acceptance of the GPT to have the largest benefit 
from this. But there are a lot of other benefits on the other side as 
well in that Canadian companies have been opening up business 
there. The GPT helps Canadian companies in their general 
relations with China.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Chairman, I know 
that through the General Preferential Tariff, Canada maintains 
special trade relations with some 180 countries. I would like the 
Minister to remind me whether all those countries are in a single 
category or whether there are different categories of tariffs for 
different countries? Based on his answer, I will have another 
question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, there are two categories actually. 
The least developed countries are zero rated. These are the 
poorest countries in the world. Then there are those in the less 
developed category which are subject to the general GPT. There 
are two categories.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Mr. Chairman, this is, in a way, a supplementary 
question based on the answer. On what criteria is a country 
selected for one category rather than the other? I am also asking 
this in the light of the comments by my colleague for Verchères, 
because in the least developed countries category, there are 
countries which are probably not among the least developed. So, 
what are the selection criteria? And would it not be better, in the 
future, to have a more gradual scale instead of just two 
categories?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, it would be possible to have any 
number of categories. We have used the United Nations 
classification which is generally accepted throughout the world. 
There is always some question as to whether we move from one 
category to another but clearly the United Nations categories are 
pretty well accepted throughout the world. That is why we use 
those categories.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I would like to ask the minister whether there are any 
guidelines for or any monitoring done of the products brought in 
by these preferential tariffs to ensure that our consumers benefit 
from them and to ensure that they do not get lost in the retailing 
or the reselling after they have been imported by the importers. 
Could he comment on that, please?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, I do not think we could ever 
exactly tell where the imports go. They are generally part of the 
accepted items found in stores. We could turn over a plastic item 
in a hardware store and find it was made in China. If so, it 
probably came in under the GPT. We have to look at the source.
<P>
	There is no way we could trace it. It is not of particular 
interest to trace it. It is a benefit to the Canadian consumer to 
have access to a particular good at that particular price, and a 
benefit to the country exporting it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> I have a supplementary question, Mr. 
Chairman.
<P>
	The Reform Party is quite favourable to freer trade, but we 
have to look at our manufacturers so that there is fair 
competition. I feel some kind of monitoring should be going on 
so that our consumers do not have to pay the price and a few 
importers get rich by making sacrifices on these tariffs. We have 
to be fair in this trade if we are to have this type of trade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, every time a question is raised by 
a manufacturer we look at it. We rely on Canadian 
manufacturers of competing products to tell us that there is a 
problem.
<P>
	As a matter of fact we search out people concerning tariff 
reduction. Whenever there is a particular tariff question we refer 
to manufacturers. A lot of them are intermediate goods, a lot of 
them come in at the behest of Canadian manufacturers to make 
their products more acceptable at a better price for production in 
Canada and for export abroad. There are substantial benefits to 
Canadian producers and manufacturers of these goods, not just 
at the retail level.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron: </B>Mr. Chairman, a few minutes ago, the minister 
was saying that the classification used by the federal 
government is based on the United Nations classification. The 
question I am asking myself is whether we should consider 
South Korea or Singapore as less developed countries or as 
developing countries. Of course, the answer is crystal clear and 
self-explanatory: Singapore and South Korea are no longer 
developing countries, but newly industrialized countries.
<P>
	I would have two short questions for the minister concerning 
what he told us earlier. Does the government intend to reassess 
the general preferential tariffs allowed to newly industrialized 
countries such as Singapore or South Korea? The minister was 
pointing to us, rightly so, that the United States, for example, 
had removed the general preferential tariffs allowed to those 
countries, but that Japan and the European countries had not yet 
done so.
<P>
	Does the Canadian government intend to follow the United 
States or the wait and see policy of Japan and Europe? I would 
like him to inform us on that matter.
<P>
	I also have a sub-question relating to the first one. The 
minister is somewhat leaving up to parliamentarians and 
committees the initiative of asking the government to consult 
them. I ask the minister and the government, through him: Does 
the government intend to directly submit the matter to 
parliamentarians, through the Committee on Finance or the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade?
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, I will answer the last question 
first. Any parliamentary committee can ask to have the question 
raised and can ask the minister to do so. At any point either the 
Standing Committee on Finance or any other standing 
committee can ask to have it referred.
<P>
	The first question the hon. member asked was about 
reassessing the granting of the GPT to South Korea and 
Singapore. That is not under active consideration at the moment. 
Should there be some change, for example if Europe and Japan 
moved, I think we would bring it under active consideration.
<P>
	It is not under active consideration right now to change the 
GPT rules for South Korea or Singapore.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron: </B>Mr. Chairman, please allow me to ask my 
second question again. The minister has been implying since the 
beginning of our committee's proceedings that members of 
Parliament and committees can ask to be consulted on issues 
like that one.
<P>
	Since the beginning of the present session, the government 
has been saying it wants to consult members in this House or in 
the various committees. As they said during the pre-budget 
conferences, they even claim they want to consult the 
population. Is it the intention of the government to consult 
members of Parliament on graduation from the GPT by certain 
countries, which profit from the General Preferential Tariff, as it 
is their intention to consult business people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, the level of consultation is the 
basis of the hon. member's question. The level of consultation is 
quite high on these matters at any time. We have received a 
number of requests from businesses to consider certain 
products, certain countries and things like that.
<P>
	A number of parliamentarian have written to the department 
over the years to ask whether it would consider particular tariff 
items. It is quite possible. Another method would be to have the 
standing committee merely ask that it be considered. If the 
standing committee asks that question it would be considered.
<P>
	The avenues of consultation are rather high on this particular 
item. The GPT has been in effect for 20 years, so we have had 20 
years of experience with consultation and it has worked rather 
well over that period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask a question 
of the hon. minister. I see in my notes that on an annual basis we 
lose about $156 million in preferential tariff reductions. With 
expanded trade as a global community, has the minister done 
any projections on how much of an increase it will be? We are 
trading more and more with these countries. Is there any way he 
can project what kind of an impact it would have on our 
economy?
<P>
	The more preferential products we bring in, the more we have 
to consume. They also reduce the revenue side for the 
government. I would appreciate it if the minister would give me 
a bit of a guideline on that point.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, this is a very interesting question. 
If we lower the tariffs on certain goods we can make a nice 
estimate as to how much money we will lose. However, if we had 
the tariffs in place we would not make money because the goods 
would not come in. We say we have lost $158 million, but it is 
$158 million we would not have had anyway because the goods 
would not come in with the ordinary tariffs.
<P>
	It is a very difficult estimate to make. That is part of the key. 
This is a good deal for both the Canadian people and for 
developing countries. Developing countries have said that they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2164"> 2164 </A></B>
<P>
want trade, not aid. That was a good way of putting it. We can 
put forth any number as lost revenue, but it is not lost revenue. It 
is revenue we would not get in any case.
<P>
	Making a projection into future years means, if we have 
higher revenue losses, that it is revenue we would not have 
received anyway. If we had put on the tariffs we would not get it. 
However it is a real benefit to Canadians and a real benefit to 
developing countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. minister. 
When I look at the trade figures we have with other countries, 
not just underdeveloped countries, my concern is that the 
Canadian government seems to have been a very poor trader. We 
have deficits with the majority of countries. The United States is 
practically the only country with which we have a trade surplus.
<P>
	The government should be vigilant. We should make trade 
deals with these countries that benefit us to some extent. We 
cannot be at the short end of the stick all of the time. With the 
$500 billion deficit we already have, we have to improve our 
trading practices to increase revenue.
<P>
	I would ask the minister and the government to be very 
vigilant in improving our trading practices because we have to 
become better businessmen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, I take that admonishment with 
great sincerity. We are going to be very vigilant about our 
trading practices. I have written on the subject of our balance of 
payments deficit for 10 or 20 years and have said that we should 
be pursuing strong trading relationships, relationships that 
reduce our balance of payments deficit which is running around 
$25 billion a year right now. That is a high priority of this 
country.
<P>
	I also remind the hon. member that it is two-way trade. We 
must remember there is only benefit to trade if it goes in both 
directions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Mr. Chairman, I feel that up to a point this question 
of the GPT should be related to Canada's external policy. No 
doubt our policy is silent on that issue, but it seems we are facing 
a contradiction: When Canada takes part in bilateral aid 
programs with other countries, that is one country to another, we 
know that as it did in the past and is still doing today in some 
cases, Canada links such aid to the respect of human rights. With 
regards to the GPT, since it is also a process for helping 
developing countries and seing that we are still in the same 
country, Canada, as far as I know, why is it that Canada's 
external policy does not force partner countries to respect 
human rights?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, the member is asking how 
effective trade sanctions are in approving human rights in 
developing countries. The only way that trade sanctions can be 
effective is when they are done generally by a massive number 
of countries. That will have some impact.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada is far too small a market for almost any country to 
have an impact on its own. We are really only harming ourselves 
if we try do that sort of thing.
<P>
	Trade sanctions, where it is possible to use them, and it has 
been done only very seldom, are only effective if at all effective 
when done in conjunction with, for example, the whole United 
Nations, the whole Commonwealth or something like that.
<P>
	It is not really possible to have any impact on these countries 
with our very small market here in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Mr. Chairman, I do understand the minister's 
answer. However, I would like to point out that there have been 
precedents when Canada took the initiative of organizing a 
coalition. Such was the case in South Africa, with apartheid and 
human rights violations. We then saw how Canada played a role 
in setting up a dialogue among nations and forcing many 
countries to take a stand, which did have an impact.
<P>
	Saying that we cannot do anything because these countries are 
too small and we hardly trade with them is not the way to go, I 
think. It seems to me that Canada should play an international 
role there too, by bringing other nations to boycott countries 
which violate human rights. I think that it could be just as 
efficient as it was against South Africa.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, in any instance where there is a 
serious breach of human rights where Canada could take the 
lead, certainly the GPT would be part of the initiatives. It is not 
just those initiatives. One would want to do a whole lot of things 
and that is the question.
<P>
	The GPT itself is not significant in the total sphere of items 
that one would use in foreign policy. That is clearly a foreign 
policy question. Canada would have to be taking a lead through 
the foreign policy sector through our Minister of Foreign Affairs 
and through a whole host of organizations like the 
Commonwealth, the Organization of American States or the 
United Nations to bring pressures on the country.
<P>
	The GPT would be part of that and could very easily be part of 
a major change like that. Therefore I would think the hon. 
member is quite correct. It could be part of it but it would be a 
minor part of a major foreign policy initiative if that were 
needed in any particular case.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Mr. Chairman, I can see a dilemma there. I 
understand that it might happen that the volume of trade with 
these countries be relatively small. The minister seems to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2165"> 2165 </A></B>
<P>
indicate that since it only represents a minor part of 
international trade, one does not feel the need to intervene.
<P>
	But on the other hand, it could be the opposite, as we saw in 
Mexico, this past winter. There were serious violations of 
natives'rights in Chiapas, and the Mexican army itself moved to 
crush their rebellion. If I am not mistaken, Canada and Mexico 
are trading partners, and the volume of their trade is bound to 
increase. And yet, Canada did not take any drastic stand, no 
more that it had in the other cases. Its action was limited to a few 
questions asked of the ambassador, which brings me to conclude 
that when it is not important, we do not intervene. But when 
trade is important, we do not intervene either.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would remind the hon. member 
that Mexico is now a NAFTA country and does not come under 
the GPT. It is under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
Again let me stress that the GPT is only a minor part of our trade 
relationships. It is a minor part of our total foreign relationship 
with any country. Our foreign relationships with the developing 
countries are important through our CIDA grants, through our 
foreign missions and various groups. It is much more important 
to have close foreign relationships pursued there rather than 
through a GPT.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Only after all those other things have been done would the 
GPT be included with a major change. It could very easily be 
included. The legislation allows the changes to be made very 
quickly. It would not be effective to make a GPT change alone 
and say that is all we are going to do. We would want to do a lot 
of other things with it and there would be a lot of other 
questions.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that the GPT at this level 
is low on our list of things in our total foreign relationships with 
any of the developing countries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Chairman, a while ago the minister hinted 
that the Canadian business community had asked to be consulted 
on the question of the General Preferential Tariff. We are 
pleased to hear this and we can understand its position. The 
minister indicated that he was willing to go along with the 
request and that he would consult with the Canadian business 
community.
<P>
	My question is the same: Does the government plan to consult 
with members of Parliament or will the minister, as he has been 
hinting since the beginning of these proceedings, let individual 
members of Parliament or the committee take the initiative of 
asking the government to consult with them? With respect to the 
General Preferential Tariff, does the government intend to 
pursue the same policies that it has been pursuing since the start 
of this session? In other words, does it plan to consult, or at least 
make some show of consulting with, members of Parliament on 
this issue?
<P>
	The minister also implied that, all things being equal, the 
General Preferential Tariff was only a very minor aspect of our 
foreign policy. This may be true as far as we are concerned, but it 
is certainly not the case for developing countries seeking at all 
costs markets for their products.
<P>
	I would invite the minister to reflect upon this point, and I 
would also ask him to be sensitive to the fact that-and this has 
been clear from the beginning of this debate-the General 
Preferential Tariff can have a major influence on our 
international relations. That is why we are asking the 
government today to consult members of Parliament on this 
issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Chairman, I am at a loss to see what further 
consultation we could have. If any standing committee would 
like to consider this, it could do so. It is perfectly natural for a 
standing committee to call it. It could call this question up and 
consider the GPT.
<P>
	As far as consulting with the business community, yes indeed 
we have consulted widely and continue to consult on every issue 
that comes up with the business community that is affected. Any 
member of Parliament who hears from a businessman is quite 
free to bring that to our attention. I hope they will. They have 
done so in the past.
<P>
	As a minister I cannot refer it to a committee. The committee 
has to ask the question and any committee may do so.
<P>
	(Clause agreed to.)
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	(Title agreed to.)
<P>
	(Bill reported.)
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that the bill be concurred in at report stage.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When shall the bill be 
read the third time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that the bill 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill C-5, an act to extend the general 
preferential tariff for another 10 years, received broad support 
during second reading.
<P>
	This reflects, I think, a consensus within this House that 
Canada as a member of the international community of nations 
must continue to take an active role in advancing international 
economic development efforts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2166"> 2166 </A></B>
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their informed commentary on 
this bill. As mentioned by an hon. member during second 
reading, although only one line in length, Bill C-5 has 
considerable impact through what it actually does.
<P>
	To summarize, this bill will extend the tariff scheme that 
provides over 180 developing countries and territories with 
preferential access to the Canadian market. This is of direct 
benefit to the people of the developing world whose livelihoods 
are partly dependent on the performance of the often limited 
export sectors of their economy. Bill C-5, together with the 
related consultations on the structure and scope of the GPT 
program that this government will be undertaking over the 
coming months, reaffirms our commitment to encourage 
economic growth in the developing world.
<P>
	Again I thank all hon. members for their support of this 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to confirm, as we did at second reading, the 
support of the Bloc Quebecois and Official Opposition for this 
bill that we consider extremely important, as it provides 
indirectly for development assistance and is therefore, in our 
opinion, a bill with a most commendable and honourable 
purpose.
<P>
	At committee stage, the hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette 
expressed a number of concerns about the protection of 
Canadian industries, producers and businesses with regard to 
the application of the general preferential tariff. I think that my 
colleague's concerns and questions were well answered by the 
minister who pointed out to the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette the benefits that can accrue to Canadian 
business from the general preferential tariff.
<P>
	We must also bear in mind that we all stand to benefit 
collectively-the international community as well as 
Canada-from the development of developing countries and 
that there are only winners, no losers, with something like the 
general preferential tariff.
<P>
	We did express a number of concerns at second reading and 
again in committee.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	We understand that the government is about to undertake 
consultations with the Canadian private sector, and we could not 
agree more. We encourage the government to consult Canadian 
businesses on the issue of the general preferential tariff. Our 
collective well-being is at stake, as well as that of Canadian 
producers and industries.
<P>
	However, we consider that any change to the tariff itself or to 
the list of countries benefitting from this tariff would have 
political implications and must therefore be debated in 
Parliament.
<P>
	We raised two glaring examples of cases where we, the 
Official Opposition, believe that parliamentarians should be 
consulted. We pointed out the case of newly industrialized 
countries and gave the example of Singapore and South Korea, 
which now benefit from the general preferential tariff. What we 
should be asking is whether Canada should continue to extend 
its general preferential tariff to those countries.
<P>
	The minister made the pertinent comment that the United 
States has stopped extending its general preferential tariff to 
such countries, while Japan and Europe have not done so yet. He 
went on to say that the government is not really looking at this 
issue for the time being but that it would reconsider if Japan and 
Europe decided to move in that direction. This is quite 
surprising from a government claiming to be in favour of 
implementing a more independent policy.
<P>
	We also looked at the case of the People's Republic of China, 
which is the main beneficiary of Canada's general preferential 
tariff, to the tune of about 40 per cent. As we know full well, 
China is guilty of human rights violations and we asked the 
following question: Should countries such as that one with very 
little respect for human rights continue to benefit from Canada's 
general preferential tariff?
<P>
	The minister was a little evasive in answering these questions 
and we asked him to consult parliamentarians. We do not want 
him to wait for us to express our interest in the general 
preferential tariff through a parliamentary committee or through 
individual initiatives. We would have expected the government 
to take the initiative, as it has done since this session started, to 
consult parliamentarians on this issue with a great impact on our 
foreign policy.
<P>
	Having said that, I reiterate our full support for this bill whose 
goals, as we said earlier, are quite honourable and 
commendable.
<P>
	I thank the government for bringing this issue to the attention 
of the House at the very beginning of the session. I also thank the 
minister for answering the questions we asked him in committee 
of the whole. I thank all hon. members who took part in the 
debate; it was very interesting. As far as the committee of the 
whole is concerned, I must point out the work done by the 
interpreters, who had a difficult job to do during this rather 
fast-paced exchange.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate and 
thank the support staff on both sides of the House, who assisted 
us in our research. As the minister underlined, the research was 
well documented and, in this regard, I must say how much we in 
the Official Opposition appreciate the work done by our 
researcher, Hugo Séguin.
<P>
	I reiterate our support for this bill and urge once again the 
minister to reconsider his decision not to consult 
parliamentarians as a matter of course and to decide  instead to 
consult us and

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has been a good experience for me to be involved with this 
bill, a new experience for a farmer who just knows how to turn 
tractor wheels instead of turning politicians.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	It has been really gratifying to see this bill go through the 
House in a smooth order. We have had some very good debate. 
We have looked at some issues. I have expressed, as my 
colleagues have, that there are some concerns. We believe fully 
that the hon. minister will take these concerns to heart and be 
vigilant about them.
<P>
	I have followed the career of the hon. minister somewhat in 
his previous business experience and I always appreciated his 
comments. I know that he always stressed that we had to have 
black at the bottom instead of red. If he watches this bill as 
intently as he did at that time for his profession and makes sure 
that the majority of times the Canadian government will be in 
the black with these trading relationships it will be a benefit for 
the country.
<P>
	I have faith in this hon. minister that he will do that because he 
is a Canadian, as we Reformers are. We have very strongly made 
the comments in this House that we are for free trade but that we 
also believe in fair trade. That is one of the stipulations that the 
hon. minister has to accept. We will be critical when it is not fair 
trade but we will support him very strongly in freer trade with 
these underdeveloped countries.
<P>
	I really enjoyed the debate in this House. Where I have made a 
few mistakes I hope hon. members will forgive me and bear with 
me so that in the future we can operate this House and continue 
to make decisions that are positive for this nation as a whole 
because that is what we are here for.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before going on I would 
like to take the occasion, following the remarks from the hon.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Natural 
Resources)</B> moved that Bill C-6, an act to amend the Canada Oil 
<P>
and Gas Operations Act, the Canada Petroleum Resources Act 
and the National Energy Board Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, hon. members, I 
am pleased to speak before this House today during the debate 
on the second reading of Bill C-6, to amend the Canada Oil and 
Gas Operations Act, the Canada Petroleum Resources Act and 
the National Energy Board Act.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to give the National Energy Board 
the authority to regulate oil and gas activity in those frontier 
areas where there are no federal-provincial management 
agreements.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Specifically the National Energy Board will assume the 
technical regulatory functions associated with oil and gas 
drilling and production operations. This involves ensuring that 
the work is carried out in a way that maximizes resource 
conservation by ensuring good oilfield practices, protects 
worker safety and protects our fragile northern and coastal 
environments.
<P>
	There are many good reasons behind the transfer of authority 
to the National Energy Board under this proposed legislation. 
Since its creation in 1981 the Canadian Oil and Gas Lands 
Administration, or COGLA, administered and regulated 
activities on frontier lands on behalf of ministers.
<P>
	Canada's frontier lands, which encompass land north of 60 
and the offshore, fall under federal jurisdictions. The Minister 
of National Resources shares the responsibility for 
administering these lands with the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development.
<P>
	While COGLA served the government well, its role has 
changed and contracted over the years. Following the 
conclusion of the agreements with Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland regulation of the east coast offshore was 
delegated to joint offshore boards. Further, it was anticipated 
that the federal role would continue to diminish with the signing 
of agreements which would transfer onshore oil and gas 
responsibilities to the territorial governments.
<P>
	As a result COGLA was disbanded in 1991. COGLA's 
technical regulatory responsibilities and many of its staff were 
assigned to the National Energy Board in Calgary at that time. 
However, three years later decision making authority still rests 
with ministers in Ottawa who must approve even minor 
regulatory decisions. This is a time  consuming, complicated 
and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2168"> 2168 </A></B>
<P>
ineffective process. It is time to act decisively to give the NEB 
the authority to make decisions to do its job.
<P>
	Through this bill the Government of Canada proposes to 
consolidate frontier oil and gas regulation. This will streamline 
and simplify the approval process and operational 
responsibilities as well. These changes represent a small but 
important step.
<P>
	We believe that it is crucial that in an increasingly 
competitive world we must provide Canadians and foreign 
investors with a clear regulatory framework in which to operate. 
The federal government must demonstrate a commitment to 
establish a regulatory environment that minimizes the burden on 
those who will ultimately create the opportunities and jobs to 
which this government is firmly committed.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	These changes are reflective of another important 
Government of Canada priority-to ensure that government 
services are delivered in a cost effective manner. We recognize 
that reducing the deficit and restraining government 
expenditure is a priority for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In times of fiscal austerity such as these governments must 
make every effort to look for ways to give the taxpayers of this 
country the best value for their money. One way to do so is to 
ensure that the size and the structure of our institutions reflect 
the level of work required of them.
<P>
	This bill represents another step in the ongoing process of 
effectively downsizing and reorganizing government 
responsibilities.
<P>
	In addition to savings for taxpayers, this bill should result in 
cost savings for energy. Through streamlining operations we 
will save industry time and we recognize that for industry time 
is money. Just as important, however, we are maintaining the 
quality and integrity of the regulatory process of Canada's oil 
and gas sectors.
<P>
	I see that it is eleven o'clock. With the Chair's permission I 
will stop here and perhaps the House can proceed with members' 
statements and question period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do thank the hon. member for being so 
understanding.
<P>
	It being eleven o'clock a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by Members, 
pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in commemoration of International Women's Week I would like 
to say a few words about the considerable contribution of 
Canadian women in the field of agriculture.
<P>
	The shift in the role of rural women has been growing ever 
since grain and land prices collapsed in the early 1980s.
<P>
	Between 1981 and 1986, while the total number of farm 
operators in Canada fell by 8 per cent, the number of female 
farm operators increased by 18 per cent.
<P>
	Farm women are suddenly in startling numbers becoming 
co-managers with their husbands or becoming sole operators. 
They are proving to be very sharp in the business and marketing 
end of the industry, a crucial element of modern day agriculture.
<P>
	I have co-managed our family farm with my husband and 
family for 25 years.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to salute the growing 
contributions of Canadian farm women who, in partnership or 
alone, have successfully adapted to the increasing complexities 
of the agriculture industry.

kept hearing in this House and in committees that Quebecers and 
Canadians must tighten their belts, that governments can no 
longer provide families and seniors with the social security to 
which they are entitled.
<P>
	In spite of all that, how can one explain that, since the start of

Challenger jet twice for vacation trips to the South? How can 
one decently defend a bill of $160,000 or maybe even $700,000,

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, each day my 
office is inundated with paper, everything from copies of 
<I>Hansard</I> to various government publications. A large portion of 
this steady paper flow ends up as waste.
<P>
	In 1992 the Hill produced 472 tonnes of paper waste. When I 
asked if there was a more efficient way of providing MPs with 
information, I learned that Parliamentary Publications is 
already working toward this goal.
<P>
	It is developing a CD ROM computer system which will 
eventually allow MPs and their staff to access publications such 
as <I>Hansard</I> through their computers. This new system will not 
only be environmentally friendly but will also cut down on the 
government's printing budget. According to the House of 
Commons estimates for 1994-95, the new system will save the 
government between $200,000 and $300,000.
<P>
	Other areas of government are also moving in this modern, 
cost efficient direction; Revenue Canada, for example. I would 
urge not only the departments but the ministers of government to 
take leadership and implement this important stage for others.

I rise today to commend the Government of Alberta for its 
generous gesture to renegotiate its loan arrangements with the 
Government of Newfoundland in recognition of the tough times 
Newfoundland is experiencing as a result of the collapse of the 
cod fishery there.
<P>
	This gesture demonstrates a generosity of spirit which has 
manifested the Canadian tradition of sharing, co-operating and 
assisting one another to make this country a better place.
<P>
	That spirit has allowed us to make Canada one of the most 
desirable places in the world to live. This spirit of collective will 
and national goals is shared by Canadians in all provinces, 
including Quebecers, but regrettably it is not reflected in a 
major policy plank of the Official Opposition which pursues a 
policy of separation.
<P>
	We should all be grateful that we have the privilege of 
considering that policy in a peaceful and democratic way in 
Ottawa, in Quebec City and in all provinces.
<P>
	However, I want to suggest today that in many ways this 
commendable gesture by the province of Alberta is the

invest in people. Canada spends some $55 billion per year on 
education and training. The level of our investment is world 
class but the relevance and equality of Canadian education are 
being questioned.
<P>
	On February 28 the Minister of Human Resources 
Development met with provincial ministers. The federal 
government supported the national agenda announced last fall 
by the Council of Ministers of Education in its Victoria joint 
declaration.
<P>
	This government is working closely with the council to

<P>
	I understand redistribution is done as required by statute after 
each decennial census. In Saskatchewan we neither gain nor lose 
seats. In this time of fiscal restraint I find it difficult to 
understand why we need to spend millions of dollars to change 
ridings that are well represented by current members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Redistribution will not mean more effective representation in 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Therefore I call upon the government to introduce legislation 
to forgo redistribution in Saskatchewan on this decennial 
census. This would save the Canadian taxpayers money and 
preserve the representation that they now enjoy.

	Whether it is passenger or freight transportation, the Liberal

particularly in eastern Quebec. The government seems quite 
remote from the concern of Canadians who want a public 
transportation system which is fair and respectful of the 
environment. In this difficult economic context, when 
employment is scarce, the Liberal government is losing interest

<P>
including academics, bishops, union leaders and business 
people, to take up the fight against poverty, which is affecting an 
increasingly larger segment of society.
<P>
	Instead of proposing measures to eliminate poverty, the latest 
federal budget merely aggravates the problem by shifting many 
people who would normally have access to unemployment 
insurance on the welfare rolls.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that Canada is getting poorer 
and poorer and that an increasingly large proportion of the 
population is suffering as a result? And could he explain what 
he, as the Prime Minister of Canada, intends to do to give new 
hope to four million people who are living below the poverty 
line?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government realizes it is very important to create jobs in 
order to restore the dignity of Canadians.
<P>
	Clearly, the current system has not managed to eliminate 
poverty. We want to eliminate it by trying new policies, a new 
approach that will create jobs and restore the dignity of 
Canadians. A committee of the House of Commons is examining 
these issues at the moment. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development is working on a plan to take all our social 
programs and focus them on job creation. As soon as people 
have jobs, their dignity is restored and they can get out of the 
poverty cycle.
<P>
	That is the approach the government has decided to take, and 
we will keep on trying until we succeed. I hope we can count on 
the co-operation of the opposition parties for this new approach, 
because unemployment insurance and welfare are not the 
answer. The answer is dignity through work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister realize that according to a very thorough study 
by the Conseil scolaire de l'île de Montréal, Quebec has the 
largest number of low income families of any province in 
Canada, in other words, 31.8 per cent of all poor families in this 
country, and that cutting and restructuring social programs to 
save money is not going to restore people's dignity and provide 
jobs? What does the Prime Minister of Canada intend to do to 
change a situation that has become very bad for families in 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just answered the question. We have embarked on a fundamental 
reform of our approach to employment and social security, and 
that is the mandate I gave the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. The committee that is considering these issues is 
to report to the House very shortly.
<P>
	We hope to table legislation before Parliament by next fall 
and next spring. I would urge opposition members to take part in 
this process. The sooner we finish, the sooner we will have 
reforms that will change things, because we are not satisfied 
with the status quo.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister's answer will not satisfy families that are below the 
poverty line in this country. The Prime Minister is probably 
aware that in Canada, one child out of five is living below the 
poverty line.
<P>
	Would he agree that considering ways to cut social programs 
in Canada does not constitute a comprehensive strategy to fight 
poverty? Would he agree that his responsibility should be to put

my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	After the Minister of Human Resources Development made 
his controversial statement calling for Canadians to choose 
between old age pensions and youth training programs, the 
Prime Minister intervened to allay the fears raised by this 
statement. The Prime Minister said that the government had no 
intention of touching old age pensions.
<P>
	Now that the Prime Minister has contradicted him, can the 
Minister of Human Resources Development confirm that the

the old age security program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, the hon. member's 
question is inaccurate. I never said there had to be a choice

the hon. members opposite said.

and that we will have to review benefit programs and develop a 
system for investing these funds, which could be used for 
development and job creation. It is an issue to be examined by 
all Canadians. It is not a question of pitting seniors against 
young people but of co-operating for the benefit of all of 
Canada.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

problem and concern among seniors were the members opposite 
who raised false fears. They were responsible for that. They 
were aided by some of their journalist friends who did not look 
at what the question was doing. If there is to be an apology it 
should be from those who are out to create false fears and false 
suspicions.
<P>
	This government is trying to take an honest look at some of 
the tough realities facing this country, particularly the problems 
down the road for our social security system which the Liberals 
built.
<P>
	We are responsible for putting in place over the years an 
effective social security system for older persons. We want to 
make sure that is maintained and preserved. To do that we must 
find ways of financing it. We must find a way of ensuring that 
the large change in the seniors population which will almost 
double in the next two decades can be accommodated.

my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Several days ago the minister of Indian affairs announced that 
the government was formally proceeding to establish a new 
order of aboriginal self-government starting in Manitoba. The 
government has yet to provide this House with a clear definition 
of this new order of government.
<P>
	Recognizing the minister's long experience in the field of 
intergovernmental relations, how is the federal government 
defining aboriginal self-government in the case of Manitoba's 
aboriginals? What will be the relationship of that new order of 
government to the Government of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, these extremely important questions require complex 
answers. It would be better if the questions could be deferred 
until the minister of Indian affairs can be here to answer them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the government committed itself to establishing a new order of 
government in Manitoba surely this question must have been 
discussed at cabinet. Surely no cabinet minister would have 
committed to this concept without having a clear definition in 
law and legislation of what this concept is.
<P>
	We got nowhere asking this question of the minister of Indian 
affairs. I thought perhaps we would with the intergovernmental 
affairs minister. Perhaps I can direct this question to whoever on 
the other side understands what the meaning of aboriginal 
self-government is with respect to Manitoba. Could we be given 
that definition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the concept of self-government in Indian affairs is one 
which was used in the red book. It is not a concept that is fully 
defined. The concept will have to be defined as it is put into 
place over time. There is no doubt that federal-provincial 
co-operation will be necessary. As this slowly develops we will 
give all the details to hon. members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure all ministers will agree that in a democratic country no 
new order of government should be established without the 
consent of the governed.
<P>
	Will the federal government be conducting a formal 
referendum among the aboriginal people of Manitoba to secure 
their approval of this new order of government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

Speaker, it is quite important that the concept be discussed 
among the aboriginal people and discussed by the various 
stakeholders in the country, including federal and provincial 
governments and the aboriginal people.

has been negotiated with the various parties. This is what we

this information was made available to Canadian law officials

<P>

<P>
	The federal budget does not appear capable of putting our 
public finances in order, considering that it foresees a 
record-high deficit of nearly $40 billion, does not address the 
numerous instances of squandering brought to light by the

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2175"> 2175 </A></B>

	In the meantime, the pitiful state of our public finances 
requires an additional risk premium to be paid on interest rates, 
a premium which could cost the federal government as much as 
$5 billion a year.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that his lack of credibility with 
the international markets in the fight to curb the deficit is the 
direct cause of this $5 billion surcharge in interest costs to the 
Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I find it somewhat 
ironic that the hon. member would ask me a question about 
deficit reduction when his leader, deputy leader and colleagues 
keep telling us not to cut back and deal with the deficit.
<P>
	With respect to the deficit, we are clearly on the way to 
reducing it to 3 per cent of the gross domestic product within 
three years. And once this target is achieved, Canada will be in 
this good a position for the first time in 15 years. This should be 
applauded, and you are right to do so, Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
	Is it the decision of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and

Kemano and therefore natives should be the only groups entitled 
to federal intervener funding?
<P>

<P>

there is at least the proposition to be put that aboriginal 
communities and aboriginal peoples have been first impacted by

major intercontinental carrier is a thing of the past, when he 
announced yesterday that VIA Rail services would again be

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I want to clarify a point: I am sure that the hon. member was 
not implying that I had personally reacted in that fashion to 
previous cuts affecting VIA Rail, because it would not be true.
<P>
	As for the future of that crown corporation, cuts will continue 
to be made, as has been the case for the last few years. This year, 
Canadian taxpayers are contributing more than $300 million to 
VIA Rail's operations, a situation which simply cannot go on. 
We will do our best, and in fact we have asked VIA Rail to look 
at every possible option, including reducing its operations. Staff 
cutbacks have already been made and, as I said here yesterday in 
my speech, there is no doubt in my mind that other cuts will be 
made.
<P>

to integrate every system and transportation mode to create an 
efficient and integrated system and, more important, one which 
we can afford.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, does the minister agree that successive cuts to VIA 
Rail's budget mean a slow death for this crown corporation, as 
well as the loss of more than 23,000 permanent jobs in Canada 
and in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no question that no one takes any pleasure, especially as 
an Atlantic Canadian, in seeing further reductions in the 
services of VIA Rail. No longer is there any service of any kind 
in the railroad sector in Newfoundland. There is no railroad 
activity in Prince Edward Island. Other parts of the country are 
deeply  affected by the need to rationalize transportation 
services.
<P>
	As we go through this process of developing an integrated, 
affordable national transportation system, undoubtedly there 
will be some major problems for employees and for users. We 
are trying to do the very best we can with the limited resources at 
hand, particularly taking into account the already tremendous

<P>
	The assistant campaign manager of the unsuccessful Liberal

board of referees in that riding. Is this individual telling the 
truth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

very important position by his or her peers in the riding.
<P>
	As I said earlier, if the member wants to give me information I 
would be more than happy to look into it. I can give the member 
the assurance that regardless of one's political background or 
affiliation our interest is in getting the best person for the job.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently 
we have heard through the media and in the House some reports 
that the government is promoting a contract which allows for the 
harvesting and sale of seals.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans please tell the 
House whether or not the contract includes the sale of seals for 
the purposes of providing seal penises? Would the minister also 
tell the House why Canada is supporting a deal that allows for 
the export of seals to China?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for St. John's West for her 
question.
<P>
	A contract has been entered into between Terra Nova 
Fisheries of Newfoundland and Labrador and a Shanghai firm in 
China. It is a contract that provides for the use of some 50,000 
mature, adult harp seals out of a quota of 186,000 from a healthy 
and growing herd of three million.
<P>
	The contract utilizes the full seal. It involves the shipment of 
machinery into Newfoundland and Labrador for 
semi-processing of the product into pelts, blubber oil, 
byproducts and oils for finished processing of pharmaceuticals 
in China.
<P>
	The project is not dependent upon any one part of the animal. 
It is not even directed at any one part of the animal. Rather it is a 
normal processing operation, I remind the House, that flows 
from a 500-year old tradition. I believe it is good news for 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada and 
four other aluminum producing countries have committed 
themselves, last week, to helping Russian aluminum plants to 
modernize, in exchange for a reduction in Russian aluminum 
production. Canada, for one, will help in the privatizing, 
modernizing and industrial development of Russian aluminum 
plants.
<P>
	Did the Minister for International Trade analyse the 
medium-term impact of the modernization of Russian 
aluminum plants on our own aluminum industry? If so, could he 
table the results of those analyses?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the agreements that have been reached with regard 
to the orderly marketing of aluminium involve in part assistance 
to the Soviet industry to modernize and to improve its 
productive capacities. The basic point is that all this is directed 
to assuring that the disruption in aluminium markets we have 
seen in the past months and in the past year does not continue.
<P>
	I would be pleased to provide the member with additional 
information if he so desires.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, this probably 
means that the minister did not really study the impact of last 
week's agreement on our aluminum industry.
<P>
	Since he has also allocated several million dollars for the 
construction of a huge aluminum smelter in South Africa, could 
the minister acknowledge that the recent action of his 
government will jeopardize the jobs of thousands of Quebec 
aluminum workers, when these new and improved Russian 
aluminum plants are in operation?

	Mr. Robert Nixon's review of the proposed privatization of

then establish a non-profit operating authority.
<P>
	This position is supported by the five regional chairpersons

<P>
	Why is the minister delaying action when much needed jobs 
and infrastructure are at stake?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is a very serious question. Obviously the reason for some 
delay is that we want to do what is best for Canada's flagship 
airport.
<P>
	The Pearson International Airport is Canada's most important 
airport. All Canadians would know that we have just gone

<P>
	Without equivocation I must say it is absolutely intolerable 
that manufacturers of these vehicles have not taken safety

vehicles constructed and marketed with the primary purpose of 
providing transportation to parents and young children should

pleased as President of the Treasury Board to table, in both 
official languages, the annual report on Official Languages in 
Federal Institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This report covers fiscal year 1992-93. It reports on the 
progress of the official languages program in federal 
institutions. I am particularly proud to table this report because 
institutional bilingualism has come a long way since 1969 when 
the first Official Languages Act was adopted.
<P>
	This year, more precisely on September 7, we will celebrate 
the 25th anniversary of the coming into effect of the first 
Official Languages Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The 1969 legislation made English and French the official 
languages of Canada for all purposes of Parliament and the 
Government of Canada so that they would have equality of 
status in all the institutions of the Parliament and Government of 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2181"> 2181 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A new Official Languages Act replaced the 1969 legislation 
on September 15, 1988. It reflects the significant changes that 
have taken place in the status and use of the two official 
languages since that first legislation.
<P>
	The 1988 act further specifies the constitutionally entrenched 
rights and linguistic principles initially set out in the 
Constitution Act, 1867 and then in the 1982 Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	In line with the 1982 charter the 1988 act provides the 
framework and the provisions required to translate 
constitutional language guarantees and principles into day to 
day realities.
<P>
	The annual report on official languages describes the 
activities carried out and progress achieved by federal 
institutions in 1992-93 in implementing the act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It reflects their significant accomplishments in meeting the 
three main objectives and commitments of the program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are as follows. Within certain limits Canadians can deal 
with federal institutions in the official language of their choice. 
In designated bilingual regions employees of these institutions 
can work in the official language of their choice. English 
speaking and French speaking Canadians have equal 
opportunities to obtain employment and advancement in federal 
institutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government clearly expressed its conviction and 
commitment to official languages in the recent speech from the 
throne.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our cultural heritage and our official languages are at the very 
core of our Canadian identity and are sources of social and 
economic enrichment.
<P>
	In making sure that federal institutions live up to their 
obligations under the Official Languages Act the government 
will continue to transform this conviction and commitment into 
reality in its day to day operations and in its contracts with 
Canadians right across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the annual report <I>Official Languages in Federal 
Institutions</I> shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is still a 
long way to go to reach true fairness for the French speaking 
citizens of this country.
<P>
	The act could have been a development tool for francophone 
and Acadian communities in Canada by ensuring access to the 
public service in French. Unfortunately, the way the government 
views and implements its mission, it is making only Quebec 
bilingual. Is it the government's aim to destroy the stronghold of 
the French speaking community in North America?
<P>
	Let us look more closely at some figures.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, where the English speaking population is 10 per 
cent, the federal public service has 52.7 per cent bilingual 
positions, that is 15,945 out of a total of 30,234 positions. If the 
same principle were applied to Canada as a whole, the number of 
bilingual positions should be 30,666 instead of 7,465. 
Therefore, there is a glaring and shameful deficit of 23,000 
French or bilingual positions for francophones.
<P>
	For my colleagues' benefit, let us take a look at the data 
province by province. Reform Party members who think that 
bilingualism costs too much should be happy to see that so little 
is done in that regard. The Northwest Territories should have 
122 positions instead of 39; Yukon, 38 instead of 7; British 
Columbia, 1,600 instead of 394; Alberta, 1,564 instead of 395; 
Saskatchewan, 672 instead of 175; Manitoba, 2,238 instead of 
565; Ontario, excluding the National Capital, 9,136 instead of 
2,762; Nova Scotia, 2,755 instead of 750; Newfoundland, 132 
instead of 63; and New Brunswick, 12,339 instead of 2,680.
<P>
	In conclusion, in this year of the 25th anniversary of the 
Official Languages Act, the government has chosen to move the 
clock back 40 years by transferring the operations of the Collège 
militaire royal de Saint-Jean to Kingston, where Premier Bob 
Rae used too narrow an interpretation in determining that the 
number of French-speaking people in that community did not 
warrant it being declared a bilingual district.
<P>
	The Treasury Board and this government therefore do not give 
us much to rejoice over, and this anniversary, on September 7 
next, should rather be considered as a day of mourning, with the 
Canadian flag at half-mast.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. President of the Treasury Board for this 
opportunity to respond to his interesting report.
<P>
	Let me first underline that our party is not against 
bilingualism. We are not. In fact, we encourage it on a personal 
basis. What we are against is the waste of resources brought 
about by the application of the Official Languages Act and its 
divisiveness to Canada as a country.
<P>
	Although no doubt well intentioned, the continued blind 
application of the act, to use the words of the President of the 
Treasury Board, ``in making sure that federal institutions live up 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2182"> 2182 </A></B>
<P>
to their obligations under the  act'' is the very thing that is 
causing resentment across the land.
<P>
	The minister proudly states that English speaking and French 
speaking Canadians have equal opportunities to obtain 
employment and advancement in federal institutions. However, 
within the last two weeks we heard the Minister of National 
Defence say with pride that officers of the Canadian forces 
aspiring to the rank of lieutenant colonel or above will have to be 
bilingual. This same restriction is being applied at the 
non-commissioned officer level.
<P>
	In a country where more than 60 per cent of francophones 
speak no English and over 80 per cent of anglophones speak no 
French, a person should be able to pursue a career solely in 
either official language with the expectation that if he or she 
does everything correctly, there is a reasonable chance for 
success in that career. Application of the Official Languages Act 
takes away this hope from the majority in both language groups. 
It fosters resentment and division in Canada.
<P>
	We would be among the first to applaud the opportunity for 
francophones to pursue a career in the French language.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	We are appalled by the fact that the number of jobs available 
to unilingual francophones has dropped 26 per cent since 1974 
thanks to the government's ridiculous pursuit of the bilingual 
post designation.
<P>
	We are equally upset that unilingual anglophones are 
suffering the same form of discrimination.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me repeat again that we are not opposed to bilingualism. 
We agree that both languages are necessary in government 
institutions, such as this Parliament, and the courts of justice. 
On the other hand, we are opposed to the antagonism and the 
waste of resources caused by the Official Languages Act over 
the past 25 years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to conclude by saying I am deeply distressed also by 
the inaction of the chief parliamentary body overseeing the 
Official Languages Act. I am a member of the Standing Joint 
Committee on Official Languages which has yet to meet this 
session. My research indicates this committee has met only nine 
times in the past two years and has not issued a single 
recommendation to this House. It saddens me to think that such 
a vital part of the fabric of Canadian society appears to be sorely 
neglected by us, Canada's elected representatives.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-6, 
an act to amend the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act, the 
Canada Petroleum Resources Act and the National Energy 
Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, before our 
interruption for question period we were discussing Bill C-6 
which deals with the transfer to the National Energy Board of the 
administration and regulation of activities on frontier lands 
which were previously administered by the Canadian Oil and 
Gas Lands Administration or COGLA.
<P>
	Industry needs to have certain and clear sets of rules by which 
to operate. It needs to be confident that regulation will be carried 
out in a professional and highly competent manner. We believe 
these qualities are now exemplified in the National Energy 
Board.
<P>
	For more than 30 years the National Energy Board has been an 
effective regulatory agency. The board's experience in 
reviewing proposals for complex energy projects has provided it 
with extensive expertise in environmental, socio economic and 
technical areas. With the addition of highly qualified and 
dedicated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2184"> 2184 </A></B>
<P>
staff from the former COGLA, the board is well placed to take 
on the authority to regulate frontier oil and gas.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	We should also emphasize that this reorganization does not 
mean that the government places less importance on our frontier 
responsibilities.
<P>
	In recent years companies have shifted their attention to other 
regions and adopted a go slow attitude in the Canadian frontiers. 
This was done primarily as a result of the poor economics of 
developing these high cost resources in an environment of lower 
oil prices.
<P>
	In these circumstances it is all too easy to neglect our frontiers 
or to conclude that they are too costly to ever attract serious and 
continuing exploration activity. That, however, is not our 
intention.
<P>
	Canada's frontiers north of 60 and off shore hold more than 
two-thirds of Canada's remaining conventional oil and natural 
gas resources. Whatever the short-term outlook these areas will 
be a significant and growing part of our energy future. 
Consequently, effective regulation of Frontier Oil and Gas 
exploration is a priority and because it is important the federal 
government will retain a meaningful role in the frontiers.
<P>
	The crown is, after all, the resource owner and has an 
obligation to ensure that this resource is managed in the best 
manner possible for the benefit of the Canadian people.
<P>
	The amendment proposed to Bill C-6 do not transfer the full 
range of ministerial responsibility to the National Energy 
Board. In keeping with good regulatory practice the government 
will retain the responsibility to establish the overall policy 
framework for frontier petroleum development. The crown also 
maintains the power to grant the legal permission or exclusive 
rights to companies which in some cases involve some 
discretion.
<P>
	It would not be appropriate to transfer these powers to a 
regulatory body.
<P>
	Specifically the federal government will retain authority to 
publicly tender rights to explore, issue exploration production 
and development licences, approve benefit plans, and set and 
collect royalties.
<P>
	We are serious about our responsibilities to the Canadian 
public with respect to frontier oil and gas development. Key 
COGLA staff have been retained in both the Departments of 
Natural Resources and Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development to help us look after these responsibilities.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, at this juncture we would like to bring to your 
attention some other elements of the bill before you. Although 
unrelated to the regulation of petroleum activities on frontier 
lands two areas of legislative amendment relate to the existing 
operation of the National Energy Board and were identified as 
requiring urgent attention.
<P>
	Bill C-6 grants certain NEB staff inspection and enforcement 
powers related to pipelines. By providing mechanisms for 
speedier decision-making these amendments will help ensure 
the safety of the public and the protection of property and the 
environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-6 also provides the NEB with the flexibility to ease the 
regulatory burden for small pipeline companies.
<P>
	In conclusion, the restructuring proposed in Bill C-6 makes 
sense from all possible vantage points. In particular, at a time in 
which Canadians are looking carefully for the ways and means 
to restore common sense to our public institutions, it is an 
important and timely proposal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Just as importantly the quality and integrity of the regulatory 
process will be maintained. After all the frontiers are part of 
Canada's energy future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague for his very consistent and almost 
complete statement of the purpose of Bill C-6.
<P>
	The bill before us today should have received the assent of 
this House a long time ago. With the authority to regulate 
provided by this bill, transfers already made to the National 
Energy Board by the Department of Energy, Mines and 
Resources and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
development are formalized.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-6 also formalizes the expanded powers of the NEB on 
pipelines under its jurisdiction, namely international and 
interprovincial pipelines.
<P>
	The bill also provides for minor amendments to related 
legislation. On the surface, it does not seem to contain any 
original idea of this Liberal government. As these powers apply 
to frontier oil and gas activity, several provinces where there are 
no federal/provincial shared management agreements will be 
affected by this transfer of authority and increased level of 
responsibility.
<P>
	For example, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, which 
are Crown lands and public lands, will be directly affected by 
Bill C-6. Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia 
and Ontario will be affected in so far as the regulating of 
pipelines is concerned. Since Newfoundland and Nova Scotia 
will be administering their offshore resources jointly with the 
federal government, they will not be affected by the transfer of 
authority provided for in this bill.
<P>
	In addition, the coming into force of the Northern Accord and 
the signing of a joint administration agreement with the 
Northwest Territories will, in the medium term, result in the loss 
of NEB authority over these lands. The NEB would maintain its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2185"> 2185 </A></B>
<P>
authority to regulate oil and gas activities only in the case of 
offshore resources in the Pacific and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
<P>
	Quebec, meanwhile, has been only marginally affected by the 
changes to the National Energy Board's mandate since 1991. 
However, should resources be discovered offshore in the waters 
of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, then the question of resource 
ownership would inevitably arise, just as it arose when 
resources were discovered offshore from Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	Clearly, Quebec and the Bloc Quebecois would set some 
conditions in terms of the legal and constitutional options of 
having Quebec's and the provinces' ownership of any potential 
resources recognized.
<P>
	In a number of cases involving gas and oil distribution in 
Canada, Quebec has repeatedly voiced its opposition to various 
federal policies, notably in recent cases where legislation, 
regulations and constitutional interpretation appeared to 
blatantly infringe on Quebec's jurisdiction and economic 
interests.
<P>
	I will briefly share with you two of those issues, so as to 
clearly express some Quebec positions which, I believe, federal 
authorities did not take into consideration thus far. We are not 
talking here about pouring out a long litany of unfounded 
complaints. The Bloc Quebecois was elected in Ottawa both to 
promote Quebec sovereignty and, in the meantime, to defend 
Quebecers' interests within the present federal system.
<P>
	I am well aware that my colleagues from Western Canada are 
very sensitive to issues concerning natural resources ownership. 
I must tell them that I share the same sensitivity. I would just 
like to say that no one will challenge the representatives of 
western Canada or of Quebec for putting forward what they 
perceive as their constituents' interests.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	First, the federal government is partly responsible for the 
decline of the refining industry in Quebec. Until the early 1980s, 
Quebec exported refined petroleum products. During that 
decade, Quebec lost more than half of its refining capacity and 
as a result was forced to import part of its consumption.
<P>
	The economic costs of this change in the petroleum industry 
were enormous, especially for Montreal, which had been a 
centre for refining petroleum products in North America since 
the 1940s. Quebec lost its leadership to the benefit of Ontario. 
The Borden commission of 1961 is responsible for this decline 
since it decided to give western oil producers a captive market in 
Canada. It was also decided that the pipelines taking oil from the 
West to the East would stop in Ontario-this was called the 
Borden line. With the coming of the Borden line and the 
requirement for Quebec refiners to buy western oil which was 
carried by pipeline only as far as Ontario, Quebec definitely lost 
its geographical advantage as a refiner for central Canada, to the 
benefit of Ontario.
<P>
	The federal government has never repaired the damage done 
by its energy policy. Quebec lost thousands of jobs. Head 
offices, businesses and research and development that could 
have put Quebec at the forefront of the industry were lost.
<P>
	I would also like to raise another very current issue and that is 
the ruling made last week by the Supreme Court of Canada 
regarding exploitation of electricity. That decision led us to 
believe that other conflicts might occur in the future. The court 
empowers the National Energy Board to subject the granting of 
hydro-electricity export licenses to an environmental 
assessment. This decision is a setback for Quebec which always 
wanted to assert its jurisdiction regarding environmental 
matters.
<P>
	Already in 1990 the National Energy Board had imposed two 
conditions before granting Hydro Quebec an electricity export 
license for the States of New York and Vermont. These two 
conditions provided that these exports should not contravene 
federal environmental standards and that the energy-producing 
facilities would have to be subject to the federal environmental 
assessment and review process.
<P>
	Quebec's Energy Minister, Lise Bacon, who was far from 
being a nasty separatist, declared at that time that this federal 
intrusion into provincial jurisdiction was completely 
intolerable. In 1992, another Quebec Liberal minister, Pierre 
Paradis, who was then Minister of the Environment and who is 
not a nasty separatist, said in a letter addressed to his federal 
counterpart that the bill he was about to introduce contained 
elements which were a perfect example of totalitarianism and 
domination by the federal government and that it continued to 
embitter relations between Quebec and Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Quebec has already successfully appealed that decision in the 
Federal Court of Appeal. Following this victory for our 
province, in turn, the James Bay Cree appealed the NEB's 
decision to grant a hydro facility operating licence in their 
region.
<P>
	The recent Supreme Court decision will have an impact on the 
development of Quebec's hydroelectric resources and will make 
the costs of any new project higher.
<P>
	Moreover, the Supreme Court decision imposes a public 
review to limit the development of hydroelectricity, power lines 
and production facilities. Before a provincial development 
project can be undertaken, it would be very surprising if the 
NEB did not require the equivalent for gas or oil exports, 
thereby limiting the environmental impact to pipelines, and 
overlooking anything having to do with the greenhouse effect, 
air pollution, depletion of resources and other environmental 
considerations.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that the Bloc Quebecois is not 
necessarily opposed to this bill. However, since the NEB will 
only have jurisdiction over small parts of the Canadian territory, 
once all the joint management  agreements are signed, the 
parliamentary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2186"> 2186 </A></B>
<P>
committee will have to review this legislation with a long-term 
perspective in mind.
<P>
	We must not only straighten out an existing situation; 
eventually we will have to have a modern approach regarding all 
issues related to the management of offshore natural resources. 
We have to take reality into account and propose alternative 
structural changes which will give each province responsibility 
for its own future interests.
<P>
	Needless to say, if necessary, we will make sure each province 
gets jurisdiction over offshore resources. You can count on us to 
do that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
address Bill C-6, an act to amend the Canada Oil and Gas 
Operations Act, the Canada Petroleum Resources Act and the 
National Energy Board Act.
<P>
	In the interest of reducing the duplication of comments and 
overlap of debaters I will speak on behalf of the Reform Party 
which in principle supports Bill C-6 in the spirit has been put 
forward by the Department of Natural Resources and the 
National Energy Board.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Calgary Centre, I need only 
look out the window of my constituency office to see the 
importance of the oil and gas industry to the people, the city and 
the province of Alberta.
<P>
	When the government, especially a Liberal government, 
begins to change legislation that regulates this industry, people 
and companies alike get nervous and express their concerns, 
especially when it involves giving power to a federal board 
where it may overlap in the future with an area of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Having consulted with the Canadian Association of 
Petroleum Producers and the National Energy Board our party is 
confident that Bill C-6 deals primarily with the centralization 
and the consolidation of technical and regulatory functions to 
the National Energy Board from the ministerial level of the 
department of natural resources and in some cases the judicial 
system.
<P>
	According to the National Energy Board, this process of 
streamlining will save the government $5 million. This is a 
positive step but remains just the tip of the iceberg when one 
considers the overall amount of government waste that has 
existed over the years.
<P>
	When I spoke in this House on Bill C-2, I encouraged the 
Department of National Revenue to initiate line by line, item by 
item reviews of the department to find out exactly where money 
is being spent.
<P>
	Today, while discussing Bill C-6, I want to ask the 
Department of Natural Resources to do the same. These results 
should be made public in their entirety in the form of an annual 
report which could then be distributed to all parties for review.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	My party wants the federal government and all its 
departments to be fiscally responsible and exercise restraint 
wherever possible. We believe strongly in the streamlining of 
government operations like those in Bill C-6 and encourage the 
federal government to do more of the same.
<P>
	Less government bureaucracy in the oil and gas industry 
means quicker decisions so that more time can be spent by 
businesses exploring for new resources and/or building new 
pipelines.
<P>
	Freeing up the marketplace from government intervention 
creates opportunities, incentives and real jobs, long term 
meaningful jobs. It generates real revenue and sends a message 
to investors and to all Canadians that this country wants a future 
based on prosperity and not on high unemployment and high 
debt.
<P>
	The Liberal government must continue to cut red tape and 
encourage the spending of equity capital from the private sector 
and not debt capital by the government as is the current 
situation.
<P>
	For too long governments have relied on the spending of debt 
capital versus equity capital in the funding of megaprojects that 
have wasted billions of taxpayers dollars, Hibernia and the 
Lloydminster upgrader, for example.
<P>
	My party supports a free market system, one in which supply 
and demand regulate the industry, not political agendas. 
Government should facilitate and not hinder the production and 
efficient delivery of exports.
<P>
	We support the fact that Bill C-6 will also provide the 
National Energy Board with the authority to ease the regulatory 
burden for small pipeline companies that do not have the 
resources for drawn out hearings and application processes. It 
enables them to participate in the process without being hung up 
in months and months of delays and waiting for hearings.
<P>
	Small businesses like these play a large role in job creation 
and need to be free to compete in the marketplace.
<P>
	These significant changes cannot, however, come at the 
expense of the environment. Bill C-6 takes some positive steps 
concerning industry safety and environmental conservation. For 
example, by increasing the power for National Energy Board 
inspectors to make immediate decisions in the field on safety 
and environmental violations, potential disasters can be 
avoided.
<P>
	Decisions in the past had to be made by the full board which 
caused delays and proved to be an inefficient way to ensure 
companies meet high safety standards.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2187"> 2187 </A></B>
<P>
	The NEB plays a large role in the oil and gas industry and is 
held in high regard. We commend and encourage it to continue 
its high standards of work.
<P>
	The consolidation achieved through this act eliminates the 
need for courts and politicians to be involved in the daily 
operations of frontier activity. The new power given to the NEB 
should subsequently encourage continuity, consistency and 
expediency within the department.
<P>
	Having said that, there are still certain members of the oil and 
gas community that have expressed concern with the fact that 
Bill C-6 will eliminate the oil and gas committee which was an 
independent appeal board.
<P>
	With no impartial appeal process the National Energy Board 
could in effect become judge, jury and sole executioner for 
companies that may disagree with the decision that it hands 
down. Therefore, the precedent setting decisions that are made 
will subsequently be extremely important for politicians to 
monitor, ensuring there are no destructive precedents set.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by reminding the House that previous 
Liberal governments played a significant role in crippling the 
oil and gas industry in Alberta with their national energy policy. 
We do not wish to see this happen again.
<P>
	We encourage this new Liberal government to be different and 
continue to improve the regulatory environment in Canada, 
discourage red tape and the size of bureaucracy and promote 
free and open competition in the private sector and leave the 
industry alone. With respect to discriminatory grants or 
subsidies, it does not need them, nor does it want them, with new 
environmental taxes like a carbon tax and wasteful job creation 
programs.
<P>
	That is my submission on Bill C-6.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-6 before the House today is in fact a piece of 
legislation the previous government did not have time to pass 
and which died several times on the Order Paper.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Essentially, this bill only gives legal basis to the role 
currently played by the National Energy Board ever since its 
merger with the Canada Oil and Gas Lands Administration in 
1991.
<P>
	As my colleague from Matapédia-Matane said earlier, the 
Bloc Quebecois approves the principle of the bill and will vote 
for it at the second reading stage. However, to put things into 
perspective, I would like to mention that the terms of reference 
of the NEB was, as recently as last week, challenged before the 
Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	My colleague from Matapédia-Matane also reviewed the 
new constitutional realities concerning the need to conduct 
environmental impact assessments on any hydro projects 
undertaken for foreign markets. We are anxiously waiting for 
the decision the National Energy Board will should make, 
following the ruling of the Supreme Court, as to the need to 
extend such assessments to gas and oil exportation projects.
<P>
	Of course, if Quebec becomes sovereign, we should be free of 
this control over our interests. In the meantime, we think it is 
crucial to promote and defend the interests of Quebec within the 
current federal system. Defending Quebec's interests does not 
prevent us in any way from also defending and promoting the 
interests of Canadians and the rest of Canada, provided, of 
course, that theirs are fully compatible with ours and are in no 
way against Quebec's interests.
<P>
	Yesterday, my colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata 
brilliantly demonstrated this when she defended the cultural 
interests of English Canada against excessive control by 
American publishing multinationals. The Leader of the Official 
Opposition himself does not fail opportunity to stand up for 
common interests of Canada and Quebec in his speeches which 
attract considerable attention, including his stand on the 
presence of Canadian UN troops in Bosnia.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, who took the advice of the Bloc 
Quebecois and yesterday extended for another six months the 
mandate of our UN troops in Bosnia.
<P>
	But to come back to the issue of oil and gas development, 
there is a subject which involves the financial interests of all 
Canadians and Quebecers. I am talking about the Hibernia 
megaproject, of which our friends in the Reform Party have just 
spoken.
<P>
	Left to market forces alone-and I think members of the 
Reform Party will fully agree on this-the Hibernia project 
would never have come about. It exists only because two 
governments, this one and the one before, persisted in investing 
billions of dollars in this venture whose outcome nobody can 
predict. Such quandering of public funds should give the shivers 
to anyone in this House who takes taxpayers' interests to heart.
<P>
	In fact, what worries me most about the Hibernia adventure is 
the extremely high financial risk. Just think that Chevron, Mobil 
and Murphy, the oil companies that are partners in that venture, 
have so little confidence in it that they demand that the federal 
government, and ultimately the Canadian taxpayers, bear a huge 
share of the financial risk.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the heated debate on the relative cost of each 
barrel extracted from the Hibernia and Avalon oilfields 
compared to the international price, one has to admit that it takes 
an act of faith to believe that the project will ultimately be 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2188"> 2188 </A></B>
<P>
profitable. As a professor at Memorial University said so 
eloquently: ``We are down to gut feelings and faith about it''.
<P>
	The profitability of that project, if it is ever profitable, can 
only be marginal at best. Moreover, the rate of return depends on 
unpredictable fluctuations in three distinct and very important 
factors. The first is the quantity of oil that can really be 
extracted from this field. The second is the final cost of building 
and operating the gigantic drilling rig. The third, which is both 
the most unpredictable and the determining factor, is the price of 
oil in 1997, the year when production is supposed to begin, and 
during the productive life of the field, which is 15 years.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I could refrain from mentioning the risks of environmental 
disasters that are never desirable but always possible, but I have 
to raise the issue of the safety of the platform itself, which will 
be towed 300 kilometres off the coast of St. John's, right in the 
middle of what is referred to today as Iceberg Alley, in the area 
where the Titanic sank in 1912. The risks of disaster are so great 
that it seems impossible for the promoters of the project to 
insure the platform for its full value in case a disaster should 
occur. So it is obviously something important.
<P>
	It seems to me that Canadian taxpayers should not have to 
trust the federal government blindly, as it is asking them to do. 
They should be informed of all the costs and the great risks 
associated with this project. After all, it is the money of 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers that the government is throwing 
at this project to prevent it from sinking.
<P>
	The money invested by the federal government on behalf of 
taxpayers currently exceeds $3 billion in direct grants, loan 
guarantees, interest payments and direct equity participation in 
this project. And I would remind all Canadians who are listening 
to this debate that $1 billion equals $1,000 million. So, $3 
billion means that the federal government is asking Canadians 
to trust it with a $3,000 million investment in a single project, 
over and above the hundreds of millions it has already invested 
in activities related to the exploration and development of 
resources off Canada's east coast.
<P>
	In one of his recent annual reports, the Auditor General of 
Canada expressed legitimate concern about Hibernia. He said 
that it was a high risk venture due to fluctuating prices as well as 
technological and environmental issues. The Auditor General's 
analysis is still valid today, and even more so during a period of 
fiscal restrictions, when we are making deep cuts in 
unemployment insurance. Billions of dollars, thousands of 
millions, have been invested in high risk ventures based on faith 
but, when cutbacks are needed, we do not hesitate to cut benefits 
to the unemployed. This government seems to think that 
unemployed people are the problem.
<P>
	If I brought up the issue of Hibernia today, it is probably 
because I am wary. The Bloc Quebecois is not in power and has 
no ambition in that direction; that is quite obvious. We cannot 
stop this massive investment of public funds in a high risk 
venture based on faith. However, as the Official Opposition, we 
will fight to ensure that, should this project go forward, it will 
generate as much economic activity as possible in Canada and 
Quebec. It is the least we can do.
<P>
	We will hound this Liberal government to ensure that 
subcontracts promised to Canadian and Quebec businesses by 
the previous government and the Hibernia consortium will be 
honoured and, if possible, maximized.
<P>
	As for other megaprojects whose profitability is more than 
doubtful, the Bloc Quebecois will defend the interests of 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	In short, the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-6 at second 
reading. We will look into the legitimate complaints that will 
eventually be brought to our attention before or during the 
committee stage of this bill.
