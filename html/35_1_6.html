	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of personal privilege to make a 
brief statement regarding a letter I wrote in 1989 and other 
issues which have received widespread media attention in the 
last few days.
<P>
	The letter was written at a low point in my life when I was 
under tremendous stress relating to my career and my family. 
The letter contained irresponsible statements which have been 
widely reported and need not be repeated in this House. My 
personal problems did not justify or excuse the insensitive 
words that I used and I deeply regret what I did.
<P>
	Over three years ago I apologized in writing on more than two 
occasions to both the staff and the chair of the board of 
education for the city of Toronto. I had hoped that this sorry 
chapter of my life was over when I wrote the apologies in 1990.
<P>
	However, I now believe that it is appropriate for me to 
apologize to the Prime Minister, to my caucus colleagues, and to 
all members of the House for any embarrassment these letters or 
any other statements or letters I may have made or written have 
caused.
<P>
	More specifically, I wish to apologize to the people who live 
in the riding of Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	At this juncture I ask my colleagues in the House for their 
forgiveness. I hope they will allow me to prove that I can be a 
hard working, responsible and effective member of Parliament.
<P>
	Once again I apologize to you, Mr. Speaker, and to all 
members of the House for the inexcusable acts which I most 
profoundly regret having done in 1989.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. This is, as the House 
knows, a point of personal privilege. The House has heard the 
statement. It is not debatable and the record will show that he did 
make the statement and that it was accepted by the House.

	The House resumed from January 21 consideration of the 
motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in 
reply to his Speech at the opening of the session; and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am pleased to advise hon. members 
that Telesat Canada has successfully transferred the cable 
parliamentary channel to the Anik E1 satellite. In consequence 
the televised proceedings of the House will again be available to 
cable companies across the country. It may however be a few 
days before all of the cable companies can get their systems up 
and operational, as we always are.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure hon. members will wish to join me in thanking the 
staff at Telesat Canada and the cable parliamentary channel who 
worked during the weekend to rectify this problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I take 
this opportunity in my first speech in this 35th Parliament both 
to congratulate you as Deputy Speaker and to congratulate the 
Speaker of the House on his election. I look forward to a very 
fruitful working relationship. I know that both the Speaker and 
the Deputy Speaker will bring great fairness and openness to this 
House. Again, I congratulate you and give you my sincere 
commitment to work with you so that we can productively work 
for the citizens of Canada. Again, congratulations.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the other members who have 
been elected to the 35th Parliament. During the election 
Canadians said that they wanted to see us work together 
constructively for the future of this country. I know that will be 
the aim of all members. We owe it to ourselves, our constituents 
and to all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="198"> 198 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians to deliver on this expectation. We must acknowledge  
when the government has done well and hold the government 
accountable when it has not kept its promises.
<P>
	That is the elementary essence of our democratic system. I 
want to assure all Canadians that the New Democratic Party will 
be there both to work constructively and to ensure that the future 
of this country will be preserved. We will go forward into the 
21st century with confidence and with a new vision.
<P>
	As I said, I want to congratulate all members of the House on 
their election. In particular, I want to congratulate the right hon. 
member for Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister of Canada. As 
we have an unprecedented number of new members it will be 
extremely important that we all work together.
<P>
	Finally I want to thank the constituents of Yukon for their 
continued support. I pledge to honour that support with my 
representation in the House of Commons and in promoting the 
issues of northern Canada which are far too often overlooked.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I mentioned the challenges to us as members of this 
Parliament. First, the public elected us to find specific and 
practical solutions to the problems facing us as a nation.
<P>
	Second, Canadians want to feel that their government has a 
vision, that it knows where we are going as a nation, and that it 
not only has a map but a destination, a vital sense of identity, a 
vision that brings us all together as Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The next couple of years will be absolutely crucial to the 
future of this country in defining who we are as a nation and 
where we will go as a nation. We have in this House one political 
party that says we cannot go forward together as a nation, one 
which would see us dismantle the country. I want to say in this 
speech today in response to the speech from the throne that the 
New Democratic Party is absolutely committed to the future of a 
united country that all Canadians want to be a part of and we will 
fight for that vision of this strong country.
<P>
	Key to the future of our country, key to those of us who want 
to build the country not destroy it, is that we address the 
economic issues that face so many Canadians today, that we 
bring about not just words of hope to Canadians but a real vision 
and real hope. Without real jobs there can be no real hope.
<P>
	The speech from the throne had many words about restoring 
hope. We heard other speeches from previous governments that 
did the same thing. What is needed now are real targets, real 
timetables to bring down the high rate of unemployment. We are 
told it officially stands at 11.2 per cent but there is surely not one 
person in this country who believes that is the actual and real 
number of unemployed in this country. We must address  it 
realistically and we must always address it with the view that 
unemployment is not just simply an economic problem. It is a 
social issue as well and will have an effect on every Canadian in 
the very real future of this country.
<P>
	Employment targets would give real teeth to the words that we 
heard in the speech from the throne and provide accountability 
for the government to the public on its performance. The 
government has given us no targets and I want to ask why. 
Unless we know where we are going, unless we can see if there is 
a real objective Canadians will very quickly lose their faith in 
this parliamentary process.
<P>
	One only needs to look back at the last nine years and the 
devastation that was wrought on this country to know that it is 
not a continuation of the policies of the previous government 
that will make Canada a stronger nation. It is a change in those 
policies.
<P>
	I must ask whether the speech from the throne shows that 
change, that clarity of vision. Let the government really indicate 
that it is prepared to take that change that is necessary. I have to 
say that in two crucial areas we see not a change but simply a 
government that is prepared to follow the failed policies of the 
previous government.
<P>
	In some ways this government is on the road to failure before 
it begins but I want to mention two crucial areas. The first area is 
around the North American Free Trade Agreement. The 
governing party campaigned very strongly about real changes to 
NAFTA. It along with the New Democrats stood up and showed 
the devastation that the free trade agreement has done to Canada 
in the number of lost jobs. In fact what happened was that the 
government on January 1 did nothing to fundamentally change 
those sections of the North American Free Trade Agreement that 
work against Canada but went forward with the agreement, 
sadly saying that Canada is prepared to join the race to the 
bottom in the North American continent, not to work more 
strongly for workers' rights, not to work to improve trade 
agreements that would be truly in the interests of all workers in 
all countries that are partners in those trade agreements. Canada 
must improve its trade both in the Pacific Rim and in Latin 
America, but we must do so aggressively from our strength and 
not from our weakness. What this government has done in going 
forth with NAFTA is again to work from our weakness.
<P>
	Monetary policy is certainly an extremely important 
ingredient in the future of a country and how its economy is 
determined. In the famous red book the government makes the 
following statement about Canada's previous government. It 
states: ``The Conservative single-minded fight against inflation 
resulted in a deep recession, three years without growth, 
sky-rocketing un-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="199"> 199 </A></B>
<P>
employment, a crisis in international payments and the highest 
combined set of government deficits in our history''. I agree.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	However, do we see a signal for real change in the 
government's appointment of the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada? I would say we do not. Sadly what I see in these two 
crucial areas in this era of globalization of markets and capital is 
that once monetary trade policy is determined, the economic 
direction of the country is determined. Sadly in these two crucial 
areas the government has chosen to follow its failed predecessor 
rather than to lead Canadians with a new vision.
<P>
	Job creation is the number one problem in Canada today and 
yet major sections of the economy are not mentioned, 
agriculture and the resource sector for example. These 
industries account for 21 per cent of our gross national product 
and close to a million jobs in our economy.
<P>
	The New Democrats' full employment plan included items 
such as the infrastructure proposal, and we support that, and 
investment funds to stimulate the growth of small and medium 
sized businesses. We agree on the need for research and 
development and the kind of new technologies that will bring us 
into the 21st century.
<P>
	I want to particularly mention the government's reference in 
the throne speech to a youth corps. We will be looking very 
carefully at what the details of this will be because the tragedy of 
youth unemployment in this country is incalculable. We know 
the high rate of statistics but we have not calculated the social 
cost to the future of this country and we must do that.
<P>
	I urge the government to very quickly move on youth 
unemployment, to develop the youth corps and give us the 
details because we must show the youth of this country that we 
who have been elected take their concerns and their future very 
seriously.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southwest places his major 
emphasis on debt and the current deficit of this government. Let 
me assure you, Mr. Speaker, that there is absolutely no debate 
about whether debt and the deficit are serious problems to this 
country. As we reached the half trillion mark on the debt last 
week, there certainly can be no question that it must be a 
preoccupying part of our deliberations.
<P>
	The debate therefore is not about whether it is a problem but 
how we address that problem. We must come to terms with a 
number of realities, the first being that unemployment is not 
free. We have to stop assuming that it is.
<P>
	Last fall we saw the Department of Finance say that lost 
revenue and income support means that every unemployed 
worker costs government an estimated $17,500. That is simply 
the economic cost. It is not the social cost. We see that the 
department projected that deficit projections would not be met 
because of a shortfall of revenue, not because of overspending 
on programs. Simply capping expenditures is not the sole way to 
address the debt. Certainly efficient management is. Unless we 
can create employment and create growth  we will never address 
the real serious debt in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another important area this government must examine is our 
unfair tax system. The middle class is saddled with the largest 
share of the tax burden, while the wealthy and the large 
corporations can take advantage of legal loopholes to avoid 
paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	Personal income tax now represents 48 per cent of federal 
revenue, and only 7 per cent of that revenue is contributed by 
large corporations. Tax expenditures like private family trusts, 
set up by Canada's richest families to shelter their money for a 
period of 21 years, should be eliminated. We should also 
eliminate budget items that allow deduction of expenses like 
business lunches and entertainment, estimated to cost one 
billion dollars in lost revenue annually.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no doubt that the GST has failed in its objective. We 
have said for some time that we must eliminate the GST, that it is 
an unfair and regressive tax. It is not enough, as the government 
is suggesting it is going to do, to simply review and hide the 
GST. It must eliminate it. We are witnessing a near tax revolt in 
this country with a new underground economy.
<P>
	The government has signalled its intention to overhaul 
Canada's social security system. In essence, social security is a 
definition of who we are, how we treat each other and the values 
that we in this country support.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that the social security system 
must be looked at in light of the realities of today's society. One 
of those realities is that more women are in the work force and 
there is a greater need for child care than there has been in the 
past.
<P>
	While there was much rhetoric in the red book on child care, it 
is absolutely missing from the throne speech. There is no 
mention of the necessity and importance of child care which I 
see not just as a social program but an economic program in 
developing our future economy.
<P>
	I say to the Liberal Party that it is a great loss to Canadians if 
they do not follow through on a national child care program 
which is essential to the development of our economy.
<P>
	In the proposed review of social security, it is suggested that 
there will be a process that takes place. I urge the government to 
listen not just to the academics or the business community but to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="200"> 200 </A></B>
<P>
those who are affected and who have been victims of 
unemployment in our country.
<P>
	Finally there are many things that I applaud such as the review 
of members' pensions and remuneration. I proposed that in 
February 1992. As well, I applaud the government saying that it 
would like a new relationship with aboriginal peoples. Such a 
partnership must be based not only on the right to inherent 
self-government but speedy settlement of land claims.
<P>
	I urge the government to put into practice the rhetoric, the fine 
words that were said in the throne speech and bring forward as 
an early piece of legislation the Yukon land claims settlement 
and self-government legislation.
<P>
	We face many challenges. We have the ability to make this the 
best country in the world in terms of equality and our economy.
<P>
	I urge the government to remember that Canada is not just a 
great nation internally but that we have a great role 
internationally. We cannot forget the concept of common 
security. We cannot build our security on the insecurity of 
others. In fact, we must move forward to be a strong advocate in 
the international community as well as here at home.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> The hon. member for Yukon 
said earlier-and I felt somewhat under attack-that some 
members of this House want to destroy this country while others 
want to build it.
<P>
	The point is that the federal system has been destroying this 
country for many years. It is not the members of this House but 
the federal system itself which is destroying the country through 
duplication of government programs and services. According to 
the Quebec government, this duplication costs between $2 
billion and $3 billion a year. The inefficiency and inconsistency 
of these programs are very costly as well; the same can be said of 
contradictory legislation in many cases.
<P>
	To those who maintain that we are here to destroy the country, 
I reply that our goal is to help build two countries, but two 
countries that will work well.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask the hon. member for Yukon is 
this: As a member of this House, does she intend to favour and 
encourage small and medium sized businesses instead of trying 
to destroy them? It is in that sector that jobs are created.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, during the election 
we proposed to set up programs for small and medium sized 
businesses because it is very important for the future of this 
country.
<P>
	With regard to the statements on the future of this country, it 
is clear that there are problems with the federal system. That is 
why I supported the Charlottetown constitutional agreement. 
This agreement would have allowed us to make certain changes 
for all provinces and territories.
<P>
	I would also like to repeat that the New Democratic Party 
fundamentally believes in the future of Canada, a Canada which 
includes Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say hello to my good friend and almost seatmate in the 
last Parliament, the member for Yukon. I listened with interest, 
as always, to what she had to say. I congratulate her on her 
election and on the vigour and dignity she demonstrated 
throughout the campaign.
<P>
	I got the impression toward the end of her remarks that maybe 
she had run out of time. Could I give her the opportunity to be a 
little more specific on what she had in mind with respect to our 
international role?
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his kind words. We were almost seatmates then. I had to give 
him a lot of coaching and I will continue to do that even though 
he is across on the other side of the House.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words. As some people will know I 
have just returned from the east and had an opportunity to speak 
in India, Nepal and Thailand with business people, some 
political people and so on. One is really struck by the potential 
for Canada in trade relations in those areas and our ability as a 
non-super power to be a real force for peace and progress in 
those countries. We will be having a debate later this week on 
several aspects of peacekeeping and other similar issues.
<P>
	It is extremely important that we not forget, as we deal with 
the very crucial issues in our country, we have a responsibility to 
those outside our shores. As I said in my remarks, when we think 
of what will make us a secure nation it is certainly not to build on 
the insecurity of others but to reach out in a spirit of 
co-operation to help other nations become self-sufficient in the 
way that is in their interest and ultimately in the interests of the 
world.
<P>
	In that relation I would like to say that we talk a lot about the 
global economy, but we in Canada have a very important 
opportunity given our size and our past to be a real player in the 
development of international institutions which become more 
key as we move into this continuing global economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate the leader of the NDP on her election and tell her 
that, like my fellow member from Longueuil, I was a little 
surprised by her remarks on Canadian unity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="201"> 201 </A></B>
<P>
	If I remember correctly, Quebec said yes to Canada when it 
said no in the 1980 referendum. Quebec was told no by Canada 
when the 1982 Constitution was signed without it. But Quebec 
again said yes by electing the Bourassa government, and the 
government also said-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that one of the main 
features of our democracy is the right to speak. I am surprised 
that the Liberal members opposite are trying to cut me off while 
I am exercising what seems to me to be the most basic 
democratic right.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Then we had the Meech Lake Accord and some members, one 
or two in the NDP, voted against it. The leader of the NDP was 
among them. When it was time to give Quebec a chance to enter 
the Canadian federation, when it was time to take a first step 
toward Quebec, she said no and today instead of engaging in a 
new historic debate, they prefer a prehistoric debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, while the member talks about 
a prehistoric debate I think he would want to talk about the 
Charlottetown accord which was the most recent constitutional 
discussion. It is pretty clear that the majority of Canadians 
certainly do not want to see us preoccupied in the House with 
constitutional matters only.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of all members of the House to ensure 
the security of all Canadians, particularly in terms of economic 
security. I am surprised the member would want to use his 
question simply to deal with that matter when he sees the high 
rates of unemployment in Montreal and other parts of Quebec. I 
would like to see the member fighting here for his constituents, 
for better economic and social programs, as is being done by the 
New Democratic Party.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I begin by 
congratulating you on your new post. We have all taken on 
different responsibilities in the House. As we in the opposition 
offered our full co-operation to the last government, I am sure I 
can expect the same kind of co-operation from opposition 
members in a few weeks to come.
<P>
	Nonetheless I am thrilled to be here on the government side of 
the House. Some of us have come here as new members. Some of 
us have been around this place for some time, and some of us 
have spent a lot of years in opposition. I have spent precisely 13 
and a half years in opposition, 4 years working as an assistant to 
a member in the opposition, for a total of about 17 years fighting 
against governments. Mr. Speaker, if you see from time to time 
that it takes a bit of time for me to make the transition please 
bear with me.
<P>
	I cannot help but look around the House and see how things 
have changed in the last 25 years. Twenty-five years ago there 
was only one woman in Parliament. When I was first elected to 
this place in 1984 there were 26 women. Today that has more 
than doubled. Of course I was very happy to see my hon. friend, 
the member for Yukon, back with us. We have taken steps rather 
slowly but we are getting there. I have to feel particularly proud 
of the work and the support given by our Prime Minister to the 
arrival of more women in our caucus. In 1984 we were five. In 
1988 we were 13. This year there are almost as many women in 
the Liberal caucus as there were in the whole of Parliament: 37 
Liberal women. I can say, Mr. Speaker, that you are going to be 
hearing more and more from these very strong women in the 
days and weeks ahead.
<P>
	I am proud that our Prime Minister led the charge, in fact to 
some public criticism, in ensuring that this particular 
Parliament was more representative of Canada as a whole. When 
I see my colleague, the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, my 
colleague for Bramalea-Gore-Malton and other colleagues in 
this place, it is clear this is one Parliament where we are 
beginning to reflect the real face of Canada. For that I think the 
governing party can take some credit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said, all government policies are aimed 
at creating a just, fair, human, decent and prosperous country. 
Ultimately, the government is serving people and it is by making 
use of everyone's skills in this country and by giving all 
Canadians an opportunity to realize their full potential that we 
will succeed as a nation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With 205 new members of Parliament reflecting a broad range 
of issues we have a chance to deal effectively with issues which 
affect all Canadian families. In this International Year of the 
Family we have a duty to deal with the issues that can help 
safeguard Canadian families and ensure that they are healthy, 
secure and prosperous.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	The government will address issues in particular relating to 
women's health, breast cancer, osteoporosis and heart disease. 
The government will introduce a program for prenatal nutrition 
to help ensure that when babies are born they are born healthy. 
We will address the staggering problem of poverty among 
aboriginal children through a specific head start program. The 
Prime Minister intends to personally chair the new national 
forum on health.
<P>
	We believe a strong national health care system is essential 
for the dignity of our country and for the dignity of every 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="202"> 202 </A></B>
<P>
individual Canadian. We will act to make our streets and our 
homes safe. We will act to protect Canadians from hatred and 
harassment.
<P>
	The government will take these measures because it is only 
through these measures that every Canadian has a fair chance to 
play a role in restoring our country to economic health. 
Canadians want to see the health of our country restored, and 
that is the top objective of the new federal government.
<P>
	As Minister of the Environment I have heard loud and clear 
that Canadians understand economic prosperity can and must 
flow from a healthy environment. Yes, Canadians want to see 
our fiscal deficit cut down and they want the job deficit wiped 
out, but they know that can only happen when we attack the 
environmental deficit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am firmly convinced that, with the support of my colleagues 
in the House, we will succeed in making environmental changes 
which we, as Canadians, must make. The leader of the 
Opposition was once the Minister of the Environment. He and I 
sometimes have different opinions on some issues, but we agree 
on the need to show leadership when it comes to the 
environment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party has already said during the 
election campaign that even when it comes to cutting costs he 
obviously believes the environmental budget is one that should 
be kept intact.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Yukon represents a region of Canada 
where good jobs depend on a healthy environment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The leader of the New Democratic Party, the hon. member for 
Yukon, comes from a part of the country that obviously depends 
very much on environmental health.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Sherbrooke was also Minister of the 
Environment and he knows how important sustainable 
development is to Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have had a chance to meet a number of our new members. I 
was very pleased to hear the commitment that a great many of 
them had to environmental issues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Regardless of our political views on other issues such as the 
Constitution, the environment really matters to everybody, 
because all Canadians want to leave their children a more 
healthy and prosperous country. As Canadians, we care about 
our lakes and rivers. Let us not forget the song ``Mon pays ce 
n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver''.
<P>
	We also care about our Rocky mountains, our Arctic region 
and about the air we breathe. We are adamant about leaving our 
children and grandchildren a cleaner environment. We know 
that good jobs and economic prosperity depend on a healthy 
environment. Guided by these principles, I am convinced that 
we will, in this Parliament, co-operate to ensure an improved 
environment and economy for our country.
<P>
	We know that, for our country as well as for the whole planet, 
the environmental limits will soon be reached. Human activity 
has increased tenfold and the earth is less and less able to absorb 
the damage and to recover from it. In some cases, we have 
already gone the point of no return.
<P>
	The environment is one of the basic features of our national 
identity. In some cases, this heritage is already in jeopardy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The failure of the fisheries industry to be able to sustain itself 
is just one example of how environmental degradation can have 
serious and indeed devastating economic impacts. Literally tens 
of thousands of fishermen and fisherwomen have nothing left to 
fish because we have not been the guardians of this sustainable 
resource nationally and in particular internationally.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Sometimes we do not heed warnings.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	For instance, for about a month it has been pretty frigid in this 
country, but nevertheless global warming is a very real threat. 
The same goes for the thinning of the ozone layer: skin cancer is 
on the rise, and even wildlife is threatened. Our beautiful lakes 
are being poisoned by toxic substances. Soil degradation and 
loss of biodiversity are also serious problems. The birds and the 
air we breathe have no passports, and that is why we all have a 
responsibility, whatever our political persuasion, to concentrate 
on finding solutions to these environmental problems. We are 
going through a crisis, but there is still hope. The answer is 
sustainable development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We can aspire to a better life for ourselves and our children by 
understanding that sustainable development must provide a 
sound basis for Canada's long-term prosperity.
<P>
	Individual Canadians have learned that lesson well. They are 
biking where they once would have driven. They are protecting 
wildlife habitat on their property and cutting down drastically 
on household garbage. Many businesses have switched to envi-
<P>

<B><A NAME="203"> 203 </A></B>
<P>
ronmentally friendly products and are reaping benefits. Our 
children regard blue boxes and composting as a fact of life.
<P>
	Canadians expect the government and Parliament to do our 
part. That is why the Prime Minister made sustainable 
development a central theme of our election red book.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, as members know, is a person who lives 
up to his commitments. He understands that environmental 
improvement and economic development go hand in hand. He 
believes that by making Canada a world environmental leader 
we will ensure prosperity for Canadians.
<P>
	If we use our resources wisely, we will have resources for 
future generations. If we promote research and development and 
environmental technologies, we will create good long term jobs 
and protect ecosystems. If we make Canada a leader in green 
industries, we will create more products for Canadians to market 
throughout the world, products that can help clean up this world.
<P>
	Also, we have the benefit of a Minister of Finance who is a 
strong environmentalist already on the record on these 
important issues. Personally, I am pleased that the Prime 
Minister asked the former minister of the environment of the 
province of Quebec, the member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, to become my parliamentary 
secretary. The hon. member is a committed environmentalist 
who has a great understanding of the delicate balancing act 
between federal and provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	The Liberal caucus is full of talented and energetic members 
of Parliament. I have personally heard from more than four 
dozen Liberal members of Parliament who are interested in 
spearheading environmental issues on the local, national and 
international levels. We intend to move from words to action 
and to make Canada a model of environmental responsibility.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has already done that with the 
infrastructure program which will be signed in Ontario today 
and which has already been signed in a number of provinces 
across the country.
<P>
	This key initiative is a wonderful example of how we can 
create jobs and clean up the environment. Untreated municipal 
raw sewage is one of the main causes of water degradation in 
Canada. Now the federal government under the infrastructure 
program will assist provincial, regional and municipal 
authorities to finance new or renewed facilities for sewage and 
water.
<P>
	What is more, we are ensuring that our investment lays a firm 
foundation for economic development and pollution prevention. 
We are doing this by insisting that municipalities receiving 
funds encourage water conservation and develop sound 
financial plans to keep that infrastructure in place.
<P>
	It is with that same spirit that the government is pursuing the 
action plan for clean-up of the Fraser River, the Great Lakes and 
the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	We ought to be a showcase for the world of economic growth 
in tandem with environmental enhancement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to inform you that we are about to sign phase two 
of our action plan for the St. Lawrence River, a vital part of our 
environmental heritage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Sound environmental planning is not an impediment to jobs. 
It is a potential source of tens of thousands of new jobs.
<P>
	Environmental technology is the fastest growing business 
sector in Canada today, growing this year at a rate of 15 per cent. 
We must tap the ingenuity and drive of Canada's workers. These 
are qualities that have made us one of the most successful 
trading nations in the world and they can make our country the 
world leader in sustainable development. Incredible.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	At present Canada still imports 60 per cent of the 
environmental technology it needs. We plan to reverse the 
situation and make Canada a net exporter of eco technology and 
eco know-how. We plan to have the private sector seize this 
market advantage at home and internationally.
<P>
	The government will help Canadians by directing 25 per cent 
of all new government funding for research and development to 
technologies that benefit the environment. We will consolidate 
incentive and support programs into a co-ordinated strategy to 
promote environmental industries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why this week, the secretary of state for science and 
the parliamentary secretary for the environment will travel 
across the country from Halifax to Vancouver via Montreal, 
Toronto, Winnipeg and Edmonton, to meet representatives from 
the various sectors and environmental groups and promote a 
joint development strategy for environmental industries.
<P>
	Small and medium sized businesses in the environmental 
industry will benefit from improved access to funding 
assistance for capital investment. Canada Investment Funds will 
be created to help leading edge technology firms. The strategy 
for implementing an information highway and the creation of a 
technology network designed to improve the diffusion of 
innovation are essential elements of this two-pronged approach: 
job creation and environmental protection.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="204"> 204 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is aware that by targeting assistance to small 
and medium sized businesses that are active in the 
environmental sector today, we will create the jobs of tomorrow.
<P>
	The government will also review the tax system and federal 
subsidies to identify barriers to sound environmental practice. 
We want to ensure that at the national level, government 
expenditures and taxes are used to promote social equity, protect 
the environment, conserve resources and develop new green 
industries in order to create future prosperity.
<P>
	The government will promote energy efficiency which can 
quickly generate economic and environmental dividends. We 
must extract maximum value from the energy we consume. It 
makes sense, both economically and environmentally, to use our 
precious resources wisely.
<P>
	We will also adopt an industrial policy to promote the value of 
our natural resources and the processing of these resources into 
finished goods that can be sold on international markets. 
Increasing jobs and prosperity without depleting our natural 
wealth and resources is a vital part of the Liberal national 
employment policy.
<P>
	More and more environmental problems have a global 
dimension, and that is why we must work together. These 
problems cannot be solved without international co-operation, 
and that is why we will make sustainable development a key 
element of Canada's foreign policy.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has already shown the way. He was the 
first political figure to ask for the inclusion of environmental 
guarantees in NAFTA. He realized that this was a unique 
opportunity to promote both economic prosperity and a healthy 
environment. His approach showed great vision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under the NAFTA the North American Commission for 
Environmental Co-operation will be located in Canada. To that 
end we are engaged in an open and transparent process to select 
the host city for the commission. We have commissioned an 
independent consultant to provide selection advice based upon 
objective criteria.
<P>
	For the first time ever in the history of the Canadian 
government the environmental record of the applicant cities will 
be taken into consideration in choosing the site of this important 
international institution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Significantly for the first time in Canada's history, an 
environmental record is requested of each city that wishes to act 
as host to this international institution. At the Seattle summit, 
the Prime Minister invited all Pacific Rim countries to 
contribute to sustainable development.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	It is in response to this invitation that foreign and Canadian 
environment ministers will meet in Vancouver next March with 
my colleague, the secretary of state responsible for Pacific 
affairs, to consider solutions to common concerns. The Prime 
Minister thinks that our trade partners must also become our 
environmental partners.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, permit me to congratulate the Prime Minister on 
his choice of the new ambassador for the environment, your 
predecessor, Mr. John Fraser, who had a reputation for cleaning 
up this House. It should serve as a model for how we can clean 
up the country. We will move in the spirit of John Fraser very 
quickly to proclaim the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act. However, I want to assure you that we will do more than 
that. We intend to establish a concurrent process for 
amendments to strengthen that act as it is being introduced. Our 
goal is an assessment process that is comprehensive and 
effective.
<P>
	Environmental assessment is not a stumbling block to be 
circumvented. It is a powerful tool to promote sound decision 
making to prevent environmental damage and to avoid costly 
mistakes.
<P>
	At the request of the Prime Minister, I am also working 
personally to analyse the requests in the red book for an 
environmental auditor general and for an independent 
environmental assessment agency. If we as Parliament and 
government are going to encourage others to clean up their act 
we have to start by putting our own House in order.
<P>
	At the Prime Minister's instruction, I am examining the most 
effective means of ensuring that our own practices are held to 
rigorous environmental scrutiny. We intend to work very 
co-operatively with provincial ministers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I already had a very fruitful discussion with my counterpart 
from Quebec on several issues, including proposed 
harmonization measures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have already signed an administrative agreement with the 
province of Alberta to make sure when we get into the business 
of environmental regulation that we do it in a way that protects 
the environment and at the same time ensures that we use 
taxpayers' dollars wisely. That is the spirit in which we will, as 
Parliament, be reviewing the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act. I know the parliamentary committee will be 
working very hard to hear the concerns of all Canadians and I 
welcome input from all sides of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="205"> 205 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	More and more Canadians take the environment into account 
in their daily decisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I draw confidence and hope from the positive changes that I 
have seen in my own community. Hamilton harbour is now a 
place where children can swim.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will repeat it. Hamilton harbour was one of the worst places, 
but it is now a place where children can swim. I invite everyone 
to come and visit my riding in the spring to see for themselves 
how sustainable development can work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	People and wildlife are the beneficiaries. Canadians want to 
see co-operation between levels of government and political 
parties. We want to avoid possible overlap and duplication but 
we also want Parliament and the Government of Canada to start 
taking sustainable development seriously. It is an opportunity 
we can seize. We must keep the faith of Canadians. We can and 
we must make sustainable development not simply a concept but 
a way of life starting right here in Parliament so that we can 
show Canadians that as we speak so we do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
congratulate the Minister of the Environment and Deputy Prime 
Minister because she began her speech by saying that we need 
women. I do not know her personally, but I think that she is a 
woman of action. We need women like that. She is in authority; 
she is now the Prime Minister's right arm. Right now, she is 
probably the most influential woman in Canada.
<P>
	I also listened closely to her speech. She mentioned a country 
with values of justice and fairness and so on. However, like me, 
she must admit that even though we have very good intentions, 
right now, unfortunately, the country is not fair and just.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister must know that at least one family 
in five in Canada lives below the poverty line. I am now on the 
first subject that I want to raise, which is also the poverty of 
Indians living on reserves and in the far north; in their case, not 
one in five but one in two families in the far north and on Indian 
reserves lives in poverty. These are very disturbing statistics. 
We must deal firmly with these issues. There is a lot of 
discrimination in Canada and I think that is an example. Shortly, 
I will be asking her to say just how her government intends to 
proceed on these matters.
<P>
	I also come back to the environment because I know that it is a 
subject which particularly interests her. With respect to the 
environment, we also know that the food chain in the far north is 
deteriorating, and I think that is one of the few places where an 
environment which was protected by the very nature of things is 
deteriorating.  My first question is this: can she state what her 
thinking is on how to deal with this poverty, out of concern for 
justice and equity, for Indians on reserves and in the far north?
<P>
	Second, does she with her government intend to put forward 
specific issues and ways to deal with the deterioration of the 
food chain in the far north as such?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will first answer the second 
question. The member for Saint-Jean is absolutely right about 
the serious problem of the food chain degradation in the far 
north.
<P>
	I personally had the opportunity to visit part of the Arctic 
circle where mothers have an unacceptably high level of PCBs 
in their milk. These women were wondering if they ought to 
breast feed their infants or instead buy milk at $7 a litre. The 
latter option is not a very good one for people who already live 
in poverty. This situation reflects the importance of the work we 
are doing right now in co-operation with the Government of 
Quebec and all the other governments across Canada in order to 
improve air quality. A committee was set up to harmonize our 
regulations regarding CFCs and all other pollutants released 
into the atmosphere by industries and others.
<P>
	In March, my counterparts, the provincial ministers of 
Environment, and I will try to find a way to harmonize some 
laws related to the environment. For example, the release of 
CFCs comes under provincial jurisdiction. Yet, if a problem 
occurs in Toronto, it ultimately will affect the air people breathe 
in Montreal and even above the Arctic circle. Therefore, we 
must work in co-operation with the provincial governments to 
develop a national policy which will garner the support of all the 
stakeholders.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the member raised the issue of poverty, 
especially among aboriginal people, because the government 
has already announced, in the speech from the throne, its 
intention to be directly involved in a program called Head Start. 
This school program was first conceived by the Americans in the 
sixties and was targeted to the poor of a certain age group. It is 
our intention to implement this program which will serve as a 
model for aboriginal people. In fact, my colleague, the Minister 
of Health, is presently monitoring the development of that 
program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to applaud the transparent nature of the minister in 
assigning or trying to determine which Canadian city is going to 
get this much coveted NAFTA environmental secretariat.

	After the decision has been made will the selection criteria 
and the respective bids by the respective cities be made public? 
Who makes the final decision?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, we intend to have the process public 
and transparent throughout. The final decision will be made by 
the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I should also point out that in doing the analysis the 
independent consultant will be working without political input 
by any of the ministers. The assessment rating areas that have 
been set out, including environmental record, infrastructure, et 
cetera, will be done without identifying the individual cities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to start by congratulating the Deputy Prime Minister on her 
election.
<P>
	I think that what the hon. member said about the environment 
in her speech is very important, but she mentioned earlier the 
importance of the family and the United Nations International 
Year of the Family, as well as the importance of equality for 
women.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister a question on 
plans for a national child care system because it is absolutely 
fundamental when dealing with the issue of the family and 
especially for women. I would like to ask her what plans exactly 
her government has regarding a national child care system?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, it certainly goes to show what good, 
considerate people we are in this country when you see the hon. 
member for Yukon ask a question to the member for Hamilton in 
the other official language, and I thank her for that.
<P>
	With regard to day care, of course we have a specific policy. 
As soon as the economy has grown by 3 per cent, we plan to open 
150,000 new day care spaces within 3 years. That was clearly 
indicated in our red book, and there is no doubt that the Prime 
Minister will fulfil the promises made in that book.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am humbly aware of the great privilege bestowed 
upon me by the people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt in 
electing me to speak for them in this venerable Chamber. I 
congratulate the 66,000 voters of my riding for taking part in 
Canadian history with the arrival of 52 Reformers to this place.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt I wish to congratulate you, 
Mr. Speaker. I would also like to congratulate members of the 
government and all hon. colleagues on their election to the 
House of Commons to represent the voices of their constituents.
<P>
	Canadians have become cynical about their government. They 
have become suspicious of their representatives who have too 
often ignored the voices of their constituents. We in this 35th 
Parliament have a duty to restore their faith. On January 6, in a 
ceremony in my riding, I swore an additional oath to represent 
my constituents faithfully in the House. It is my earnest 
intention to do just that.
<P>
	The people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt look to us 
for prudence, wisdom and fairness in our decisions. They look to 
us to work together for the benefit of all Canadians. They look to 
this Parliament for the vision to create a future for them, not of 
bankruptcy or division but of promise and opportunity.
<P>
	Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt is an area of honest, 
industrious and hardworking Canadians. The riding extends 
from the rolling ranch lands of the Nicola Valley, through the 
lush orchards and vineyards of the Okanagan, through the rich 
forests of the boundary country. It is an area of ranches, farms, 
orchards, mountains, lakes, peaceful towns and small quiet 
cities. Traditionally we have benefited from the bounty of our 
minerals, forests, agricultural lands, tourist attractions and of 
course the best climate in Canada, something which I have come 
to greatly appreciate this past week.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Today however the riding faces many challenges. It suffers 
from high unemployment, as much as 2 per cent higher than the 
provincial rate. We face changes in the structure of our economy 
as technology and global competition impact on our industries. 
We see our young people leaving in search of employment. The 
bright spot in this picture has been our small businesses and the 
jobs they have created.
<P>
	Today I am choosing to comment on the government's 
legislative program from the perspective of Canadians who are 
looking for economic hope and recovery. These are issues of 
great importance to the people of my constituency. I commend 
this government for talking about job creation which Canadians 
so clearly need. I support this goal.
<P>
	I do not however believe that government is the best vehicle 
for this job creation. For some time now small business has 
created the majority of new jobs in Canada. For example, in the 
decade up to 1990 while big business was busy downsizing and 
laying off employees, Canada's small businesses created 85 per 
cent of the net new jobs in the country. That represents 2.2 
million jobs. In the future small business will be even more 
important as our economy restructures.
<P>
	However it is often government that stifles this very job 
creation. Overregulation, onerous taxation, poorly conceived 
and administered programs all have drastic effects on small 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="207"> 207 </A></B>
<P>
business, sometimes fatal ones. We must ensure that 
government does not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
<P>
	An example of that is the recent hike in UI premiums. This is a 
tax on employment. It not only takes money away from small 
businesses but it penalizes them for expanding their staffs. 
Every cent taken away from small business hurts job creation.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, job creation in the 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt riding depends very much 
on the entrepreneur and the small business person. These are the 
ones who take the risks, make the commitments and put 
everything they own on the line to make this happen. These are 
the people who create jobs.
<P>
	To be successful small businesses do not need grants, 
subsidies and handouts. Instead government must create and 
sustain a climate that encourages their development and growth. 
Let us remove the road blocks and get out of the way of these 
entrepreneurs. Let us free small businesses to create prosperity 
for the nation.
<P>
	Government subsidies and grant programs do not help 
entrepreneurs who have sound business plans. They do not need 
them. These programs are a part of our deficit problem. They 
lead to high taxes that siphon off the investment dollars that 
could be going to the creation and expansion of successful and 
viable enterprises.
<P>
	Propping up dying industries with subsidies and tax 
concessions can no longer be justified in today's climate of 
global trade. Our businesses must be able to compete. We should 
be looking to the future and the emerging new industries in the 
areas of high technology, information and knowledge services.
<P>
	Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt small businesses just 
want to get on with business. All they ask is that government not 
make their task any harder than necessary.
<P>
	Tax burdens in this country are reaching unsustainable levels. 
Taxes have risen from 24 per cent of the gross domestic product 
in 1950 to almost 43 per cent in 1990. For the last 10 years we 
have been promised by our governments that they would get 
spending under control and that eventually taxes would be 
reduced. Instead the spending each year exceeds the previous 
and taxes rise again.
<P>
	It is time for action. We must stop pointing the finger at 
previous governments and act on a plan to reduce spending.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	Our tax system has spawned a burgeoning underground 
economy and has made criminals out of ordinary people. The 
resulting loss in tax revenue transfers more burden onto the 
shoulders of the remaining taxpayers, including small 
businesses.
<P>
	Another concern of small business is overregulation, cost of 
compliance and the cost of dealing with the ever growing 
bureaucracies. In some cases the costly delays can jeopardize 
the viability of a business before it gets off the ground.
<P>
	An example of this is an entrepreneur in my home town of 
Summerland who faced three years of bureaucratic delays in 
importing llamas and alpacas for which there was a 
demonstrated, ready market.
<P>
	The government is to be commended for its intention to 
reduce the regulatory and paper burden on small businesses and 
to streamline the delivery of services. This is much needed. As 
well, it deserves to be commended for its progress in the matter 
of eliminating interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	The major issue that businesses are concerned about is the 
deficit. The federal deficit is the biggest monkey on the back of 
all Canadians, not just small businesses.
<P>
	Now the hon. members of this House have an opportunity to 
restore the faith of Canadians in our fiscal management. The 
defeat of our Reform Party's subamendment which proposed 
limiting spending to $153 billion sends a confusing signal to the 
Canadian people, especially to small business people.
<P>
	On the one hand the government has spoken, albeit somewhat 
vaguely, about controlling the deficit. On the other hand, it 
refuses to commit itself to a specific reduction target only 6 per 
cent below last year's runaway levels.
<P>
	What are Canadians to think of that when it comes to doing 
their own household budgets? We must all address the issue of 
reducing the deficit and make it a high priority. We must 
unshackle small business so that it can get on with getting 
Canadians back to work and making our economy grow.
<P>
	The people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and all the 
people of Canada are looking to this 35th Parliament to chart a 
new course for Canada. The future of the nation depends on the 
wisdom and fairness of these hon. members in deliberating the 
issues before us. Most important, it depends on the diligence 
with which we listen to and present the views and concerns of 
our constituents in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's presentation with great 
interest and was very much in accord with some of the things he 
said.
<P>
	I am very much aware as we are on this side of the House, 
particularly my friend who is the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, of the difficulties that small 
businesses have en-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="208"> 208 </A></B>
<P>
countered in the past few years. I will not put a political 
perimeter on it because I would be accused of being partisan, 
which of course is not in these days.
<P>
	If we cannot take credit here, it is safe to point out that we are 
focusing on the difficulties that small businesses have 
encountered in all seriousness and with great enthusiasm and a 
certain amount of hope.
<P>
	While indeed small businesses are very concerned about the 
deficit, a major difficulty they have, they are primarily 
concerned about moving ahead in what we hope will be a 
growing economy.
<P>
	Just this weekend I participated in an economic conference in 
my riding. I pointed out that people should not be waiting for big 
buildings and large industries to be brought in because 55 per 
cent of our gross national product in the last two years was 
related to businesses of five or less.
<P>
	We on this side of the House are convinced that small business 
is important. However, I would ask the hon. member if he could 
give me some indication in outline form, as time does not permit 
him to reveal perhaps all the ideas he may have, what he might 
consider a good initiative or measure to take for small 
businesses to give them the kinds of breaks and the hope that I 
believe he is looking for.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	I believe that what this country is missing as we look and 
ponder what can be done for small business is the realization of 
the importance of business initiatives and the increase in jobs 
that will be stimulated by that.
<P>
	I think one of the biggest business initiatives we could have is 
to elevate the feeling of the small businessman to that of a 
hockey player in this country. I think that they feel left out. We 
elevate and make national heroes of other people when really the 
heroes in this country are the people who create jobs and they are 
in small businesses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like the hon. member for Okanagan to explain briefly what he 
has in mind when he says that the government should create a 
climate that is favourable to job creation instead of lending 
money to businesses. What does he mean exactly by that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	I feel it all relates back to the whole issue of deficit reduction. 
In order to stimulate the economy and give the entrepreneurs 
who would create this new employment for Canada we must first 
address our financial situation in this country which is an 
immediate reduction in spending by this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
listening to the hon. member's support for small business I 
could not help feeling that he must have taken extractions from 
our red book. I think it is clearly emphasized how job creation 
and small business is an integral part of our program.
<P>
	I was more concerned when he turned around and said that 
deficit reduction is the main and most important issue. If I am 
not mistaken I think in the greater metro caucus we have twice 
had people before us from the business community. There were 
two major banks as a matter of fact. We have pushed them to 
extremes to start co-operating with small businesses.
<P>
	The member indicated that we must reduce the deficit and that 
it is the main priority. If people are not working then we cannot 
reduce the deficit. If they are not working then we are supporting 
them. We are draining our already depleted revenue. The 
emphasis is on getting the people working. Let us bring some 
dignity to the House as the Prime Minister has often said and let 
us reduce the deficit accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	First of all I would like to say that all good ideas should 
always cross party lines. It makes no difference where they 
come from but as I mentioned in my speech we have made 
Canadian history by electing 52 Reformers to this place. 
However, over the last few days I have sensed that there are 
more Reformers or more ideas to reform in this Chamber than 
just the 52 sitting here.
<P>
	We feel deficit reduction is a very important part. Subsidy 
programs and initiative programs have a dismal rate of success 
in this country. It is evident from all statistics we have where the 
jobs are coming from. Eighty-five per cent of all jobs came from 
the small business sector. We need to stimulate this.
<P>
	I have talked to the business people in 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and around this country and 
they all point to one thing. People do not have confidence in a 
country that is as mired in debt as we are.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to address this problem soon so that Canadians will 
have a feeling of goodwill and the spirit to invest in their country 
and create the jobs through small business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks by 
congratulating you on your new responsibility.
<P>
	I would like to begin my address by also thanking my 
constituents of Broadview-Greenwood for giving me a second 
term in this Parliament of Canada. I grew to have a deep sense of 
respect and appreciation for this Chamber, especially in the last 
three years of my first term. I found it a bit intimidating the first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="209"> 209 </A></B>
<P>
year and I did  not enjoy it as much. As a result of that I shied 
away from the Chamber.
<P>
	However, after my first year of being a member of Parliament 
I made up my mind that I would work at trying to make a 
contribution to debate in the House of Commons in exchanging 
views and ideas. At that time I was on the opposition benches but 
I discovered if I worked at that many members on the 
government side were as interested in trying to achieve the same 
results as I was. I say to all members of this House that I am 
going to continue the same approach of trying to present ideas in 
a constructive way and listen to their ideas so that together we 
can advance real debate. From real debate I believe we have a 
shot at making real reform happen.
<P>
	The danger that one has to be aware of in this town is that most 
of this town is in the hands of the bureaucracy or the paper 
pushers. I believe we have become a nation of paper pushers. I 
think one of the reasons why it has become like that is because so 
many of us who are elected by the people have not used or have 
not exercised our political will to transmit to the public service 
the fact that the ideas that we bring to this Chamber are not our 
ideas but those of our constituents, the people who elected us 
and sent us here. We are going to have to work forcefully to 
make sure they are implemented because ideas just do not 
happen automatically.
<P>
	I put my energy into two very specific areas during the last 
Parliament. I want to begin my remarks this time by going back 
to those two specific themes of small business and tax reform.
<P>
	As I said repeatedly during the last Parliament I believe 
passionately that the greatest hope for putting Canadians back to 
work rests with the small business community. We have close to 
900,000 small businessmen and businesswomen operating 
across this country and they have been suffering incredible 
difficulty over the last few years. They have been suffering 
because of very poor tax design. It was exacerbated by the 
poorly designed goods and services tax which caused an 
incredible paper burden at a time when they did not need it.
<P>
	However there is another area in which small business has 
been suffering and it has to do with the area of capital. Unless we 
address the issue of capital for small and medium sized 
businesses then this country and this House of Commons are 
going to continue to flounder.
<P>
	I was just thrilled during the election campaign, even before 
the election was called, when the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance called a press conference in Ottawa in the 
early part of July. They told the people of Canada that one of the 
central themes of the red book would be built around trying to 
move or shift the attitude of the financial institutions of this 
country toward small business.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	There is not a member of Parliament in this House who could 
not stand up and tell horror stories of how small and medium 
sized businesses in his or her riding have been terrorized by the 
local branch manager. Are there any members who could stand 
up and say they have not had that experience? I see all members 
in this House are nodding their heads.
<P>
	The problem is that somehow as a House of Commons 
collectively-not just the government side, this is not just an 
issue for government members, it is an issue for all members in 
this House-we have to communicate forcefully to the financial 
institutions, the 57 charter A and B banks, the trust companies, 
the pension funds, anybody who has large pools of capital. We 
have to tell them that if they are so hung up on deficit and 
debt-and we are concerned about it too-if they really care 
about this community and this country, then they have to start 
figuring out ways of getting capital into the hands of small and 
medium sized enterprises.
<P>
	I stand up here today, not just as the member of Parliament for 
Broadview-Greenwood, but thanks to the Prime Minister I also 
have the responsibility of being the parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister of Industry. I want to assure all members that just 
because I am on this side of the House I will not stop for a second 
in campaigning on behalf of small businesses, that banks must 
start coming to their assistance.
<P>
	I want to be fair about this as well. We are beginning to hear 
signals from some financial institutions. I want to be very fair 
when I talk about financial institutions in this sense.
<P>
	Two weeks ago the Toronto caucus listened to a senior 
vice-president of the Royal Bank of Canada, Mr. Charlie 
Coffey. He admitted to all of our members that the banks have 
really been falling behind in changing the attitude of 
commercial loans officers toward small business and that they 
were working aggressively and quickly to try to rectify this 
problem.
<P>
	Mr. Coffey stated that until this problem was solved he would 
take calls from any member of Parliament. He gave us his fax 
and phone numbers and encouraged us to circulate them. There 
is one institution that has publicly declared it is committed to 
join us in this campaign. I can only hope that this country's other 
56 financial institutions will be just as aggressive.
<P>
	I want to go on to the next area that also affects small and 
medium sized businesses. It is an issue many members of the 
Reform Party have talked about during the campaign and in the 
House of Commons. It is the issue of tax reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="210"> 210 </A></B>
<P>
	Our Prime Minister has stated unequivocally that we as a 
government are committed to comprehensive tax reform. He 
stated clearly in the Speech from the Throne-I believe it is on 
page 4 at the second paragraph-that he is going to set up a 
finance committee that will first of all do away with the goods 
and services tax. That committee will also look at the idea of 
comprehensive tax reform.
<P>
	I want to declare publicly my particular bias for a specific 
aspect of the Reform Party's platform. It has to do with the 
whole area of tax reform. As a Liberal I am committed to tax 
reform and I know many other Liberals share that commitment. 
This is the Tax Act of Canada. This is the document that really 
decides how the economy of Canada is run. This document is 
approximately 15,000 pages of rules, regulations, exceptions 
and exceptions to exceptions.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	To all members of the House I want to say that even the best 
tax lawyers and best tax accountants in Canada will admit 
privately that this no longer works. We all know this. Canadians 
know it and they are showing their total lack of trust in this 
particular act first of all by going underground.
<P>
	As members know the GST exacerbated the underground 
economy. Even before the GST we had the largest underground 
cash economy of any country in the world, after Italy. That is a 
statement from Canadians that they have lost trust in the system. 
It is not working and it is time to go back to the drawing board.
<P>
	Fortunately we are a party that encourages open and 
constructive debate. Because of that I have been allowed with a 
lot of support to advance an idea called the single tax system. It 
is not too far off the idea that the Reform members campaigned 
on. To all members of the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois, 
this is in both official languages. The single tax is an exercise a 
group of us undertook in the last Parliament after the first year 
when the government asked for a constructive alternative to the 
GST. It is a simple, fair, efficient, workable alternative to the 
current tax act of Canada.
<P>
	I want to say to all the Reform members and members of the 
Bloc as well that I am happy to share the research and the 
experiences I have had because I believe that Canadians really 
do want us to work together. Canadians want us to act now. 
Canadians, as do all members of this House, believe that this 
cannot be a Parliament of consultation. We have been consulting 
to death. We have been consulting and the consultants have been 
consulting the consultants. The last thing we need to do so early 
in this Parliament is to get back into the consulting business. 
Canadians are fed up with consultation. They want action now. 
They want us to move now.
<P>
	When I say they want us to move now, it is not that people 
want us to move irresponsibly. One very specific thing we can 
do immediately is we can phone the leaders of the financial 
institutions and tell them we are all together on the issue of 
banks supporting small business. If every member in this House 
just made one or two calls to a leader of a bank and said that we 
were all together on that issue, that would be immediate action.
<P>
	If we did that to all the financial institutions they would move 
quickly. Members in this House should not forget that they are 
the designers of the law that governs how the banks function. I 
can say if I were a bank president and thought that a united 
House was going to start looking at other ways of regulating my 
business because the banks did not come to the party on their 
own, I would probably move quickly.
<P>
	However we cannot do that job alone. Everyone must 
participate in this and I plead with all members to get involved 
in the issue.
<P>
	Another thing which must be dealt with is the whole hangup 
on the deficit. I am as concerned about abuse and paper burden 
and duplication as any other member of this Parliament, but we 
have to be very careful. If we become so fixated on the deficit 
and if we become so fixated on cutting costs and cutting 
programs just because we want to meet some magic number of 
cutting, I am afraid we are going to exacerbate the already 
serious crisis of confidence we have in this country.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I get very concerned when I see the emphasis on deficit versus 
the emphasis on putting Canadians back to work. As the member 
for Yukon, the leader of the New Democratic Party pointed out 
in her remarks, for every unemployed person we have in this 
country today it costs the treasury $17,000 directly, not counting 
indirect costs like health care, crime costs and so on, not to 
mention the fact that we lose a revenue source to the treasury.
<P>
	I personally believe the best way to handle the deficit and 
ultimately the debt is by getting Canadians back to work. If we 
have to go through a short period where there might be a little bit 
more of the same deficit and debt, but if ultimately it means we 
can get Canadians working so that a year or 18 months from now 
we have more taxpayers and therefore more revenue coming in, 
that is the approach I support. I hope members understand that.
<P>
	Of course that is the design and the objective of the 
infrastructure program which is totally supported by the 
Minister of Finance. It is a fine balancing act but we have to 
remember as I said the other day that our ultimate responsibility 
in this House is not for the people who are advantaged. We come 
to this House as people in government for the people in our 
communities who are disadvantaged: the unemployed father 
who does not have enough money to buy his kid a hockey stick; 
or the unemployed single mom who sometimes just does not  
have enough money to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="211"> 211 </A></B>
<P>
give her child proper nutrition. That is our bottom line 
responsibility.
<P>
	I hope we will not put human capital on the back burner in the 
name of the deficit, when it really should be on the front burner.
<P>
	Again I want to thank my constituents, especially all of the 
volunteers. We all have very special volunteers who helped us 
come here. A young man, 32 years old, comes into my office. 
Nick Lamacchia is unemployed and has been for the last six 
months. He comes into my office every day from about ten 
o'clock in the morning and stays until about seven at night. He 
listens to other people's pain and frustration.
<P>
	As long as we can keep in touch with the reality of what is 
going on in all of our communities we can overcome whatever 
we have to in order to make sure the people we are sent here to 
serve are ultimately being served.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, thank you for your patience and time. I am going 
to do my best to advance my support for small business and tax 
reform. I will be happy to share any research I have from the last 
Parliament with anyone.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> To make your job easier, Mr. Speaker, and to 
clarify matters for the House, I would hope to obtain unanimous 
consent that beginning with the next speaker on the government 
side, the 20 minutes allotted be split into two 10-minute 
periods, followed by two 5-minute periods for questions and 
comments. This would not apply to ministers who would 
continue to speak for 20 minutes, followed by 10 minutes for 
questions and comments. Is the House prepared to give its 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, part of the proposal put forward 
by the hon. member for Saint-Léonard has eluded us. We do not 
reject his proposal but we would like him to repeat it so that 
everything is clear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I proposed that all government 
members starting with the next speaker talk for 10 minutes, with 
five minutes for questions and comments, except for the 
ministers. The ministers will continue to have 20 minutes at 
their disposal, with 10 minutes for questions, since they must 
talk about specific projects mentioned in the throne speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does anyone else wish to speak on this 
point of order?
<P>
	I believe there is unanimous consent for the government 
whip's proposal.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the hon. member's comments very much, particularly 
when he stressed the importance of small and medium sized 
businesses, and I would like to ask him several questions.
<P>
	Before I do that, however, I would like to make two brief 
remarks, as it seems to me that the hon. member reacted very 
negatively when the Bloc Quebecois announced its sovereigntist 
stand in this House. As I recall clearly, he reacted very openly 
and very negatively.
<P>
	He noted at the outset that most of his ideas came from his 
constituents. I would like to remind him that I, and all Bloc 
members, were elected to this House to represent the views of 
our constituents.
<P>
	Late in his statement, he also said that he was tired of 
consultation and wanted action. Well that is precisely how 
Quebec feels. We too are rather fed up with consultation and 
want action on the sovereignty issue.
<P>
	I want to broach the subject of small and medium sized 
businesses because it is dear to me and affects Quebecers and 
Canadians equally. I realize it is an important issue, one that you 
have addressed at considerable length, as did a member of the 
Reform Party who made some timely comments. I ask the hon. 
member if he would be prepared to support measures which 
would enhance the climate conducive to the development of 
small businesses?
<P>
	We know that the deficit, taxes and all of the government 
forms that small and medium sized businesses must contend 
with impede initiative. Would the hon. member support 
eliminating family trusts, trimming the fat from government 
and setting up a parliamentary committee to reduce government 
waste and duplication in order to lower the deficit and promote 
the development of small and medium sized businesses?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
begin by thanking the member for his question.
<P>
	The member used to be a former resident of Penetanguishene, 
Ontario. I remember his presence there. He always made a great 
contribution to that community. I talked to some of his 
supporters from Penetang-Midland Coach Lines this morning. 
They asked me to convey a hello to him.
<P>
	I want to deal with the question of the Bloc Quebecois before I 
get to small business. One has to try to understand that this is the 
Parliament of Canada. There has been a traditional view I have 
always supported that when one comes to this Chamber the 
objective is to make a better Canada. There have been times 
when I have struggled, and I still struggle, with the idea of 
coming to this House of Commons of Canada saying basically 
that I want to separate from it.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="212"> 212 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Please bear with me as I try to understand how that fits 
logically. I have not been able to figure it out yet but I have 
tremendous personal affection for their leader when he was 
Minister of the Environment and I was a member in opposition. 
He came to my riding and supported my people's summit on the 
environment so none of my feeling is of a personal nature. It has 
to do with an ideological difference we have. I am already seeing 
signs that the Bloc is shifting its position.
<P>
	When I hear members of the Bloc stand up and passionately 
care about the image and the play of Team Canada I say there is a 
spark of hope because eventually their interest in Canada will 
probably expand to other areas.
<P>
	I have less than a minute. I want to deal with the subject of 
family trusts. One can check Hansard. I spoke against the 
government three times on that bill. I voted against the bill. I 
personally think it is obscene that the richest people and the 
wealthiest families in Canada, some of whom actually happen to 
be friends, have billions of dollars that have gone untaxed for 20 
years when we have people living in poverty and people making 
less than $50,000 a year who are paying tax because of the 
complexity and other complications related to the tax system. 
There is no argument from me and we will be fighting for 
reform.
<P>
	I call that comprehensive reform and we are with them on 
that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> I will be 
very brief, Mr. Speaker. I have a question and a few comments 
for the hon. member who just spoke.
<P>
	I for one consider that what the hon. member just said is fair 
for any one who still believes in the Canadian system and its 
effectiveness. Personally, I believe everything has been tried 
over the past few years. How long have we been telling the 
federal government that duplication between Ottawa and 
Quebec is horribly expensive?
<P>
	The hon. member himself admits that even accountants do not 
trust the Income Tax Act any more. He himself has lost 
confidence in it. We, in Quebec, have understood that the 
Canadian tax law was working against us. It is too expensive. 
The entire Canadian system is too expensive, starting with the 
size of the public service, our embassies and the very operation 
of the Canadian government. That is why the national debt has 
reached $500 billion in Canada, creating a $40 to $45 billion 
annual deficit. I respect what the hon. member said, but as far as 
I am concerned it is nothing more than pious wishes.
<P>
	I do not believe that in the present system the federal 
government can solve the problem with studies and analyses.
<P>
	I do believe, however, that it can be solved. My question is the 
following: how would the hon. member feel about Quebec 
opting out of the Canadian Confederation, bringing along its $28 
billion in taxes to administer on its own? I would put more faith 
in that approach that in the one the hon. member has put forward.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister of Industry. You have two or three minutes 
remaining.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin by saying that I am a naturally optimistic and 
hopeful person but let me say why I believe we all can be more 
hopeful.
<P>
	With the exception of 60-odd members this is a totally new 
Parliament. I happen to believe that one of the reasons I am back 
here, aside from the red book and the great performance of my 
leader and my colleagues, and that I have had such support is 
because I stood for a couple of causes people believed in.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	I am from Ontario, as you are. We have the same problems you 
have in terms of duplicate-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I know this is a new 
Parliament, but would the hon. member please address the 
Chair?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
apologies to you. Through you to the member, I am much more 
optimistic obviously and because we have new members we can 
address these issues quickly.
<P>
	Concerning the people of Quebec, through you Mr. Speaker to 
the members of the Bloc Quebecois, we must never forget that 
they do have 50-odd members and two million votes, but there 
are seven million people in Quebec. I think the challenge for all 
of us in this House who want to keep Canada together is for us to 
address some of the legitimate problems that are brought to this 
House. I say that there are some real legitimate beefs. If we can 
address those things then ultimately it is our responsibility to go 
over the heads of the separatists right to the people and tell them 
to stay in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired for questions and 
comments. The next speaker will be the member for Medicine 
Hat. I might say before recognizing our new colleague that an 
error was made. It was my error that you did not get recognized 
earlier. You now have 10 minutes with 5 minutes of questions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="213"> 213 </A></B>
<P>
thereafter before we go to the member of the Official 
Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker and hon. 
members, first of all I offer my sincere congratulations to all 
who won election to the House of Commons. To serve as a 
member of Parliament is a great responsibility and a great 
honour.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, yours is certainly a double honour. You were 
honoured by your constituents in Edmonton in becoming a 
member of Parliament once again and of course now by your 
appointment as a Speaker of this place. Please accept my 
congratulations.
<P>
	To the government and to the Prime Minister in particular I 
extend my wishes for every success in solving the problems that 
stand before us. They are problems that really cut across party 
lines, provincial boundaries, cultures, genders, institutions and 
even the generations. If we are to solve these problems it will 
require the best efforts of all Canadians. It is my sincere hope 
that we will all together apply ourselves to that task.
<P>
	To the people of the Medicine Hat constituency I give my 
gratitude for the warmth, friendship and support they have 
shown toward me as their member of Parliament. I thank them 
for the great trust they have placed in me as their servant and 
representative to the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I begin that job by offering advice to the government on its 
intention to bring reform to the unemployment insurance 
program. The government is to be commended for recognizing 
that unemployment insurance as it is presently constituted is a 
destroyer of jobs and a ravager of initiative. Likewise, the 
government is correct in asserting that more emphasis must be 
placed on improving training and that business should play a 
major role in providing training.
<P>
	Who could know better than businesses themselves what 
skills are required for their future success? Certainly not 
government. I am concerned, however, when the Prime Minister 
talks about a training tax to coerce business. If the government 
would instead cut spending and ultimately lower taxes one could 
be sure that business could provide its own training because it is 
in the best interest of businesses to do so. Nonetheless, simply 
recognizing that a problem exists is the first major step in 
resolving it. For that alone I give the government full marks.
<P>
	I am also profoundly concerned when the government fails to 
outline the process by which it will shape the unemployment 
insurance program of the future. It is no exaggeration to say that 
the present unemployment insurance program has not only 
failed Canadians, it has wounded us. In ignoring pleas for 
change from both businesses and those people who are sincerely 
looking for work we have cut the soul out of entire regions of the 
country. If this is the type of help that comes from government 
then Canadians should run from government as fast as they can. 
On the other hand, if the government is prepared to share the 
decision-making power to involve those who fund the program, 
to design it for the  long run to ensure that it is in line with what 
other levels of government and the private sector are doing, with 
the current fiscal reality, if it is prepared to set clear measurable 
objectives, if it is committed to making the program more 
accessible and user friendly, if it is committed to promoting 
equal access and benefits for all, if it promotes and rewards 
personal responsibility and initiative, if it commits itself to 
following that process in designing an unemployment insurance 
program, it will succeed beyond our greatest hopes. Contrarily, 
if it is a program that is designed and implemented and 
controlled solely by government, it will fail. If it invites greater 
public input but then ignores that input, it will fail. In failing it 
will again crush the initiative of the unemployed and business 
creating economic and human carnage of tragic proportions.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Specifically how should we go about redesigning the UI 
program? The first decision-making principle is that all 
stakeholders must have a voice in designing this program. That 
includes business, particularly small business which pays most 
of the premiums. It should include of course the workers who 
pay into the fund. It should include the federal government as an 
adviser and a junior stakeholder. Although this may seem 
obvious, governments I find often ignore this advice. The 
process should not include those groups which have a vested 
interest in not resolving the problem.
<P>
	It is a great truth that incentives matter. If a group or an 
individual receives funding so that they can protest high 
unemployment levels do not expect them to propose solutions 
that will make their position or group unnecessary. Even though 
they are often well-meaning and claim passionately that they 
want to solve the problem, I point out that they have a powerful 
economic incentive to perpetuate the problem. These two 
competing forces can never be completely disentangled.
<P>
	The second principle is that decisions must be made with the 
long term best interests of the country in mind. Too often 
decisions are made without considering their long term 
implications.
<P>
	In 1971 the Liberal government chose to regionally extend 
unemployment insurance benefits. Today we reap the rotten 
fruit of that hastily planted seed. Governments must always 
consider the effect of their decisions over the long run.
<P>
	The third principle is that decisions should always be made 
with complete awareness of the current environment. By that I 
mean the current economic, social, cultural and political 
environment, both within and without the country. Unless we are 
all pulling together in the same direction on every front even the 
best designed programs will ultimately fail. Today's 
environment is one of tight fiscal constraints, freer trade and 
greater public participation in the democratic process. A newly 
de-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="214"> 214 </A></B>
<P>
signed unemployment insurance  program must be sensitive to 
this and reflect these trends in its design.
<P>
	The fourth principle is that all government programs must 
have clear measurable objectives. What is the point of designing 
a program whose effects are not measured or cannot be 
measured because the objectives are never made clear? In those 
instances when the effects are obviously counterproductive why 
have a bureaucracy? Why even have a government if it will not 
fix the problem?
<P>
	For 20 years the evidence against high benefits, regionally 
extended benefits and training boondoggles has been mounting. 
Every government in that 20 year period has cowered from 
fixing the problem.
<P>
	The fifth principle is that all government programs must be 
designed to be user friendly. Today the myriad programs offered 
by human resources development are hopelessly complicated. 
As one field level bureaucrat told me: ``Our job is to make 
poorly designed programs run efficiently''. What a damning 
indictment of the system that is.
<P>
	In the introduction of the 1985 Forget commission report 
there is a touching letter from a lady who decries how hopelessly 
complicated getting a UI benefit can be. Sadly that is still true 
eight years after that report was tabled.
<P>
	Governments' failure to solve problems can be traced back 
directly to the process by which they make decisions. Without 
public input in the design of these programs they will never ever 
be able to respond to the needs of the public.
<P>
	The sixth principle is that all government programs must 
always treat all Canadians the same. Choosing to live in a 
particular area of the country should not be a reason for 
receiving greater or longer benefits. The government must 
recognize that in attempting to correct what are sometimes 
inequities in the natural resource wealth of the country it only 
succeeds in corrupting the human resource wealth of the same 
area of the country it originally set out to help.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	That is the malady of large tracts of Atlantic Canada and it is 
the legacy of a government that did not understand that 
government has its limitations.
<P>
	The seventh principle is that all government programs should 
promote and encourage personal responsibility and initiative. 
Of course this should be demonstrated at the top by giving 
business and employees the responsibility for setting premiums 
and determining benefits. Those premiums will reflect more 
accurately than any government decree what businesses and 
employees can afford to pay in premiums and pay out in benefits 
while maintaining and strenghthening the viability of 
businesses and the purchasing power of employees, thereby 
strenghthening the economy.
<P>
	Those who are chronically unemployed because they lack 
experience or training should be the beneficiaries of an 
integrated program of training and income support provided 
jointly by the provincial and federal governments. That, 
however, is a speech for another day.
<P>
	Before we can reform unemployment insurance or social 
programs or anything we do in government, we must first reform 
how we make decisions including all the stakeholders looking at 
the long run, being aware of the current environment, having 
clear measurable objectives, designing programs to be user 
friendly, treating all Canadians equally, encouraging personal 
responsibility and initiative. This is the framework within which 
unemployment insurance should be reformed.
<P>
	The $20 billion Canadians spend on unemployment insurance 
is not play money. It is not the government's money. It is the 
product of the hard work of millions of Canadians. It is their 
money. It is their right to have a say in how it is spent. If we 
respect that most basic right we will produce a responsible and 
sustainable unemployment insurance program. If we respect 
that right in all of our deliberations we will have a government 
that works within its limits and lives within its means.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate my friend from Medicine Hat for his first 
speech in the House. I just got the last part of it because I was so 
busy stuffing my face.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> With what?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Food. My friend from York South-Weston is 
here. Anything can happen now.
<P>
	The member for Medicine Hat talked about the 
unemployment insurance program. Certainly I would be the first 
to agree that there is a need for change. I want to scrutinize some 
of the suggestions he made. One that caught my attention I will 
come back to in a moment. But let me make a basic point about 
the unemployment insurance system.
<P>
	It is not a bogy. It is a system that has served this country very 
well. Let us not, to use a cliché, throw out the baby with the bath 
water. This is a system that has served this country very well.
<P>
	The issue I want to come back to is the one of the variable 
entrance requirements. I say to the member kindly that if we 
were to extrapolate and take to its logical conclusion his point 
that one ought not to have a different entrance requirement 
depending on where one lives in this country, he is also 
espousing that all automobile insurance plans ought to be 
identical and that there ought not to be any variability in the type 
of coverage that is needed by different individuals.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="215"> 215 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Of course he does not believe that. I ask him to examine a 
little more closely his thesis that where one lives in the country 
makes no difference.
<P>
	I submit that it makes a whole lot of difference. For example, 
it makes a difference in the ability of one to work in construction 
activity. I would suggest that it would have been much more 
difficult three days ago to do construction activity when it was 
-30 degrees in Ottawa than in Newfoundland where it was 12 
degrees above that day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised a 
couple of issues.
<P>
	First, he wants to know whether unemployment insurance as it 
is presently constituted has been a boon or a problem in the 
country.
<P>
	Certainly the premier of Newfoundland would suggest that as 
it is presently designed it has not served the interests of 
Newfoundlanders very well. He points to the fact that a 
generation of people have become dependent on unemployment 
insurance as it is now. That is not only an economic tragedy but a 
human tragedy. We must work quickly to change that so that we 
can save yet another generation from that type of situation.
<P>
	It is very important to recognize that there is a great 
difference between an insurance program that puts the onus on 
individuals to show that they are trying to stay in the work force 
and setting up different benefits depending on the 
unemployment rate in particular areas of the country.
<P>
	I point out that before regionally extended benefits we had 
unemployment rates in Newfoundland of around 7 per cent. 
Since we have regionally extended benefits they have gone up, 
up and up to 20 and 25 per cent. It is very important that we not 
ignore the lessons of history lest we be doomed to repeat them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired. 
Before recognizing the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, I think the hon. member for 
Bellechasse has something to say, am I right?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I want to rise on a point of 
order. The next speaker for the Official Opposition is the hon. 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. Like every woman sitting 
in this House, she is very active and only sickness or some 
mishap would slow her down just a little. Unfortunately, she 
broke her ankle during the weekend. So, Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask you to show some leniency and allow the hon. 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata to stay seated while she 
makes her speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I can assure the hon. member that I see 
no problem whatsoever. Now, the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to speak today in this House, the 
symbol of Canadian democracy.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all 
members of this House who were elected or re-elected, 
especially the right hon. Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
of the Opposition and the hon. member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	My first words will be directed to the constituents of the 
riding of Rimouski-Témiscouata. I want to thank them for the 
confidence that they have shown me by choosing me to represent 
them in the House or that they have expressed to me since I was 
elected. I will do everything I can to meet their expectations and 
they can count on my co-operation for any individual or 
collective project that could contribute to their well-being.
<P>
	My speech will be made up of two parts. In the first part, I 
want to remind you of the reasons that brought me to Ottawa 
and, in the second part, I want to express some comments and 
questions I have about certain aspects of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage, of which I am the official critic for the 
opposition. I will come right to the heart of the subject by 
reminding you, Mr. Speaker, that you have before you a true 
sovereignist, one who is determined to work relentlessly in 
order to defend Quebec's interests. You have before you a 
sovereignist who, on behalf of the people of 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, feels that she has the legitimate right 
to be here in order to claim what is owed to that region and to see 
to it that it is treated fairly.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Whether the Prime Minister or the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest and their parties like it or not, I came here to speak 
about Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	I came here to fight for the MRCs of Mitis, Témiscouata and 
Rimouski-Neigette and their 37 municipalities in my riding 
which includes Rimouski, the regional capital of eastern 
Quebec. Besides government services, you can find in Rimouski 
one university, the Institut national de recherche scientifique en 
océanographie, the Institut de marine, one CEGEP, the Quebec 
Telephone head office, the Rimouski regional hospital and the 
archdiocesan offices.
<P>
	I am also here to fight for the five eastern Quebec ridings and 
all Quebecers.
<P>
	I stand here as an advocate of Quebec sovereignty. I grew up 
in Montreal, started a teaching career in Laval University in 
Quebec City and spent the last 25 years working in a region that 
honoured me by making me their elected representative. That 
region is well known for its vibrant cultural life, but it is plagued 
with deep and lingering economic problems. Up to a few years 
ago, the citizens there thought they could count on vital  
communication links for its development, but it had to weather a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="216"> 216 </A></B>
<P>
devastating attack by the previous government which deprived 
it of its public television services and cut back its postal and 
railway services. Ever since that sombre day when 
Radio-Canada closed its doors there, that region has hardly had 
any means left to voice its concerns, and its protests have gone 
unanswered. Everyone knows that we have reached a point 
where communications are essential community rights.
<P>
	The people of Rimouski-Témiscouata have had enough of 
cuts, closings, unemployment, welfare, poverty, bankruptcies, 
tax increases, not to mention the underground economy, 
smuggling and violence. These proud, courageous and 
hard-working people have had enough of a centralizing 
government which denies that there are differences and 
disparities between communities. They have long understood 
that their future depends on appropriate and concrete solutions 
to their problems. They understand that their sovereignty, 
Quebec's sovereignty, is the key to their future. In the 
meantime, they will have the opportunity to say yes again like 
they did the first time in May 1980. They want the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage to fairly fulfill his mandate, a mandate which 
is to protect the cultural and natural heritage so that when the 
new era comes Quebec can find its heritage untouched. I will 
now turn briefly to some issues before the Department of 
Canadian Heritage, that is amateur sport, the National Film 
Board, official languages, Telefilm Canada, the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation and copyright.
<P>
	Now that the winter and summer Olympic Games alternate 
every second year at the request of American broadcasters and 
their sponsors, amateur sport will be on the forefront of current 
events and could be widely talked about in a rather bad light, as 
we saw recently in the case of Team Canada and figure skating in 
the United States.
<P>
	In the present context of economic austerity, Quebecers want 
more than games, in any case something other than a flag war. 
They demand, among other things, a review of the athlete status 
in order to put an end to dubious practices whereby so-called 
amateurs stash away the thousands of dollars they earn while 
continuing to receive their amateur sport grant. These grants 
should go only to those who really need them.
<P>
	Moreover, since the main decision centres for participation in 
the Olympics are in Toronto and Calgary, Quebec is asking, and 
rightly so, for a review of selection procedures in some olympic 
sports, to do away with discrimination and inequity toward 
Quebec athletes and others.
<P>
	Over the last four years, Canadian taxpayers have given some 
$4 million in grants to Team Canada. Selection of athletes is 
entirely left to the various coaches and, according to 
information given in this House by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage himself, Team Canada will reveal the names of athletes 
selected ``a few days  only before the first match''. Why pay for 
four years if, on the eve of the Olympic Games, we cannot make 
public the names of the 23 players selected?
<P>
	Team Canada needs more than a token French speaking 
assistant coach in charge of relations with the French media. We 
have to make sure that people like Mario Lemieux will not be 
eliminated because they are ``not good enough''; that those like 
Alexandre Daigle will not be excluded because they are ``too 
strong-minded''; that those like Sylvie Fréchette will not be 
disregarded because they refuse to train in Calgary; that those 
like the Duchesnays-who gave France the gold-will not be 
considered ``too avant-garde'' by Canadian judges; finally, that 
those like Eric Lindros will not be given the red carpet treatment 
and selected against the rules.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Finally, one has only to think about fencing or figure skating 
to realize that all amateur sports are not equal. We must 
recognize that and adopt a grant policy which will protect those 
sports and ensure an equitable distribution of funds.
<P>
	As far as official languages are concerned, it is essential that 
interventions be targeted properly, that they be distinct, that 
they fulfill specific needs and that they take into account the 
special situation of each of our two solitudes.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the Bloc Quebecois came to Ottawa to 
deal with sovereignty; we are not here to promote bilingualism. 
For Quebec, the sole purpose of official languages is the proper 
operation of federal parliamentary and judicial institutions.
<P>
	However, for the francophone and Acadian community of 
Canada, the Bloc Quebecois is simply asking for the 
implementation of section 23 of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms entrenched in the Constitution Act of 1982.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to make this clear to all Canadians from one ocean to 
the other and to the other, as our colleague from Yukon likes to 
say Mr. Speaker, I want you to listen carefully. As you know the 
English speaking minority of Quebec has always been well 
treated. These people have a complete guarantee that under a 
sovereign government in Quebec they will keep all their historic 
rights.
<P>
	As critic for Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition I want to make 
sure that the minority known as la Communauté francophone et 
acadienne du Canada receives the same treatment and that its 
rights guaranteed by the Constitution are respected without 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="217"> 217 </A></B>
<P>
having to take legal proceedings and going as far as the Supreme 
Court of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Even though it is a magnificent concept, the cinerobotheque 
recently opened in Montreal has not increased the NFB's 
market.
<P>
	Over the years, the NFB has strayed more and more from its 
original course which was to produce documentaries. The NFB 
seems to be looking for its raison d'être. It produces fewer films 
on its own but rather uses the funds it manages to co-produce 
films in co-operation or in competition with the private sector 
or Telefilm Canada, as was the case with ``The Decline of the 
American Empire'', ``Night Zoo'' and ``Léolo''.
<P>
	On the other hand, the NFB neglects its regional role and 
budgetary restrictions forced it to reduce the resources and 
services which regions normally had access to. Preferring 
glamour to thriftiness, the NFB announced it was closing its 
regional offices in Rimouski, Chicoutimi, Trois-Rivières, 
Sherbrooke, Rouyn-Noranda, Charlottetown, Calgary, St. 
John's and Sydney, but that it will be keeping open those in 
Paris, London, and New York to distribute its films, something 
which could be done at a lesser cost by the private sector.
<P>
	I am asking that the NFB's mandate be re-examined in light of 
the taxpayers'ability to pay and the need to support a growing 
film industry in Canada.
<P>
	As for Telefilm Canada, one can well wonder why it is 
maintaining at great expense offices in Paris, London, and Los 
Angeles.
<P>
	Moreover, through the years-thanks to a lack of control and 
too much opulence-several of Telefilm's employees have 
gotten into the habit of attending, sometimes in great numbers, 
numerous film festivals including the one in Cannes and the film 
and television fair, as well as the Marché international de la 
production en télévision and the Marché international de la 
production et des communications which are held for the same 
audience and the same market, twice a year in Cannes.
<P>
	Before considering slashing financial support for the creation 
of original works, we should review the mandate of Telefim 
Canada, and ponder the judiciousness of keeping those offices 
abroad open instead of giving the responsibility for film 
distribution to the private sector.
<P>
	As far as the CBC is concerned, we know that in 1990, it was 
left with a shortfall of $108 million as a result of a decision by 
the previous government. The president announced 
unprecedented cuts, closing 11 local or regional TV stations, 
including those in Rimouski, Matane, and Sept-Îles, and 
causing the loss of 1,100 jobs, 280 of which were reclassified or 
lost in eastern Quebec.
<P>
	These cuts, which had and are still having a negative impact 
on regional development, did not improve the corporation's 
financial situation.
<P>
	It should be noted that, without taking into account the cuts 
announced in the April 1994 budget, the CBC will have a 
shortfall of around $42 million in 1993-94; around $32 million 
in 1994-95; and around $79 million in 1998-99.
<P>
	It is therefore urgent that we tackle the issue of the financing 
of the CBC public radio and TV networks.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I am concerned that the CBC is thinking about using the 
surplus generated by the employee pension fund to offset its 
deficit for the next two years. You can surely understand that we 
will oppose any attempt to resolve the CBC's financial woes by 
shutting down regional stations or by using pension funds for 
bailout purposes.
<P>
	Moreover it is all the more important under the circumstances 
that the next CBC president be selected on the basis of ability 
rather than on the basis of partisan considerations.
<P>
	Lastly, the mandate of the CBC must not be viewed strictly in 
terms of available funds, but equally in terms of the country's 
linguistic specificity, that is to say in terms of the cultural 
specificity of the country's two founding peoples.
<P>
	The Crown corporation is straying from its mandate of public 
broadcaster because, on the one hand, of the shortfall it must 
make up and because, on the other hand, of the increasingly 
commercial approach it is being forced to take. It has modified 
the content and level of some of its programming to get the 
viewer ratings it needs to attract advertisers and in turn erase 
part of its revenue shortfall. It is dipping into an already limited 
pool of advertisers, especially in Quebec, and getting into 
questionable competition with private broadcasters.
<P>
	It is critical that the government review the Crown 
corporation's mandate and be very vigilant as the CRTC 
prepares to hold important hearings on speciality services and 
digital radio broadcasting. The CRTC's rulings will have a 
major impact on the operation of the radio-television industry. 
The government must ensure that in making its ruling, the CRTC 
takes into consideration the country's linguistic specificity and 
extracts a commitment from cable operators to abide by 
Canadian content rules and make services available to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is important to realize that the CRTC's rulings 
will have a considerable impact on the world of television. They 
will affect cable subscription costs as well as the way 
advertising revenues are shared at a time when broadcasters are 
already worried about their future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="218"> 218 </A></B>
<P>
	Moving to the complex issue of copyright, I would like to 
point out that creators are currently out in the cold and that the 
government will have to act quickly by tabling as soon as 
possible a bill to correct this unfortunate situation.
<P>
	As I far as I know, there are two ways of looking at this issue. 
You can view copyright as a right to reproduce a concrete piece 
of work-a view commonly held by the Americans and 
Anglo-Saxons-whereby the higher the quality of the work, the 
more it is reproduced and the more profitable it is.
<P>
	Or you can view the very act of creation as taking precedence 
over any concern for protecting the work that will be produced. 
This is the view which allows creators to earn money as soon as 
their work is used, the view favoured in francophone circles.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes we should favour the latter and 
protect copyright for 50 years after the death of the artist on all 
types of work.
<P>
	However, we can neither stop progress nor ignore it. So, we 
must recognize the right to copy privately, but at the same time 
grant royalties to creators for every blank tape sold as well as for 
the recording medium. The Société de gestion des droits 
d'auteur, a collective, could be in charge of administering the 
royalties.
<P>
	Further, Mr. Speaker, we should protect neighbouring and 
residual rights. France recognizes the former. That is how 
Céline Dion can receive royalties every time they play her 
rendition of ``Power of Love''-to which she has given a 
personal touch and which she has made famous around the 
world-in France but not in the US nor in Canada, because 
neither recognizes neighbouring rights.
<P>
	As for residual rights, they should be included in this act and 
also protected for 50 years. These rights relate to the royalties 
paid to artists as their works are sold to successive owners. This 
entire area of residuals will have to receive due attention out of 
fairness for the artists and to sustain the art production market.
<P>
	The last point I want to get across to the government is that 
culture is a sensitive area and a financially profitable industry of 
vital importance to the development of communities. Just 
thinking about how much the Riopelles, Vigneaults, Voisines, 
Adams, Sutherlands and Forresters have done for the reputation 
of Quebec and Canada, it is easy to see that the return on 
investment in the cultural industry far exceeds that of any other 
economic activity.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois reiterates that, to promote the cultural 
identity of each of the founding nations, the government must 
put an end to costly overlapping in culture and communications, 
while ensuring the transfer of the budget envelopes for these 
items, in accordance with the traditional demands of Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, Mr. Speaker, I ask the government to follow through 
on the suggestion of the Official Opposition requesting that a 
committee be struck to review extensively, item by item, 
expenditures of the Department of Canadian Heritage and of all 
federal corporations or agencies that come under it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before going on to questions and 
comments, I would like to add for the television viewers that you 
remained seated because of a broken ankle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague for her speech. I would 
like to make a short comment and then ask two questions.
<P>
	The comment is very straightforward. I believe that it would 
be useful, if possible in the near future, to give a comparison of 
the services anglophones have in Quebec and those 
francophones have outside Quebec.
<P>
	I understand your point and I fully agree with the basic 
premise, but I believe that could help to educate some people. So 
if the occasion arose and I could assist you, I would be pleased to 
do so. If you can do it, it would be very useful.
<P>
	I also note that the hon. member made the following 
comment, that if Quebec became a sovereign state, the 
anglophone minority could be assured of having the historic 
rights which they had and which they enjoy today. I hope that it 
would be so, but why did so many anglophones leave Quebec 
during the referendum crisis several years ago and why are so 
many still leaving, according to the statistics and information I 
have? If this objective of sovereignty were realized, no doubt 
more would leave. Obviously, some of them must be wondering 
if it is true or not.
<P>
	Secondly, I listened carefully and I heard nothing about what 
a Bloc Quebecois government would do with respect to native 
people if Quebec were sovereign. Nevertheless, the First 
Nations have historic rights. Would you have something to share 
with us on this subject?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by making 
a comment and thanking the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services for his 
question.
<P>
	First of all, minority rights in Quebec have always been 
guaranteed and protected. You asked me to draw a comparison 
between francophones and anglophones. I will take only one 
example, that of the school system.
<P>
	Anglophones have always managed their own free public 
school system. They even had a school system managed by 
English speaking protestants, so that they would not have to mix 
with French-speaking catholics.
<P>
	Although the 1982 Constitution guarantees the right of 
Acadians and other French speaking Canadians to manage their 
own schools in every province where numbers warrant, those 
com-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="219"> 219 </A></B>
<P>
munities had to go all the  way to the Supreme Court to force 
their provinces to merely implement the terms of the 1982 
Constitution.
<P>
	So when Acadians and other French Canadians are treated the 
same as the anglophone minority in Quebec, I think that Canada 
will be entitled to sing the national anthem of its choice. In the 
meantime, I think that the rights of Quebec anglophones are 
protected by the program of the Parti Quebecois. This is not the 
place to list their potential rights in a sovereign Quebec. We will 
leave that to Quebec and Mr. Parizeau when he comes into 
office, as we all hope.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	As far as natives are concerned, I am not the designated critic 
on this issue. I will leave it to the official critic on aboriginal 
affairs to state our views on the subject. But it is clear that our 
native minority has always been treated well in Quebec, too. 
They have not experienced nearly as many difficulties as in the 
rest of the country, as the courts can testify to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> I would 
also like to congratulate my colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata for her comments. However, Mr. 
Speaker, I thought that, during the last election campaign, the 
party which forms the official opposition had promised 
Quebecers that it would primarily talk about economic recovery 
and job creation. Yet, since the opening of this session, that 
party has only raised the issue of sovereignty.
<P>
	Is the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata prepared to 
fulfill the mandate she received from her constituents and 
co-operate with our government to put Quebecers and 
Canadians back to work? Otherwise, will she tell them honestly 
that she is here for one reason, and that is Quebec's 
independence, rather than its sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question, but I want to remind him that I am not here to promote 
Quebec's separation, but rather its sovereignty, and in French 
there is an enormous difference between those two concepts.
<P>
	As regards economic recovery, it just so happens that I am 
involved in a sector which is absolutely extraordinary for the 
recovery of the economy. The budget for Canadian Heritage is 
roughly $3 billion but that sector brings in $22 billion to 
Canada. Each dollar invested in the cultural sector brings in one 
dollar in revenue. In some fields you sometime have to spend 
$200,000 to create one job, but in the cultural sector one dollar 
will have a return of one dollar. In fact, this sector is the one with 
the highest return in the economy and it also creates 500,000 
jobs across Canada.
<P>
	What I emphasized throughout my speech was that we must 
revise mandates, cut the fat in the federal administration, and 
put an end to trips made three times a year by civil servants to 
Cannes as well as to the film festival in Berlin at 
taxpayers'expense. I have rarely seen any civil servant at the 
international film festival for youth in Rimouski. It does not 
cost much to go to Rimouski. Yet, no civil servant shows up at 
that festival, even though it would really not be an expensive 
proposition, with hotel rooms at $40 a night. But 60 civil 
servants go to Cannes three times a year and stay in hotels at 
$200 a night. This is why we must set up a House committee so 
that members of Parliament are the ones who decide where to 
cut, instead of relying on suggestions made by civil servants, 
because they will never cut in their own fat. Have you ever seen 
anything like this? Therefore, this issue must absolutely be dealt 
with by a House committee, so that we, members of Parliament, 
are the ones to decide where to cut out the fat. We must be able to 
find funding so as not to reduce the budget of Telefilm Canada 
producers but rather that of those who sell our films and not 
passively watch the private sector sell our films. This is the kind 
of sound decision we must make, and not once again go after the 
performers and the creators. The throne speech is silent on this; 
there is not a single line about promoting economic recovery in 
that sector in spite of the fact that we know it has the best 
performance.
<P>
	So, I hope the government will prove serious and take proper 
steps in this direction.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are three and a half minutes left. 
You can share this time. The hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> First off I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata who reminded this House of the first 
objective Bloc Quebecois members have set for themselves 
during the last campaign.
<P>
	Listening to her speech, one or two questions came to my 
mind. However, given the question of the last speaker I will 
rephrase it, to make it clearer to the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, and to the House. As a member of this 
House, how does she interpret the mandate she received on 
October 25?
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> I hope I interpret it the same way as 
everyone else in this House. I came to pave the way for Quebec 
sovereignty, to explain to all Canadians what we are doing here 
and what we will be doing afterward. We did not come here to 
destroy Canada, we came to rebuild it differently by going our 
own way and making it better, because there really are two 
countries in Canada. We have to shed our blinkers and face the 
facts. We have two countries. We say: ``Let us leave. Let us try 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="220"> 220 </A></B>
<P>
to negotiate something which would allow our two countries to 
live side by side and everything will be better for Canada''.
<P>
	I have just remembered the hon. member's question. He wants 
to know why the anglophones are leaving Quebec. They are 
leaving because they are scared. It is just fear, because there are 
English speaking Canadians of other origins coming to Quebec. 
Even Americans come to Quebec, because life is good there. The 
food is good, accommodation is good. People who are scared 
leave Quebec, those who like a challenge are coming in.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will recognize the parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleagues on having been elected to 
the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Congratulations to all my colleagues. At the same time I want 
to thank my constituents for giving me the honour of 
representing them in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I thank my constituents for having given me the opportunity 
to return.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My speech has three parts. Part one will be about government 
that takes an active role. Part two will concentrate on the 
priorities in the throne speech, and finally part three, the 
conclusion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government has been extremely busy undertaking a 
number of actions, actions that are good for Canadians, actions 
that are in fact part of its electoral program. Let me mention a 
few.
<P>
	The government has downsized cabinet; it is one of the 
smallest ever in the history of Canada. It has cancelled the 
controversial EH-101 helicopter contract. It has as well stopped 
a bad deal to privatize terminals one and two at Pearson 
International Airport. It is pushing ahead with its $6 billion 
national infrastructure program. It has replaced the Governor of 
the Bank of Canada. It has passed NAFTA and finalized the 
terms of the new GATT. It has announced a plan for the review of 
defence policy. It has sent a clear signal on the need for integrity 
and frugality in government and it is opening the books to reveal 
government finances. Those are a number of actions the 
government has already taken.
<P>
	As parliamentary secretary I have had the good fortune to 
make a number of announcements in my own riding that respond 
to the need to create jobs in Canada. It so happened because I 
was from the city of Winnipeg in the province of Manitoba that I 
was given this task.
<P>
	For example, Peerless Garments Limited received two 
contracts totalling $541,000 for newly designed materials for 
National Defence to protect Canadian forces personnel from 
cold and wet weather. This will create four jobs and maintain up 
to 30 employees in Peerless Garments Limited.
<P>
	Another announcement involved Century 21st Apparels 
Limited that won a $526,000 contract supplying National 
Defence with parkas and trousers for wet weather. This will 
create up to 20 jobs and maintain 45 more jobs at this particular 
company.
<P>
	A third announcement involved Standard Aero Limited that 
won a $725,000 contract for repairing and overhauling aircraft 
cooling materials. It will maintain six jobs at this particular 
company.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of announcements that Canadians want to 
hear. Those are the kinds of announcements that create jobs and 
maintain jobs, that make sure our fellow Canadians are working 
or going back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I also had the privilege of announcing a grant of $261,000 in 
my own riding for maintaining a six-room residence to provide 
temporary shelter for victims of family violence.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	It is too bad that in today's society, we need establishments 
like these, but unfortunately, we do. I was glad to make this 
announcement, which responds to a real need in our society.
<P>
	I will now discuss the highlights of the throne speech. First, I 
would like to deal with job creation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
Job creation which during the election was our major priority 
continues to be our major priority.
<P>
	Most members will have heard about the infrastructure 
program that is going forward rapidly. That is an immediate 
response to Canadians who have been unable to work. Then 
there will be the response to small and medium sized businesses 
which are those enterprises that have created 85 per cent of the 
new jobs in Canada during the last decade. They will have more 
access to capital. There will be less red tape. There will in fact 
be research and development which will permit them to grow, 
create and simply make sure there are more jobs in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now, I would like to speak about integrity or ethics, if you 
prefer, in public life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="221"> 221 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Prime Minister has indicated that integrity in government 
is absolutely essential and in that vein he has cancelled the 
Pearson airport deal which was a very bad deal for Canadians. 
He has cut political staff for a saving of $10 million annually and 
he has outlined cuts to MPs' perks and benefits of over $5 
million annually. There will be a review of MPs' pensions and 
there will be additional reductions and changes to that which is 
happening in this government in this Parliament because the 
Prime Minister and his government believe that integrity in 
government is an absolute necessity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There were also references in the throne speech to economic 
recovery.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have talked about changing Canada's social security 
system within two years so that it responds to more needs more 
effectively, replacing the goods and services tax, ending foreign 
overfishing and making sure that we have an elimination of 
internal trade barriers.
<P>
	Finally, there is perhaps a fourth major point. We have talked 
about strengthening the fabric of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
About strengthening the social fabric in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will proclaim the Canadian environmental assessment act. 
The Prime Minister will himself chair a national forum on health 
to foster a public dialogue on health care. We will introduce 
measures to enhance community safety, especially the safety of 
women and children, and we will move to implement the 
inherent right of aboriginal self-government. We will consult 
widely with Canadians as we conduct major reviews of foreign 
and defence policy.
<P>
	As I indicated initially, this is a government of action. This is 
a government that said during the election campaign that it 
would do things and this is a government that has reiterated a 
number of those particular points in the Speech from the Throne.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like more or less to summarize the throne speech 
which reflects our determination to keep our campaign 
promises. To me, this is absolutely essential. Economic 
recovery and job creation are the main priorities of this 
government and of all Canadians.
<P>
	We will meet the commitments made in our campaign 
program, the little red book which is becoming increasingly 
popular. The government's priorities are clearly identified, both 
in this little red book and in the throne speech.
<P>
	And finally, the Minister of Finance will put figures to the 
measures announced in the throne speech in his February 
budget. The budget will contain measures designed to control 
the debt and the deficit while turning around the unemployment 
situation.
<P>
	There are two final comments I would like to make. The 
throne speech contains one paragraph which to me is very 
important, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our cultural heritage and our official languages are at the very core of 
Canadian identity and our sources of social and economic enrichment. The 
government will announce measures to promote Canada's cultural identity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Is this throne speech perfect? Of course not. But I think it 
gives us a chance, if we are willing, to work together to create, to 
build, and to improve what we already have. On many occasions 
I have heard members of all political parties make comments 
such as that this is an excellent country. We live well. We eat 
well. We have fun. So when we like something this much, 
something that may be the best of its kind in the whole world, 
why are we looking for radical solutions? To me, this is the best 
country in the world, and I want to ask my colleagues to help 
make it even better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just heard 
the hon. member make some very interesting comments about 
job creation. But I also read this morning that the Minister of 
Finance said he would cut expenditures by twice the amount of 
any hike in taxes. We know Canadians, Quebecers and others 
alike, are taxed enough as it is. We also know that if we reduce 
expenses we will take away the income of many who will end up 
on unemployment. How can the member not see the 
contradiction between what his minister said and what he just 
told us?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
questions. Naturally, before we get the details, we will have to 
wait for the February budget. But I see no contradiction. If we 
examine all the reports received to date we see that the Minister 
of Finance is trying to establish a larger taxation base because 
we are short some $46 billion. It is very normal therefore to try 
to find taxes in areas that were not taxed or not sufficiently taxed 
before.
<P>
	I do not think cutting certain expenses will necessarily have 
adverse effects on jobs. It depends on where we make the cuts. 
Remember that here, in the House of Commons, our program is 
based on two fundamental principles, on two very important 
programs, the first being the infrastructure program which has 
already been launched and budgeted. That measure has been 
implemented and it will immediately create jobs for people.
<P>
	As far as long term development is concerned, we talked 
about replacing the GST, about ensuring better access to capital 
for small businesses, since they were responsible for creating 85 
per cent of new jobs over the  last 10 years, and about giving 
them additional help for training and updating skills, more help 
for research and less forms to fill. All that is very normal. I see 
no contradiction there. I think the Minister of Finance is trying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="222"> 222 </A></B>
<P>
to strike a balance between deficit and debt reduction and job 
creation. I admit this is quite a challenge, but I am very willing 
to wait until February for the details.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member for St. Boniface on his remarks.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I will also take this opportunity to greet all the French 
speaking Manitobans living in his riding. He just described the 
state of the Canadian economy and we are all in agreement with 
what he said.
<P>
	One thing is certain now, everyone in Canada knows what is 
going on. People understand the difficult situation we are in. 
They are now expecting action. Making a diagnosis is not 
enough, the government was brought to office to take concrete 
and positive steps to stimulate the economy.
<P>
	The member also mentioned French speaking Canadians 
across Canada. Mr. Speaker, I think I should point out that 
francophones outside Quebec have always relied on the 
Canadian government for services whereas for us, in Quebec, 
our motherland, our government has always been primarily the 
government of Quebec, and that is a big difference.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, to conclude, I would like to ask the member, in 
his capacity as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Public 
Works, what his government intends to do, apart from the 
tripartite program, to create stable and long lasting 
employment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I want to thank my hon. colleague for his 
comment and question. First off, it is a fact that the nearly one 
million men, women and children who make up the francophone 
minority outside Quebec have relied to some degree, and at 
times considerably, on the federal government to help them 
establish certain institutions.
<P>
	One fact that is sometimes forgotten is that this minority has 
often looked to Quebec, an important reference point, for the 
necessary resources to grow and develop.
<P>
	Moreover, it should also be remembered that we have long 
relied on our own resources and waged our own fight to preserve 
our language and culture which we hold so dear.
<P>
	Regarding long-term stable jobs, as my hon. colleagues in 
this House know, the program which we are putting forward to 
encourage in some ways small and medium sized businesses 
will create this kind of well-paid, sustainable employment. Our 
long-term plan is to reduce government red tape, to ensure that 
taxes-
<P>
	I see the Speaker is signalling to me that my time is up, so I 
will conclude on this note.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me to 
add my words of congratulations to the many you have received 
since your appointment as Deputy Speaker.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate the hon. members for Bruce-Grey 
and Madawaska-Victoria for their eloquence in moving and 
seconding the Speech from the Throne.
<P>
	I am pleased to have in common with all members of this 
House the responsibilities of this office. There has been much 
talk of the need for greater civility here. I believe that members 
of all parties can help give this place a more productive and 
positive atmosphere.
<P>
	Allow me to thank the voters of Halifax West once again for 
giving me and this government something very precious and that 
is their trust and confidence.
<P>
	It is with a great sense of pride and humility that I stand in this 
House to speak on behalf of the people of Halifax West. I am 
here to serve them and give voice to their concerns but I 
recognize that I am also here to serve the best interests of 
Canada.
<P>
	It is also with a sense of history and responsibility that I stand 
in this House where my father and grandfather stood before me. 
I note from <I>Hansard</I> that when my grandfather, Jack Harrison, 
made his maiden speech in this House some 44 years ago the one 
member to intervene during his speech was Mr. Stanley 
Knowles. What a remarkable pleasure it has been to see him here 
sitting in front of me these last few days.
<P>
	I have great respect for the best traditions of this House. At 
the same time we are all aware of the need for change and the 
urgent need to restore hope and confidence to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am encouraged by the changes to the rules of the House 
announced in the Speech from the Throne. I detect a fresh, new 
attitude in this place and it augurs well for Canada.
<P>
	With nearly 93,000 voters, Halifax West is the biggest riding 
in Atlantic Canada, the fastest growing one and perhaps the most 
diversified as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It has urban, suburban and rural components. It includes a 
large part of the city of Halifax along the hills from Fairmont 
and Fairview to Clayton Park and Wedgewood. It includes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="223"> 223 </A></B>
<P>
bedroom communities like the town of Bedford, the Timberlea 
area and Sackville, the third largest community in Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Halifax West also contains a long list of smaller communities 
from the hamlets of Goffs and Oldham in the northeast to the 
fishing villages like Terrance Bay and the picturesque Peggy's 
Cove in the south and the glorious beaches of Queensland and 
Hubbards in the west.
<P>
	Throughout my years of growing up, working and 
volunteering in Halifax West I have seen the challenges facing 
its people. As we all know Canadians face many challenges. We 
face challenges like unemployment. We see friends desperately 
trying to find work. We see neighbours in danger of losing their 
homes, their hopes and their dreams. We face the challenges of 
cleaning up our environment. We see our lakes and rivers dying 
from acid rain and other pollution.
<P>
	We smell our landfills overflowing. We have witnessed the 
ravaging of our ocean resource. We see other challenges. We see 
the poverty of single mothers and their children. We see women 
bruised and battered. We see families destroyed by drugs and 
alcohol.
<P>
	At the same time as we face these and other challenges we are 
confronted by a national debt of over $500 billion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These are but a few of the enormous problems we are facing. 
No government could solve them all, and none could do it 
overnight.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I do not have all the answers, but I look 
forward to working with all my colleagues to find them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last summer and fall I visited over 12,000 households in 
Halifax West. As I did, I heard the concerns of many people. I 
want to mention today a number of issues they have brought to 
my attention.
<P>
	Transportation is a constant concern. Overcrowded and 
inadequate highways and access roads are a safety problem and 
a hindrance to business. Many communities in Halifax West 
have sewer and water systems that are inadequate or in need of 
upgrading. They pose a real threat to health and the 
environment.
<P>
	In light of these concerns I am pleased the government has 
moved so swiftly to complete the Canada-Nova Scotia 
infrastructure agreement that was signed January 14 in Halifax. 
I am confident the private sector will play a role and will 
respond to the call to play a role in this national program. I am 
encouraged that this job creation program allows local 
governments to set the priorities.
<P>
	Unemployment is a major problem throughout Atlantic 
Canada. There are those in Halifax West who live in very 
difficult conditions. After seven years of involvement in food 
banks I feel a particular obligation to those in our society who 
are hurting. These people want to move away from dependency 
to become full participants in society. They want to work.
<P>
	I look forward to the coming review of our social programs 
with the hope that we can make them fairer, simpler and 
stronger.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am happy about the reintroduction of the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program because it will allow many 
seniors to stay in their own homes. I also find it is a good idea for 
the government to focus on small and medium sized businesses 
in its long-term job creation plan.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a past president of the Bedford Board of Trade I am 
familiar with the frustrations of the small business sector. By 
cutting red tape and improving access to capital we can give 
small business a better shot at success. No other segment of our 
economy has the same potential for creating jobs.
<P>
	I spoke a moment ago about transportation. The Halifax 
International Airport is located in my riding and many residents 
are employed either at the airport, in the nearby aerotech park or 
in the airline industry. In light of the current airline industry 
crisis in Canada these airline workers in particular are very 
concerned about their future. They are looking to the 
government to help stop the feuding. I wish the Minister of 
Transport every success in this regard. I offer my support and 
assistance to him.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	Then there is the railway. The maintenance of an efficient and 
competitive rail link to the Atlantic provinces and the port of 
Halifax is a crucial economic issue for Halifax West and the 
entire region.
<P>
	Halifax has a long and proud history as the east coast home of 
our navy. I look forward to the coming review of foreign policy 
and defence policy. I am confident it will highlight the need for a 
strong, effective and flexible naval force for peacekeeping, drug 
interdiction and resource preservation. There is no more 
pressing problem in Atlantic Canada than the collapse of the 
groundfishery which has caused the largest layoff in Canadian 
history.
<P>
	The vast majority of my constituents are not directly involved 
in the fishery but they know the importance of the fishery to the 
entire Atlantic economy. I welcome the government's pledge to 
assist those affected to become self-supporting. I stand with all 
members from Atlantic Canada in my concern for this vital 
sector.
<P>
	Canadians will take hope from the speech from the throne. It 
demonstrates that this government is keeping  its promises. The 
<P>

<B><A NAME="224"> 224 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Minister and cabinet have been true to their words in 
cutting $10 million from their staff budgets. I am pleased that 
we in the House will help save another $5 million.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 30(5) the House will now proceed to statements 
by members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on November 26, 1993 a serious rock burst occurred at 
the Maccassa mine in Kirkland Lake, trapping two miners 
underground and injuring many others. To this date recovery 
efforts have not been successful and the two miners are still 
missing. With each passing day chances of finding these two 
men alive become less and less likely.
<P>
	Such tragedies are unfortunately a common occurrence in our 
mining communities. I would like the families of these two 
miners and the communities of Kirkland Lake, Larder Lake, 
Virginiatown and Matachewan to know that our thoughts and 
prayers are with them.
<P>
	This government is committed to participate in further studies 
on how to prevent and anticipate these rock burst occurrences 
which are the major cause of mining fatalities.

	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Greater 
Montreal area is the economic heartland of Quebec. There you 
find the greatest concentrations of industries and jobs. Eighty 
per cent of the province's R and D activity is conducted in the 
Montreal area.
<P>
	But for decades now, the federal government has been 
neglecting the funding of research and development in Quebec, 
with the result that Quebec's economy has suffered.
<P>
	In my capacity as a member from the greater Montreal area, I 
want this House to know that I will continue to keep a watchful 
eye on this because Montreal should be getting its fair share of 
federal R and D funds for employment and equity.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to commend Senator Douglas Everett of Manitoba who has 
announced that he will be resigning his seat in the upper House.
<P>
	Senator Everett conducted himself in such a way as to 
enhance the credibility of that institution. He favoured freer 
votes in the Senate and chose to sit as an independent Liberal 
when he found himself at variance with the Liberal Party on the 
issue of free trade. When he dissented from the tactics used by 
the Liberals in the Senate in the GST debate he crossed the floor 
to sit as a fully independent senator.
<P>
	In his resignation speech, Senator Everett's last advice to the 
government was that the upper chamber should be elected like 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	I pay tribute to Senator Everett today and recommend that the 
government heed his advice for restoring public trust and 
confidence in the upper chamber.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to express my 
appreciation and that of my hon. colleagues in the House for the 
opportunity last Thursday to attend a special screening of the 
film ``Schindler's List''.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	Many hon. members and senators along with staff members 
took advantage of the kind invitation of the hon. member for 
Ontario. In his welcoming remarks he warned us that 
``Schindler's List'' is a powerful film which makes explicit the 
facts of the holocaust and the lessons to be learned from it.
<P>
	As we prepare for a special debate on peacekeeping in Bosnia 
it is appropriate that we reflect on the genocide, violence and 
inhumanity of the holocaust. Similar evils seem rampant in 
Bosnia.
<P>
	In conclusion I again thank the hon. member for Ontario for 
his timely initiative.

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
under section 745 of the Criminal Code many murderers of 
police officers and prison guards are coming up for review of 
their eligibility date for parole. Such individuals are serving life 
sentences with no eligibility for parole for 25 years. The review 
proceedings could allow this 25-year period to be reduced to 15 
years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="225"> 225 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask that all members join together to review this condition to 
determine whether this procedure should be available to 
murderers of police officers and prison guards or whether it 
should be eliminated completely as soon as practically possible, 
thereby making murderers of police and prison guards serve at 
least a minimum of 25 years.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec is the 
third largest producer of aluminum, with 10 per cent of world 
capacity.
<P>
	The workers employed by the four aluminum plants located in 
the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region account to close to 30 
percent of the direct manufacturing labour force in the region. 
This industry is going through a crisis caused by the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, which is dumping 
massive quantities of aluminum on the international markets 
and making world prices tumble.
<P>
	Aluminum-producing countries have tried without success to 
convince Russia to reduce its production. The United States 
wants to protect itself by imposing anti-dumping duties on all 
foreign producers including Quebec. That would only aggravate 
the crisis hurting Quebec aluminum workers. Canada must act 
immediately to persuade Russia to limit its exports and also to 
prevent the United States from imposing anti-dumping duties 
on aluminum from Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my riding and indeed the whole country have many residents 
who choose to own and use for competitive or recreational 
purposes legally owned firearms. Competitive shooting is in 
fact an Olympic competition that has won many medals for 
Canada.
<P>
	The previous government passed legislation that severely 
restricted the legitimate use of firearms without addressing the 
criminal use of them. The Liberal government has indicated its 
intention to introduce new firearms legislation.
<P>
	If it is the government's intention to deal seriously with 
prevention of illegal activities I would hope its legislation is 
straightforward and realistic. Legitimate owners stand ready to 
assist the government in any way possible.
<P>
	If on the other hand it is the government's plan to pass 
regulations intent on forcing these legitimate owners to give up 
their legal property in frustration, I hope the government will at 
least be honest enough to state that its real intention is to take 
firearms away from all citizens of this country.
<P>
	Legitimate owners would like compassionate legislation, but 
above all else they demand honesty from their government.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to make colleagues in the House of Commons 
aware of a serious situation developing with student loans.
<P>
	The former Tory government abolished the initial six months 
of free interest on student loans.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Many Canadian graduates now find themselves without jobs, 
without money and with student loans of $30,000 or more. How 
can we ask these young people to pay back their loans right away 
when they are unemployed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Jobless graduates have become discouraged, even desperate. I 
urge my colleagues to support youth employment programs and 
a fair repayment plan of student loans.

this opportunity to be the first female MP from Newfoundland

<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	On October 25, 1993 the people of both St. John's ridings had 
the wisdom to elect me and my friend from St. John's West as the 
first women to represent our fair province in this honourable 
House.
<P>
	The issues brought to my attention by my fellow 
Newfoundlanders during the campaign are clear. 
Unemployment is dangerously high. Our young people are 
beginning to lose hope and many families are finding it all but 
impossible to cover their basic needs.
<P>
	However Newfoundlanders are at their best when times are 
the hardest. We continue to have the lowest level of income in 
the country but we give to our charities the most. This is the type 
of character that makes me proud to represent the people of St. 
John's East. I would like to thank the voters who have put their 
trust in me, in the Prime Minister and in this government team to 
address the issues of their concerns.

you my personal congratulations and those of my constituents of 
London West.
<P>
	There are many challenges facing this government, but one 
which we must address quickly is the 17.2 per cent level of youth 
unemployment. Approximately 355,000 young people remain 
unemployed in Canada. These youth have become innocent 
victims after years of economic hardship. With them we will 
work toward forging a new economy founded on information 
and knowledge based industries.
<P>
	I am confident that in its promised priority for job creation 
this government will assist in a productive school to work 
transition and work co-operatively with business, labour and 
other levels of government to achieve our objectives.
<P>
	I ask all members of the House to strongly endorse measures 
including the establishment of the Canadian youth services 
corps and the formation of new apprenticeship programs. We 
must support our human resource of young talent and energy as 
we head into the 21st century.

amazed at the lack of interest shown by the federal government 
and its lack of co-operation in helping the provinces stop the 
illegal sale of cigarettes once and for all.
<P>
	Despite its promises to take action right after the election, the 
Liberal government is dragging its feet on the increasingly 
serious problem of smuggling. Instead of helping provincial 
governments to tackle the problem, it is passing the buck.
<P>
	This government is not doing any better than the previous 
Conservative government that was rejected by the population. It 
is in this government's interest to help solve the problem instead 
of aggravating it.

emigrated from New Zealand where the government of the time 
was immersed in a policy of tax and spend with overgenerous 
social programs and widespread reliance on welfare.
<P>
	In 1984, as many members will be aware from the ``W5'' 
television program, New Zealand experienced a debt crisis. The 
tough decisions that should have been made by the politicians 
turned into drastic decisions when New Zealand could no longer 
deficit fund its spending.
<P>
	Unless all members of the House learn from the experiences 
in countries like New Zealand, Denmark and Sweden which 
have all experienced debt crisis in the last 10 years, Canada too 
will soon be on the brink of a debt crisis.
<P>
	The new free enterprise, unsubsidized, minimally regulated 
economy of New Zealand today is proof that there is a great 
reward for gaining control of government spending.

its commitment to job creation.
<P>
	Federal and provincial colleagues assembled in Toronto this 
morning to sign the Canada-Ontario infrastructure works 
agreement. This undertaking paves the way for Ontario 
residents to benefit from more than $720 million of federal 
funding to be matched by provincial and local authorities to 
build and upgrade our infrastructure services.
<P>

<P>
	As a result of this initiative jobs will be created immediately. 
Roads, sewers, water mains and other services will be improved. 
It will enhance our economic growth and create jobs today and 
well into the future.

coast of P.E.I. some 23 years ago. It remains there today, with 
3,100 tonnes of bunker sea oil in its tanks. Federal officials have 
tried for years to assure Islanders that the barge does not pose an 
environmental risk, however after 23 years few Islanders share 
that confidence. This is increasingly evident in recent weeks.
<P>
	It has been reported that the Canadian Coast Guard has 
recommended the oil be pumped out. I am pleased the Minister 
of the Environment agrees that it is not a question of whether or

not to remove the oil but is a matter of finding the financing and

prepared to take a new direction and to listen to all Canadians.
<P>
	Recently the hon. member for Willowdale voiced surprised at 
the tighten the belt attitude that has dominated pre-budget 
meetings, but I ask if one has predetermined the results by the 
invitation list and by virtually ignoring all presenters who 
present an alternative view, should one really express surprise at 
the result?
<P>
	I urge the minister and I urge the government to ensure that 
these pre-budget consultations, unlike the ones of the previous 
government, show new direction that all Canadians are listened 
to and that we have a budget which reflects the needs of every 
Canadian, not just simply one group.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The shopkeepers' revolt against smuggling is growing in 
Quebec, with the regrettable decision of store owners in the 
Saint-Eustache region to sell cigarette cartons for $20 today in 
order to fight the unfair competition from professional 
smugglers.
<P>
	In a statement he made yesterday in Granby in reaction to this 
revolt, Premier Johnson of Quebec made the following urgent 
appeal to the federal government: ``The plan to sell cigarettes 
without collecting taxes should first of all bring a reaction from 
the federal police''.
<P>
	Given this appeal from the Premier of Quebec, asking him to 
assume his responsibilities and enforce the law, what is the 
Prime Minister of Canada waiting for to order the RCMP to 
dismantle the smuggling rings?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is a serious situation and I wish to assure my hon. colleague 
that the RCMP is prepared to lay charges where the evidence 
shows that federal law has been broken.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. Given this vague 
answer, which is only a statement of intentions that have never 
been carried out so far, does the Prime Minister not realize that 
all this is reinforcing everyone's impression that the 
Government of Canada and the Prime Minister have in effect 
ordered the RCMP to turn a blind eye on smuggling?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> As the 
Solicitor General indicated, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
have received orders to make all citizens of this country obey the 
law.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, do the government and the Prime Minister not 
recognize that there is something extremely unhealthy for the 
citizens of a democracy and a society based on law to see the 
state come down harder on small shopkeepers who are the 
victims of smuggling than on the real smugglers, the 
professional traffickers, who for many years have been acting 
with complete immunity, in broad daylight and on a very large 
scale, thus depriving the federal and provincial governments of 
huge amounts of money?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have nothing to add except to say that of course the federal 
government and the governments of Quebec and the other 
provinces must act to enforce the law. That is what the Solicitor 
General instructed the RCMP to do and I hope that the provincial 
governments will give the same instructions to their police 
authorities.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. In the 
Throne Speech last week, the government announced its 
intention to monitor the behaviour of ministers and members. 
We just heard that the Liberal member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville was fired in 1989 from his 
teaching position, after he sent a series of 17 threatening letters 
to his colleagues, the last one containing death threats-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. We had several questions on the subject 
last Friday, and today the hon. member in question made a 
speech in the House. Perhaps the hon. member would care to 
rephrase his question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was just getting to my question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="228"> 228 </A></B>
<P>
	How could the hon. member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville run for the Liberal Party, 
if the party executive was aware he had been fired because of 
these death threats?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think I have anything to add to the statement by the hon. 
member for Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville who 
apologized before the House this morning. We have a tradition 
in the House that applies when no criminal charges were laid.
<P>
	I remember when I was a member here, one of the members 
rose in the House and admitted that in the past, he had served a 
prison sentence, but since that time he had been a member in 
good standing of his community. After this admission he was 
given a standing ovation by the House, because he had become a 
very good citizen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I realize apologies were made this morning, but 
according to House security regulations, any person who had 
made such statements, whether or not he apologized, would be 
prohibited from entering Parliament Hill.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. This is not a matter for the government 
to deal with, and I think it is rather difficult to answer the 
question because it is not up to the government to take action in 
this respect. Perhaps the question could be rephrased somewhat?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> This was my preamble, Mr. Speaker. How does 
the Prime Minister intend to deal with the case of the hon. 
member for Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the members of this House have their private lives like anybody 
else. There are members who in the past faced criminal charges 
and sat as members until their problems were resolved before 
the courts.
<P>
	In the case of the hon. member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, no charges were laid 
before any court whatsoever. There was no judgment. The hon. 
member in question apologized to Canadians, and in this House, 
it is the rule that when a member apologizes for making a 
mistake, those apologies are accepted.
<P>
	If every member in this House who made a mistake in the past 
were obliged to leave the House, there might not be many 
members left who would not have to rise in the House and say: I 
made a mistake at some point in my life.
<P>
	The hon. member admitted he made a foolish mistake, and he 
apologized. I think the Standing Orders of this House indicate 
that one accepts the apologies of a member of this House.

have a question for the Prime Minister.

	As he knows, Senator Everett from Manitoba, after providing 
many years of independent-minded service in the upper House 
has resigned his seat and called for an election of future 
senators.
<P>

<P>

that if their legislature were to pass legislation providing for the 
election of a Senate nominee that he would appoint the winner of 
such an election to the upper chamber?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Canadian Constitution makes provision for the appointment 
of senators. We will amend this procedure when all of the 
provinces agree to an elected Senate. We cannot have some 
elected senators and some appointed senators. We have to 
amend the Constitution, but it is clear that the members of this 
House are not willing to do so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not intend to change the Constitution at this moment. We 
will respect the Constitution. It is the basic law of the land. It is 
the way the Constitution is written. I will respect the 
Constitution until it is changed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister well knows that Senate nominees can be 
elected without any constitutional change. Almost three months 
ago the Prime Minister received a letter dated October 28 from 
Premier Klein of Alberta touching on this same subject.
<P>
	He sought assurance from the Prime Minister that if a Senate 
vacancy were to arise in Alberta and a Senate nominee were to 
be elected in accordance with the provisions of the existing 
statute, the Alberta Senate Selection Act, that he would appoint 
the winner of that election to the upper chamber.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister now give the premier of Alberta that 
simple assurance?

do that which was in the Charlottetown accord?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister well knows that the objections of the 
Reform Party and other members to the Charlottetown accord 
and its provisions for Senate reform were not objections to 
election to the Senate but to an ineffective Senate which that 
provided.
<P>
	In the Speech from the Throne the Prime Minister made a 
commitment to restoring integrity and public trust in the 
institutions of government and enhancing the credibility of 
Parliament.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is not prepared to trust the judgment of 
the public in the selection of senators by what means other than 
by changing the Constitution does he propose to restore public 
trust in that institution and to enhance its credibility?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the best way to gain the trust of the Canadian people is very 
simple.
<P>
	It is not to vote against a constitutional proposition to have 
senators elected and then, on the first occasion the leader has a 
chance in this House of Commons, ask to do what he voted 
against only 12 or 15 months ago.

concerns the responsibility of the government to stop the 
horrible smuggling of firearms between the United States and 
Canada.
<P>
	I will put my question to the Prime Minister once again, as he 
is supposed to be responsible for his government. When does he 
intend to act to put an end to the smuggling which has led to a 
number of incidents and, instead of calling an emergency debate 
to discuss cruise missiles, would he agree to a debate on the 
Kanesatake problem?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Canadian army acted properly in this matter. There was some 
concern about loss of life. They flew over the area and landed as 
they had the right to. Therefore, there was no incident.
<P>
	Some people claimed to have fired some shots, but there is no 
evidence that this in fact occurred. The army landed-

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	This past weekend the minister met with several prominent 
economists, business people and ordinary Canadians to discuss 
the issue of deficit reduction. The vast majority of participants 
believe that the key to deficit reduction is through spending 
reductions rather than tax increases. Yet the government 
continues to float ideas about increasing tax revenues by 
limiting RRSP contributions.
<P>
	My question for the minister is this. Will he treat the deficit 
problem as a spending problem and immediately set targets to 
reduce and limit spending or does the minister regard this as a 
revenue problem? Will he then tell the Canadian public what his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="230"> 230 </A></B>
<P>
real plans are to increase their taxes and how much this will cost 
individual Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would appear that the 
member objects to a discussion of ideas in this pre-budget 
period. I find that quite surprising because I have found that 
these consultations have worked very well.
<P>
	The bulk of the discussions have in fact been directed toward 
numerous approaches to reduction in the deficit, certainly 
cutting spending, conceivably increasing government revenues 
and most clearly by creating jobs. That is certainly the way we in 
this government look at the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week and 
again just now the Minister of Finance refused to tell this House 
that there would be no increase in taxation. Canadians therefore 
have no choice but to believe that taxes will be increased in this 
upcoming budget.
<P>
	Will the minister tell the House today whether he plans to 
raise tax revenues by changing the income tax regulations 
regarding RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member's question 
referring to my refusal to divulge the budget now indicates 
perhaps that he is new to this House. The Minister of Finance 
reveals the budget when he reveals the budget and not ahead of

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
All of Quebec, beginning with their Premier, is scandalized by 
the federal government's refusal to begin negotiations on job 
training before reform of the income security system has been 
completed. In Quebec, industry, labour and government came to 
an agreement a long time ago and put the Quebec labour force 
development agency in charge of managing training, using the 
same model as the one found in the Liberal Party's red book.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Here is my question: would the Minister of Human Resources 
Development not agree that, all things considered, nothing 
serious is stopping them from making a deal right away with 
Quebec on job training?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I met with Mr. Bourbeau from 
the Government of Quebec before Christmas to discuss this 
issue.
<P>
	We talked about training issues as well as more general 
aspects relating to reform. I am also hoping to meet with his 
successor, Mr. Marcil, next week to discuss this and any other 
subject Mr. Marcil and Mr. Johnson may want to bring up.
<P>
	I will gladly report to the House the outcome of that meeting, 
but for the time being, no decision has been made and we are still 
discussing with the Government of Quebec as well as with all 
other governments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is the 
problem. Nothing has been decided. A decision must urgently be 
made because we have an emergency in Quebec, where 26,000 
people are waiting to get training and this may be their last 
chance.
<P>
	We have learned that for the first time in history, Quebec has 
won the poverty award. The Liberal Party ran on an employment 
platform, and when you have jobs for a slogan, you have no time 
to lose.
<P>
	My question is as follows: does the Minister not agree that the 
only explanation for such an unacceptable and costly delay is 
this government's resolve to impose a Canadian solution rather 
than the one suggested by Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, we share very much the concern 
about unemployment, so much so that the Canadian people gave 
us a very strong mandate last October to do something about it.
<P>
	That is the reason we said in the throne speech that we will be 
bringing in programs that will help young people get 
employment. We have a major program of apprenticeship 
training that will be announced and brought forward to this 
House very shortly.
<P>
	Most important, I think the hon. member would recognize as 
does a broad consensus of Canadians that we will never be able 
to effectively tackle the embedded structural problems of 
unemployment until we make some fundamental changes in the 
system.
<P>
	It is not working now. It is not working effectively. To do that 
we cannot simply fractionalize a program. We cannot take one 
piece out called training and give it away in perpetuity. We must 
look at the broad context.
<P>
	Fortunately at the first ministers meeting all the provincial 
governments including Quebec agreed that must be the priority 
for all Canadians and that is to make fundamental changes to our 
systems of employment training and our systems of social 
security so we can have a broad-based attack on the 
fundamental issues that concern Canadians.

	We had a statement this morning. Perhaps if the hon. member 
could rephrase her question it would be acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am trying to bring a

Prime Minister to respond please. I will bring a supplementary 
on this point at this moment if you wish.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think it is proper to continue to ask this question. There 
was a statement by the member in this House. There is a rule 
here that when a member explains it is his fault, it is not for the 
Liberal Party to decide if this gentleman should or should not be 
a member of the caucus.
<P>
	We decided that everybody can make a mistake. He has 
apologized. There was no charge laid against him, no 
foundation. I explained earlier in French that some members are 
sometimes subject to actions in court and they still keep their 
seats in the House of Commons or even in their caucus. It 
depends on the nature of the offences and in this case there was 
none.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	To reply to the specific question, I read it Friday morning in 
the <I>Toronto Sun</I>. However, I do not want to run away from my 
responsibilities. The party organization had been made aware of 
that after the candidate had been nominated. Since there was no 
criminal action they decided this was a man who had won the 
confidence of the party members in his riding. He had no record 
and he was acceptable.

last weekend in Montreal I attended a pre-budget conference 
that was a sham as it was clear that the participants, including 
former Liberal advisers and other advocates of the welfare state, 
had been carefuly selected by the Minister of Finance first to 
justify the need to slash social programs and second to attack 
RRSPs and the capital gains exemption on the first $100,000, 
which are the only measures benefiting the middle class 
smothered by excessive taxes.
<P>
	Not a word was said by either the finance minister or any of 
the participants about the real tax breaks enjoyed by the 
wealthiest.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Has he decided 
that, in addition to singling out the poorest, he would completely 
smother the middle class by attacking RRSPs and capital gains 
exemptions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was just saying, all 
the relevant details will be disclosed in the upcoming budget. 
Until then, I think it is really worth discussing what might be in 
this budget, because the process must be open.
<P>
	The hon. member was commenting about the conference 
participants, who were chosen by the Institute for Research on 
Public Policy and not by the government. That said, I saw Pierre 
Paquette of the CNTU, Henri Massé of the FTQ, Nancy 
Neamtam of RESO, Richard Langlois of the CEQ, as well as 
FRAPRU representatives. If the hon. member who was in 
attendance does not know them, I will happy to introduce him 
next time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> As usual, 
Mr. Speaker, this is a period for questions but not for answers.
<P>
	My supplementary question is this: Does the minister intend 
to eliminate the real tax breaks enjoyed by very wealthy 
Canadians such as family trusts and tax shelters available to big 
business or, as <I>Le Devoir</I> was reporting this morning, to bow 
down to the rich friends of the Liberal Party who contribute to

<P>

said that his party sticks together because it has all the right

<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Does this mean that the government does not intend to honour 
its promise to allow more free votes in the House?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
of course there will be more free votes. Tomorrow something 
will be done in this House that has not been done for a long time. 
Before the government makes a decision, every member of 
Parliament will be invited to express his or her views about the 
Bosnia situation. This will not be done after the fact as it was in 
the past but before so members will have input.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member appreciates the way we want to 
operate. We will have some free votes. Of course we want to do 
this, but it is probably also better to do what we are doing and 
give a chance to everybody before we decide. Members can 
speak on Bosnia and there will be no confidence vote on that. 
There will be the views expressed by the members before the

<P>
some of the speculation in the media about what may or may not

well-founded.
<P>
	I would assure him that to the extent the ongoing discussions 
with the United States bear upon questions that have to do with 
supply management, the Government of Canada is acutely 
aware of the interests of all Canadian producers in this subject, 
especially the interests of producers in the province of Quebec 
where supply management forms a very large part of the 
agricultural industry in that province. In whatever discussions 
we may have with the United States the interests of those 
producers will be front and centre in our thinking.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>

	When we are in a position to announce some conclusion to our 
discussions with the United States, members of the House will 
be the first to know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has yet to admit to the negotiations but it is not a well 
kept secret. Everyone is well aware of the details and the 
Minister of Agriculture is surely aware that yogurt and ice 
cream represent a substantial percentage of Canadian 
agricultural production.
<P>
	If these sectors are now sacrificed, is it not crystal clear to him 
as it is to everyone else in this country that we are asking 
Canadian farmers once again to pay the price for a global 
agreement in agriculture with the United States?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question. These discussions with the United States bearing on a 
number of agricultural commodities are presently ongoing. I am 
sure the hon. member will understand that I must for obvious 
reasons be rather guarded in what I say publicly.
<P>
	I do not think it is appropriate for us to bargain long distance 
and perhaps in that way do some things that would potentially 
impair the Canadian position. I hope the hon. member will 
understand the need for some confidentiality.
<P>
	I can say that ever since Canada unfortunately lost a GATT 
panel decision on its import quotas on ice cream and yogurt in 
1989, all of us with the interests of agriculture at heart-and I 
am sure that includes members on both sides of this 
House-who sincerely want the best for agriculture have been 
very aware that this particular issue, because of that previous 
GATT panel ruling, would have to be resolved in one manner or 
another at some future date with the United States as we go 
about attempting to arrive at a solution.
<P>
	Again I assure the hon. member and all farmers that the vital 
interests of Canadian agriculture in all parts of this country are 
very much on the top of the government's mind.

regarding retirement benefits:
<P>

Has the Prime Minister informed the comptroller of his decision

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as soon as the legislation is passed members who opt out will be

	The first step in developing a different approach to the serious 
problem in the fisheries is to talk to the people directly affected 
by the crisis. Both the minister of fisheries and myself have 
already held several meetings in the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Our first commitment would be to ensure that before any final 
decision is taken we have serious dialogue with the various 
groups in the Atlantic provinces directly affected by the 
moratorium on the fisheries. In saying that, we also want to hold 
true to the spirit of our campaign mandate, the red book, to use 
these programs to enable people to get back into the work force, 
to build a future for themselves, to have the dignity of work and 
not simply to have income security with a short-term end.

in Newfoundland, Atlantic Canada and Quebec is to once again

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary. By setting up such a committee, is the minister 
not weakening the commitment made by her own party during 
the last election campaign to make Montreal a major world 
centre for environmental technology?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that the 
hon. member shares my interest in this very cosmopolitan city 
and agrees that Montreal is truly an asset for all of Canada. This 
approach is very well received.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	We have also promised to distance ourselves from the 
previous government in that we want to implement a process 
which is open, transparent, public, and objective and one which 
can be subjected to scrutiny.
<P>
	I believe that Montrealers, like all Canadians, want a process 
free of politics, which is precisely what the federal government 
is providing.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. It comes from Mr. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="235"> 235 </A></B>
<P>
Raymond Watts of Surrey, British Columbia and has to do with 
the chronic inaccuracy of federal revenue estimates.
<P>
	Allow me to quote Mr. Watts. ``History shows that one of the 
first acts of any new government is to condemn the accounting 
practices of the previous government. This invariably leads to 
cries that the deficit is far worse than we thought it was''.
<P>
	Mr. Watts' question is: ``Will the government pass into law a 
standard system of accounts that requires the federal 
government to issue revenue budgeted forecasts and annual 
reports in a standard format?''
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair is having a little difficulty with 
questions posed by persons other than members of Parliament. 
Hon. members are able to put any questions they want in this 
House. It would probably be better to have it as their question as 
opposed to someone else's. I will permit the minister to answer 
the question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the 
concept, the philosophy behind the question is one that we on 
this side of the House, and I would think anybody interested in 
responsible administration, would share.
<P>
	It is for that reason that when we took power, what we did in 
terms of the government's numbers, the deficit estimates at that 
time, was to follow the recommendations of the public accounts 
committee and the Auditor General which had not been followed 
by the previous government and come out with a set of numbers 
based on generally accepted accounting principles.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
unfortunate that I cannot put questions directly from the people 
in my constituency. However if that is your ruling-
<P>
	On November 25, 1993 the Liberal government of Nova 
Scotia enacted a law which allows the Auditor General to review 
and report on the reasonableness of that government's revenue 
estimates. Would the government be supportive of such a law at 
the federal level?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is some merit in the 
suggestion and I am sure that we on this side of the House will 
look at it.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, that in line with the philosophy of 
the openness of Parliament and giving Parliament every chance 
what we really want to do is to make sure that the committees of 
Parliament have a very good shot, a far better shot than they ever 
had before, at looking at the estimates of the government.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion for an

<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my speech 
began at 1.52 p.m. and was closed off at two o'clock. I would 
like two additional minutes to conclude my remarks before we

ourselves or our country. I believe we are on the right path.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	What a thrill it is to be here to serve my country, Mr. Speaker, 
for I believe that politics is and must be about building a better 
Canada. In spite of all the challenges we face I still see Canada 
as a beacon to the world. I still see Canada as a country that 
shows the world how to live in peace and harmony. It is plain to 
see that right now the world needs the shining example that is 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the hon. member and I certainly have some comments 
and especially a few questions for him.
<P>
	I listened to the speech of the Minister of the Environment, 
but as I did not have the opportunity to ask her a question, I will 
ask it of the hon. member who dealt with the same issue, that is 
the conflict between the Environmental Quality Act passed a 
few years ago in Quebec and the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act passed a few months later. Because of the 
differences between the two acts, whenever an environmental 
assessment is required, we must make two, one for the Quebec 
government and one for Canada.
<P>
	Here is another example. The top executives of 
Hydro-Quebec, who want to go ahead with the Grande-Baleine 
project, realized that they cannot bring to the same table Quebec 
and federal officials when discussing the environmental 
assessments to be made. I would therefore like to ask the hon. 
member whether he could seek from the Minister of the 
Environment amendments to the act to make it more flexible, so 
that  environmental assessments could meet the needs of both 
acts, in order to help our companies to expand and go ahead 
faster with their projects? That way more jobs could be created 
in Quebec more rapidly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is obviously a question for the 
Minister of the Environment. I am not the minister but I am 
aware of many cases of provincial-federal overlap in 
legislation. There are many areas, for example, in Nova Scotia 
that we are concerned about. I am sure we would like to see 
legislation changed in both places. We know this government is 
committed to working with provincial governments to find ways 
to bring our systems together so that they work more reasonably 
and rationally and do not have the present overlap in legislation.
<P>
	If the hon. member wishes to ask the minister the question in 
question period tomorrow, she would be happy to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for Halifax West. I 
too grew up in Halifax West and went to Halifax Municipal High 
School. I have relatives all through that area.
<P>
	With regard to the infrastructure program, I would like to ask 
how much do you think the program will add to the economy of 
your area. Will it get people working-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. All questions should be directed 
through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I got 
my question across. I would like to find out how much 
employment the hon. member thinks this infrastructure program 
will actually add to long-term employment in Halifax West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had discussions with municipal 
and provincial representatives in my riding about this very 
question and about the things they feel are needed in the area, 
obviously not just for a short-term boost but to lay a long-term 
foundation for business to succeed in our area.
<P>
	It is my view that some of the projects I would like to see 
come forward in Halifax West would respond to that need and 
help business be more successful. For example, there are a 
couple of business parks that do not have adequate access to 
highways. If they had that access they could be much more 
successful because transportation needs for any business are 
absolutely essential.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
If trucks on the road are going over potholes all the time or if 
they cannot get access to highways quickly, that is a cost they 
are paying.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="237"> 237 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, one should be looking for ways to minimize those 
costs and improve the ability of business to do business. That is 
what I am looking for in these programs. I will try to push 
forward the things that will help my area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in my reply to the speech from the throne to first of all 
congratulate you for being elected as Speaker of this House. 
Second, I would like to congratulate the right hon. Jean Chrétien 
as Canada's 21st Prime Minister.
<P>
	My special thanks go to the people of Okanagan Centre who 
elected me. I consider it a real honour to be able to represent 
them. I will do the best I can to honour the trust they have placed 
in me.
<P>
	The primary question facing this Parliament is how do we get 
the Canadian economy going again? I will address that question 
from three perspectives: first, by recognizing the need for 
innovation; second, the acceptance of research and development 
as an engine of economic growth; and finally, to begin the 
answer to the question, how can we get that job done?
<P>
	This Parliament can be Canada's defining moment of the 20th 
century. As members of this Parliament, we have the 
opportunity to raise Canada's social and economic aspirations to 
higher levels of individual social responsibility and 
accountability.
<P>
	To do so the government must establish an environment in 
which the wild government spending of the past is tamed and 
brought under control. If the government fails to bring its 
spending under control, it will also fail to motivate individual 
Canadians to act responsibly and be willing to be held to 
account.
<P>
	As a society we are in danger of falling into a kind of cultural 
tyranny in which minds uninformed by traditions and standards 
are easy to shape by whoever is driven by a strong ideology. 
They may not be sympathetic to unity, honesty, integrity and 
fiscal responsibility. Those were the values that made Canada 
great.
<P>
	To become more specific, in order for Canada to stimulate 
new momentum in the economy, some fundamental changes 
must be made in organizing our economic pursuits.
<P>
	First of all, we need to understand that we have a new 
economy in which huge profits are no longer possible simply by 
making and moving things. The main producers of wealth and 
economic production have become information and knowledge, 
specifically biotechnology, artificial intelligence, the business 
of space and the creation of new materials, including ceramic 
composites and combinations of metals or plastics with fibres.
<P>
	Second, we must note the accelerating development of 
knowledge and its application in various sectors of the economy. 
We need to realize that Canada's electronic industry is bigger 
than its pulp and paper industry, that the computer services 
industry employs more people  than the auto industry and that 
more people in B.C. work in communications and 
telecommunications than in forestry, that more Ontarians are 
employed in business services than in the construction industry 
and more people in Quebec have jobs in the health and medicare 
fields than in construction, textile, clothing, furniture, auto, 
forest and mining industries combined.
<P>
	These realities demand we give high priority to the 
acceptance of research and development as an engine of 
economic growth. What is required to do so? First of all, it 
would require utilizing the results of systematic studies of 
material sources, administrative structures and organizations.
<P>
	New sources and applications of capital must be found and 
employed. It will be necessary to adopt new ideas about the 
relationships between public and private organizations, between 
various levels of government and between private organizations 
and government. Second, it will require a government that 
establishes an entrepreneurial attitude toward politics.
<P>
	Last week our leader, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, 
challenged this Parliament to be a House beyond precedent. It is 
in that spirit that we require entrepreneurial politicians who will 
undertake innovations that promise substantial political profit 
while running the risk of potential loss. With such an orientation 
the major requirement of government is to do what is right, just 
and fair. Then government is in a position to create an 
environment that encourages and provides for the exercising of 
initiatives by private citizens to apply their individual and 
collective skills, creative talent and knowledge in making 
Canada the successful nation that it can become.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	What must be done in order to achieve that job? First, we need 
a change in attitude. We need to establish and maintain an 
educational system that trains entrepreneurs. We need a 
government that will establish and maintain an economic, social 
and political climate that assists Canadians to become able and 
successful entrepreneurs without removing all the risks.
<P>
	Our families need to develop an attitude that will encourage 
our children to become resourceful and self-sufficient. We must 
nurture an attitude that supports community leaders who 
understand, speak and demonstrate personal responsibilities and 
accountability. These are leaders who know and accept the need 
to balance reward with the cost of taking risks and who are 
willing to pursue a new approach because it promises greater 
success.
<P>
	Second, we need to think big. We need to think in the longer 
term which means long enough to permit the innovations a 
reasonable chance for success but short enough to discourage 
lethargy and bureaucratic stonewalling. We need to think 
beyond our respective families, friends, associates, 
shareholders and subsidiary companies. We must think beyond 
our constituencies,  regions and perhaps even beyond the 
boundaries of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="238"> 238 </A></B>
<P>
Canada to ensure that as many people as possible will benefit 
from the new approaches.
<P>
	We need to develop a new role for government. We need a 
government that acts as a facilitator and not a benefactor and 
regulator supreme. We need a government that adopts principles 
of development that encourage growth and the application of 
private efforts as opposed to pandering to the pressures of 
self-serving special interest groups.
<P>
	We need a new role for the federal government that rejects the 
insidious pressures to centralize power yet provides leadership 
and guidance for all Canadians in their pursuit of harmony, 
health, happiness and financial independence.
<P>
	By changing our attitudes, thinking big ideas and establishing 
a new role for government we are building on a solid foundation 
that some have called ordered liberty. By that I mean a state of 
peaceful harmony and a constituted authority that provides for 
each of us the freedom from captivity, imprisonment, slavery or 
oppressive control.
<P>
	It is this ordered liberty that has given us excellence in art, 
discovery in science and has undergirded the ethic of work and 
the ethic of service. It has tempered freedom and internal 
restraint, inspired public virtue and the inner impulse to do good 
and has sent legions into battle against disease, oppression and 
bigotry. It has built hospitals and orphanages. Finally, it has 
given mercy a human face.
<P>
	To preserve that ordered liberty Parliament must regain its 
sense of duty and moral, as well as legal, obligation and accept 
its responsibility to do what is right.
<P>
	With that sense of duty intact we must sharpen our focus and 
perspective by looking beyond the confines of this House. We 
must have a vision that is bigger than balancing the budget, 
extends beyond social and economic safety nets, embraces new 
ideas and arouses creativity. It is a vision that not only brings 
about reparation but also progression.
<P>
	It is such a vision that will establish hope and instil a renewed 
sense of confidence in Canadians who will carry this country 
forward to a prosperous and new economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I join with 
other members of this House in congratulating you on your 
election as Speaker. I also extend my congratulations to the 
government and to all other members who were successfully 
elected in this 1993 election.
<P>
	I would also like to publicly thank the voters of North 
Vancouver for placing their trust in me as their representative in 
Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Prior to and during the election campaign I distributed more 
than 20,000 pieces of survey cards to North Vancouver residents 
so that I could find out what their concerns were on a wide range 
of national issues. The number one concern by at least 10 to 1 
was a desire for the government to eliminate the deficit. The 
people of North Vancouver clearly understand the relationship 
between government deficits and high taxes and they understand 
the relationship between high taxes and the lack of job creation 
by the small business sector.
<P>
	There are a significant number of home based businesses in 
North Vancouver in addition to the established base of light 
industry, shipbuilding and wheat, lumber and coal export 
facilities. The owners and workers of these North Vancouver 
businesses will be searching the throne speech looking for signs 
of fiscal responsibility and future tax relief. The small and home 
based business sector in particular will be looking for signs that 
this government will facilitate the availability of capital that is 
needed in order to establish new businesses and to foster growth 
and employment.
<P>
	The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood mentioned this 
earlier today and I am pleased to offer some additional 
suggestions for capital for small business in my speech. The Red 
book accurately points out on page 48 that a major problem 
facing small and medium sized businesses is that they cannot 
find capital or that the capital they find is too expensive. I 
applaud the recognition by this government that capital 
availability is a problem for the small business sector and I 
commend it for its efforts to try to find a solution.
<P>
	However, one of the solutions proposed in the red book on 
page 49 would place taxpayers' dollars at risk by eliminating 
personal guarantees for loans under the Small Businesses Loans 
Act. Instead of encouraging bona fide business ventures and 
viable businesses this policy could encourage the funding of 
poorly researched projects and even scams. We will have 
difficulty convincing our constituents that we are responsible 
guardians of the public purse if we approve such a measure.
<P>
	The second proposal, on page 49 of the Red book, confirmed 
in the speech from the throne is to use $100 million of our tax 
dollars to help establish a Canada investment fund to ``seek out 
projects and technologies in which to invest''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="239"> 239 </A></B>
<P>
	This approach has all the trappings of yet another government 
agency which would concentrate on spending as much of our 
money as possible in the shortest possible time.
<P>
	If this project goes ahead I would urge the government to first, 
advertise openly across Canada for experienced private sector 
fund managers and not make political appointments and second, 
make sure the managers are held accountable for the 
performance of the fund and that they will be expected to deliver 
a profit back to the public purse.
<P>
	There are those who would say that it is easy to criticize 
without offering alternatives and for that reason I offer a number 
of distinct alternatives for considerations by the government.
<P>
	First, the single most important action that could be taken by 
this government is to gain control of its expenditures and 
eliminate the deficit. This would bring the promise of future tax 
relief and future tax reductions for both companies and 
individuals in Canada. The result of tax deductions would be the 
freeing up of billions of dollars each year for use as investment 
capital by the business sector. There would be no need for 
government funds or the elimination of personal guarantees on 
loans. It is quite likely that $100 million in tax cuts would yield 
more wealth producing economic activity than $100 million of 
taxpayers' money targeted for a Canada investment fund.
<P>
	Second, the government could support changes to the RRSP 
investment rules which would permit individuals to invest their 
RRSP contributions into private financing and investment 
companies which specialize in funding for small and home 
based businesses. Such companies are already familiar with the 
market and could act as a vehicle for the encouragement and 
development of new business. The government would of course 
be involved in the setting of maximum interest rate levels and 
could require that a set percentage of the funds be committed to 
research and development. This would help deliver on other 
promises in the red book regarding research and development. 
No taxpayers' money would be required for this alternative.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Third, the government could permit the establishment and 
licensing of RRSP qualifying mutual funds which would lend 
part or all of their capital in leases and loans to home based and 
small businesses. Since banks appear to be reluctant to become 
involved in the provision of venture capital this area of new 
business financing should be opened up to investment. The 
banks would probably quickly follow suit and establish their 
own mutual funds when they saw the response to competition for 
RRSP and other investment funds.
<P>
	Fourth, the government should actively seek and act upon 
input from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business and other coalitions of 
small business which have already brought together banks and 
business people to discuss concerns over the supply of capital. 
These organizations should be encouraged in their initiatives to 
help small business become aware of sources of financing other 
than banks.
<P>
	Finally each member of this House could seek input from the 
home based and small business community as to the best ways 
for government to facilitate the availability of venture capital. A 
simple advertisement in our local newspapers in each riding 
requesting input could produce a wide range of practical ideas. 
The government could then base its final decision on feedback 
from business groups and individual members representing their 
ridings. There would be no need for expensive commissions to 
tour the country and yet all interested in Canadians could have 
an input into the process.
<P>
	There is ample evidence that voters want a say in the way they 
are governed. They should be encouraged to become involved. 
We should take more direction from their input and we should 
properly represent their position on issues before this House.
<P>
	I urge the members of this House to support freer votes so that 
a legislative direction more in keeping with the wishes of the 
constituents can be possible and I urge them to support more 
creative ways of improving capital availability to small 
business. These two measures together would contribute toward 
finding solutions to the great problems which face us as 
legislators in Canada today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I begin by congratulating the 
member on his opening remarks in the Parliament of Canada and 
I would like to respond to his constructive ideas.
<P>
	First, the objective of eliminating the 25 per cent personal 
guarantee under the Small Businesses Loans Act at that time was 
to try to put further stimulation into a reluctant bank sector 
which already had in my view a very generous government 
support provision under the Small Businesses Loans Act.
<P>
	The member's point is one that we will discuss. Perhaps if we 
can get the banks to shift their attitude and start lending money 
to small business then maybe that provision will not have to be 
touched.
<P>
	I want to deal with another aspect of the hon. member's 
speech which had to deal with getting private funds either 
through RRSPs or just private funds, not financial institutions, 
that might be used to help small business. Under the Small 
Businesses Loans Act if someone with a private fund wants to 
lend money to small businesses eligible under the act then there 
is a provision in the act for such funds to be considered by the 
governor in council. In other words this means they are decent 
people who meet the approval that they are solid operators. I 
applaud this idea because it would be a way of providing more 
competition to the reluctant banks.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="240"> 240 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	On the specific notion of the RRSPs as a possibility being 
shifted into small business as a part of the program, we will 
make sure the Minister of Finance and his staff hear the 
member's remarks and we will look at it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to 
thank the hon. member opposite for his comments and the 
suggestion this morning that each of us as members should 
phone our bank managers and request that they help the small 
business sector.
<P>
	I think it is a great suggestion. I am sorry I did not mention it 
earlier, although I should say as a small business person prior to 
coming to the House I wonder whether my bank manager might 
think I had other things in mind when I ask him to do that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to react to the speech of the first Reform 
member who spoke during the 20-minute period.
<P>
	He seems to think we need a new federal economic leadership. 
I have my doubts on that matter. I could mention many examples 
in my riding of situations where when the federal government 
took part in an operation, it became more complicated and less 
efficient.
<P>
	I referred to a few such cases in my speech as critic for 
regional development. Let me stress the importance of reducing 
duplication in this issue. The best leadership the federal 
government could show would be to withdraw from certain 
areas in which it has been floundering for years while doubling 
the costs.
<P>
	During question period we spoke about training. I think 
manpower training is one of the best examples. But there are 
also many areas of federal jurisdiction to consider. For example 
piers along the St. Lawrence. The federal government reneged 
its responsibilities in that area for over 20 years while spending 
money on matters that should have come under provincial 
jurisdiction. I think that it could easily have spent the necessary 
money to ensure that we have installations that meet the 
required standards instead of the opposite.
<P>
	I therefore feel that it is important, when reflecting on the 
throne speech, to make sure that this government really has the 
will to reduce overlapping of jurisdictions. The issue is 
mentioned in the throne speech, but without any details on how 
this would be done. I believe it is very important for the House to 
seriously consider ways to reduce overlapping.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, in the end, real initiatives are taken 
at the local level. I would like to point out that, in some areas, we 
should give ideas a chance to bloom. For example, in La 
Pocatière, in my riding, there is a research centre on public 
transportation and a centre specializing in physical technology. 
If those centres had been planned by national thinkers, they 
never would have been located  in La Pocatière, but probably 
somewhere in the Montreal area, or worse yet, outside Quebec.
<P>
	So, what I wanted to tell the member is that, ultimately, the 
federal government might best show leadership by staying 
within its own jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time for questions 
and comments to the member for North Vancouver have 
terminated. Because the Chair neglected to give the five-minute 
allocated time to the member for Okanagan Centre and since the 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup directed his 
question to that member, the member may give a five-minute 
response, if he wishes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Madam Speaker, I was totally unaware that 
those questions were being directed to me. I thought they were 
to the member for North Vancouver. I was really diverting my 
attention to other matters and therefore cannot immediately 
respond to those questions.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Madam Speaker, on a 
point of order. Since the hon. member did not take up all his 
allotted time, may I respond?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> No. The hon. member 
may ask questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> I will ask a question with a preamble. Madam 
Speaker, my question is directed to the first member who spoke 
for the Reform Party.
<P>
	In his speech, he mentioned seven or eight points, and I 
certainly share some of his opinions. He indicated the need for 
renewal through the infrastructures program. He also mentioned 
increasing government funding for research and development 
and also said that the government should control-this was very 
important in his speech-its spending to create the right 
economic climate for creating jobs.
<P>
	He also said a few words about education and manpower 
training.
<P>
	He referred to the feelings of freedom and sense of duty 
Canadians should have if they were to be more progressive and 
creative. He also asked this government to provide the requisite 
funding for small and medium sized businesses to invest and 
create jobs.
<P>
	However, and that is my question, the hon. member will have 
to admit that to meet these objectives, which are quite 
praiseworthy as such, we need a compassionate government that 
does not attack those who are less well off or the neediest in our 
society or the middle class to get all the money it needs to boost 
the economy. We need a government that is not afraid to cut the 
tax shelters enjoyed by some families and corporations. I want 
to ask the members of the Reform Party to support and join the 
Bloc Quebecois in asking this government to guarantee that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="241"> 241 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians will be able to keep their vested rights with respect to 
social housing, health-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I regret to interrupt the 
hon. member, but the question and comment period for both 
speakers of the Reform Party has expired. Resuming debate. The 
hon. Minister of Public Works has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Madam Speaker, let me begin by 
joining with other members of the House in conveying to you 
and to Mr. Speaker my best wishes in your election as Speaker 
and deputy speaker of this Chamber.
<P>
	In the weeks and months ahead, Madam Speaker, there will be 
many challenges you will have to face, but I hope you will be 
comforted in the knowledge that members of all political parties 
have demonstrated quite clearly their desire to maintain civility 
without having to sacrifice anything as it relates to our ideology.
<P>
	There is no greater honour in a democracy than to be elected 
to represent one's fellow citizens. There is no greater obligation 
than to work together to try to create a better life for every 
person in the country.
<P>
	I do not share the political philosophy of members opposite 
but I respect their right to hold their beliefs and to enunciate 
those beliefs. I hope that on many issues we can find common 
cause and common ground as we seek to build a better future for 
our children and our grandchildren.
<P>
	May I say a special thanks to the people of my constituency of 
Cape Breton-East Richmond who have granted me the 
privilege in four general elections of representing them as their 
member of Parliament in this the highest court of the land. I 
acknowledge that privilege but I remind them, as I do all other 
members of this prestigious House, of the words of Edmund 
Burke when he said:
<P>
You owe them much more than your industry; you owe them 
your judgment.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The communities in my constituency were established by 
people who dared to dream. My constituents are the descendants 
of men and women who faced adversity and persecution, men 
and women who came to Canada seeking opportunity, tolerance 
and a better life. They sought a decent standard of living and 
they sought a fair chance to play their role in building a better 
country.
<P>
	In 1994 the challenges are different but the dreams remain the 
same. The residents of my riding and indeed all Canadians seek 
economic growth, compassion, social programs and a 
generosity of spirit. Canadians want a government that shares 
their concerns, a government that respects their views and their 
dollars, and a government that helps them to fulfil their dreams.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne the government did not promise 
miracles. We cannot solve all the problems overnight, but we 
can and we must take steps to foster new economic growth. We 
can and we must take steps to ensure integrity and openness in 
our actions. We can and we must move to solve problems with 
creativity and co-operation. We can and must treat individuals 
all across this country, regardless of their differing political 
philosophies, with dignity and with respect.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made clear throughout the election 
campaign his belief that we need to kickstart our economy. We 
are attempting to do just that with the new national 
infrastructure program which was announced by my colleague, 
the President of the Treasury Board. This program will create 
thousands of new jobs in a matter of months. It will help build 
the roads and bridges we need to link our country together and to 
move our goods and produce. We need modern infrastructure to 
compete in the modern world.
<P>
	What is so encouraging about this particular initiative is the 
degree of co-operation shown by provinces and municipalities. 
To my knowledge this is the first time in our country's history 
when we have crafted such a complex economic program with 
such speed and indeed such goodwill. I hope this is a hallmark 
for future efforts in which all of us in government work together 
to achieve effective and efficient results for the good of the 
country.
<P>
	As an Atlantic Canadian I want to note the significance this 
government attaches to the fixed link. The fixed link is a 
transportation initiative which will integrate the economies of 
Prince Edward Island with those of New Brunswick and 
thereafter the rest of the country. This, the largest of the building 
projects, will provide short-term jobs and long-term economic 
growth for that area of the country. I may say in a personal way it 
will provide hope to an area which suffers from unprecedented 
levels of high unemployment.
<P>
	The whole thrust of the government's agenda is to give every 
region, every province, every community and every person a 
chance to be part of the economic mainstream. We want to knock 
down the barriers that keep Canadians from having a fair chance 
at success. That is the simple principle behind our plan, Madam 
Speaker, something to which you have spoken yourself 
personally in the House and indeed across the country, the 
introduction of a prenatal nutrition program. We think that 
babies have a right to be born healthy. Frankly I find it shocking 
that in a country as rich as Canada we have infants born sick just 
because their mothers were too poor to eat properly during 
pregnancy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="242"> 242 </A></B>
<P>
	Equally distressing are the conditions of poverty in which so 
many aboriginal children live. Is it any wonder that children fall 
asleep at school when they do not get one decent meal a day let 
alone three, when they live in rooms without heating, when they 
do not have proper winter clothing? I hope all members of 
Parliament, regardless of political ideology, will support the 
implementation of an aboriginal head start program so that we 
can end this national disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	We cannot expect people to make a meaningful contribution 
to our society if we do not create the conditions that allow them 
to make that contribution. Surely it is the responsibility of 
Parliament to show forceful leadership in creating those 
conditions.
<P>
	I cannot help but reflect upon some words spoken by the new 
Speaker of this House in 1981 when he said: ``I want Canada to 
excel in spheres in which we are particularly gifted. I want us to 
produce goods better than anyone else. I want us to celebrate the 
forms of artistic expression that best reflect our soul. I want us 
to pioneer to branches of knowledge and to develop an even 
more humane social system''.
<P>
	It is wrong that one million children use food banks in 
Canada. That is why the Government of Canada will announce 
an action plan for major reform of the social security system in 
this country. It is wrong that senior citizens are afraid to walk 
down the street. That is why my government will bring in 
measures for community safety and crime prevention.
<P>
	It is wrong that large numbers of women and children are 
battered and abused. That is why my government will introduce 
measures to combat that high level of violence. It is wrong that 
law-abiding citizens are victimized just because they look 
different, sound different or act different. That is why my 
government led by the right hon. Prime Minister will act to fight 
racism in hate crimes across this country.
<P>
	The notion that every Canadian is entitled to certain basic 
standards of life is central to our identity as a nation. I am proud 
to live in a country where we take it for granted that we actually 
care about one another. I am proud to live in a country where 
universal health care is regarded as a right and not as some sort 
of specialized service for the wealthy of this country.
<P>
	The decision of the Prime Minister to create and to chair the 
National Forum on Health is based on the belief of our party, the 
Liberal Party of Canada, that medicare is the cornerstone of 
social programs in this country.
<P>
	Only when all Canadians have access to decent health care do 
all Canadians have an opportunity to forge a decent life for 
themselves and for their families.
<P>
	As the minister responsible for housing, I am pleased to say 
that the government will immediately reinstate the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program. This was a commitment that 
we made in the election campaign and a commitment that was 
reaffirmed in the throne speech given just a few days ago.
<P>
	Over the next two years, the Government of Canada will 
provide $100 million in loans and grants to allow low income 
Canadians to bring their homes up to health and safety 
standards.
<P>
	The emergency repair program will furnish assistance in rural 
and remote areas of Canada. RRAP for the disabled will allow 
Canadians with disabilities to make changes they need to their 
homes to guarantee their fuller participation in the mainstream 
of Canadian society.
<P>
	I have asked the provinces and territories to share the cost and 
to deliver RRAP in a spirit of partnership and co-operation. It is 
my hope that we can create more jobs and provide more help to 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians across this land.
<P>
	We are announcing this quick action in order to gain the 
immediate economic benefits that the renovation program will 
provide. Later this week I intend to propose improvements in the 
program to provincial and territorial housing ministers.
<P>
	Our aim is to put Canadians back to work. Our aim is also to 
invest in short-term projects that provide the foundation for 
long-term economic growth. Our aim is to introduce policies 
and programs that allow all Canadians to benefit from that 
long-term economic growth.
<P>
	The government's fundamental view is that we can only solve 
Canada's deficit problem when we are on track with creating 
long-term jobs. I am perfectly aware that money for any 
government programs comes from hard-earned taxpayers' 
dollars. As the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, I intend to respect that fact. I will do my best to 
eliminate waste within my departments as well as other 
governments. I look forward to receiving the suggestions of hon. 
members which I am sure will be made in a very constructive 
way.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are entitled to cost effectiveness and 
accountability for how their money is spent. We are moving 
toward greater fairness through open and electronic 
procurement systems. My officials and I will work with the 
provinces and others to establish an open purchasing policy 
across our respective governments.
<P>
	What is equally important is to ensure that small and medium 
sized businesses have a fair opportunity to do business with the 
Government of Canada regardless of where they may come 
from.
<P>
	On that note, a small business for instance in my riding has a 
difficult time knowing where to get the application forms or 
even who to call. Anyone who has ever flipped through a 
government phone book knows  what a frustrating process this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="243"> 243 </A></B>
<P>
must be for small and medium sized businesses. That is why we 
will work to bring centralized business service centres to each of 
our regions. Small businesses should be able to get all of the 
information, all of the help and all of the forms in one place.
<P>
	My hope is that we can work with the provinces and business 
groups to provide information for them at the same locations.
<P>
	Small businesses in Atlantic Canada, the west and the north 
pay taxes too and they deserve a fair opportunity when it comes 
to bidding on contracts paid for by the taxpayers of this country.
<P>
	I do not pretend that the new government procurement 
policies will on their own revitalize the poorer regions of this 
country, whether they be the north, the west or indeed the 
Atlantic. We know that our problems are much deeper than that.
<P>
	The truth is that the economic problems confronting, for 
instance, the four Atlantic provinces are powerful. However, I 
am absolutely convinced that the will of Atlantic Canadians to 
overcome those problems is far, far more powerful. I can say 
that the Government of Canada will show the leadership to make 
Atlantic Canada prosper indeed in the years ahead.
<P>
	I know that members from other parts of Canada face difficult 
economic adjustments in their communities as well, but I point 
out to Atlantic Canada, which has been doubly hit and doubly hit 
hard, the recession of the last few years took an especially harsh 
toll on my region because of our narrow economic base and our 
competitive gap with the rest of the country. What is more, the 
collapse of the east coast fishery is wreaking havoc on the 
livelihood of thousands upon thousands of families. Six hundred 
communities in Newfoundland and in Cape Breton are losing 
their economic mainstay and some feel they may even lose their 
dignity.
<P>
	The groundfish have disappeared but the will to survive has 
not. The federal government will work tirelessly with the 
provinces and the industry to help the people affected to find 
new job opportunities. We will put an end to foreign overfishing. 
In that regard, I salute the Prime Minister and my colleague, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, who has assumed 
responsibilities for this particular dossier and is showing 
leadership both domestically and internationally.
<P>
	We are going to need goodwill from other Canadians. I urge 
Canadians to understand the difficulties which interprovincial 
trade barriers pose not only to Atlantic Canadians but to all 
Canadians. The Atlantic provinces for instance face a $5.7 
billion trade deficit with the rest of Canada. We need your 
support for the Government of Canada's commitment to 
eliminate barriers to trade within Canada and, if so, it will 
benefit all Canadians.
<P>
	The lack of equity capital remains one of the most serious 
road blocks facing Atlantic businesses and indeed all businesses 
across this country. The private venture capital industry is 
virtually non-existent in Atlantic Canada. We need to work with 
the private sector and investors to find means of allowing 
entrepreneurs from the Atlantic region the same access to 
capital as other Canadian businesses.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Each province in the Atlantic has exciting possibilities for 
creating and trading new products and we will work with each 
province to build upon those various strengths.
<P>
	My province of Nova Scotia for instance has a rapidly 
growing software industry that stretches from underwater 
acoustics to support centres of higher education.
<P>
	We are modernizing and upgrading our tourism in Cape 
Breton and Halifax, if members do not know it by now, has the 
potential to become the hotbed of music in North America.
<P>
	Like every other Atlantic Canadian I am a realist, a realist 
about our problems we face but an optimist about the future. 
Like other Atlantic Canadians I believe that the Government of 
Canada has a major and constructive role to play in justifying 
that optimism and helping us reach the future.
<P>
	If we are to become world-class traders and if we are to build 
upon Atlantic Canada's potential in knowledge-based 
industries, we need to implement the programs as outlined in the 
speech from the throne.
<P>
	I know that as I speak here today other members of this House 
of Commons do not believe in an activist government, do not 
believe in job creation programs, and do not believe in our task 
to help generate new employment for our constituents. But I 
believe.
<P>
	Like many others of my generation I came to maturity as an 
admirer of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy who once said: 
``Have you ever told a coal miner that what he needs is 
individual initiative to go out and get a job where there isn't 
any?''
<P>
	This government believes it must support job creation and it 
must provide people with the tools and skills to create new jobs 
and to obtain those new jobs.
<P>
	If we want Canadians to seize the opportunities of the future 
this Parliament must seize the opportunities of today. If we want 
Canada to tap its full potential we must allow every Canadian to 
tap his or her full potential. If we want to restore respect for 
government we must make government a force for economic and 
social renewal. We must make government a force for growth 
and, as the Prime Minister has said so often, we must make 
government a force for good.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="244"> 244 </A></B>
<P>
	We are very blessed in this country. I look forward to working 
with all members of Parliament to use those blessings wisely 
and to make certain that each and every one of our citizens from 
each and every part of our country has a chance to share in those 
blessings.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, may I close my remarks by thanking you, 
congratulating you, and congratulating new members of this 
House.
<P>
	For those who have spoken in this debate I am certain they 
have spoken with sincerity and with conviction. Although we 
will attempt to practice civility in the weeks and months ahead I 
assure hon. members opposite that that should not be interpreted 
in any way as a consent for sharing the ideologies which they 
may and I may pronounce from time to time.
<P>
	I seek your respect. I will give you the civility which it 
deserves but in turn, Madam Speaker, I expect no less than those 
members opposite.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to start by thanking and congratulating the Minister 
of Public Works for his speech. He gave us his opinion on a 
number of questions of public interest, but he kept rather silent 
on other issues of direct concern to his department.
<P>
	I would like to ask him first about questions directly related to 
his portfolio and then talk about infrastructures, which involve 
several departments, and finally ask him a question about 
parliamentary life.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I will start by asking him why, as minister responsible for 
public housing, he does not try and reassure the people of my 
riding and many other ridings in Quebec and Canada, many of 
whom have signed petitions reflecting their concern as to the 
governments's intentions regarding social housing? Will the 
present government follow in the footsteps of the previous one?
<P>
	Among the issues he did not deal with, although they are of 
direct concern to him, there is the recent decision of Canada 
Post, for which he is responsible, to buy Purolator. I would like 
to know, given the various ideological trends, where this 
decision fits in the larger government strategy.
<P>
	Also, I would like the minister to tell us whether, as a member 
of cabinet, he feels that the infrastructure program will be 
enough to bring about a significant reduction of unemployment 
in Canada?
<P>
	Finally, something about the last few words of the minister 
regarding respect towards members on the other side. I would 
like to know whether he is among those, on the government side 
and in cabinet, who seem to doubt from time to time the total 
legitimacy of Bloc Quebecois members in Ottawa, who were 
sent here by the will of the Quebec people expressed during the 
elections of October 25.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe the hon. member 
asked four questions.
<P>
	First of all let me congratulate my colleague and thank him for 
this kind of intervention. Perhaps I can respond to his four 
questions in reverse.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks about the legitimacy of the Bloc 
Quebecois and their interventions in this House, I want to refer 
him, not to some rhetorical speech I gave outside of this 
Chamber, but to <I>Hansard</I>. If he were to check <I>Hansard</I>, he would 
find that in my capacity as the opposition House leader I 
defended on the floor of this House the right of members of the 
Bloc Quebecois in opposition to speak in this Chamber and to 
express their views no matter how difficult I found those views 
to accept. I believe <I>Hansard</I> will report that in 1991 in response 
to Jean Lapierre, a former member, I outlined this very clearly.
<P>
	I respect the rights of all duly elected hon. members who 
come to this Chamber to have the opportunity stand in their 
places and to echo the sentiments they believe in. Equally hon. 
members opposite should not be fooled into thinking that 
because they make these statements, by a certain process those 
of us on this side will somehow concur with their ideology. That 
is not the case. I believe that <I>Hansard</I> will probably prove that to 
the hon. member. I will probably send him a copy so he can read 
it for himself.
<P>
	The third question concerned the national infrastructure 
program. It will provide an economic benefit to Canadians 
across the country and will provide economic benefits in the 
province of Quebec. It will not be the panacea for all the ills in 
Quebec or in Canada. However it will provide a good solid base 
on which governments can build upon. That is why the President 
of the Treasury Board and the Prime Minister initiated this 
particular program on December 21 with the first ministers. As 
well, the treasury board has signed agreements with provinces 
across this country.
<P>
	The second question the hon. member asks is with regard to 
Purolator. The hon. member is obviously a very wise, seasoned 
and intelligent individual. Far be it for me to question a 
quasi-judicial body which reviewed evidence for an extended 
period of time, called witnesses, examined them under oath and 
made a decision which it believed to be in the public good, 
which we as a government and as an opposition party would 
subscribe to now as we did previously.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Finally, I think the hon. member quite rightly made 
reference-I want to underline that-to social housing. Social 
housing is not just the prerogative of the Government of Canada. 
It is part of the jurisdiction of provincial governments, it is part 
of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="245"> 245 </A></B>
<P>
the jurisdiction of municipalities and it ought to be the cause of 
many individual Canadians across this land.
<P>
	My government, as confirmed in the throne speech, has put 
$100 million into social housing under auspices of the RRAP 
program. I have had discussions with ministers of housing 
across the country on ways to find additional moneys. At the 
present time I am dealing with my colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, other ministers of the Crown as well as provincial 
governments to see if we can ascertain additional dollars to 
address those kinds of situations.
<P>
	In conclusion, I thank the hon. member for his sound and wise 
intervention. I hope that my answers fulfil some of the queries 
he has to some major public policy issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first I would like to congratulate my colleague on his 
appointment to the cabinet. Having worked with him for the last 
10 years I know he will serve the people of his constituency and 
the country well. I should also say how deeply honoured I am to 
be often mistaken for the hon. minister and it is only because we 
share the same barber.
<P>
	I was encouraged by a statement the minister made. He said: 
``Every citizen is entitled to a minimum standard of living''. The 
minister knows that at every national Liberal convention over 
the last 25 or 30 years the Liberal Party has endorsed the concept 
of a guaranteed annual income. The minister seems to be 
suggesting that is the direction this present government will go.
<P>
	I would like the minister to expand upon the statement he 
made about every citizen being entitled to a minimum standard 
of living. Is he suggesting this government will finally fulfil a 
commitment or a position taken at national conventions over the 
last 20 years? Is he suggesting this government will finally 
move toward amalgamating the myriad of social programs in 
this country to guarantee every Canadian a certain standard of 
living?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question and assure the House that I am honoured from time to 
time to be mistaken for the hon. member. In fact I have had the 
pleasure of using his name on a number of occasions of which I 
will not bring the details to the House.
<P>
	The response to the question is no in terms of the guaranteed 
annual income.
<P>
	The hon. member asks, how does a government which has a 
limited fiscal capacity achieve its overall objective of 
enhancing the opportunities of every Canadian. I want to say to 
the hon. member that although this has been passed by party 
resolution, as he knows, it is still under active consideration. 
However I think I would be misleading him if I told him that 
tomorrow announcements were going to be made with regard to 
the guaranteed annual income; hence my response of no.
<P>
	The government is proceeding in many ways to achieve that 
particular objective. First and most important, the Government 
of Canada under the auspices of the Prime Minister has 
recognized that the major economic and social problems facing 
the country today is the creation of economic growth, not just in 
small pockets of the major centres but indeed all regions in all 
quarters of all provinces. So we would be working toward trying 
to create economic activity in all regions of the country.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	A list of things are contained in the throne speech. Perhaps at 
another opportunity the hon. member would raise this kind of 
question so that I could give him more details, such as the 
pre-natal program, the aboriginal head start program, the RRAP 
program which has provided much needed housing in all regions 
of the country. There will be a variety of other programs 
ministers will be announcing in the course of this debate as well 
as in the debate when the Minister of Finance announces his 
budget.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Madam Speaker, for one 
who appreciates history, to be making a maiden speech in the 
House of Commons is definitely a solemn moment. We 
members of the Bloc Quebecois intend to create history and I 
think this is a very good time for it.
<P>
	Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on your 
election to this very important position you now occupy, let me 
offer you my best wishes and assure you of our total support.
<P>
	I would also like to thank my constituents of Ahuntsic, a 
riding in the northern part of the island of Montreal where some 
eminent Quebecers from both political camps, federalists as 
well as sovereignists, have played a great role in the democratic 
debates over the Quebec issue.
<P>
	Let me mention Mrs. Jeanne Sauvé, who was a member and 
then a minister representing our riding during a great many 
years, and the hon. Raymond Garneau, both federalists. Mr. 
Jacques Parizeau twice was a candidate in our riding and so was 
Mr. Jean Campeau who will certainly be the next Minister of 
Finance in Quebec. It is therefore a great honour for me to 
represent that riding.
<P>
	As a critic for the Official Opposition on the infrastructure 
program, I would like to share with you some of my concerns on 
this program implemented by the new government. Everyone is 
saying the Liberal Party was elected because of the platform 
presented in the red book. That is where the infrastructure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="246"> 246 </A></B>
<P>
program took form. But it is also in that same document that one 
can see clearly the confusion surrounding that project.
<P>
	Indeed, since the government announced that infrastructure 
renewal program, those concerned do not know what to expect 
from the federal government. When you think about what the 
population expects in terms of economic development, you can 
rightfully speak of-

expecting a report from the Clerk regarding the interpretation 
problem. I want to advise the member for Ahuntsic that he is still 
entitled to his full allotted time of 20 minutes. He now has the 
floor.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault: </B>Such an interruption during a maiden speech is 
rather startling. I will start again then, Madam Speaker. Once 
more, I wish you all the best in your new position. You may be 
assured of our full co-operation.
<P>
	I will also remind the House that the riding of Ahuntsic, which 
I represent, has always been at the heart of the national debate in 
Quebec. It was represented by prominent federalists such as 
Jeanne Sauvé and Raymond Garneau. At the provincial level, 
prominent sovereignists such as Jacques Parizeau and Jean 
Campeau, whom I hope will be our next finance minister in 
Quebec City, ran for election in that riding. It is therefore a great 
privilege for me to represent it.
<P>
	As opposition critic for infrastructure, I would like to voice 
some of my concerns regarding the program being implemented 
by the new government.
<P>
	The Liberal Party of Canada was elected on the strength of its 
red book. The infrastructure project took form in that same 
book. And it is clearly from that policy paper that stems the 
confusion regarding this project. Indeed, since the 
infrastructure program was announced, those concerned have 
not known what to expect from the federal government. When 
you are aware of the people's expectations in terms of economic 
development, you are fully justified in asking the government 
for more details on what it intends to do in that particular area.
<P>
	The tough economic times we are experiencing put all levels 
of government in an uncomfortable position. Given these trying 
circumstances, it is extremely important to look at how the 
needed funds promised by the federal government will be 
allocated and where the money will come from.
<P>
	To begin with, I would like to refer to a statement made by the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and which was reported 
in <I>La Presse</I> last November 21. Mention was made of the fact 
that the provincial governments were in such a weakened 
economic state that their powers to negotiate with the federal 
government were virtually non existent.
<P>
	The minister stated the following: ``So far, I have met with 
most provincial representatives and I have observed that their 
fiscal problems make them much more open to reason than they 
ever were during the last two or three decades''.
<P>
	This kind of statement by the minister leads one to believe 
that might is right and that the federal government intends to 
take advantage of the economic hardships of the provinces to 
once again infringe upon provincial areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that the infrastructure program 
could lead to constitutional infringement and our party will 
denounce any kind of interference in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Traditionally, the principal area in which the federal 
government has intruded to a significant degree for many 
decades is spending power. Spending power is linked to the 
federal debt which has surpassed the critical $500 billion mark. 
We object to this spending power and will continue to do so.
<P>
	May I remind the government that section 92(8) of the 
Constitution Act, 1867 gives the provinces jurisdiction over 
municipal institutions.
<P>
	The federal government is forever reminding us that the 
provincial governments will be responsible for implementing 
the infrastructure program. Why then is the federal government 
taking so much time to negotiate with the provinces to ensure 
that the money invested in the program will satisfy its criteria 
and requirements?
<P>
	In his address in reply to the throne speech, the minister 
responsible for the infrastructure program, the President of the 
Treasury Board, emphasized the need for some elements of 
consistency and I quote: ``All the provinces the federal 
government will review projects in relation to broad program 
criteria''. The conclusion is obvious. In fact, the government is 
interfering with project management.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="247"> 247 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	If the federal government wants to give good, solid proof that 
it will have no involvement whatsoever in this program, why not 
just give the provinces the money they were promised?
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the federal government also keeps saying 
that the infrastructure program will stimulate job creation and 
boost the economy in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	By making this program the focus of their economic recovery 
policy, the government is displaying a glaring lack of vision and 
sensitivity to the real, basic needs for improving the economic 
performance of the provinces and Canada as a whole.
<P>
	How could the Liberal Party think that such an ad hoc program 
could have a structuring effect on the economy while a more 
serious and carefully thought-out approach would have had a 
much stronger structuring effect by creating steadier 
employment?
<P>
	I am thinking for instance of the HST project which is 
particularly promising both in terms of development for the 
economy of Quebec and Canada and in terms of industrial 
consolidation in high-tech sectors.
<P>
	Another strategy which would have had a structuring effect 
for the consolidation of the industrial fabric in Quebec and 
Canada would have been to develop a national defence industry 
reconversion program. In these industries, production is already 
technology intensive and for the federal government to provide 
them with assistance through a reconversion program would 
have demonstrated a more structuring view toward brightening 
things up as regards the economy and the manufacturing 
industry.
<P>
	I would be remiss to address the issue of infrastructure 
without mentioning the need for oneness in light of the recent 
negotiations between the federal government and the provinces.
<P>
	Over the past few weeks, I have had to tell constituents who 
were enquiring about the state of the negotiations on 
infrastructure that the government was keeping us in the dark.
<P>
	These hidden negotiations have led to confusion for which the 
federal government must assume responsibility. The umbrella 
agreements being drawn for each province-and we will revisit 
the issue after the Minister tables these agreements-contains 
grey areas on aspects as simple as the definition of 
infrastructure.
<P>
	In fact, what constitutes an infrastructure? For some, 
infrastructure must be narrowly interpreted in terms of roads, 
sewers, drainage ditches and sidewalks. That is how this basic 
infrastructure project was defined. Others favour a wide and 
vague definition including cultural and community facilities, 
telecommunication highways, even congress centres.
<P>
	This wider definition suggests that the moneys to finance this 
infrastructure could come from various government 
departments such as Public Works or federal regional 
development offices.
<P>
	The nature of the projects chosen under the infrastructure 
program could not only confuse existing federal departments 
but also lead to a duplication of departmental efforts and to a 
waste of public funds.
<P>
	In this regard it is conceivable that the federal government 
will be tempted to use the money already allocated to these 
departments, thus weakening the notion of new money invested 
by the Canadian government.
<P>
	The Liberal Party cannot use old money to keep its election 
promises, or else its program amounts to a mere accounting 
exercise.
<P>
	In fact, is the federal government willing to pay the grants in 
lieu of taxes in full to municipalities?
<P>
	According to the UMRCQ, the Union of Quebec County 
Regional Municipalities, these grants amount to some $125 
million. How much is it for all the provinces?
<P>
	It is also easy to assume that the government will be tempted 
to reduce public spending in terms of transfer payments to the 
provinces and social programs.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois denounces such practices, because the 
budget cuts to be made in the federal government must not be at 
the expense of the poorest people.
<P>
	Together with my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, again I 
invite the government to set up as quickly as possible a 
committee to review public finances. This committee could 
identify major cuts that would provide the funds required to 
support needy people.
<P>
	Finally, Madam Speaker, the infrastructure program must not 
be used to reward the government's friends. The government 
must not intervene in the process of recommending and 
selecting applications for financial support under the program.
<P>
	When we met with the minister on January 12, 1994, I 
proposed consulting all members of the House who are directly 
concerned with local projects, regardless of their political 
affiliation.
<P>
	I also wrote to the minister on January 17, so that he could 
explain this point which was missing from the document 
received by all members as of Friday, January 14.
<P>
	So I am satisfied, I admit, that the minister took this 
recommendation into account in his address on the Speech from 
the Throne on January 21.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="248"> 248 </A></B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would like to make a final clarification on 
the true nature of the infrastructure program and its economic 
impact on the provinces and municipalities.
<P>
	The federal government is championing this program. It 
pompously announces its absolute leadership in setting up this 
program.
<P>
	It is important to recall that the Liberal government did not 
instigate this program; in fact, it was initiated by the Federation 
of Canadian Municipalities, whose report addressing the 
renewal of basic local infrastructure was adopted in 1985. In 
reviewing the documents, we will see how far it goes. It was a 
project re-evaluated in May 1993 at nearly $20 billion over five 
years.
<P>
	For example, the basic infrastructure renewal needs of the 
city of Montreal alone are estimated at about $1.7 billion.
<P>
	I also wish to remind people that the federal government only 
pays one third of the total program cost. The provinces pay one 
third, as do the municipalities.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the federal government has not yet 
demonstrated, I remind you, that the money it uses will all be 
new funds, nor has it demonstrated that it will not use spending 
cuts in social programs and transfer payments to free up the new 
money needed to pursue its program.
<P>
	The 33 per cent that the federal government invests is likely to 
be much less when the above-mentioned issues are taken into 
account.
<P>
	By intervening in provincial jurisdiction, the federal 
government is unbalancing the municipalities' three-year 
capital works plans. To free up the money needed to start work in 
the next two years, will the municipalities have to draw on funds 
that were to be spent in later years, in 1996, 1997 or 1998?
<P>
	In so doing, they will face chronic underfunding for future 
projects on later agendas, thus creating a sort of dependence that 
will of course suit any centralizing government.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I wanted to show in my first speech in the 
House one of the wrongs of federalism as traditionally practised 
by Liberal governments. Here is where the second part of the 
mandate we sought and received from Quebecers comes in, 
namely promotion of Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	In this statement on Canada's infrastructure program, I 
wanted to show the indescribable administrative mess we are 
living in as Canadians. This example in just one field of 
government activity is matched in almost all other areas. 
Duplication and infringement have become the rule and no 
longer the exception.
<P>
	English Canada recognizes the primacy of the federal 
government over the provincial governments and that is no 
doubt why this same English Canada is less sensitive to federal 
infringement in provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We are a long way from the spirit of equality, balance and 
mutual respect which characterized the Constitution in 1867. 
Although it respects the will of its partners, Quebec must not 
pursue that route.
<P>
	In my opinion, Canadian federalism has become a model of 
administrative inefficiency, an inefficiency which undermines 
the system and severely affects the groups which should be 
served.
<P>
	Political systems are tools used by communities to 
co-ordinate their actions. There is no doubt in my mind that we 
have to adopt a new regime if we want to get out of this situation.
<P>
	And this is why the Bloc Quebecois will, during the next 
referendum, ask Quebecers to patriate its tools by proclaiming 
its sovereignty.
<P>
	In the last week, we have heard a lot about the famous red 
book-probably as much as the Chinese people heard about 
Mao's red book during the cultural revolution-but I want to 
remind the government that people in Quebec voted 
overwhelmingly in support of the Bloc Quebecois and not the 
Liberal government's red book and, as such, gave their federal 
representatives the very clear mandate which we had sought, 
that is to defend Quebec's interests and promote its sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, I can see 
from the speech the hon. member for Ahuntsic just made that he 
understands full well what the infrastructure program put 
forward by the federal government is all about. First of all, we 
have asked and we continue to ask that the money the federal 
government wants to spend be directly sent to Quebec. Hence, 
the provincial and municipal governments in Quebec would be 
able to effectively and responsibly manage this money 
according to their priorities. Maybe then there will be some 
money left for the real infrastructure needs of Quebec.
<P>
	Again, the federal government is directly impinging on a 
jurisdiction of which it has no knowledge and on which it has no 
right, since, according to the Canadian Constitution, the federal 
government has no right over municipal affairs. But now, in a 
roundabout way, it will succeed in meddling directly in 
municipal affairs. For the first time in Canadian history, the 
federal government will directly impinge on municipal affairs. 
It is a shame, but the federal government keeps doing it.
<P>
	The Liberal government at that time was the most centralist of 
all federal governments in Canada's history, and again, with this 
policy, this program, it will manage to stick its nose in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="249"> 249 </A></B>
<P>
sewers and under the bridges of our municipalities. Moreover, it 
will continue to line its  pockets by awarding its own engineers 
and contractors all the small infrastructure contracts for the 
municipalities.
<P>
	It is outrageous and unacceptable. So, the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, just like the hon. member for Ahuntsic I am 
sure, will denounce the fact that the federal government is 
directly encroaching on the management of municipal 
infrastructures. One of these days, the federal government will 
have to recognize that the best way to achieve efficient 
management and to make municipalities accountable is to 
withdraw from municipal affairs to avoid overlapping and 
duplication. As you know, overlapping and duplication are very 
costly to manage and also very costly in lack of efficiency, in 
confrontation and other such things.
<P>
	I do not understand why the federal government, which 
should know and should understand this, still gets involved in 
areas that are not of its concern.
<P>
	It is a shame, Madam Speaker. I denounce it today and I hope 
that we, as Quebecers, will continue to work hard together so 
that this does not happen again, considering how terribly high 
the deficit now is. We have a $500 billion deficit and we know 
full well that it is due to the fact that the federal government is 
constantly interfering in areas that should be under provincial 
jurisdiction, that it is due to the centralization of powers in 
Ottawa. Canada's deficit began to grow under the Liberal 
government in 1970 and it has become outrageous. It went from 
$2 billion in 1970 to about $35 billion in 1984 and now stands at 
$45 billion. Nevertheless, the federal government insists on 
centralizing everything and it has even come to the point where 
it interferes in areas of municipal jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	It is absolutely outrageous and I want to ask my colleague 
from Ahuntsic what he thinks of all that. I think he agrees with 
me, but I will let him explain in his own words.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. I would ask the 
hon. member to address his questions and comments to the 
Chair.
<P>
	The hon. member for Ahuntsic has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> I totally agree with my colleague, Madam 
Speaker, but I will not elaborate further on that so the hon. 
member for York Centre has enough time to make his 
intervention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I want to make a couple of observations and then ask a question 
of the hon. member.
<P>
	The 35th Parliament is only a week old today and I think a lot 
of us on this side of the House are getting a bit tired of the Bloc 
members harping on sovereignty. Bloc members should be 
mindful of the fact that they have been elected to the opposition 
and that the task they fulfil is an important one. They should be 
here representing all provinces, not just the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman was complaining about certain aspects of 
the infrastructure program. He is suggesting that we in the 
federal government should just send bags of money to Quebec 
City: no accountability, no questions asked, no thought given as 
to how the money is going to be spent in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Surely those members should get serious. If we are going to be 
responsible to all Canadians, if the federal government is going 
to be responsible to federal taxpayers, it should take its full 
responsibility with respect to expenditures of federal money 
under the infrastructure program, whether the money is spent in 
the province of Quebec, the province of P.E.I., the province of 
Manitoba or anywhere else in the country.
<P>
	Is this member really serious when he suggests the federal 
government should abrogate its responsibilities and not show 
any concern whatsoever on how money is spent in the province 
of Quebec?
<P>
	If this member is really preaching sovereignty-and that is 
what I hear-perhaps he would like to tell us whether he might 
like to forgo the federal share altogether. We are going to see 
hundreds of millions of dollars poured into the province of 
Quebec under this program. Would he like to forgo this money 
and let Quebec go on its own?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> I thank the hon. member for his speech. He 
made it clear that the notion of accountability was central to the 
problem. Every time the federal government gets involved, this 
government, which initially was intended to co-ordinate and 
equalize, steps directly into provincial areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	When looking at the agreement with Ontario released this 
morning, I find it as vague as the others in this regard. It states 
that the federal-provincial management committee, made up of 
two members from the federal side and two members from the 
provincial side, will set up unspecified subcommittees, and that 
it will be responsible for establishing subcommittees as required 
in order to manage the agreement; for delegating to these 
subcommittees every power required to carry out their mandate 
and for setting every procedure applicable to these meetings and 
to all the subcommittees, in particular the rules of conduct of 
meetings and of decision-making.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Once more, accountability will be an excuse for interfering. 
Municipalities will be faced with expenditures that will alter 
their three-year plans and as a result the  problem will not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="250"> 250 </A></B>
<P>
addressed because this program is supposed to deal with basic 
infrastructure problems.
<P>
	Initially, that was the program proposed by the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities. Today, Ontario is even accepting 
school boards as local administrations. This means school 
boards as well as municipalities will be eligible.
<P>
	The first project in the program, the convention centre in 
Quebec City, is not a renovation project or basic infrastructure 
or even locally-based infrastructure. How much will there be 
left of the $6 billion for the FCM's project? There will not be 
enough left. They said $20 billion was needed. In 1985, it was 
$12 billion, and now this has been revised upward to $20 billion.
<P>
	Where is the critical mass of this program? In its agreement, 
the government never gives carte blanche for any kind of 
project, and I am sure the President of the Treasury Board is 
going to be very happy because for the first time in perhaps 20 
years, he will not be just a budget cutter. He will also be able to 
dole out subsidies, but these agreements contain no restrictions 
on what the federal government can do. Just read the 
agreements. If you look at them from the provincial point of 
view, you will see they contain everything the federal 
government needs to get involved in all stages of the project.
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned the Bloc's position as the 
Official Opposition. Yes, we are. I spent most of my speech 
talking about the infrastructure project because I take that 
position very seriously.
<P>
	We will get back to this if necessary, but as far as I am 
concerned, when Quebec's interests are at stake, and I 
mentioned the mandate we sought and received from the people 
of Quebec, when our interests do not coincide with those of 
other Canadian provinces which may prefer to let the federal 
government interfere with certain jurisdictions, we will 
consider Quebec's right to object to this kind of interference and 
will always defend the interests of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South):</B> Madam Speaker, on this 
first occasion that I have had to speak in the House I want to 
begin by thanking the constituents who put me here.
<P>
	I have been elected twice provincially. This was my first time 
running federally but never in an election campaign have I been 
questioned as closely and as carefully as I was in this one. The 
people in my riding wanted to know what I stood for, what I was 
going to do if I got here, and what I am doing every day I am 
here.
<P>
	It is passing strange to me that it was such an unusual move to 
put a party's platform in a book. It is stranger still that people are 
surprised when the government acts on the promises it makes.
<P>
	I also thank my wife, Karen, and my daughter, Sarah. The 
hardest thing I have to do as a member here is be away from 
them. It is something we are all going to have to adjust to. They 
make a big sacrifice. All members make that sacrifice and I do 
not think people realize that.
<P>
	I thank the 1,400 volunteers who worked thousands of hours 
over the last 18 months so that I could get elected. They did not 
ask for anything in doing that. All they wanted and all they want 
today is a government that reflects their values. They are still 
coming around to my office. They are still looking for ways in 
which they can volunteer their time and energy to share in the 
process of governing. I am honoured by their participation.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate you and the Speaker 
and all members who were elected to serve this House, and 
through you I want to thank all of the staff that serve this House. 
As a rookie member here I have been remarkably well treated 
everywhere I have gone. I really appreciate the support of all of 
those who do not get recognized in the work that this House 
does.
<P>
	I also want, through you Madam Speaker, to thank the many 
thousands of people who work for the federal government. 
There was a time not too long ago when the previous Prime 
Minister stood in front of a scrum and said that all he had to offer 
the civil servants of Canada were pink slips and running shoes. I 
thought then that that was a shameful experience.
<P>
	How do you expect people to carry out the programs if that is 
the way you treat them? No company on earth would survive if it 
treated its employees the way the previous government treated 
the public service of this country. I caution some of the members 
opposite because I hear some of that same language coming 
through, as though somehow the people who carry out the work 
of this House are the enemy. We need to reflect on that.
<P>
	I also want to thank Dorothy Dobbie and Mark Hughes. 
Dorothy was the member for Winnipeg South in this House prior 
to me and Mark was the Reform Party candidate who ran against 
me. We debated 20 times during the course of the election and 
we managed to keep every debate on the issues and never once 
resorted to personalities. I really want to thank them for that.
<P>
	I come from the province of Manitoba. We talk a lot in this 
House about the upheaval that has happened in Quebec, the 
election of the Bloc Quebecois, or the upheaval that took place 
in Alberta and British Columbia with the massive election of the 
Reform Party. Well, an upheaval took place in Manitoba. We 
elected 12 Liberals. In fact we elected 21 Liberals in the 
prairies. Back when I was working for the Liberal Party in the 
seventies there was only one Liberal in all of western Canada. 
But it is no surprise that we did not elect a single Conservative in 
the prairie region.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="251"> 251 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to share a couple of facts with the House. They are facts 
that I hope members from the prairie region will reflect on and 
work with me on helping to right this. Do members know that if 
they look at the share of national wealth that is held in the prairie 
region, in the three prairie provinces of Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and Alberta, that if we just held the same 
percentage of national wealth that we held in 1984 there would 
be $26 billion more economic activity in those three provinces 
today? That is a staggering figure. That is more than the entire 
gross domestic product of the province of Manitoba. That is a 
fact.
<P>
	In truth, a big chunk of that is the decline in oil revenues. But 
in my province of Manitoba, a small province, less than 4 per 
cent of the total population of the country, no oil revenues, we 
are $1.6 billion poorer and 42,000 jobs poorer today than we 
were in 1984-85. I believe that is because we had a federal 
government that had no understanding of the regional character 
of this country, no understanding of how to use government as 
an instrument in the regions of this country.
<P>
	The people in my province are not blaming anybody. They do 
not even blame Ontario.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They could.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> They could. They are approaching this new 
government, they are approaching the year 2000 with great 
optimism, and they are working very hard to meet the challenges 
that they are confronted with.
<P>
	I spoke the other day in the House about a young business in 
my area. Four young graduates from the University of 
Manitoba-that is Manitoba, in the city of Winnipeg-had built 
a super computer. Not a good computer, a super computer, a 
10-gigaflop massive computer. Not only have they built it from 
scratch in the city of Winnipeg, but they have successfully sold 
it to Korea, Japan, China, Brazil, Sweden and the United 
Kingdom.
<P>
	There is a tremendous amount of energy and optimism and 
work going on in the province of Manitoba. But when I talk to 
people there, as I do every night from my office here, when 
talking about the problem with Canada, unlike the Leader of the 
Opposition who says the problem with Canada is Quebec, they 
tell me that Quebec is one of the great strengths of Canada. They 
tell me that it is the Canada we have built, the Canada that 
embraces diversity, the Canada that stands up for minorities, the 
Canada that has created a code of human rights, the Canada that 
embraces multiculturalism. It is that very diversity that gives 
them the strength to go out into the world and compete.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Out of these debates I take a couple of things that stick in my 
mind. There are two little statements that come to mind. One 
was told by the current Speaker who was recounting his first 
days in the House many years ago when he was taken aside by 
the Hon. Paul Martin Senior, the father of the current finance 
minister who told him:  ``Young man, whether you are here for 5 
years or 20, remember that you are just passing through''. I think 
about that statement and I think about a comment that the leader 
of my party, the Prime Minister, made in his speech when he 
spoke about about Canada as being a great work in progress.
<P>
	Think about the work that we do here: pass some laws, amend 
some laws and rescind some laws. To tax or not to tax. We spend 
or we do not spend or we modify spending. Those are the 
tangible things we do. Those are the buttons we push or the 
levers we push.
<P>
	However, there is an intangible thing we do in this Chamber 
and that is provide leadership to the rest of the country. I hear the 
talk about greater decorum and a more positive attitude. But 
when I read carefully through the speeches that I see coming out 
of the third party, I see very much the same kind of criticism I 
heard when I sat in the provincial legislature. They did not look 
at the throne speech and ask: ``What is there and how should we 
discuss the things that are being committed to''. They saw what 
was not there. They did not see the glass half full, they saw it 
half empty.
<P>
	I hope that over the months and years to come we will have the 
kind of debate that is talked about. I hope we will have a 
competition in this House for good ideas. I hope we will 
challenge each other to see who has the best idea to solve a 
problem.
<P>
	Would it not be wonderful if when our constituents watched 
television they went away saying: ``Gosh, I learned something. I 
have been enlightened''. I do not think that is the way they walk 
away from it now. It is going to take all of us to do that.
<P>
	I hope that in the time I am passing through this Chamber that 
I can contribute in some small way to this great work which is 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry I am not at my 
desk, could I ask my question from here?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The Standing Orders 
require that you be in your seat to ask a question.
<P>
	I already recognized a member, but after him, if you wish, you 
could have the floor. The hon. member for Charlevoix.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
start by congratulating you, personally and on behalf of my 
constituents from the riding of Charlevoix, the riding of the 
former Prime Minister, Mr. Brian Mulroney, for your 
appointment to the chair.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Like my colleague from Ahuntsic, who spoke about 
infrastructures, I would like to say that in a riding like 
Charlevoix, where unemployment is high, and where the income 
level is low, the mil rate is nevertheless quite high. If I 
understand correctly what was announced by the President of 
Treasury Board regarding infrastructures, a grant of $527 
million would be paid to  Quebec. For Quebec, $527 million and 
$700 million for Ontario. Granted, we elected a very small 
number of Liberals in Quebec while Ontario sent quite a few 
Liberal members to the House, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="252"> 252 </A></B>
<P>
but I hope we will not be penalized because of the October 25 
election.
<P>
	Several municipalities in Quebec cannot afford to pay a third 
of the costs. Will the government include, in the agreements 
with Quebec, rules or specific clauses in order to help small 
municipalities, maybe through the labour market, maybe by 
allowing them to pay on a half-time basis since, in some cases, 
spill-overs from the tourist industry bring additional revenues 
to municipalities, but only six months a year. For the smaller 
municipalities, it could also mean-one third, one third-if they 
want to take advantage of the program, it could force them to 
borrow the necessary money. Already they cannot support their 
poverty rate. Will the government think of additional revenues 
that could help small municipalities? Will each municipality be 
the local project manager, will they be able to encourage the 
local economy and local workers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not going to begin to 
respond to the specific question about some municipalities in 
the member's riding because I am not the minister responsible 
for the infrastructure program.
<P>
	I would like to point out a couple of things to him. The 
previous member for his party who spoke on this issue made a 
comment that this sort of tripartite arrangement, 
federal-municipal-provincial, was unheard of. Certainly that is 
not the case in my province.
<P>
	This kind of arrangement where the three levels of 
government come together to jointly share responsibility for 
major public works is quite common. Municipalities, Indian 
reserves and others are all participating in it.
<P>
	On the allocation of funds, the one thing that is different about 
this government from the previous government is that these 
decisions are made on an open rational basis. In this case, it was 
a mixing of population and unemployment. There was a criteria 
set and not: How many Liberals did you elect?
<P>
	This is unlike the previous government. I think we are further 
ahead for that kind of decision-making.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Time has terminated for 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Madam Speaker, I am honoured to stand 
in the House today as the member for Essex-Windsor.
<P>
	First and foremost, I would like to thank the residents of 
Essex-Windsor for giving me the privilege to represent them in 
the House of Commons. Indeed, it is a privilege to have this 
opportunity.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would also like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate you on your appointment and to congratulate the 
Speaker on his election. You have your work cut out for you to 
reform this House and I pledge my full support to those efforts.
<P>
	One of the primary reasons that I decided to run for public 
office was that I was concerned and I believe that Canada's tax 
system needs to be reformed. That is not just our tax policy but 
our collection system as well.
<P>
	As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National 
Revenue, I have been given the opportunity to be closely 
involved in such reforms. I want to thank the Prime Minister for 
that opportunity and for appointing me. I intend to make the 
most of it.
<P>
	During the election, we all know that we promised to replace 
the GST. The throne speech repeats this commitment, the same 
commitment I made to the residents of Essex-Windsor. This 
tax which was introduced by the previous government has been 
disastrous for Canadian businesses. It has fuelled an 
underground economy that threatens to destroy Canada's social 
fabric. Some critics have expressed concern that the throne 
speech fails to identify the GST replacement. But for the throne 
speech to identify the replacement would be a betrayal of the 
Canadian public.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister told Canadians over and over during the 
election that in the first session of this new Parliament he would 
mandate an all-party finance committee to consult Canadians 
and provincial governments on all options to the GST. That is 
exactly what the Prime Minister has done.
<P>
	I would encourage all residents of Essex-Windsor who want 
their views on tax reform to be made available to the committee 
to send their letters, their briefs, their charts directly to myself 
and I will make sure they are presented to the standing 
committee.
<P>
	I mentioned that one of my primary reasons for running and 
entering politics was to tackle tax reform. I would be remiss if I 
did not take a moment to acknowledge and pay tribute to the 
people who, through example, showed me the value of public 
life. I speak of my parents.
<P>
	My father, Eugene Whelan, as many members know, spent a 
considerable part of his life in this House. Indeed, some of the 
members in the present House served with him. I want you to 
know that my father was not alone in his endeavour. My mother 
was always at his side. They were truly a team. Both were raised 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="253"> 253 </A></B>
<P>
on a farm yet both are quite different. My father is second 
generation Canadian born. My mother was born in Yugoslavia 
and came to Canada when she was nine years old. However,  
both were raised during lean times and both understood the 
greatness of this country and what can happen when we put hard 
work forward.
<P>
	As a child, I saw day in and day out the commitment my 
parents had to Essex-Windsor and to Canada. I was raised with 
a sense that we had a duty and an obligation as citizens to serve 
this great country and to keep it great. It is that responsibility 
that brings me to the House today. It is a responsibility that I 
intend to keep.
<P>
	However that responsibility cannot be kept by any member in 
this House unless we put our House in order. On December 1, 
1992 when I sought the nomination in my riding I made a 
commitment, a commitment to work to restore integrity to our 
political system. I am pleased to see from the throne speech that 
this party and this government is not backing away from that 
commitment. I want to impress on the House and my 
constituents that this is not the easy thing to do but it is the right 
thing to do.
<P>
	My riding of Essex-Windsor, in many ways, is a microcosm 
of Canada. It is a reflection of the country as a whole. Like 
Canada, the riding of Essex-Windsor is ethnically diverse. We 
have over 70 different cultures peacefully co-existing in my 
riding. Pluralism and multiculturalism, the fact that we can be 
different and yet all be Canadians, are fundamental 
characteristics both of Essex-Windsor and of Canada itself.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I too recognize the importance of bilingualism and of 
protecting linguistic rights in Canada. I hope to become 
bilingual to better serve my constituents.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Like Canada, Essex-Windsor has a diverse economy based 
on a mixture of heavy industry, light industry, small and medium 
sized businesses and farming. For example, my riding hosts the 
largest mould making industry in the world. As well, we have 
three large automotive companies in Windsor, Chrysler, Ford 
and General Motors.
<P>
	Let me remind you, Madam Speaker, the auto industry in 
Canada owes its very existence to past Liberal policies under 
Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, ministers Paul Martin Senior, 
Walter Gordon, Mitchell Sharp and then backbenchers like the 
hon. member for Windsor West and my father, Eugene Whelan. 
Without the auto pact that industry would be nearly dead. Now 
the auto industry is one of the economic generators of Canada. It 
is alive and well because of Liberal foresight.
<P>
	However, like the rest of Canada, Essex-Windsor is still 
recovering from the current recession. Economic suffering has 
social consequences and in Essex-Windsor we have a lot of 
work to do.
<P>
	The throne speech commits the government to concrete 
measures to deal with problems and restore Canada. These are 
measures that will affect, help and assist Essex-Windsor. To 
stimulate the economy, the government will immediately 
introduce the infrastructure program based on recent federal, 
provincial and municipal agreements.
<P>
	I have been in contact with all the municipalities in the riding 
of Essex-Windsor and they are all looking forward to joining in 
and participating in this program. As well, to assist in long-term 
job creation the government has committed to work with this 
country's financial institutions to improve access to capital, to 
allow small businesses to expand and prosper.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I cannot help but note that during the election campaign this 
plan was criticized as being unworkable. Yet last Thursday night 
I read in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>: ``Another flurry of small business 
lending initiatives is under way as Canada's big banks try to stay 
on the right side of the new federal government''. That was 
accomplished without a single piece of legislation or a single 
decree.
<P>
	We finally have a government that understands the future of 
this country. As we all know, the future of tomorrow is based on 
the youth of today. Therefore one of the most important 
initiatives in the throne speech is the youth service corps, a 
service corps that will begin to put young Canadians back to 
work. It addresses youth unemployment. As well, we are 
looking at a national apprenticeship program.
<P>
	For 125 years Canadians have worked together to build a 
strong, united nation. In spite of the economic difficulties we 
face, we are what the rest of the world wants to become: peaceful 
and prosperous, diverse yet tolerant, educated, strong and free. 
If one looks at the situation in the former Yugoslavia and if one 
was to ask the people there what they wanted more than 
anything, I believe they would ask for the two things that we 
have in great abundance in Canada: bread and peace. The power 
expressed in the idea of bread and peace is fundamental. It was 
the promise of bread and peace that allowed the Bolsheviks to 
take over Russia in 1917. It is our abundance of bread and peace 
that underpinned our economic prosperity in the past. We must 
never forget its important to our future.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I want you to know that my riding contains 
some of the most productive agricultural land in Canada. As 
Canadians we must protect and strengthen our agricultural base. 
A country that cannot feed itself is soon not a country and is at 
the mercy of every other nation.
<P>
	There are many difficulties facing agriculture. One is the new 
GATT agreement, that while successful in many areas was of 
mixed success in terms of agriculture. Like the producers of this 
country I would have preferred a strengthened article XI. I know 
the importance of supply  management. If we allow our dairy 
and poultry production to be destroyed or damaged, the entire 
agricultural industry will be negatively affected and the quality 
of our food will suffer. Over the next 18 months I will work to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="254"> 254 </A></B>
<P>
ensure that supply management is adequately supported under 
comprehensive tariffication.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has always been at the forefront of social 
change in Canada and always will be. The throne speech lays the 
ground work for continuing that vision. The Prime Minister 
himself will chair the national forum on health to foster with the 
provinces a renewal of Canada's health system. The government 
will also undertake, with the consultation of individual 
Canadians and the provinces, a major reform of the social 
security system. This will be completed during the next two 
years. I again encourage the citizens of Essex-Windsor to 
participate.
<P>
	Further the throne speech commits the government to fiscal 
discipline necessary for sustained economic growth and deficit 
reduction. As the member for Madawaska-Victoria stated in 
her eloquent reply to the throne speech on Tuesday: ``A lean 
government does not have to be a mean government''. The 
Canadian dream that built Canada on principles of sharing, 
fairness and compassion has all been forgotten over the last 10 
years. We as Canadians must remind ourselves of the greatness 
of the Canadian experiment and return our energies to 
endeavours which reflect our collective values and our desire to 
work together.
<P>
	The throne speech that we are debating today is the blueprint 
for Canadians to work together to build Canada's future success.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member on her appointment 
as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Revenue.
<P>
	I am somewhat surprised by the fact that she has failed to 
mention that the Liberal Party has just increased the tax burden 
of small wage earners, when for years, they have been 
criticizing the party in power for imposing taxes on the poor. 
Shortly after they were elected, we realized that they were 
increasing the tax burden of the unemployed, and particularly of 
small businesses.
<P>
	I do hope that as assistant to the revenue minister, the hon. 
member will remove this unfair burden on small wage earners 
due to the increase in unemployment insurance premiums. The 
government squeezes a further $800 million out of workers and, 
the next day, announces that it is going to give municipalities 
$995 million for their infrastructure. What is the government 
doing? It is reducing the purchasing power of the people, that is 
what it is doing. Consequently, it is slowing down economic 
growth while putting an equivalent amount into the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The government toots its own horn, bragging about this great 
program which is going to create jobs, stimulate the economy, 
while it increases the burden of workers by about the same 
amount by raising unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I have this question for the member: where is 
the government going with that process I would call dishonest?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe some of the 
comments the hon. member made should be directed more 
readily at the leader of his own party when he was minister and 
the things that he did in the past government.
<P>
	We have to pick up the pieces and start over, and that is what 
this government is doing. We are going to have an all-party 
finance committee to deal with the question of the GST and 
other questions. That is where fairness will start. It will start 
with this government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> At any rate, Madam Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to congratulate my hon. colleague on her recent 
election and I should mention that she is the youngest member of 
our party, at least on this side of the House. I would also like to 
point out that I am proud to sit next to a woman who reflects the 
renewal our government is undergoing, a government which is 
striving for profound renewal by putting in the foreground, so to 
speak, the wishes of the young generation which is shaping this 
country for the next century.
<P>
	Of course, Madam Speaker, the opposition is not too happy to 
hear about young people like us being the future of this country. 
Not that I absolutely want to quote Sir Wilfrid Laurier who so 
aptly said a century ago that ``the next century will belong to 
Canada'', but the speeches and the presence of my colleague in 
front of the opposition prompt me to say this: Canada is in very 
good hands and thank you for a great speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, let me 
extend my congratulations to you on your appointment to the 
chair and to the hon. member for Welland-St. 
Catharines-Thorold on his election as Speaker of the House. I 
sincerely believe that both of you will be just and wise in 
conducting the business of the House. I also congratulate all 
members of the House on their election victories.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="255"> 255 </A></B>
<P>
	I am very pleased to take this opportunity to thank the people 
of Vegreville constituency for their strong show of support on 
October 25 and for their communication with me since then. I 
understand well that I represent all constituents and each must 
have equal access to my ears, my effort and my voice.
<P>
	The greatest strengths of this area are resourceful and highly 
motivated people and an abundance of natural resources 
including oil, natural gas and rich agricultural land. Through 
living and working with the people of this area I have learned 
there are common threads that bind them. They are kind, 
generous and forgiving to a point. They are hard working, treat 
people fairly and expect to be treated fairly. They like to face 
problems head on and are frustrated that their governments 
refuse to do the same. They are a way ahead of government in 
recognizing the problems and the solutions to the problems the 
country faces.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	These people have told me what they expect of this 
government. They want democratic and parliamentary reforms 
which will make me and the Government of Canada more 
accountable to them. They want reform of the justice system to 
restore the balance between the rights of victims and society as a 
whole and the rights and rehabilitation of criminals.
<P>
	They want government to spend less, much less. My 
constituents have sent me here to ask these questions of each 
spending proposal. Is it necessary? How much will it cost? Can 
it be done for less? The Canadian public and members of the 
House have heard and will continue to hear Reform MPs ask: 
Can we spend less?
<P>
	As I listened to the throne speech I was disappointed that 
agriculture was not mentioned. However my concerns were 
somewhat alleviated by the hon. Minister of Agriculture in his 
response to the throne speech. I was pleased with some of the 
objectives the minister outlined and will be thrilled, as will my 
constituents, if my interpretation of what he said and what he 
actually meant are the same.
<P>
	I will list briefly what I see as the major problems in 
agriculture today and outline some of the Reform solutions. My 
colleague from Fraser Valley East will discuss the supply 
managed sector.
<P>
	The problems then are subsidies both domestic and foreign 
which encourage overproduction and lead to unfair competition, 
a lack of co-ordination of programs further distorting market 
signals and causing inappropriate production, and programs 
which threaten access to markets. For example, the national 
tripartite stabilization program for beef and hogs has caused 
export problems to the United States. Then there are problem 
which encourage environmental damage. An example is the 
gross revenue insurance plan which encourages crop production 
on marginal and easily degradable land.
<P>
	The Crow benefit costs taxpayers approximately $700 million 
a year and leads to the exports of value added in industries and 
jobs. The future of grain farming may very well depend on 
keeping those value added industries in Canada.
<P>
	Next would be marketing agencies which prohibit 
competition. For example, the Canadian Wheat Board controls 
all sales of wheat, barley exports and domestic milling wheat 
sales. I am not suggesting that we eliminate the Canadian Wheat 
Board but rather that we reform it.
<P>
	Another problem is very poor anti-combines and fair 
competition legislation and even poorer enforcement. Finally 
are interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	All these problems and others must be dealt with in a 
co-ordinated way. Are farmers ready to accept the necessary 
change? I believe they are. Farmers are astute business people 
who do not want to depend on subsidies which prolong the 
problem. They want to depend on less subsidies and more on the 
marketplace. Although the new GATT agreement may open the 
gate it will not solve the problem. It is up to Parliament, in 
consultation with farmers, to make the necessary changes.
<P>
	I will outline briefly the vision of the Reform Party for 
agricultural reform: more specifically reform of safety net 
programs, the transportation system, research, education and 
training, government regulations, and the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	Concerning safety net programs, our plan is to consolidate the 
mess of over a dozen unco-ordinated programs into three 
programs to protect farmers from natural hazards, unfair foreign 
trade practices and other income fluctuations which are beyond 
their control.
<P>
	First, there is the creation of a trade distortion adjustment 
program to compensate farmers for unfair trade practices in 
other countries.
<P>
	Second, an income stabilization program will help protect 
farmers against price fluctuations and cycles which occur in an 
open market environment. This program will ensure a minimum 
of interference in the marketplace by using the whole farm 
approach. That means all commodities would be eligible and all 
commodities produced on a particular farm would be included in 
the plan.
<P>
	Third, an improved crop insurance program would help 
protect farmers against natural hazards but not encourage 
overproduction.
<P>
	This package of three safety net programs will be better for 
farmers and less expensive for taxpayers.
<P>
	Concerning transportation reform, agricultural products 
should move to markets by any route, any mode of 
transportation and in any state of processing that farmers and 
their customers agree on. Transportation subsidies should be 
eliminated and the money put into the safety net program. The 
<P>

<B><A NAME="256"> 256 </A></B>
<P>
railway system should be deregulated and options such as 
privatizing CN Rail  rolling stock to enhance competition in the 
system should be considered. Grain handlers should be deemed 
an essential service during labour disputes if alternate routes 
which are cost effective cannot be found.
<P>
	A policy environment which encourages private sector 
participation in research, education and job training must be 
developed. Research funds should be better targeted to meet the 
goals set out by farmers and agribusiness.
<P>
	In the area of government regulation we must ensure that 
imported products meet the same safety and environmental 
standards as those produced in Canada. We must strengthen and 
rigorously enforce anti-dumping laws and dispute settlement 
mechanisms. We must protect against unfair business practices 
by strengthening and enforcing anti-combine legislation and by 
creating stronger licensing and arbitration regulations.
<P>
	Finally, a priority of this Parliament must be reforming the 
Canadian Wheat Board. Allowing a continental barley market, 
though certainly a move in the right direction, is only tinkering 
with a system that needs major reform. Let us make the 
following improvements. Make the Canadian Wheat Board 
accountable to the people who pay the bills and they are western 
Canadian grain farmers. Allow the wheat board to handle any 
crop it wants but permit farmers and grain companies the right to 
compete with the board. Continue loan guarantees as long as 
other countries do and give farmers the right to choose between 
a pool price and a daily cash price.
<P>
	These changes will provide a win-win situation for farmers, 
taxpayers and for us in this House. We have strong support, as in 
no Parliament before, to make these positive and substantial 
changes to the Canadian Wheat Board. The farmers of this 
country are way ahead of us politicians in being ready for and 
demanding these changes. Let us catch up. Let us lead. Thank 
you.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
very much appreciated what the hon. member of the Reform 
Party said about agriculture, because agriculture is very 
important in the West as well as in the East.
<P>
	I would like to find out from the hon. member if he knows 
about the negotiations on durum wheat now under way between 
Canada and the United States.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. 
member that I am aware of the negotiations. I can only go by 
what is reported by the government but I understand 
negotiations are going well and that the probability is not very 
high that we will have interference in shipping our durum wheat 
to the United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to register my objection to the recommendations 
made by the hon. member with respect to the privatization of CN 
rolling stock and with respect to the further deregulation of the 
transportation industry, particularly rail and, I might add, with 
respect to eliminating the Crow benefit. The member did not 
make it clear whether he wants to eliminate it altogether or 
whether he wants to pay it to the producers.
<P>
	In either event, all three of the things that the member spoke 
of would have the effect of further weakening the role of rail 
transportation in not only the transportation of wheat but the 
transportation of goods, period.
<P>
	As the member for Winnipeg Transcona, I would like to say 
that I object to that. The throne speech called for green 
infrastructure. There is nothing greener in terms of 
infrastructure than railways. What we need is policies in this 
country to encourage the use of railways, not discourage the use 
of railways.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time has lapsed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
50(5), to interrupt the proceedings and to put forthwith every 
question required to dispose of the amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The question is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour of 
the amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Call in the members.
