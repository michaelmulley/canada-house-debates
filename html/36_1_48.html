creating a sense of national unity around Christmastime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob has requested the Christmas cards of members of Parliament

guards for creating something truly unique during this time of 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome all to come to see the tree.  Merry Christmas, Happy 
New Year, Joyeux Noël.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal government has made it clear that 50% of any future 
surplus will go into spending.  There is compelling reason to 
make debt reduction and tax relief a higher priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the government's supposed social conscience.  The 
negative impacts of exploding debt and excessive taxation are 
felt directly by the old, the young, the sick, the poor, the 
unemployed and families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people the Liberal government is turning its back 
on when it says new spending is its number one priority.  The 
interest on the federal debt is eating the heart out of social 
programs.  Health care, education, employment insurance and old 
age pensions combined receive less than what we spend on interest 
payments each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers believe social responsibility and social conscience 
demand that the Liberal government reduce the debt and cut taxes 
in the name of the old, the young, the sick, the poor, the 
unemployed and families across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today is International Human Rights Day.  In 1948 the 
international community adopted the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights and observed December 10 as Human Rights Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The respect for human rights is one of the cornerstones of a 
functional democratic nation.  The world is rife with human 
rights abuses.  Every day in one way or another we are informed 
about human rights violations in various parts of the globe. 
Individual rights are either violated by oppressive regimes or by 
the actions of others.  In some instances others have lost their 
lives as they struggle for even the most basic human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and the government must not take human rights for 
granted.  As a nation we must continue to work at upholding and 
promoting human rights in Canada and around the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the many 
organizations that wage a daily battle against drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving have changed the 
attitudes of Canadians.  People who may have considered driving 
drunk before probably do not now because of stiffer penalties and 
RIDE programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Christmas season approaches I encourage everyone to make 
this a safe and happy holiday.  If you do drink, don't drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our gallery today we have a group of students from Bishop 
Smith Catholic High School in my riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke.  One of those students is Miss 
Kathleen Forder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Miss Forder is the Ontario provincial chair of Students Against 
Drunk Driving.  It is the leadership shown by Kathleen and other 
young Canadians like her who will help keep the pressure on 
parliamentarians to ensure that people continue to realize that 
driving drunk is not socially acceptable.  We must work together 
to make our highways safer for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kathleen, keep up the good work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last spring a young couple purchased a lot in Tumbler 
Ridge, B.C., and then bought a trailer to put on it.  After it 
had been installed on the property, Shirley and Don were notified 
that a mistake had been made and they did not qualify for a CMHC 
mortgage unless they put another 20% down.  They simply did not 
have the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now out $20,000, renting, and their dreams of owning 
their home are shattered.  CMHC has designated Tumbler Ridge a 
special risk community, which means anyone working for the local 
coal mine needs at least 25% down before CMHC will even look at a 
mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is ludicrous.  If the mine ever shut down they could move 
the trailer to a new location.  Where is the risk for CMHC?  You 
can work in a corner store and buy a house in Tumbler Ridge, but 
you cannot if you work in the mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is discrimination at its worse.  On behalf of all Canadians 
living in resource based towns, I call on the federal government 
to review and amend CMHC special risk policy.

the broadening of civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these real advances, however, there is still much to 
be done.  The tragedy of the Palestinian refugees in the Middle 
East, the scandal of the <I>loagai</I> in China, the denial of the rights 
of the aboriginal communities in Chiapas, are all examples which 
rightly trouble the international community.

cannot believe this minister and his lack of knowledge of what 
happened there today and last night.  One plane took off with 
three injured yesterday and a <I>Sun</I> helicopter landed today. 
The military circled around.  The minister said that they did not 
have the equipment to do the job properly.  Nor did the military 
say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask this question of the Prime Minister.  Were there any 
helicopters on the ground at CFB Winnipeg?  If so, why were they 
not dispatched to go and do the job? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my understanding about the private 
helicopter is that it was able to get underneath the ceiling. 
However, it did so at considerable risk.  A risk assessment is 
something our people have to take at the time.  It did not do it 
in that much of a different time from what it took our own 
Hercules to be able to land and to carry out the rescue mission 
for the vast majority of those people.

the consensus of finance ministers from all provinces is clear.

it took from the provinces back into social programs, health and 
education before spending right and left on new federal programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the federal government is getting ready to free up

to now hand out gifts using a small part of the money it cut the 
provinces?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, when the country's financial situation forced us to 
make cuts, we made them at the federal level first, and gave the 
provinces a period of notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, as the prime minister announced in June 
and the Minister of Health and I confirmed two days ago, we have 
put $1.5 billion back into the Canada social transfer.  This is one 
of the government's largest areas of spending.  Furthermore, it 
shows the benefit of putting our fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, my colleague in human resources development 
and I have invested over $850 million to help the most 
disadvantaged in the provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> The Minister 
of Finance is such a generous fellow, Mr. Speaker.  He tells us 
that, instead of cutting $48 billion, he is only cutting $42 
billion, and then he wants us to think he is giving us $6 billion. 
Honestly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is the only one telling us that the surpluses 
belong to all Canadians.  I therefore ask him why he does not come 
around to the consensus of all provincial finance ministers, who 
represent the people of Canada and of Quebec from coast to coast to 
coast, as they are so fond of saying.  Should he not go along with 
this consensus rather than spending money in provincial areas of 
jurisdiction?  That is what we are asking ourselves. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, I would like to tell the leader of the Bloc Quebecois that 
the cuts we were obliged to make in provincial transfer payments 
amount to half of the Province of Quebec's cuts in its 
municipalities' budgets and, second, that we gave a period of 
notice, a courtesy the Province of Quebec did not extend to its 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, is the member saying that the provinces did not 
want us to help students with their debt load?  He is mistaken.  Is 
he saying that the provinces did not want us to help the children 
of disadvantaged families?  He is mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did exactly what Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
wanted us to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Finance should be a little more reasonable. All the provinces, all the 
provincial finance ministers—every single one of them, including the 
one from Quebec—were unanimous in asking him to give back a portion 
of the money he had taken from them instead of squandering it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not realize that his current position is terribly isolating 
for him and his government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance ministers of all the provinces agreed that the priorities set, 
that is to say children, poverty and health, are both their priorities 
and ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, all the provincial finance ministers agree that lowering 
interest rates to their lowest level in 20 years greatly helped them 
reduce their debt load. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, even though the 
Minister of Finance claims to have made poverty his priority, the truth 
is that he cut $11 billion from education, health and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question for the minister. If today his government wants 
to pour money left and right into all sorts of programs, it is only to 
increase the federal government's visibility. They want cheques with

That is what they want.

federal government's position on Kyoto, fiscal dividend, youth 
unemployment and transfer payments.

might save was to stay in the same field.  There was no 
difficulty there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence earlier in this House suggested 
that the Reform Party was playing politics with the helicopter

since 1993.  For the last 81 days, the minister has been saying 
“soon” to the purchase of the helicopters.

a decision sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it clear that there is no relationship between the 
question of purchasing helicopters and the tragic event that 
occurred in Manitoba.  Helicopters were not used, private or any 
other kind of helicopters, with respect to that rescue mission 
because of the weather conditions that existed.  What were used 
were fixed wing aircraft. Our Hercules aircraft in fact has 
carried out a magnificent rescue.

to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the GST. The Bloc Quebecois has submitted a 
proposal whereby arbitration would be used to resolve the deadlock that 
has arisen on the issue of the $2 billion in compensation for 
harmonizing the GST in Quebec. Yesterday, Bernard Landry officially 
reiterated that proposal to the Minister of Finance, but the minister 
again rejected arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this arbitration proposal does not cost anything to the 
federal government, and if the Minister of Finance is in fact right in 
his claims, why is the minister not jumping on this unique opportunity 
to prove that his federalism is fair? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, quite 
simply because Quebec did not lose any money. Compensation cannot be 
offered if there was no loss of money, as shown by data not only from 
Statistics Canada but also from the Government of Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister's 
attempt to avoid the issue is not fooling anyone. Why is he refusing a 
solution that would solve the matter once and for all without any cost 
to him? If it is true, who is right? What exactly is he afraid of? What 
does the Minister of Finance have to lose?

to reduce taxes until such time as the deficit has been

suggest that the member himself might want to answer that

<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

pensions, because that is what the Reform Party would do.  If 
these people live in Manitoba or Saskatchewan, ask them if they 
are prepared to see their basic services cut because the Reform 
Party would cut $3 billion.  That is how it would cut taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night Canadians had the opportunity to see on television 
the toxic mess left behind when Americans closed military sites 
in Canada.  The CBC documentary clearly showed this government is 
letting the Americans walk away, leaving their toxic trash and a 
$1 billion clean-up bill behind.  Moreover, our Canadian 
ambassador in Washington defends this bad deal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

them, an agreement which involves some hundred million dollars in 
U.S. funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a bit of a hold-up in Congress on this matter, but

impression that all air strips Canada have or should have air

</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the crash last night at Little Grand Rapids, we 
understand the pilot depended on private weather observers.

of that committee made by one of your officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the co-chair nor I were informed or consulted until

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have spoken.  Their message was quite clear. Canadians 
want balance, balance between the security offered through debt 
reduction and tax relief and the benefits of investing in people

our fellow citizens about their values, about their priorities 
and how the federal budget should reflect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to announce that this year's consultation was the 
most extensive ever.  In addition to regional consultations and 
round table discussions in which members of the committee 
participated, we called upon members of Parliament to hold town 
hall meetings to ensure that the people in their ridings were 
involved in the policy process.  That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important because as the Standing Committee on Finance 
travelled to the major cities of this country, members of 
Parliament were reaching to the rural areas of this country, to 
the small towns.  Many of the discussions took place not 
necessarily in hotel ballrooms but around the kitchen table, 
where many important decisions in this country take place.

fiscal success are not ends in themselves, but rather they are 
means to improving the quality of life of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, including round table discussions, witnesses, town 
hall participants, letters and e-mails, our committees received 
over 4,900 submissions. 
This national conversation was both rewarding and enlightening. 
Not only did we as members of Parliament come away with a sense 
of what individual Canadians want in the next budget, but we 
learned a great deal about the new outlook that is shared by many 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one that is filled with a great deal of optimism and hope. 
People told us that change is not something they feared.  Change 
is something that we embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout our meetings it became quite clear that the 
challenges we faced as a nation in the 1980s and 1990s have made 
us a more confident people.  This in large part is possible 
because of our Canadian character which allows us to adapt to 
change and triumph in the face of adversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adversity is the right word to describe the situation our 
country faced in the early 1990s.  We were confronted with a 
vicious circle of high deficits, high interest rates, slow 
economic growth and high unemployment.  This vicious circle 
wreaked havoc on our standard of living, on our position on the 
world stage and on our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the hard work, the foresight and much sacrifice, 
Canada is about to enter a new era, one in which the government's 
bottom line will be written in black ink rather than red and one 
in which the Government of Canada will be able to tackle the 
challenges facing our nation more effectively than it could in 
the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving forward, replacing the excesses of the past with 
the successes of today.  Interest rates are at their lowest 
levels in three decades.  Inflation remains firmly under control. 
Consumer and business confidence are up and continue to rise. The 
virtuous circle of lower deficit, lower interest rates, stronger 
economic growth and job creation is perpetuating a culture of 
success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 15, 1997 the finance minister unveiled the results of 
four long years of sacrifice by the Canadian public.  Clearly 
that sacrifice has paid off.  The deficit four years ago stood at 
$42 billion.  We all remember that when the Liberal government 
took office after the Conservative government the deficit was at 
$42 billion.  Now it is at $8.9 billion.  Every target has been 
bettered.  The $8.9 billion is almost $15.5 billion below the 
original target for this year and almost $20 billion below the 
deficit of the previous year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister went further, promising a balanced budget no later 
than the year 1998-99.  Today Canadians face a brighter future. 
Let us for a second take a minute or so to look at some of the 
headlines that appeared in newspapers. 
In the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, October 1, 1993, “Economic outlook 
dim”.  In the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, July 1, 1997, “Economy 
Rockets Ahead”.  In the <I>Financial Post</I>, September 18, 
1993, “Falling jobs, sales, exports turn 1993 into a 
disappointment”.  In the <I>Financial Post</I>, November 12, 
1997, “Economy gets upbeat appraisal”.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next headline speaks to another very important issue about 
Canada's position on the world stage.  How sad it was back in the 
early 1990s when editorials, newspaper articles and opinions 
around the globe were stating that Canada was a basket case in 
economic and financial terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, March 24, “Canadian 
government disappointed with down grade”.  In the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I>, February 20, 1997, “Canada's budget wins applause 
because of its restraint”.   In the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, July 
23, 1993, “Recovery sputters through spring”.   In the Toronto 
<I>Star</I>, December 2, 1997, “Economy grows at 4.2%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must mean something.  It means that through the hard work 
and sacrifice of Canadians, through the entrepreneurial spirit of 
the private sector in Canada and through the responsible 
management of the Canadian economy by the federal government, 
Canadians are now looking to the future with a great deal of 
optimism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of pride in me and I am sure in Canadians 
from coast to coast to coast when we see that economic conditions 
have bettered to the point where now Canada is not being laughed 
at by other countries.  Because of what we have been able to do 
in the House of Commons and throughout the country, Canada is 
referred to as the Canadian miracle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gone is the burden of the $42 billion deficit.  Gone are the 
crippling interest rates and rising inflation.  Gone is double 
digit unemployment.  Over one million jobs have been created 
since the government took office.  Unemployment has been below 
10% for 12 consecutive months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the pain the member for Markham is going through. 
He remembers as clearly as I do when the former prime minister 
stated that the unemployment rate could never fall below 10% 
until the next millennium.  I understand and I feel his pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enhanced confidence in our prospects and abilities will 
prove to be truly a valuable asset as we face new challenges in 
the future.  Not only do we as Canadians believe that tomorrow 
will be better than today.  We also have the capacity to make it 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians feel empowered in today's society.  They have seen the 
impact they have on government policy.  They are determined now 
more than ever to continue to steer our country in the right 
direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout our consultations Canadians spoke clearly and 
decisively on many issues.  They expressed serious concern about 
the national debt.  Canadians want us to finish the fight with 
the deficit and to turn our attention to the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 73.1% our debt to GDP ratio continues to curb our economic 
potential.  This is why the committee called for the government 
to establish an interim debt to GDP ratio range between 50% to 
60%, and we went further.  We also said that it should be done 
within the life of this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question about the fact that Canadians want to leave 
future generations a legacy of expanding opportunities rather 
than one of high taxes and escalating debt.  Let me leave no 
doubt in the minds of my hon. friends across the way.  Canadians 
recognize that across the board tax cuts are not affordable at 
this time.  To implement them would be irresponsible and short 
sighted.  I also want my friends in the House to know Canadians 
want targeted tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason the committee felt it was important to 
address a number of issues including raising the basic personal 
non-refundable tax credit amount, reviewing the impact 
deindexation has had on our tax system, addressing the issue when 
the fiscal situation permits, and reducing or eliminating surtax 
on personal income.  These are all issues we heard about.  As a 
responsible committee we brought them to the attention of the 
House of Commons and the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A message that was very clear from the people of Canada was that 
once tax cuts are feasible, the focus should be on the personal 
income tax.  The committee continued to call for immediate 
measures that would help those in greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk about spending and investment, call 
it what we may.  The reality is that Canadians are against old 
fashioned spending sprees.  They want continued fiscal 
responsibility.  They want continued prudent budgeting and 
prudent assumptions.  They want the $3 billion contingency fund 
to be used toward the debt, a very important point to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not want to see the economic stability of the country 
undermined by an oppressive deficit ever again.  They want to 
ensure that those who need it most receive support from our 
social safety net.  They want to build an economy that is 
prepared for the challenges that lay ahead in the next century. 
They want responsible government.  They want wise investments. 
They want results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spending patterns of previous governments demonstrated a 
lack of respect for Canadian taxpayers.  As elected 
representatives we owe it to the families we represent to invest 
their resources wisely.  New resources, whether invested through 
new programs or significant changes to existing programs, should 
be allocated within a framework of accountability like that 
introduced in the government's program review. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means determining whether the program addresses an evident 
problem, whether it could be resolved more efficiently by the 
federal government, other levels of government or the private 
sector, whether the proposed program is the most effective way to 
approach the problem, whether the program is being delivered 
efficiently and whether we can afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes sense to put checks and balances in place to ensure 
Canadian taxpayers are getting the best value for their tax 
dollars.  Let me quite blunt.  Having the money to spend is no 
justification for spending the money.  Respect is a theme that 
runs throughout our report: respect for Canadians, taxpayers, 
those in need, innovators, respect for their right to a 
responsible government and a better tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RRSPs are one of the three pillars of our retirement income 
system.  The committee in its wisdom recommends that the schedule 
for contribution limits set out in the 1996 budget should be 
revised so as to allow contributions to increase before 2002. The 
committee also recommends that the 20% foreign property rule be 
increased in 2% increments to 30% over a five-year period. This 
diversification will allow Canadians to achieve higher returns on 
their retirement and reduce their exposure to risk, which will 
benefit all Canadians when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also told us that small and medium size businesses 
create roughly 85% of all new jobs and account for 45% of 
Canada's GDP.  Their importance in our economy cannot be 
overstated.  It is in everyone's interest to ensure our economic 
environment is one in which they can thrive.  It is for this 
reason that the committee supported the government's move to 
lower EI premium rates.  This measure, the latest measure taken 
by the government, will result in a $1.4 billion saving for both 
employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we went further than that.  We also said when the 
fiscal situation permits, EI premiums should be further reduced. 
We call on the government to ensure that EI premiums not be 
increased during an economic downturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also recommended that the government take steps to 
address imbalances in the way different sectors of our economy 
are treated by the tax system and to examine the appropriateness 
of the $200,000 threshold of the small business deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we build a strong economy, the government should do its part 
as a partner and facilitator to modernize the economy and to do 
its part.  That is the reason we supported programs such as 
Technology Partnership Canada, the industrial research assistance 
program, because it goes a long way in helping Canadian 
businesses compete in a global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our report also respects Canadian priorities when it comes to 
the social safety net.  Both on the road and throughout the 
public hearings in Ottawa, Canadians told us that they are ready 
to reinvest in the social and economic needs of our society. That 
means improvements to Canada's health care system, which includes 
an increase in the CHST cash floor to $12.4 billion, a 
recommendation that was acted upon earlier this week.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It also means continuing support for the youth employment 
strategy.  If I can speak on this particular issue for a few 
minutes, Mr. Speaker.  I had the privilege to chair the 
Ministerial Task Force on Youth.  From that Ministerial Task 
Force on Youth the government responded with the Youth Employment 
Strategy.  Today, as a result of those measures, hundreds of 
thousands of young Canadians have benefited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth Internship Canada, Youth Service Canada, the Summer Job 
Action Plan, these speak to a very important issue providing 
opportunities for young people to give them that very important 
first chance at a job, to get that very important first line on 
their resumé. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member who has dedicated the greater part of his political 
life to addressing the issue of youth unemployment and concerns 
related to young people, I can say that the most important 
barrier they face is the experience paradox:  no job, no 
experience; no experience, no job.  That is why the government as 
a partner in the development of the Canadian economy should play 
its role in making sure that that very first important chance is 
given to young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in changing times, more challenging times for our young 
people.  Many of the new economy's jobs require a higher level of 
education which means that one of the roles of the government 
should be to provide opportunity and accessibility to 
post-secondary education so that young people, students, can be 
given the opportunity to acquire the educational level required 
to get those new economy jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all committee members, I want to thank Canadians 
from coast to coast to coast for participating in our pre-budget 
consultation.  It has instilled a profound respect for our 
country, its citizens and their ideas in all members of the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“In Keeping the Balance”, which is the title of the report, we 
have tried to respond with the substance our fellow citizens 
demand, as well as a budget plan they deserve.  I am proud of 
what we have accomplished together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to participate with enthusiasm in this pre-budget 
take note debate mainly because it deals with matters that touch 
on the lives and the livelihood of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it is the Christmas season, I thought I might begin by 
reading from the New Testament what is reputed to be the Minister 
of Finance's favourite part of the Christmas story, from Luke's 
gospel:  “And it came to pass in those days that there went out 
a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. 
All went to be taxed, everyone into his own city”, the classic 
case of a rich and powerful government imposing onerous taxes on 
the poor, a theme to which I would like to return in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue before us is this.  What should be the financial 
priorities of the federal government once the budget is balanced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to that question, we have two fundamentally 
different views in this House.  We have the government's position 
that once the budget is balanced, 50% of any surplus will be 
directed toward new spending.  The remaining 50% is to be divided 
between debt reduction and tax relief.  In other words, the 
highest priority of the government once the budget is balanced is 
increased spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the government's Speech from the Throne, we saw this 50-50 
promise.  In the pages that followed there was not a single 
concrete proposal for debt reduction or tax relief, but there 
were 29 proposals for additional spending.  In the Minister of 
Finance's economic statement made in Vancouver earlier this year, 
we saw the same thing, a repeat of the 50-50 promise, followed by 
10 pages of spending proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see virtually the same pattern repeated in the report of the 
Standing Committee on Finance, entitled “In Keeping the 
Balance”.  On page 32 we have a simplistic restatement of the 
50-50 promise without any intellectual justification at all. This 
is then followed by 22 pages containing at least 17 specific 
proposals for increased spending, as well as the defence of a 
dozen more spending increases already provided for in the 1997-98 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then have another 30 pages of the report, and what do they 
contain or fail to contain?  Not one word on how to achieve debt 
reduction targets, and we did not hear a single word on this from 
the chairman of the committee today.  Not one word on either 
short-term or long-term debt management strategy.  A 
recommendation opposing broad-based tax relief.  A recommendation 
that certain payroll taxes not be increased.  Now, there is a 
public relations device.  Half a dozen big unqualified 
recommendations that certain tax relief measures be examined or 
studied or considered, but only when circumstances allow or when 
the fiscal situation permits.  Half a dozen very specific 
measures which amount to little more than administrative 
tinkering on such high priority items as a tax treatment of 
earthquake reserves.  In fact, the only tax relief measures of 
any substance are the recommendations on pages 59 to 60 for 
increasing personal and spousal income tax exemptions and 
developing a schedule for removing the 3% and 5% surtaxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, these proposals are lifted virtually word for 
word from Reform's fresh start platform in the 1997 federal 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appreciate the inclusion of three of our tax reform measures 
in the committee's report, imitation being the sincerest form of 
flattery, but we find it ironic that when we proposed these 
measures during the election they were denounced by the Liberals 
as tax cuts for the rich.  Now that they have been resuscitated 
by the Liberals, they are described in this report as measures 
essential to building a fair tax system.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line of all this is that when it comes to spending 
propositions, the government's plans and the committee's 
recommendations are specific and urgent, but when it comes to 
debt reduction and tax relief, the government's proposals are 
non-existent, stolen, vague or distant. This is what happens when 
you make increased spending your number one priority, which is 
this government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the official opposition is that debt reduction 
and tax relief should be the highest priority of the government. 
I had expected that the federal debt situation would be spelled 
out in detail in this report.  However, since the government does 
not appear to take the debt seriously, the official opposition 
must fill the vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net federal debt stood at $583 billion at the end of the 
1996-97 fiscal year.  This amounts to $19,400 per person or 
$77,600 per family of four.  If that debt were converted to $5 
bills and laid end to end, it would circle the earth 1,448 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mind saying that this debt has even changed the way 
doctors deliver babies.  I have this on good advice from the 
member for Macleod as well as the member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca, both of whom are physicians. In the old days when they 
delivered a baby they would hold the baby up and give it a pat on 
the bottom to get it to cry and fill its lungs.  Today all they 
do is hold the baby up and whisper in its ear “you owe us 
$19,400” and the baby starts to cry right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal debt currently stands at over 60% of the gross 
domestic product.  The total public debt in Canada is almost 100% 
of GDP.  In other words, if the total value of all the goods and 
services produced in the entire year by every economic enterprise 
and government in the entire country were converted into cash 
that would hardly be enough to retire our public debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians ask once we raise this subject to whom do we owe this 
money. About $120 billion of this debt, or 25% of the 
government's market debt, is owed to non-residents, so that the 
interest payments flow out of the country.  About one-third of 
the foreign held debt rests with U.S. investors, with the 
remainder divided mainly between European and Japanese 
investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The domestically held debt was held in roughly these 
proportions: by the Bank of Canada, 7%; by non-financial 
corporations, 4%; by all levels of government, 7%; by public and 
other financial institutions, 17%; by quasi-banks, 3%; by the 
chartered banks, 23%; by life insurance and pension funds, 26%; 
and by persons and unincorporated businesses, 14%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also owes $3.7 billion to the Canada pension plan 
and $114 billion to public sector pension plans.  Of total debt 
owed to outside parties 7% is in the form of Canada savings 
bonds, 28.4% is in the form of treasury bills, and 64.1% is in 
the form of marketable Canadian government bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual interest payments on this massive pile of federal 
debt amounts to $45 billion a year or $3,210 a year for every 
working Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I say more or provide any more information as to why the 
official opposition wants to make debt reduction, not spending, a 
higher priority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the tax situation.  The Liberal government has 
increased taxes 37 times since 1993.  Net personal income tax 
revenues were $51 billion in 1993-94.  They are now on track to 
increase to $70 billion in 1998-99.  Since 1961 the tax bill of 
the average Canadian family has increased by over 1,168%.  After 
adjusting for inflation, the tax bill of the average family has 
still jumped by 125%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian family now spends more on taxes than on 
food, shelter and clothing combined.  The personal income tax 
levels, both as a percentage of our gross domestic product and as 
a percentage of total taxation, are higher now than those of all 
our G-7 trading partners.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, to conclude on the issue of taxation, the average 
Canadian family has suffered a $3,000 drop in real income since 
1993, the year the Liberals took office.  I do not think I have 
to say anything more or provide any more information on why the 
official opposition wants to make tax relief a higher priority 
than increased government spending.  Canadians are taxed to 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the official opposition is that governments in 
Canada in aggregate should not consume more than 30% of the GDP. 
Governments today consume about 43%.  Our position is that 
Canada's intermediate debt reduction target should be to reduce 
the debt to GDP to 50% by the year 2004, and that our long range 
target should be to reduce debt to GDP to 20% of GDP by the year 
2015. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to fiscal priorities our position is to limit 
federal spending to a fixed percentage of gross national product 
and allocate any surplus roughly 50:50 between debt reduction and 
tax relief.  While we acknowledge a need for greater investment 
in some areas, such as health, research, post-secondary education 
and research and development, it is our belief that these needs 
should be met through a reallocation of budgets within the 
existing envelopes rather than through increased spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to tax relief, our tax relief proposals include a 
$3 billion reduction in EI premiums paid by Canada's employers, 
and a $12 billion reduction in personal income taxes through 
raising personal exemptions, adjusting the child care expense 
deduction and a 50% reduction in capital gains tax. The net 
effect of these tax relief measures is to remove about 1.3 
million lower and middle income Canadians from the federal income 
tax rolls altogether, including about 300,000 seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On any issue Reformers always want to look at what the people 
themselves think.  In challenging the government's desire to make 
increased spending its number one priority and in advocating that 
the highest priority be given to debt reduction and tax relief, 
Reform is supported by larger and larger numbers of Canadians, as 
indicated by the recent Compas poll commissioned by the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Compas poll found that 89% of Canadians want the largest 
proportion of the surplus to be used for debt reduction.  On 
average Canadians want the government to put at least 40% of the 
surplus toward the debt; 72% want the government to hold more 
discussion before it spends any surplus. Almost half of all 
Canadians feel the government's status quo pace of debt reduction 
is too slow.  Only 38% of Canadians believe the government has 
explained its position on debt and taxes well, while almost 60% 
believe Reform has done a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty-two per cent of Canadians say that taxes are just too 
high, with 52% of Canadians holding this position intensely. 
Fifty-nine per cent of Quebeckers agree a lot that taxes are too 
high compared with 53% nationally.  Perhaps the best thing the 
government could do to persuade Quebeckers to remain in Canada is 
to simply stop taxing them to death. Eighty per cent of Canadians 
believe that the basic personal exemption should be raised and 
82% of Canadians agree that tax cuts will create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Reform advocates that debt retirement and tax relief be 
made the highest fiscal priorities of this government, we are not 
arguing some peripheral right wing extreme position. 
We are advancing a proposition that has massive and growing 
support from people of all persuasions and types across the 
entire country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have referred to the principal deficiencies of the finance 
committee report, namely its inadequate attention to debt 
reduction and higher taxes. But there is one other serious flaw 
to which I would like to draw the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cover of the finance committee report, as well as the 
structure of its table of contents, reflects what logicians refer 
to as a false dichotomy. A false dichotomy arises when one sets 
up categories for organizing data that lead to false or 
misleading conclusions, for example, when one treats as opposites 
things that are not opposites, or when one treats as 
complementary things that are not complementary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cover of the finance committee report shows a balance scale. 
On the balance scale pictured on the cover of that report, all 
the fiscal factors, debt and taxes, are shown on one side of the 
scale and all the social factors, like social security, 
education, health and the well-being of youth are shown on the 
other side, as if a greater increase in fiscal responsibility 
would result in a decrease in social security or vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently this government thinks that helping people and 
cutting debt and taxes are opposites, when in fact the two 
measures are complementary.  They ought to be on the same side of 
the scale, not on opposite sides of the scale.  In a moment I 
hope to demonstrate this beyond any reasonable doubt to members 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the remainder of this take note debate, the official 
opposition will make the case for debt retirement and tax relief 
more strongly than it has ever been made in this House.  My 
colleagues, such as the official opposition finance critic, the 
member for Medicine Hat, the official opposition critic for 
revenue, the member for Calgary Southeast, and other members will 
present as strongly as possible the facts, the arguments and the 
reasons for debt reduction and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will argue that high taxes hurt our trade competitiveness, 
that they kill jobs and reduce disposable income. We will argue 
that high debt is costly and renders us extremely vulnerable to 
interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But members of the House will know that arguments based on 
fiscal rationality do not move this government.  If they did, the 
government would have committed itself to balancing the budget 
through genuine spending reduction rather than tax increases and 
it would already be committed to debt reduction and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take another tack. This government never ceases to 
tell us that it has a great and enlightened social conscience, 
that its real priority is helping people and caring for the 
disadvantaged.  Therefore for the purposes of this debate at 
least, I am going to take that profession at face value. I will 
therefore present the argument for debt retirement and tax relief 
from an entirely social perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to present the House with the argument that high debt and 
high taxes are socially irresponsible, that they hurt millions of 
people, that they carry a heavy social cost.  I want to argue 
that debt relief and tax relief are not only fiscally beneficial 
but they are socially beneficial, that they help millions of 
people, including the most vulnerable members of society. Then 
let the Canadian people see if the government is really as 
committed to social responsibility as it claims to be. Let us see 
if it can be moved by social arguments to give the highest 
priority to debt reduction and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start with the negative social impacts of pyramiding debt 
and interest payments.  The pyramiding of the debt of the federal 
government to $583 billion has led as I said to annual interest 
payments of $45 billion or $3,200 per year per person, for every 
working Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This annual debt service bill is enough to run the governments 
of Newfoundland, P.E.I., Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and Alberta for an entire year with enough left over 
to pay the entire public debts of Newfoundland, New Brunswick and 
P.E.I. This annual debt service bill is enough to pay the tuition 
for four million Canadian young people to finish a four year 
university course. Just the annual debt service bill is enough to 
pay for federal transfers to the provinces for health, education, 
welfare, equalization and old age security for a year. 
It is enough to pay for all Canadian hospitals, physicians and 
drug costs for an entire year.  It is enough to provide every 
poor child in Canada with a $30,000 a year endowment.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the interest on the federal debt that is eating the heart 
out of the social transfers.  It is no accident that since 1993 
debt service charges have increased by $7.5 billion a year and 
that since 1994 government has reduced health and social 
transfers to the provinces by $7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excessive federal debt, like private debt, limits freedom. 
It limits the freedom of governments to pursue social as well as 
economic goals.  The federal government would have at least the 
option of committing more resources to health, education, and 
pensions if this huge percentage of its annual budget was not 
consumed by interest payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal debt were reduced and stabilized, funding for 
essential services would be stabilized and assured. The 
government and people of Canada would have more social and 
economic freedom and we would stop mortgaging the future of young 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower debt is the key to social security for both the current 
and future generations of Canadians.  I would suggest to those 
members of this House who profess to have enlightened social 
consciences, who profess to be moved by social arguments, that if 
they care for the poor, the sick, the old and the young, then 
they should be the most committed members in this House to the 
reduction of the federal debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me look at the negative social impacts of excessive 
taxation.  We have made arguments in this House before that 
excessive taxes reduce disposable incomes of business and are the 
greatest factor in killing jobs.  There is a connection between 
the fact that we have higher taxation levels than our principal 
trading partners and the fact that we have 1.4 million people 
unemployed, two to three million underemployed and one of the 
highest youth unemployment rates in the world.  If a good job 
with a good income is the best guarantee of economic and social 
security, then it is excessive taxation in this country which is 
undermining the economic and social security for millions of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to discuss a further dimension of excessive taxation.  It 
has a particularly onerous and insidious impact on the most 
vulnerable among us, the young, the old and the poor.  Under this 
federal government's tax policies a single mother with one child 
and an income of $15,000 pays $1,364 in income tax.  I ask, what 
is the government doing taking one paycheque out of 12 from a 
single mother with one child making $15,000 a year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government starts taxing people at lower income 
levels, $6,500 a year, than either Britain where it starts at 
$9,000 a year, or the United States where it starts at $9,500 a 
year.  Canada has one of the lowest first bite levels, the level 
at which personal income tax kicks in, in the industrial world. 
It is far lower than those in Hong Kong, Sweden, France, 
Switzerland, Japan, the U.S., Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain. 
In fact taxpayers in most countries are permitted to earn upward 
of $15,000 before they begin paying taxes.  Not in Canada and we 
ask, why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government rips $1.8 billion out of the pockets of people 
making less than $15,000 a year.  The government takes $11.2 
billion out of the pockets of almost eight million taxpayers 
making less than $30,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, and we have heard this from the ministers, 
accepts Statistics Canada's low income cutoff figures as measures 
of the number of Canadians living in poverty.  But here is the 
amount of revenue the federal government collects from these very 
people whom it claims to recognize as living in poverty or near 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, the low income cutoff for a 
single individual was around $17,000 a year.  Taxation statistics 
show us that in 1995, which is the year for the latest data, 
there were almost 3.4 million taxpayers earning less than $17,000 
a year, or that were in this low income position.  What did the 
federal government do for them?  It taxed them to the tune of 
$2.3 billion.  These are people the government itself says are 
living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The low income cutoff for a family of four in the same city was 
about $32,000. There were over 8.2 million taxpayers earning less 
than $32,000. 
What did the federal government do?  It taxed those people to the 
tune of $12.5 billion.  It took $12.5 billion in taxes from 
people its own statistics define as living in poverty or near 
poverty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the tax policies and practices of the federal 
government hurt lower income people as well as middle and higher 
income people.  The greatest single thing this government can do 
to help the poor is not to develop another program for poverty 
and not to develop another program on child poverty but simply to 
get its hands out of the pockets of lower income people and leave 
them more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough statistics.  To illustrate this point more effectively, I 
want to read to the House a letter I received from a New 
Brunswick mother of four in February 1997.  Her name is Kim 
Hicks.  She lives near Sackville, New Brunswick and she and her 
family are with us today in the gallery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I receive some 2,000 letters a month on average, but her letter 
was one of the best I have ever received.  I want to share 
it with the House.  It is dated February 27, 1997: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Mr. Manning: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hello, first of all my name is Kim Hicks.  I am married and we 
have four children aged 2-8 years.  My husband is the breadwinner 
in our family and our income is $29,000 to $30,000 a year 
approximately.  Last year, 1996, our income was a little over 
$33,000 because we withdrew our RRSPs, my husband worked a lot of 
overtime and took his vacation pay without a vacation, which 
means that we now owe $900 in income tax, and lose money on our 
GST and child tax benefit which we depend on to get by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is this.  We feel as though we are drowning with no 
sign of relief in sight.  I have talked to other families in the 
same situation and they feel the same way.  It seems as though 
people like us are forgotten.  We are not considered working 
poor, but we sure don't feel middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you are probably thinking that I am a whining lazy stay 
at home mom, who was irresponsible in having four children, but 
we love them dearly and we want to do what we feel is best for 
them and that is why I stay at home.  Truthfully sometimes we do 
feel that we were irresponsible but my husband works hard. Also 
we live in an area outside Sackville, New Brunswick and it would 
not be easy to get child care or transportation.  I have no 
special skills and cannot afford to upgrade my working skills and 
quite frankly I feel that at this point in time my kids need me 
at home, not that by any means I look down on working women. I 
don't, I sometimes envy them.  I'm sorry there is so much that I 
want to say but don't quite know how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel resentment toward the politicians and afraid to be 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband says maybe we should go on welfare, at least then we 
would have health care and dental benefits.  We do manage to buy 
some health care, but for how long we don't know.  It seems as 
though only people with incomes under $26,000 a year and those on 
welfare need help, and that is not true.  There are other 
families who need help.  We want our kids to grow up feeling 
proud of their country and to feel secure, but it's not going to 
happen.  For us who fall just above the $26,000 mark less seems 
better, then maybe we wouldn't have to worry that because we make 
$29,000 or $30,000 we might lost our child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need that benefit or else we would lose our home.  Our kids 
won't be going to the dentist this year, but the child down the 
road, whose mom is on welfare, will.  We have refinanced and 
refinanced and we just can't do it any more.  We live on credit 
because we do not have enough clear money to use money.  Pay the 
needed payment and then borrow it over.  We are sick of it. 
People with four kids who make $30,000 a year are poor too, but 
our kids don't count.  By the time we pay our taxes our $29,000 
to $30,000 is a joke.  We are afraid that we are going down and 
there is nothing we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promises and empty talk—we are sick of it.  We are trying to be 
a family in a time when family means squat. Also now with this 
new HST we will pay more for our kids' clothing, heat, power, 
telephone.  We don't buy big ticket items.  We pray our washer 
will wash one more load, and that it will be nice out so that we 
can put our clothes on the line to save on electricity and so 
that the squeaky drier will be there when we need it.  We, again, 
are going to lose and so will our kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'm sorry for this long letter.  I really don't know what I 
expect.  I wrote to Mr. Axworthy when he was human resources 
minister.  I got an I'm sorry and an I understand and a lot of 
statistics that I don't care about.  It won't help us feed or 
clothe our kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please don't send me one of those short form letters saying 
that you're sorry.  Also please don't tell me to contact my MLA or 
premier—they don't care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kim Hicks 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are members moved by that letter? 
What do we say to Kim Hicks and others like her?  What does the 
government have to say?  What does the finance minister have to 
say?  What does the finance committee report have to say?  Would 
this create a great impression in that home if it were sent in a 
paper envelope to that family?  Here is the answer to your 
problems.  We know what kind of reaction it would get.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first read this I was at a loss for words.  That is quite 
an admission from a politician.  Let me tell the House what I 
finally did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote Kim back, thanking her, assuring her she was not alone. 
I wondered whether anything I could say would help.  My letter 
was almost apologetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then shared with her, briefly, the tax relief section of our 
fresh start election platform.  We were working on it at that 
time.  I pointed out that under those tax relief measures she and 
her husband would receive $2,500 to $3,000 in tax relief.  In 
effect, a family like this would have been removed from the 
federal income tax rolls altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not hear back from Kim, but I carried her letter around 
with me through the 1997 federal election campaign.  I read it to 
public audiences in a number of places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After it was over I wrote her again and I told Kim that we were 
not the government but we were now the official opposition.  I 
asked her if she and her family would do a little research 
project for us.  I would send her a research contract and a 
cheque from party funds for $3,000 plus.  What I asked her to do 
was to pretend that the cheque came from Revenue Canada as a tax 
refund.  I asked her to pretend it was a $3,000 tax refund from 
Revenue Canada, as if our tax relief measures had been 
implemented and applied to the 1996 tax year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, we had to send her $3,000 plus.  Why?  To cover 
the income tax she would have to pay on the $3,000 so that her 
net refund would be $3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I asked Kim to do two things.  I asked her to write two 
more letters, one telling us how she and her husband Wayne spent 
the $3,000.  What would she do with it if she got it from Revenue 
Canada?  I also asked her to tell me frankly what impact, if any, 
this had on her feelings of entrapment and despair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to read into the record the first of those two 
letters received from Kim.  Before I do, let me give members a 
little quiz.  If they have a pad in front of them they might just 
jot down a few notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do they think a mother of four would spend that refund of 
$3,000?  Do they believe she would spend it all?  Do they think 
she would save a portion?  What do they think she would spend it 
on?  What would be the allocation?  Do they think she would spend 
it wisely or foolishly?  Do they think she would spend it more 
wisely than the federal government could spend it on her behalf? 
We will let the members be the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is her first letter, dated July 23, 1997: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Mr. Manning: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following letter describes how my family spent the $3,000 in 
tax relief that we received “from Revenue Canada”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was willing to play the game. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband and I carefully looked at how to best use the money 
and we decided that the best plan for us was to divide the money 
into a spend category and a savings category.  We divided the 
money $2,000 and $1,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $2,000 we spent as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. The first thing this money enabled us to do was to pay our 
two older boys' dentist bill and gave us the amount needed for 
our two younger sons' trip to the dentist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. The next thing we did was to set aside $200 for one of our 
son's visits to the optometrist in October, and to have a new 
pair of glasses which are badly needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. We bought the extra wood that we will need for the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>4. We paid off one of our credit card balances thereby easing 
our monthly payment load, which in turn gives us a bit more money 
to use toward other bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. The boys and I went shopping for back to school clothing and 
I set aside money for their school books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6. I took a trip to the grocery store and bought the items that 
we needed but could not afford to buy with our weekly grocery 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>7. I paid my mother back the money that she has loaned us over 
the past few months when we have found ourselves in a bind owing 
over $800 in income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>8. Lastly we decided to take $200 of the money and to spend it 
any way we wished.  We bought Kentucky Fried Chicken and we went 
to see the movie “George of the Jungle”. My husband, along with 
his regular hours, has had to start working Saturday mornings and 
also two to three evenings a week to help make ends meet.  He 
only takes one week of his vacation and we use the other week's 
vacation pay to buy wood.  What this means is that we have never 
taken a vacation trip with our children, but this year we are 
taking the $125 left from the $2000 and we are driving to Pictou, 
taking the ferry to P.E.I. and driving back across the bridge to 
N.B.  It feels great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the other $1,000 that we have left, we for now have put it 
into a savings account to use in the case of an emergency or to 
hopefully buy an RRSP, which would give us a start at some future 
savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in a nutshell is how we spent the $3,000 sent to us by 
Revenue Canada.  I am looking forward to writing my next letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sincerely, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kim Hicks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can look at that letter as a husband and parent or I can look 
at it as a former management consultant and economist, but notice 
that her savings rate is over 33%.  If I asked some economist 
friends of mine what they thought the savings rate would be of a 
family in the $30,000 a year category, they would never guess 
that it would be 33%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notice that her highest priority expenditure is meeting the 
medical and educational needs of her children.  Notice the 
commitment to debt reduction.  There is more commitment to debt 
reduction in this letter than there is from a government that 
receives $150 billion a year.  She pays down her loans and her 
credit card balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note the spending on essentials, wood and groceries for the 
family.  Note the desire to have an RRSP.  There is a lot of 
criticism when we talk about expanding the RRSP about people at 
the lower and income level not wanting it or understanding it. 
Here is a family earning $30,000 willing to save to put into an 
RRSP.  Notice the $200, 7%, for a little fun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any member in this House, any bureaucrat at human 
resources development or finance, who has the nerve to stand up 
and say they could have spent that money more wisely or more 
socially responsibly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the social engineers on the other side of the House or 
among the Bloc or the NDP might argue that some government could 
design a program complete with legislation, forms and armies of 
bureaucrats and social workers which would deliver $1,000 to that 
family for debt relief, $1,000 through another program for child, 
dental and optometrist care, and $500 to $1,000 through some 
other program for essentials.  However, there would be one 
problem with that. It would probably cost us $30,000 per family 
to administer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, we got exactly the same results, not with another 
program but simply by leaving—and this is so pathetically 
simple—$3,000 of this family's own money in their own pockets 
instead of collecting it in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of that famous quote from Adam Smith in his 
<I>Wealth of Nations</I>, which I think is applicable to social 
capital as well as industrial capital: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in 
what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only 
load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an 
authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single 
person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would 
nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly 
and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did this tax relief make this family feel? Frankly, I 
confess that when I wrote this letter to Kim and made this 
proposition I was pretty sceptical, given the feelings she 
expressed in that first letter, that the $3,000 would make much 
of a difference.  I thought it would just be a drop in the bucket 
and not enough to do anything.  However, I want members to be the 
judge.  This is her last letter in response to my request: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Mr. Manning, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be happy to explain to you how receiving $3,000 in tax 
relief “from Revenue Canada” has made my family feel both now 
and for the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the officials of Revenue Canada if they did more of 
this they would get letters like this. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first feeling my husband and I experienced was a sense of 
relief.  It was as if a weight had been lifted from our shoulders 
and we could finally catch our breath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It meant that we could have the money for those things that kept 
having to be overlooked such as trips to the dentist, borrowed 
money that couldn't be paid back, or a simple family trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It meant for the first time in a very long while that we could 
have some guilt-free fun. By this I mean we actually took our 
children to the movies and out for supper without sitting there 
worrying about “how are we going to get the money to replace 
what we just spent, when we didn't have it to spend in the first 
place?”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But most importantly, after the initial feeling of relief, we 
felt less pressure and worry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a family struggling to get by there is a lot of guilt and 
insecurity associated with the pressure of just trying to make 
ends meet when there is a lack of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband feels guilty because, even though he works hard, he 
still feels that as a provider he lets his family down, not only 
financially but time wise also.  I feel guilty because as a stay 
at home mom I sometimes feel I am robbing my family of income we 
could have if I held a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this guilt affects our family life—the way we feel, the 
tension and stress.  We do manage to keep our emotions and worry 
in check, most times, in hopes that we will not cause our 
children to feel as we do, although I know there are times when 
they feel as we do—receiving this money made my husband and me 
feel a lot less guilty.  I actually saw a happier, more relaxed 
man, which in turn made our family more carefree and closer than 
we have been in a while.  I'm not saying that money in itself 
solves problems, but it helps to relieve the pressures caused by 
a lack of it and that in turn helps to give us a brighter outlook 
and a happier family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Manning, as I write this letter I feel really great because I 
know that we have provided some of the things that our children 
needed, which prior to receiving our tax relief cheque we simply 
could not do.  I have gone to sleep at night with a feeling of 
being more secure because I know that our kids have been better 
taken care of and that if a problem should arise we do have money 
set aside in a savings account.  It feels great to know that we 
have fewer bills and that because we do not have to borrow money 
or take from other needs, we will be able to hold on, and that 
the money won't be so tight, and in time we will be ahead. And 
that means, to us, a brighter future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes my husband and me feel a sense of encouragement knowing 
that we have someone in government who understands our needs and 
our struggles as a family, and who realizes the heavy tax burden 
that a family like mine carries, and is trying to help, and that 
gives us a sense of hope for our future and our children's 
future.  Our children can grow up knowing that Canada is 
wonderful and that they have a government who cares, not one that 
will squeeze every last cent out of their paycheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that we have to have this tax relief.  We really carry 
too much tax burden.  Recently my husband asked his boss for a 
raise and, to us, he received a substantial raise of $44/week, 
that is until he received his paycheque and realized he had lost 
$27 of the $44.  Mr. Manning, $24.18 went to Federal Taxes alone! 
Do you understand why I cannot say enough about why a $3,000 tax 
relief is needed?  Families like my own do not want the $3,000 
for frivolous spending; we need it to maintain a half-decent 
standard of life for our families, and $3,000 is a substantial 
amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I just want to stress again that this $3,000 meant 
relief and security and a bit more freedom for us.  If my family 
and families like mine could look forward to this $3,000 tax 
relief each year, it would, I am sure, restore some faith in our 
government and it would relieve a lot of guilt, pressure, and 
worry from our lives.  We could provide more of the things our 
families need, both necessities and even leisure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extra income in our pocket would give us a sense of security.  We 
could actually see some light at the end of the tunnel, so to 
speak.  I know in my case it has helped to take away some of the 
desperation I feel.  It has definitely made our lives easier and 
has made us feel happier and even encouraged.  There is great 
pleasure in feeling that you have provided for your family a 
little bit better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to close now.  I hope—that I have answered your 
question sufficiently.  Thank you once again for the privilege of 
allowing my family to participate in this research project.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Note the references to feelings of relief, security and freedom: 
relief from worry, relief from guilt, security, better able to 
sleep at night, hope for the future and freedom.  I wonder how 
many letters Revenue Canada gets like that.  Is it not about time 
we started generating some letters like that for Revenue Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of members of Parliament I thank Kim Hicks; her

Luke for sharing their hearts and their lives with us.  It is not 
easy to do and we thank you for putting it down on paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of thousands of families in Canada like Kim's 
earning $30,000 a year or less from whom the federal government 
is collecting $11.2 billion a year.  Is there any member of the 
House who still believes that tax relief, especially for lower 
and middle income families, is not a socially responsible thing 
to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began my remarks with a reference to the Christmas story as 
told in the New Testament.  The heart of my remarks has really 
been the Kim Hicks story which ought to move us to tears as well 
as to action.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to end this address with one more story that will perhaps 
reduce the Minister of Finance to tears or induce him to action. 
It is a modern adaptation of Dickens <I>Christmas Carol</I> with 
particular reference to the issue before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once upon a time there was a finance minister named Scrooge.  To 
borrow a few adjectives from Dickens, he was a squeezing, 
wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old finance 
minister.  His one great passion in life was taxes, and as the 
year drew to an end he would spend the last part of it, 
particularly the Christmas season, laying plans for new taxes he 
wanted to impose in the new year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scrooge had a humble clerk named Bob Hatchet.  Hatchet assisted 
the minister in cutting spending but desperately wanted to apply 
his tools to cutting taxes.  This particular year Hatchet came to 
Scrooge with the revelation that he, Scrooge, was collecting $1.8 
billion a year from the poorest families in the land.  “Would it 
not” said Hatchet “be a great act of social and fiscal 
responsibility to cut taxes for these people and to announce it 
at Christmas, effective for the new year?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the response of finance minister Scrooge to this 
proposal?  He replied as he always did to requests for tax relief 
by saying “Bah, humbug”  and by saying further “every idiot 
who goes about with tax relief on his lips, especially at 
Christmastime, should be boiled in his own pudding and buried 
with a stake of holly through his heart”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add force to his words, he told Hatchet and his other 
officials that not only would there be no tax relief this 
Christmas, but starting January 1 he would commence collecting 
the first instalment of a 76% hike in payroll taxes.  “Tax 
relief, bah, humbug” said finance minister Scrooge, and with 
that he went home for Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it was Christmas Eve.  Picture this.  Scrooge had retired 
early.  To induce sleep some people count sheep but not Scrooge. 
He counted the tax increases that he had been responsible for: 
the tax on life insurance premiums extended, the increased 
clawback on OAS, the excise tax on gasoline, et cetera, et 
cetera.  He had just got up to tax increase number 37 when he 
fell into a fitful slumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scrooge knew not how long he had slumbered but suddenly he was 
awakened by a strange clanking sound.  To his horror, the door of 
his room flew open and there stood a ghostly apparition.  The 
thing was dragging a huge chain behind it to which were bound 
immense volumes of the Canadian Income Tax Act and its 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Who are you” cried finance minister Scrooge, to which the 
apparition replied in a ghoulish voice “I am the ghost of taxes 
past.  My name is Sir William Thomas White.  I too was once 
finance minister of Canada.  When I was alive I introduced the 
Income War Tax Act in 1917.  It was only 12 pages long.  It was 
temporary.  It was a tiny tax.  But I added to it and my 
successors added to it, until it became a monster.  Now I am 
condemned to haunt the halls of parliament, forever dragging 
great volumes of the Income Tax Act and its regulations behind 
me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scrooge was alarmed, for he too had forged many links in the 
chain of taxation.  “Is this my fate too” he cried.  “Not 
necessarily” said the spirit.  “All will depend on what you 
learn from the visits of my fellow spirits, the ghost of taxes 
present and the ghost of taxes future”.  With that, the 
apparition disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finance minister Scrooge tried to pull himself together.  Surely 
this was a bad dream, he told himself, a Reformish nightmare of 
some sort; perhaps the product of indigestion; perhaps a bad 
pickle at the parliamentary restaurant.  He settled down to sleep 
but in a few moments he was jolted awake again by the loud 
honking of a horn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first he thought it was the sound of a Panamanian freighter 
and he smiled serenely, but suddenly the door to his bedroom flew 
open and there stood another ghostly figure.  “I am here to take 
you for a ride” said the ghost of taxes present.  “But I don't 
want to go for a ride” said finance minister Scrooge. “That's 
what they all say” said the apparition who hurried him down the 
stairs, out of the house and into a waiting cab, a taxicab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as they were in, the doors locked shut.  The meter began 
to run.  It ran wild as the ghost of taxes present directed the 
driver to their destination.  The ghost of taxes present took 
finance minister Scrooge to visit businesses small and large 
where payroll taxes were cursed out loud day after day by both 
employers and employees.  They visited shops where the hated GST 
was funnelling millions of dollars out of the pockets of 
shopkeepers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ghost of taxes present took finance minister Scrooge to home 
after home, homes where there were sick people, homes where there 
were poor people, homes where there were old people, homes of the 
middle class, all homes where Scrooge's taxes were squeezing the 
life out of men, women, children and families. 
Scrooge tried to get out of the cab but the doors were locked. 
The meter kept spinning wildly, the taxi meter: $50 billion, $75 
billion, $100 billion, $125 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxi stopped once more outside a house which Scrooge 
recognized as the humble abode of his assistant Bob Hatchet. 
Inside he saw poor Bob talking earnestly to his son, Tiny Tim. He 
was trying to explain how the working income supplement component 
of Scrooge's child tax benefit, when applied to Scrooge's 
harmonized goods and services tax, would actually reduce the 
effective tax rate on crutches and candy canes to less than 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Tiny Tim would have none of it.  Holding his head in his 
hands the little fellow ran round the room crying “God save us, 
everyone, from finance minister Scrooge”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Dread Spirit” cried finance minister Scrooge “where will all 
this end?  What is the fate of these poor overtaxed businesses, 
these poor overtaxed families like Tiny Tim's?  What will happen 
to their lives and their dreams?”  “You will soon see” said 
the ghost of taxes present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scrooge found himself once again in the taxicab, hurtling this 
time down a lonely country road.  The night was dark and dreary, 
black clouds blotted out the moon and stars.  The taxi slowly 
came to a halt.  The door was slowly opened by yet another 
ghostly figure.  Finance minister Scrooge shuddered, the ghost of 
taxes future.  This apparition was faceless, dressed all in 
black.  He said not a word but motioned toward the gate of what 
Scrooge perceived to be a vast cemetery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scrooge shivered as the faceless spirit led him past a long line 
of tombstones, announcing in a sepulchral voice “Here lie the 
businesses killed by taxation.  Here lie the jobs killed by high 
taxes.  Here lie the charities killed by high taxes, which 
shrivelled the spirit of charity”.  “Oh, spare me” cried 
Scrooge, but the spirit led him on “In this vast plot lie all 
the dreams: the dreams of entrepreneurs, the dreams of 
homemakers, the dreams of business people, the dreams of youth, 
the dreams of Tiny Tim, all killed by the clammy hand of 
overtaxation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Oh, show me no more ” cried finance minister Scrooge.  “I 
see the light.  I will re-examine my policies but tell me, dread 
spirit, how is it that even dreams can be killed by taxation?” 
“Even the loftiest of dreams can be killed by taxation” said 
the ghost of taxes future. “Look” and with this he pointed bony 
finger toward a huge marble monument, a tomb of some sort on 
which was inscribed a long list of names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scrooge strained to read the names:  Sir William Thomas White, 
James Lorimer Ilsley, Douglas Charles Abbott, Donald Methuen 
Fleming, Walter Lockhart Gordon, Edgar John Benson, John C. 
Crosbie, Michael Holcombe Wilson.  The list went on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scrooge gasped as he recognized the names, all former finance 
ministers of Canada. “But why, dread sprit, are their names 
inscribed on this tomb in this cemetery of dreams?” “Because” 
said the ghost of taxes future “their great dream was to become 
prime minister and their dream was killed by their high tax 
policies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us leave finance minister Scrooge standing before that great 
monument to broken dreams and let the government determine 
whether this story has a happy or a mournful ending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will finance minister Scrooge dismiss the warnings of the ghosts 
of taxes past, present and future and continue his high taxing 
ways?  Or, will he listen to the voices of social and fiscal 
responsibility, the voices of Reform, the voices of mothers like 
Kim Hicks, the voices of millions of Canadians, and make debt and 
tax relief his new priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the objective of the official opposition to persuade him 
to take the latter course.

his government's economic policies to the Canadian public.  The 
finance committee held fifty or so meetings with socioeconomic 
stakeholders and members of the public in order to find out what 
they thought, but the democratic process ends there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having being rushed along on a tight timetable and having seen 
large extracts of the finance committee's report in the Toronto

party's opinion would be known and not drowned out in this vast 
federal operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, we are here solely to defend Quebec's 
interests.  We in the Bloc Quebecois again call on the Minister of 
Finance to pay the provinces, particularly Quebec, what he owes 
them. Before going ahead with other measures involving national 
standards that would interfere with provincial areas of 
jurisdiction, this government must treat its provincial partners 
fairly and return to them the amounts it has relieved them of since 
1993, significant amounts despite what the Minister of Finance 
says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Quebec, this means that, if the Minister of Finance wanted 
to be generous, he would write out a nice cheque for $5 billion. 
Dream on.  We no longer believe in Santa Claus or in the federal 
government's little helpers.  We know that, even though this 
government comes dressed in the traditional red of the jolly 
gentleman himself, it is a Santa without a heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few months, this scrooge in Santa's clothing has 
deprived dozens of Quebec parents of their fundamental rights by 
slashing EI benefits.  Even as the holiday season approaches, the 
Minister of Finance and his side-kick in human resources 
development are all in favour of these decisions, which I still 
describe as inhumane.  They still refuse to budge and admit that 
their wonderful employment insurance scheme is a failure and that 
they should start calling it poverty insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of having compassion for the least well off in our 
society, this government continues to listen to Toronto's Bay 
Street magnates.  The Minister of Finance keeps saying that his 
government is doing a good job and that, next year, it will have a 
surplus.  What he does not say is that this accounting operation 
has been accomplished on the backs of the provinces and the most 
disadvantaged.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government ought to stimulate job creation and to 
lead an all-out attack against poverty.  The Bloc Quebecois and the 
numerous stakeholders in Quebec are demanding an in-depth reform of 
personal and corporate income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last major review of corporate tax dates back to the 
1960s.  I hardly need tell you that the tax measures are out of 
date and unsuited to the present economic context.  The Minister of 
Finance, however, is content with it.  The same goes for personal 
income tax.  The minister is operating with measures that no longer 
meet the needs of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois proposals, in a spirit of re-establishing 
social justice, would allow the majority of taxpayers to benefit 
from a tax reduction.  For example, the creation of a reimbursable 
credit for child care expenses would allow a single parent with one 
child and an income of $20,000 to save an additional $600 plus. 
That is a concrete social measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is talking of decreasing income and other 
taxes.  First of all, it shouldo do as the Bloc Quebecois has done, 
and demand a major reform of a federal tax system that is very ill 
suited to the current economic context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the auditor general tables a report, he points out 
to the federal government the shortcomings of its taxation system. 
We need only think about the scandal of the family trusts and the 
use of subsidiaries in tax havens, which the Minister of Finance in 
fact uses to reduce his taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prebudget consultations clearly show, once again, that 
there are two irreconcilable visions.  The federal government wants 
to centralize everything, establish national standards and continue 
to infringe on the exclusive rights of the provinces.  Quebec wants 
to fight for its independence and speaks out increasingly in an 
effort to force the Liberal government to respect provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current situation is as follows, and I will recall it for 
you: Canada comprises two peoples, the Canadian people and the 
Quebec people.  However, the people of Quebec are making themselves 
heard increasingly, and Quebeckers are living in hope. 
They know that very soon they will no longer be part of this 
completely outmoded federal system, a Trudeauist government whose 
grand master never hid his disdain for the provinces.  Trudeauism 
is personified in this House by the minister of provincial 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this government takes every opportunity to 
twist its own Constitution and meddle in fields under Quebec 
jurisdiction.  It is obsessed with making its presence felt.  In 
Quebec, however, the fleur de lys is engraved on the hearts of 
Quebeckers and with this symbol of pride they will fend off the 
underhanded attacks of the federal government saying with one 
voice: “Yes to a sovereign Quebec; yes to all economic powers 
serving Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier 
(Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know I speak next, but I am most anxious to ask a 
question of my colleague, the member for Lotbinière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has, as it were, travelled across Canada with the 
Standing Committee on Finance, even though he himself sits on the 
public accounts committee.  He has therefore heard some horror 
stories this fall, particularly in the maritimes and eastern 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that, when he was there, my colleague heard the 
stories of fishermen and the problems they are having with EI. 
I will tell one of his stories.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People on TAGS have been saddled with a new two-tier system. 
When they reach an income level of $26,000, they must pay back all 
the EI they have received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government wants to encourage people to get out and work. 
Imagine that you are a fisherman, that you have been on the program 
all year, but that, this fall, you have a chance to go back to 
catching herring, say, or to get involved in an experimental sea 
urchin fishery. 
All the money you make from the catch must go back to the 
government.  This is no kind of incentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my colleague has heard other horror stories and I 
would like him to tell us—it must have been something when they 
wrote their report—about the mechanism for setting the provision. 
They say in the report that they will set a provision for expenses 
but, if the forecasts are not right, they will not be able to 
transfer amounts to programs.  Does he know anything about how this 
mechanism?  Can he tell us the Liberals' untold horror stories?  I 
would like to hear what my hon. colleague has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, when I visited the maritime 
provinces, especially Newfoundland, despair and frustration were 
everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider that there is only one official, we can see how 
serious the federal government is. There was only one official to plan 
this program, which is a real fiasco, a real nightmare for the people. 
The people were not consulted and were forced to undergo training for 
which they had no skills or abilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the federal government is trying to tell Newfoundland 
that it wants to help. The premier of Newfoundland, who used to sit in 
this House, has difficulty promoting the cause of the federal 
government. His star is fading, like all the other federal stars across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for that famous report, as I said, all that is missing is the 
cover of the Liberal red book. Everything else is the same. 
Everything that could help the communities, everything that could help 
the underprivileged was removed. The only thing on their mind is Bay 
Street in Toronto and the rich; they have forgotten their social 
conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier 
(Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this subject today, but I am 
sad to see the lack of empathy from the Liberal government over 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to explain.  When I was young, I was told that the 
Liberal Party was the party that had created social programs, the 
party that thought about the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The NDP is the one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> But we were not too familiar with the NDP 
in my neck of the woods.  Now I have come to appreciate my NDP 
colleagues in this House.  We were also told that the Conservatives 
were a bit more to the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what it seems to me from reading the report from the 
finance committee is that the Liberals were voted in on the left 
but are governing on the right. 
I will not use any more semantics at their expense, but that is my 
impression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to say today is about the real world of the 
Liberals.  A few Liberal MPs are okay.  I will tell the House of my 
experience in recent days.  In the last ten days, over the end of 
November and the beginning of December, the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans, of which I am a member, travelled the lower 
North Shore, the Magdalen Islands, New Brunswick, the Miramichi, 
Nova Scotia, and all around Newfoundland, including Labrador.  My 
goodness, a public servant or a minister is a rare sight for the 
people of Labrador, yet they often find their resources being 
drained away by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to say is that there were five parties in on this 
tour, and I hope we will be able to table a unanimous report. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of our trip was to hear what people had to say 
about the Atlantic groundfish strategy.  We wanted to find out what 
they had liked about it, what they did not, and what they would 
like to see follow it.  If the hon. members here in the House do 
not already all know this, we were told last year before the 
elections that TAGS was to end in May 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told the committee members that we needed to hurry up, that 
we needed to go and see the people where they lived, and to get 
back to the House before Christmas.  We did so, but tabling our 
report is taking a bit of time. 
That is why I am pleased to intervene today and to share the 
impressions I gathered, but in a rather unpremeditated way, as I 
have no written report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are afraid that TAGS will not be renewed.  People are 
afraid that the government will not keep its word.  This is a 
program that was designed to end in 1999.  People are afraid it 
will end in 1998, because the situation has not changed.  The cod, 
the cod moratorium, the fisheries have not revived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of this program, there were close to 40,000 
or 45,000 people enrolled in the program.  People have lost their 
eligibility along the way, but there must still be a good 22,000 or 
25,000 today.  What are we to tell those 22,000 people who will no 
longer have a cheque in May 1998, but no job either? 
I think the government must give them some directives. It must 
inform them as soon as possible.  It would seem that the machinery 
of government grinds very slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are on TAGS did not ask to be there.  People on 
TAGS are anxious to get back to work, anxious to be able to do 
something.  They were put on a program, and to make it worse, when 
the auditor general brought in his report this fall, they got the 
impression that they were the ones at fault, because the government 
had transformed TAGS into a passive program.  It told them “Sit 
there and wait for your cheque, and don't say a word, not a 
word”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people are really upset.  Worse yet, not only do they not 
know what the government is going to do about renewing or 
maintaining the TAGS income security program, but we discover 
thanks to our NDP colleagues that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has provided funding in the amount of $350,000 to train 
Human Resources Development officials how to act in case of 
trouble, should fisheries workers ever get angry.  Does that make 
any sense?  What sort of a country is this?  What sort of a 
government is this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize in three lines what I heard.  I know the 
members opposite.  More than three lines and they are lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first line is what people told us when we toured with the 
fisheries committee.  We heard a lot of people. 
We travelled for ten days and visited three cities a day, with an 
average of 300 to 400 people in the room, so close to 10,000 people 
came to deliver a message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people wanted three things: first, more income security. 
There was no other option.  Take the example of the people of the 
Magdalen Islands.  There used to be a redfish processing plant 
called Madelipêche.  At one time it employed 600 people.  However, 
when you live on an island and cannot fish any more and there are 
no trees to cut and no chance of a job in tourism, what do you do? 
There is nothing else to do. They said they needed income support. 
That is the first point. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720
<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they told us “You MPs should tell the government to 
renegotiate in 1998 the distribution of resources.  Negotiate with 
the provinces, which you did not include the first time.  Negotiate 
with the plants.  But we have to know who will continue to fish, if 
the stocks ever recover, because everyone agrees that there may not 
be enough fish for everyone.  We want to know who will be redundant 
so that we who work in the processing plants can reorient 
ourselves.  But no one is saying anything.  They are saying “Now 
you have your little cheque, but pretty soon you will not have one 
any more”.  And they won't take that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the first thing is the bread and butter, maintaining the 
TAGS income support program. 
The second point is for all ministers of fisheries, both federal 
and provincial, to have a look at resource distribution in 1998. 
The third point demonstrates the pride of the people of the 
maritimes, be they from the Quebec coast, New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland or Nova Scotia.  They say: “Give us the tools to work. 
We need funds.  If you want us to diversify, give us money, not 
peanuts.  It is impossible to start up new industries without 
money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at length.  As members are paying attention, 
perhaps we could check whether there would be unanimous consent to 
allow me to continue for a few more minutes. I would like to make 
another point and I note the members seem willing to give their 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something about what Human Resources 
Development officials demand from the people participating in the 
TAGS program and trying to get out of it.  The limit is $26,000, 
while the income ceiling for EI recipients is $30,000 before they 
have to start paying the government back, but only at the rate of 
30% of what they earned over $39,000.  Fishers or processing plant 
workers with families and machinery to maintain lose their benefits 
as soon as they earn $26,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this trip, I met people who were trying to catch new 
species of fish.  They had earned a supplementary income.  What 
happened?  They had to give it back to Human Resources Development 
Canada. 
I met a man who has not had a cent coming in since September.  He 
is not entitled to welfare because he owns a home, poor soul, and 
a pickup to get to work. So he gets not one red cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what he told me, and I do not know how it will 
come across in English, but the cry from the heart was “Dear 
members of Parliament, I have had no money since September.  I am 
not an animal, I cannot just graze in a field”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Minister of Human Resources Development to 
come to my region and travel around to see the people, see what the 
real world is like.  He will see that he will change his tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am asking this today: if cabinet is not 
prepared to make a policy decision on maintaining TAGS, let the 
Minister of Finance establish in his provisions enough money so 
that, if a policy decision is reached in May, there will be enough 
money in his reserves to last all year. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With consent, we 
will take questions and comments right through to Private 
Members' Business so that the hon. member for Halifax will not be 
interrupted.  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Questions and 
comments, the hon. member for Thornhill.  We will keep them short 
and sweet and the responses short and sweet.  Then we will go to 
the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did 
listen very carefully to the member opposite as he described the 
important work that the fisheries committee did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken with members from my own caucus who were a 
significant number on that committee.  They too were seriously 
moved by the stories that they heard from the people who made 
presentations before the committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all know there is a serious problem.  The question 
that faces the government is how to respond in a way that will 
not only be helpful to those people who want to work, although 
the member talked about income support which is certainly an 
important part.  We know the people of the Atlantic region want 
their jobs and the ability to work in the fishery.  We also know 
there are problems with the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making my comment to the member, I would ask him if he has 
heard any suggestions from the people who made presentations to 
the committee that would help to resolve the issue of how people 
will be able to find work in order to sustain themselves rather 
than looking to income support as a long term situation for the 
Atlantic region. We all know what the real problem is. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, in order to get as many 
questions in as possible, since I know that there are people to my 
left who also want to ask some, and in order not to show disrespect 
for the hon. member, I shall be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation fisher communities are in cannot be fixed by the 
hon. member with a snap of her fingers.  My colleague for 
Lotbinière pointed out a minute ago the old TAGS program was 
created by just one public servant.  It took less than four months 
and has led to four years of horror stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What people are asking us is to give them a slice of bread and 
butter, because that is precisely all the government's income 
support represents to them, to continue it for at least a year, and 
to use that year to create a real program which, this time, will 
reflect the reality of coastal communities.  That is the answer I 
can give the hon. member for the moment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask my colleague a question, but first, I have a few 
comments to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what happened with TAGS, does it not resemble 
what happened with employment insurance?  The governments changed 
direction and paid out a lot of money to companies for 
technological change.  Once the technological changes were made, 
people were laid off.  People got laid off, and then there was the 
fisheries problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to the employment insurance of people who were 
laid off?  They were told the government did not want to pay 
employment insurance benefits any more, that no one was working, 
that their assistance was being cut and that the problem was that 
they did not want to work and were lazy. 
That is what the Liberal government said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there are not enough fish, perhaps as a result of 
overfishing.  Today the government is changing direction and doing 
the same thing again.  Now it says it has no money, that this is 
not the way to do things, that it will cut off families and 
children and that they will no longer be entitled to eat.  It is 
rather irresponsible on the part of the federal government, as my 
colleague was saying earlier, for it to sit for four years, rather 
than give the money immediately, and do nothing.  At the end of the 
four years it then says it will be cutting off aid and has nothing 
for them.  Is the government not being irresponsible?  Is my 
colleague prepared to support me on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said earlier, and I agree with him, that we 
have to keep giving money so these people can put food on the 
table, that we then have to find a solution to the problem instead 
of abandoning them.  That is one of my questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another quick question.  I would like him to be brief 
too in order to answer my two questions.  He came to New Brunswick. 
What happened to the committee, which did not invite people— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am very sorry, but time 
has run out.  The hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is too bad that we are 
coming to the end of the period set aside for debate.  I think 
that, if we had the unanimous consent of the House, my NDP friend 
and I could debate this issue all evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer his question clearly and briefly, yes, he is right. 
No only did the Liberal government throw it together quickly, but 
it did an amateur job of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They thought about 20,000 to 25,000 people would be interested 
in this program when it was first created, but over 40,000 applied. 
That is why TAGS was turned into a passive program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the NDP member is 100% right about this.  I think the 
Bloc and the NDP will have to get together to shake some sense into 
the Liberals because, unless we do, there will never be any more 
Liberals in Quebec and in the maritimes.

commission of offence under subsection 249(4) or 255(3) of the 
Criminal Code, regardless of the time within which death occurs 
at the time of the occurrence of the last event by means of which 
the person caused or contributed to the cause of death.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds like a convoluted phraseology but I will try to 
explain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law says that an individual commits criminal negligence 
causing death, and if the individual then commits an assault, the 
person is in the hospital and dies after a period of time, the 
perpetrator is not culpable.  The perpetrator cannot be charged 
because their victim took too long to die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ironic fact is that on September 4 the justice minister 
announced that she planned to introduce the exact same 
legislation as this bill.  Why the Liberals would not support 
this proposed legislation is nothing short of political 
manoeuvring. Waiting for the government to draft new legislation 
has resulted in more time being wasted.  It could have allowed 
another perpetrator to go free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-215 called for the scrapping of section 227 of the 
Criminal Code because section 227 now states that no person can 
be convicted of a homicide if the death occurs more than a year 
and a day from the time of the offence.  The private member's 
bill would have changed this in order to allow charges to be laid 
if the assault resulted in death, no matter how long the victim 
was able to hang on to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this bill stems from the death of Marvin Ward 
from Manitoba.  This gentleman never regained consciousness 
following a savage baseball attack in May 1995.  It took Mr. Ward 
14 months to pass away and the suspects then could not be 
charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is apparent from the cases such as this that section 227 of 
the Criminal Code does not recognize modern medicine's ability to 
keep people alive for an extended period of time.  The private 
member's bill would allow for those to face charges if the 
assault resulted in death, no matter how long the victim is 
alive. There would be no time limits. 
If the bill were passed, it would ultimately have meant that Mr. 
Ward's death would not have been in vain.  It would have proved 
that we as legislators can effectively change a badly flawed 
section of the Criminal Code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose has followed this issue since last 
October and had this private member's bill drafted in March of 
this year. It was fortunate that it was picked in the draw for 
Private Members' Business but this is where the good fortune 
ended because the committee that looks at private members' bills 
did not deem it to be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 4 the justice minister announced that she too was 
scrapping section 227 of the Criminal Code as early as this fall, 
fulfilling a promise made by the former justice minister in 
March.  On this premise alone the private member's bill should 
have been made votable but perhaps we can let the media decide or 
those who follow these issues can have a conversation about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we present the private member's bill in different manners. 
First of all I would like to present it in a way that is based on 
the criteria that the standing committee for Private Members' 
Business sets for the selection of votable items.  Perhaps we can 
let the people who are listening today be the judge to see if 
this bill meets the guidelines and should have been made votable 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 11 criteria that must be met in the selection of 
votable items.  The first criteria is the private member's bill 
must be of national, regional or local significance.  It cannot 
be highly contentious, controversial, trivial or insignificant. 
Certainly this bill would be considered to have national 
significance since it affects the Criminal Code of Canada and in 
no way is this bill contentious, controversial, trivial or 
insignificant.  It involves the death of individuals and the 
consequences thereof. It is essential then to change the section 
of the Criminal Code and not allow perpetrators to go free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number two, the bill must not appear to discriminate or 
favour for or against a certain area or region of the country. In 
no way does this bill discriminate in favour of a certain region 
or area of the country.  This bill would be applicable right 
across the country.   This is federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number three, the bill cannot be with regard to 
electoral boundaries or constituency names.  Obviously that 
category does not apply here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number four, the bill should not require obvious 
amendment because it is substantially redundant with the law or 
is fundamentally ineffective to implement its own intent or is 
unclear in its meaning or is otherwise defective in its drafting. 
Bill C-215 is not redundant with the laws that already exist, nor 
is it ineffective in its intent and meaning.  It is very clear. 
It is a very short bill.  It has a simple concept and is not 
defective in its drafting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number five, the subject of the bill should be 
different from specific matters already declared by the 
government to be on its legislative agenda.  This bill does not 
affect the government's legislative agenda at all.  That is the 
problem.  This bill is here because the government is failing to 
act.  It was drafted long before the government even talked about 
looking into the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number six, depending on the context of political 
issues and events, the number of times a topic has appeared in 
the House may be of significance.  This topic, as far as I know, 
has never appeared in the House of Commons before.  However, it 
does not mean that it is not an issue of interest to Canadians 
and many of the victims' associations across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number seven, all other factors being equal, lower 
priority should be given to motions which deal with matters which 
the House can address in some way other than through another 
procedure.  All in all this bill should receive a high priority 
since this cannot be dealt with through another procedure.  It is 
my opinion that it is essential that this bill be dealt with now 
as it already has let four killers go free and potentially more 
still exist because of the flaw in the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number eight, motions couched in partisan terms should 
not be selected.  There is really nothing partisan about this 
bill whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number nine, bills will be set aside in this selection 
process if they are clearly unconstitutional in that they 
infringe upon provincial legislative authority, the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms or other entrenched constitutional 
rules or if they impede or are contrary to normal federal, 
provincial or international relations.  This is not the case 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number ten, bills relating to a question that is 
substantially the same as a question already voted on by the 
House in the session should not be selected as votable items. 
This issue does not relate to any question that has been voted on 
by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criteria number eleven, items relating to a question that is 
substantially the same as a question contained in an item already 
selected as a votable item in the session should not be selected. 
Once again, no bills were selected as votable that appear the 
same as this one.

knowing that the killers were paying their dues and not walking

people must be held responsible for their actions and the

homicide victims the stupidity of the law that allows killers to 
escape proper charges and sentencing even if the death of the 
victim occurs as a direct result of the criminal's act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are no doubt aware, the Criminal Code has simply not kept 
up with modern medicine.  Severely injured people are being kept 
alive for extended periods of time today with possible hopes of 
recovery. The families of these victims are sometimes faced with 
the dilemma of allowing life support to be continued at a cost of 
having the murderer walk free if their loved one lives beyond one

the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully agree with him that it is opportune for this rule to be 
the subject of law reform.  This issue has been of great interest 
to the Minister of Justice in Manitoba, his immediate predecessor 
and Canadians such as Mark Ward, whose brother Marvin was the 
unfortunate victim of a vicious assault in 1995 which put him in 
a coma and ultimately resulted in his death, but outside the year 
and a day time limit.  They too have been arguing for reform.

death occurs within one year and one day from the time of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-215 seeks to remove the time limit from section 227.  In 
seeking to do so, it proposes to put in place a new section 227 
in the Criminal Code. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The historic origins of the year and a day rule go all the way 
back to the Middle Ages in England.  In those days, two distinct 
prosecutions could be brought with respect to a homicide: a private 
prosecution and a public one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purpose of simplifying private prosecutions, the 
Statute of Gloucester, passed in 1278, provided clearly that 
prosecution for a serious act causing death could stand, if members 
of the family began proceedings at the latest a year and a day 
after the act suspected of having caused the death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This simple statement of fact was subsequently interpreted, 
however, as limiting the right to prosecute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time, prosecution for death was repealed and the year and 
a day rule became an irrefutable requirement in cases of homicide; 
if the Crown could not prove that death had taken place during this 
period, there could not be culpable homicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ancient rule, an accident of history, survived the years, 
and was codified in Canada's first Criminal Code in 1892. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years three arguments have been offered in support of 
the rule.  One, a person should not remain almost indefinitely at 
risk of prosecution for murder or for another fatal offence. Two, 
if a person lives for a long time after the injury was sustained 
then it is more difficult to say that the injury caused the 
death.  Three, even when the rule applies, the accused can 
usually be convicted of a serious offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be little current support for the continued 
existence of the year and a day rule, however.  The following 
criticisms can and have been made. There is no statute of 
limitations for homicide in Canada and therefore a person can 
be subject to prosecution years after a killing has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this is an arbitrary rule which prevents justice from 
being done in certain cases.  Death may occur just outside the 
time limit and a causal link may be proven, yet in such a case 
there would be no culpable homicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it can also prevent justice from being done in cases 
involving long term causes of death.  Another argument is that 
with modern life supporting technology, persons can be kept alive 
longer, yet this ancient rule continues to operate. Modern 
science can also assist in the determination of the cause of 
death, even after the passage of a number of years, so the 
causation argument is not strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experiences in jurisdictions which do not have this rule seem to 
indicate that criminal justice systems can operate fairly and 
effectively without the rule. Last but not least, juries can and 
do have to consider complex evidence as to the cause of death, 
and if the crown does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
the accused caused the victim's death then the prosecution will 
fail. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1987, in a document entitled <I>Recodifying Criminal Law</I>, 
the Law Reform Commission of Canada recommended that a new rule of 
causation be added to the Criminal Code to replace the specific 
provisions on causal link with respect to homicide, including the 
year and a day rule.  In its working paper on homicide, the LRC 
took the following position: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 210—now section 227—which provides that no 
person commits culpable homicide unless the death occurs 
within a period of a year and a day seems highly 
anachronistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this rule was undoubtedly to spare a jury from 
having to rule on cases where the link between the 
reprehensible act and the victim's death was difficult to 
establish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, however, its usefulness is highly 
disputable, in so far as this matter can be satisfactorily 
resolved through existing medical and scientific knowledge. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1991 the federal-provincial working group on homicide 
recommended a rule of causation to replace sections 224 and 227 
of the Criminal Code to read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone causes death, when their conduct significantly 
contributes to death, notwithstanding that there may be other 
significant contributing factors and that such conduct may not 
alone have caused death. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the Department of Justice consulted on a possible 
general rule of causation for the Criminal Code as part of the 
consultations on the general part in 1994 and 1995, but to date a 
reform effort to codify a general rule of causation has not 
proceeded. 
In other jurisdictions change has already taken place.

consultation paper on the year and a day rule with respect to 
murder and other related offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paper outlines six options: one, maintain the rule; two, 
make it a rebuttable presumption; three, amend the rule and extend

replace it with a limitation regarding the prosecution of homicide

1996 abolishes the year and a day rule, except in cases of acts or 
omissions that had taken place before the legislation took effect. 
The act provides that it is necessary to obtain the consent of the 
attorney general before instituting proceedings in respect of an 
offence when it is alleged that the injuries that caused death were 
sustained more than three years before death, or in cases where the 
accused has already been found guilty of an offence related to the 
death.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1997 the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong issued its

having regard to the present state of modern medical knowledge 
and the availability of life support machines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission recommended that the rule ought to be abolished 
in relation to all offences involving death and suicide. It 
considered whether there ought to be safeguards to protect 
against unfair or late prosecutions but ultimately decided that 
it was unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, while there can be little doubt that change ought to 
occur, it may be premature to support this bill at this time.  I 
think we should look to see if there is any need for safeguards 
to be put in place, as has been done in England, for example.

I too, as a representative of the Bloc Quebecois, would like to 
congratulate the Reform Party member on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reflects a concern in his riding and throughout Canada as 
well, even in Quebec.  However, I think that examining section 227 
from this angle is not perhaps the best approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not give the historical context, as those who spoke 
before me have done, particularly the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Justice, but it should be pointed out that section 
227, as it stands, makes it easier for the crown to establish the 
link of causality. 
I do not want to go into great detail and give a lecture on law, 
but there are three things the crown must establish beyond a 
reasonable doubt when faced with an offence of this type or in any 
other legal case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is mens rea, actus reus and causal link.  In the first 
two instances, I think that the crown, through witnesses, through 
various means, through factual elements, can establish proof.  But 
without section 227, the crown would sometimes have trouble 
establishing the causal link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 227 is, therefore, not necessarily there to protect 
the accused at all times, as the Reform side has said so often. 
Sometimes, in Canada's legal history, since section 227 has been in 
existence, it has helped the Crown to demonstrate a causal link, 
when death did not occur at the precise moment the offence was 
committed, but days, weeks or months later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment presented by the Reform Party would remove this 
prescriptive period that prevents the Crown from using this causal 
link to prove its case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very clear, it removes all time limits. It states: 
<UL><UL>

the time of the occurrence of the last event by means of which 
the person caused or contributed to the cause of death.

system has to offer, a person can last two, three, four or five 
years, hooked up to machines and all manner of other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform member's bill were passed, we would be left in 
a kind of legal vacuum with respect to the offence, because the 
individual can be charged with culpable homicide but also with 
other very serious offences under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year and a half limit makes it possible for the Crown to 
take position and get its act together. 
If the person cannot be charged with culpable homicide, he will be 
charged with something else, as I said before, with very serious 
offences.  But with this bill, we would be left hanging until the 
victim died or his condition stabilized, before we could institute 
legal proceedings.  I do not think that is what the legal system 
wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that there are not some very specific cases 
like those listed earlier, the revolting nature of which casts 
doubt on the entire system, but if one is going to question the 
system, the approach must be comprehensive.  We must examine the 
system with experts and look at legal precedents.  The approach 
must be one of comparative law, rather like what the parliamentary 
secretary has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a British tradition.  What happens in Great Britain, 
for instance, with its far longer history in this connection?  What 
about certain of the Commonwealth countries? 
What is happening in Europe?  What is happening with the Americans, 
who are very much at the forefront in technological terms, perhaps 
more so than Canada?  How do they operate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we will conclude that a longer period of time will 
have to be set.  I would be surprised if we were to conclude that 
no time period need be set.  We might even conclude that section 
227 no longer serves a purpose.  I do not know, but it is surely 
following an in-depth study that we could make our mark as 
legislators in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, my conclusion is that we consider the rule provided in 
section 227 of the Criminal Code to serve a purpose at this time. 
In fact, establishing a time period enables us to determine 
whether there is indeed a causal link between the act of the 
accused and the death of the victim.  This is why we oppose Bill 
C-215 as written, since it removes any time frame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we must still take into account the social, 
economic and scientific realities in which the provisions of the 
Criminal Code must apply.  It may be relevant, in the short or 
medium term, to look at the length of time currently provided, that 
is the period of one year and one day.  Perhaps, in the not too 
distant future, we will consider new provisions to try to ensure 
greater fairness, and I am sure everyone is working toward the 
objective of making our system fair and just.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one occasion here today where unanimous consent was 
sought.  I think it is important for the people who may be 
watching the House to see some co-operation and how well 
sometimes that can work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was unanimous consent to allow a different member to move 
the bill because of the importance of the bill.  I think all 
members who have spoken today recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not unanimous consent to allow the bill to become 
votable and I am a little puzzled by that.  I will just comment a 
little on the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have heard from the government is that this is an 
important piece of legislation, that this legislation has to be 
modified in some way to be brought up to modern realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard that there is a law reform commission study 
making recommendations and recommending changes to what was 
section 210 and what is now section 227 of the Criminal Code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask with some real concern why the government has not 
brought forward changes, which Canadians appear to want and which 
I think form the subject of the hon. member's bill and why he has 
crafted it as a private members' bill. That being said, I do 
appreciate the parliamentary secretary's comments regarding the 
amount of study that has to go into this kind of a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois talked a little about some 
of the things I wanted to mention.  When a crime is committed, 
the law requires first of all that there is a presumption of 
innocence, that the individual who is charged with the crime is 
innocent until proven guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to prove the guilt of the accused, the crown must 
establish two things.  First is actus reus, which is the physical 
commission of the offence, the actual physical driving of the car 
in the case of negligence or impaired driving.  The crown must 
also prove mens rea, which is the Latin phrase for the mental 
element for the commission of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is indicated by the parliamentary secretary, one of the 
reasons we have a rule that derives from the English tradition 
that says one cannot be charged a year and a day later is 
precisely to ensure some security to the accused.  How can the 
crown determine mens rea?  How can an accused be expected to 
offer a defence after a prolonged period of time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that with today's technology that remains the 
only defence for this type of section, but it is worthy of study 
and it is something we have to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mover of the bill and I think all members here today talked 
about the desire on the part of Canadians to see some change. The 
mover of the bill talked about victims and the fact that he had 
received correspondence from victims saying that they wanted this 
change to ensure that the perpetrators of the crime were brought 
to justice.  I think the quote the hon. member used was that the 
killers pay their dues instead of not doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if we do not amend this section of the code today 
that we deny justice.  We have to examine what we mean when we 
talk about justice, what we mean when we talk about punishment 
and what we mean when we talk about closure for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not extending the time period for prosecution to 
allow for a charge of homicide to be laid is the only way to 
bring closure for victims and to bring justice to society has to 
be questioned.  Given the limitations that this section now 
provides, we can look to some alternate and perhaps more creative 
ways to determine what is justice for a family and indeed in this 
situation for a victim who may remain alive on a life support 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the restorative justice models which call for a 
different type of punishment, a type of punishment that makes the 
perpetrator of the crime accountable to the victim and to the 
victim's family, we may find that even if we do not amend this 
section of the code, there are still ways to ensure that the 
perpetrator of the crime has to pay some penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of legislation coming from the government, where 
I think it has recognized and admitted the need for change, and 
in the absence of this bill being a votable item, perhaps we can 
indicate to the crown attorneys across the country that there may 
be creative ways for them to look at laying charges even though 
those charges may be lesser charges than homicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I too congratulate the member for bringing 
forward this piece of legislation. It has encouraged some debate. 
I hope the government will take some direction from this House 
and from the hon. member that the legislation has to be changed. 
The government is taking some direction in that regard but 
perhaps not as quickly as we would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment and commend the hon. member for bringing forward 
the legislation.  It is worthy of debate and serious study as to 
the consequences in terms of the justice system, as to the 
consequences for both the crown and the accused, the conduct of a 
trial, the gathering of evidence, the maintaining of evidence and 
those types of things.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise in the House today to speak on Bill 
C-215, an act to amend section 227 of the Criminal Code.  This 
bill has the objective of replacing section 227 in order to deal 
with a person who commits a culpable homicide or the offence of 
causing the death of another person regardless of the time at 
which the death occurs. Right now the code says that for a person 
to be found guilty, the death must have occurred within a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Quebec would remember the case of a taxi driver who 
was beaten to death by police officers.  The taxi driver was in a 
vegetative coma for many months and finally died more than a year 
after the incident took place. The police officers could not be 
charged with the culpable homicide because of the time that had 
elapsed between the time of the commission of the crime and the 
resulting death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all understand that the amendment proposed by my colleague 
would cover such very sad cases, but does this House want to 
completely open section 227 of the Criminal Code?  Do we really 
want to not have any time limit imposed?  This House should not 
say yes to these questions before it reflects on the consequences 
of such an amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By having no time limit it would become much more difficult to 
establish the link between the cause and the effect of the death. 
If a crime occurs today but the death of the victim occurs five 
years later, how can our police and prosecutors really establish 
that it was the last event that caused the death and not 
something else? It could become a technical battle in court, a 
battle between lawyers needless to say. Furthermore it is 
impossible in Canadian law to prosecute the same person twice for 
the same act.  It would be impossible to charge someone with 
aggravated assault only to later change the charge to culpable 
homicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With section 227 written as proposed in Bill C-215, how long 
would a crown prosecutor be forced to wait before pressing 
charges?  If there is no time limit, the jobs of the crown and 
the police are made much more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a further example of consequences to this amendment to 
section 227.  What about cases where victims are comatose and the 
family decides to pull the plug on the life support machine? 
Would that be considered death following the last event?  These 
are all only small but important examples of the consequences to 
our criminal justice system of the amendments proposed by my 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes that the Criminal 
Code should be revised, but we also believe that it should not be 
changed piece by piece.  It has been many years since there was a 
complete revision of the Criminal Code as a whole, and maybe it 
is time to start thinking of doing it.  Maybe this House through 
its standing committee on justice could begin such a revision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our belief that Bill C-215 has touched on a good point and 
that the principle behind the amendment is a good one.  But it is 
also our belief that while section 227 should be broadened, it 
should not be left wide open.  We believe there should be a 
revision of the time limit between the moment an act has been 
committed and the time a death has occurred.  We also believe 
there should be a reasonable cut off time in that limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons and the ones previously mentioned we cannot 
support Bill C-215. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate. The

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague from British Columbia for presenting this 
bill on my behalf.  I do appreciate the interest that was shown 
in what we are attempting to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am a little dismayed. Once again we see a bill 
presented that completely meets the criteria to be votable. I am 
really wondering why we have in our procedure a committee whose 
purpose is to make certain that a bill meets the criteria before 
it can be declared votable.  Once again, even though it met the 
criteria, a handful of MPs decided on behalf of all Canadians 
that this bill was not worth being voted on.  Whether the bill is 
good or bad is beside the point.  The point is that it should be 
debated fully and everyone should have an opportunity to vote on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that the governing body, the Liberals, would 
not allow this bill to be votable because the justice minister 
herself has been quoted a number of times from her speeches about 
the extreme need to take care of this section of the Criminal 
Code. I was surprised to even have the opportunity to bring this 
bill forward because according to all the news reports, this was 
something that was going to be accomplished by the justice 
minister in the fall.  It should not surprise me.  Surprise is 
the wrong word.  It is no surprise when the Liberals decide to 
promise that something will be done and it does not happen.  That 
is old stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a lot of people say that we need to make certain we 
do not put legislation in place that would cause the justice 
system to crumble here or there.  I would like to remind the 
House that we have to start listening to Canadians.  We have to 
make changes to this legislation that reflect Canadians' 
description of a good justice system.  That description today 
does not fit in the minds of a big majority of Canadians.  They 
are an unhappy lot with the justice system.  That is quite 
obvious and any members who would doubt that, I would challenge 
them to go to any street corner in their ridings and find out for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system Canadians are looking for is one that would put a 
strong emphasis on meeting the needs of the victims and the 
victims' survivors. It is high time we had a system that said 
that the needs and rights of victims of crime are a little more 
important than the rights of the criminal and the perpetrators of 
the crime.  That is what Canadians want to see.  That is what I 
was attempting to do by introducing this bill.  I want to see 
that the Canadian people, the ones who pay the bill for this 
justice system, get what they desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the governing body would have to admit that there is an 
unhappiness among Canadians.  Otherwise we would not have CAVEAT, 
CRY and FACT and thousands of Canadians who belong to victims 
groups fighting for their rights to be recognized in a stronger 
way. That is what must begin to happen.  Sooner or later it will 
have to start happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deny this bill to be fully debated and voted on is wrong.  To 
deny any bill that meets the criteria and tries to address the 
needs of victims is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate part of this whole thing is that there are the 
Ward family and other families whose loved ones come under this 
section of the Criminal Code and therefore justice was never 
served. 
If there is one thing that victims deserve and survivors of 
victims deserve, it is the peace of mind that after the horrible 
tragedies that they have gone through that at least justice has 
been served. This government for many years now has failed to 
address that. It is time that we start doing it.  It is long 
overdue.

criminal and the victim.  As for me, my support and my efforts

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
November 5 I asked the Minister of Natural Resources to table the 
secret report by the auditor general of his examination of the 
Cape Breton Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report would shed light on recent disturbing facts 
regarding Devco's management of billions of dollars of crown 
assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unlikely this House will see the report.  The minister 
appears uninterested in making this agency under his 
responsibility accountable to the public.  In the weeks following 
his decision to keep the murky dealings of the Devco board from 
public scrutiny, the special Senate committee investigating Devco 
found it nearly impossible to make heads or tails of the numbers 
in Devco's five year plan and other fundamental documents of 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Cape Bretoner, it was embarrassing to see senior officers 
of one of Cape Breton's most visible institutions being given an 
accounting lesson by senators.  Senators were shocked at how the 
board signed a letter of intent to hand over Donkin Mine, a crown 
asset worth billions, to a company with no assets.  In what 
surely will be one of the largest transfers of public assets in 
years, board members seemingly had less than a day to learn of 
the chairman's quicksilver negotiations to lock up the deal 
before they rubber stamped the process as part of a routine 
Wednesday afternoon meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators felt that the handling of this matter with little 
explanation and no accountability was highly inappropriate. 
Senator MacDonald, and this is directly from the minutes of the 
November 18 Senate hearing, said the board sealed this deal using 
“indecent haste”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Murray said the letter of intent to dispose of the 
Donkin billions was based on and I quote, “quite incomplete and 
flimsy information”.  Senator Murray said the board's actions 
were incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of Devco told senators he did not consult with 
anyone about the deal.  The minister then told senators that 
Devco's board has no legal right to either develop the Donkin 
Mine or to sell it as it belongs to the federal government.  But 
they went ahead and signed a deal to sell without even bothering 
to pick up the phone and let the minister know he would soon be a 
few billion dollars lighter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the former Minister of Health who announced that $300,000 
in federal funds were being released into DRL bank accounts 
through a subsidiary of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. 
Until this federal gift arrived, DRL was unable to meet its 
responsibilities under the terms and conditions of the contract 
with Devco, namely, to prepare its plans to develop a mine 
through the study of data.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the minister to table the auditor general's report on 
Devco to meet its mandate promoting accountability and best 
practices in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are Devco and the minister afraid of? Senator Murray is 
afraid that Devco's letter of intent may have crippled the rights 
of the federal government to reject the deal or even to set terms 
and conditions.  If so, the terms of this deal have been 
illegally established because, according to the minister, Devco 
has no such legal right to do so.  I wonder if the deal would 
even stand up in court at this point without federal government 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this week, Nova Scotia Power announced it needs to import 
coal from the U.S. because Devco could not meet its requirements. 
Nova Scotians are appalled by this need to import coal given our 
expertise and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an absolute mess brewing under the minister's nose. 
Before this all takes on a whiff of scandal or the stench of 
government rot, I urge the minister to clear the air by tabling 
in this House the auditor general's report on the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation in the name of accountability and for the 
sake of the integrity of his own department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has raised the matter of a special examination by 
the auditor general of the Cape Breton Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that I, and I believe all members, share 
a concern for the Cape Breton region.  All of us want to see 
successes on the island.  I believe that Devco can be a success 
and I have confidence in the management and employees of the 
corporation to achieve this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to the audit, according to the Financial 
Administration Act, all crown corporations must undergo a special 
examination at least once every five years.  The purpose of this 
examination is to determine if the corporation's financial and 
management controls, information systems and management practices 
are acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These systems and practices should provide reasonable assurance 
that  the assets of the corporation are safeguarded and 
controlled; the financial, human and physical resources of the 
corporation are managed economically and efficiently; and the 
operations of the corporation are carried out effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's examiner has indicated to Devco that he 
expects to submit his report to Devco's board of directors soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand the process, if the auditor general's office 
believes the report contains information that should be brought 
to the attention of Parliament, his office would prepare a report 
for inclusion in the next annual report of the corporation.  Mr. 
Desautels, like every previous auditor general, will not be 
reluctant to bring forward any concerns he might have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To repeat, Devco has not yet received the report of the special 
examination.  Until this happens, I cannot speculate on next 
steps by the auditor general's office or possible reaction by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I would like to mention some of the ways in which Devco has 
established public accountability.  Like all crown corporations, 
Devco prepares an annual report that is tabled in Parliament.  In 
addition, Devco produces quarterly performance reports which are 
made public.  As well, Devco has established the practice of 
consulting at least twice annually with its various stakeholders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on November 
18 I rose in the House to ask a question of the government about 
the $1 billion deal which was being proposed with the Iraqi 
government.  This deal was proposed by Mr. Zed, who had gone to 
Iraq and supposedly signed a deal at a time when we were at a 
very critical point in dealing with Iraq.  It was refusing people 
access to various sites in the country.  It was a time when the 
United Nations was proposing other action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing could not have been worse.  In my estimation, it 
greatly undermined Canadian foreign policy that this, in fact, 
was being pushed under the carpet by this government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically this shows a real lack of foreign affairs initiative 
and policy by this government.  It makes you wonder who is in 
charge of the foreign affairs department when a company, Summa 
Strategies, directed by ex-Liberal MPs Doug Young and Paul Zed, 
can in fact put forward a deal like this at such a critical time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the 1997 election these two gentlemen set up Summa 
Strategies as an Ottawa lobbying group.  Obviously they are now 
taking great advantage of their contacts within the government. 
Mr. Young is acting for Canadian National Railways, a crown 
corporation he helped to privatize when he was minister of 
transport.  No wonder Canadians are so skeptical of government 
and ex-ministers when they are involved in this sort of lobbying 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to tighten up these arrangements dramatically.  Just 
imagine proposing to deal with a government like that of Saddam 
Hussein. While all the time arguing that this was a humanitarian 
deal for trucks and a number of items which were not listed, they 
went further to invite the foreign affairs minister, Tariq Aziz, 
to visit Canada, to visit the Prime Minister of New Brunswick, 
for which he claimed he had an invitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House get tired of the government standing up, 
beating its chest and saying how wonderful it is.  It talks about 
standing up to Saddam Hussein, yet we let this billion dollar 
deal to go ahead.  Maybe the UN will scuttle it.  We talk about 
how great we are in saving the world with land mines, meanwhile 
we are selling nuclear plants to India, Romania, China, Turkey 
and Korea, to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about how we have solved all the financial problems, 
when in reality we have a $600 billion debt.  We talk about a 
Zaire mission which we championed because the Prime Minister saw 
it on television.  Then we found out that the day before the 
President of the United States called and suggested that that is 
what Canada should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get tired of this sort of double standard and double talk.  I 
question who is in charge over there?  Doug Young, Paul Zed and 
Summa Strategies or the foreign affairs minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

sanctions were imposed on Iraq to persuade the Iraqi government 
to comply with all UN Security Council resolutions which flowed 
from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has repeatedly expressed its full 
support to the UN Security Council resolutions and has called on 
Iraq to comply fully with the relevant security council 
resolutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has also played an active role in the implementation of 
these resolutions through its presence in the United Nations

comply fully with all the obligations imposed on it by the 
international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hold the Government of Iraq and its leader Saddam Hussein 
fully responsible for the continued suffering of the Iraqi people 
by their persistent refusal of full co-operation with the 
international inspections.  However, it was not the intention of 
the UN Security Council to inflict suffering on the Iraqi people. 
That is why the security council passed resolution 986 to permit 
the sale of humanitarian goods to Iraq to help the Iraqi people 
while sanctions are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and its principle partners, including the United States 
and the United Kingdom, fully supported this resolution which was 
opposed for a long time by the Iraqi government.  Under this 
resolution Canadian companies are free to pursue sales of 
humanitarian goods subject to approval by the UN Sanctions 
Committee and the Government of Canada.

seeking to export goods to Iraq under this resolution, whether in 
Canada or overseas, must submit their application to the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade for 
approval.  The Department examines each application to ensure 
that all conditions for such exports laid down in Canadian 
regulations are met before a certificate permitting the export 
will be issued or can be issued.  One of these conditions is that 
the UN Sanctions Committee approve the deal.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DAIRY INDUSTRY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 19 last, I asked the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food a 
question on the future of the dairy industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give you the appropriate background, I would like to quote part 
of that question. It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister intend to vigorously defend the dairy 
producers of Quebec and Canada by taking a clear and firm 
stand in the face of American claims? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please note the answer. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, yes I will confirm that we will defend the 
Canadian dairy industry vigorously. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time I ask that minister a question, he invariably says “I 
defend very strongly, I defend vigorously.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he explain that processors, and especially Unilever, are 
importing butter oil, the mix containing 49% butter oil and 51% sugar, 
at a very low tariff? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a minister who keeps saying that he is vigorously defending the 
dairy industry, this is really great. Dairy producers have lost this 
fiscal year $50 million, which represents about 3% of their quota. And 
since there are 25,000 dairy producers, this represents an average of 
$2,000 that every dairy farm is losing today because of the import of 
butter oil. “I defend vigorously”, he says. How can we believe a 
minister who is so vigorously failing to act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is caused by the fact that the product is not under the 
proper tariff item. From 1995 to 1997, there has been more than a 
four-fold increase in imports. At the rate that these imports are going, 
there is every reason to fear that dairy producers will find themselves 
in a dire financial straits. Not only does the minister have to work 
vigorously, he also has to work quickly, because this is urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This butter oil mix was obviously invented to avoid tariff 
regulations. Unfortunately, Revenue Canada is slow in reacting, and our 
Minister of Agriculture is sleeping on the job. Meanwhile, it is the 
agricultural community that is paying not for the lack of courage of 
this government but for its failure to act, especially as far as the 
Minister of Agriculture is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope there will be appropriate foresight on the part of officials 
during the next WTO negotiations. Proper management means proper 
foresight, and the Liberal government is showing neither when it comes 
to agriculture. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to the 
parliamentary secretary for a response, I want to say that the 
interpreters did a wonderful job in that discourse.  I know it is 
difficult chore from time to time and I want to thank them.

say, adding to my previous answer, that no application has been 
received for an export permit to Iraq by the Department of 
Foreign Affairs from the Kanata company's group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responding to the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic, I do 
apologize.  I have just seen this text now and there is no French 
version.  I can try to translate it, but I think it would 
probably speed up things if I give the version in a somewhat less 
eloquent English than his French.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to encourage and forgive right now the member for 
Vancouver Quadra, because at the Department of Agriculture, there is 
little concern for the French language, and this is not surprising.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada wants to vigorously defend the Canadian dairy industry 
against American claims that we are subsidizing dairy exports, in 
violation of our obligations under the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also state that we did not respect our quota on milk. The 
United States asked Canada for formal consultations on these issues 
until October 8. These consultations were held at Geneva on November 19. 
Consultations are the first formal step in a complaint made to the World 
Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be up to the United States to request that a World Trade 
Organization panel be set up 60 days after the request for 
consultations, that is after December 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special system for pricing in Canada and for quotas on dairy 
tariffs meets Canada's obligations under the rules of the World Trade 
Organization. We are ready to defend our system before a commission so 
that this conflict can be resolved.

this issue not be in compliance with the rules of the World Trade 
Organization.

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to follow up on the question I raised 
in the House approximately a week ago.  I asked the minister of 
Indian affairs about the problems of accountability on reserves 
and the fact that unfortunately many of the people were extremely 
destitute.  Yet, according to the department's own statement, 
although everything may not be nice and wonderful it is certainly 
well under control.  I would beg to differ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately our aboriginal people who live on the reserves 
have living conditions that are absolutely intolerable and would 
not be tolerated elsewhere in the country.  I wonder why the 
government would continue on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister held up the Alexander First Nation, which happens 
to be in my riding, as an example of good management that we 
should look at for other reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the St. Albert and Sturgeon <I>Gazette</I> on November 19, 
1997 the chief executive officer of the band was quoted as 
saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be the first to publicly admit to our membership, the only 
people we feel we have to answer to, that there are problems. 
There is need for change and greater accountability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was in relationship to an investigation that was being 
conducted by the St. Albert and Sturgeon <I>Gazette</I> into some 
people on the reserve who were living in absolutely abominable 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the St. Albert and Sturgeon <I>Gazette</I> of Wednesday, 
September 24, 1997 there was an article entitled “Rich man, poor 
man”.  It talked about one member of the reserve, Mr. Ernie 
Bruno, who was given $1,800 to help build a 289 square foot home. 
Now a 289 square foot home is not a mansion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was actually taking a look at the financial statements which 
came my way too and I noticed that the auditor had qualified the 
statement because he had problems with the audit.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were unable to obtain sufficient audit evidence to support our 
documentation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of the qualifications were contained in there.  The 
statements were of significant length.  I was amazed by the 
amount of money the first nations were paying out in salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, under medical, transportation, alcohol and drug 
abuse, community health representative and van transportation, 
they paid out $231,000 in salaries against $473,000 in revenues. 
More than half went on salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the social services department?  This is the 
department they run to help people.  It has revenues of $672,000 
but its salary bill was $121,000.  It goes on and on.  Economic 
development salaries were $65,000 against receipts of $240,000. 
Land management salaries were $65,000 against receipts of 
$212,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were given the opportunity I could go on at length in a 20 
minute speech about the lack of accountability on this reserve 
and others reserves across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we talked about in question period.  We asked the 
minister to substantiate that the report was factual and that 
something needed to be done.  I would still like to have a real 
response by the department to this lack of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at great length, but in view of the time I would 
like to hear the response from the department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development I am pleased to respond to the question of the hon. 
member for St. Albert regarding the Alexander First Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member suggests that the Alexander First Nation is not 
an example of good management.  I disagree.  The remarkable 
turnaround this first nation has made in a few short years 
deserves credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago the auditor of the Alexander First Nation gave a 
denial of opinion on the 1994-95 financial statements.  At that 
time the first nation, in open consultation with its community, 
took a number of steps toward rectifying the situation, including 
holding open community meetings with the band auditor.  Over the 
past two years the first nation has made positive steps by 
showing an operating surplus each year and plans to have no 
deficit by March 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of its remedial management plan Alexander must 
make arrangements for professional accounting assistance and 
provide monthly financial statements to the department.  Regional 
officials meet regularly with band representatives to review 
progress on the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the department's reporting requirements, the chief 
and council hold general band meetings each year to provide 
information to community members on the band's financial picture, 
to inform members of achievements and new initiatives, and to 
seek clarification on any issue.  Each year, members are provided 
with a copy of the annual report which includes the financial 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this community, under the direction of the chief 
and council, has been able to reduce the number of community 
members on social assistance from 100 to 12 persons as a result 
of innovative economic development projects.  These results 
illustrate real progress within this first nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I asked a 
question of the prime minister on December 4, just about a week 
ago, in relation to Summa Strategies Inc., a lobbying company in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was with regard to the activities of this company 
because two former Liberal members of Parliament were acting on 
behalf of an American company to take possession of a Canadian 
port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a vote in the House last night on the marine act, Bill 
C-9, which would see the privatization of ports in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What disturbs me about these two members of Parliament is that 
one of them is Doug Young, the former minister of transport who 
was the architect of the marine privatization act or Bill C-9. 
It is identical to the original bill that he introduced to the 
House when he was the Minister of Transport in the previous 
Parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something patently wrong when the government allows 
that type of activity to happen, because here we have it. The 
gentleman who knows the department intimately, the former 
minister who wrote the act, now works on behalf of an American 
company that wants to take ownership of a Canadian port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bad enough that Mr. Paul Zed, a former member of 
Parliament, is also involved in that consulting company.  In 
fact, he is one of the co-owners with Mr. Young of Summa 
Strategies. It is bad enough that a member of Parliament would be 
involved, but when you have a minister acting along with the 
member of Parliament doing that, the former member of Parliament 
and the former minister, there is something absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised that question in the House, I asked the Prime 
Minister, does this meet his definition of ethical behaviour. 
They just fudge on the answer.  A lot of Canadians want to know 
whether or not that would meet the Prime Minister's definition of 
ethical behaviour.  I think most people in this House on both 
sides would say no, it does not meet what would be an acceptable 
level of ethical behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Mr. Young and Mr. Zed are doing in terms of the law, I am 
not going to stand up here and say they are breaking the law, 
because obviously they are both very smart men, they are 
intelligent men.  But we are talking about ethical behaviour, and 
insider knowledge and information of departments, and the 
architect of the very act which we debated in this House this 
week which will be given royal assent very soon.  There is 
something wrong when that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the provincial side of this equation, we have a former 
minister of economic development in the province of New Brunswick 
by the name of Al Lacey who owns the company Al Lacey and 
Associates.  He is lobbying on behalf of the provincial 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the consummate insiders both federally and provincially. 
There is something wrong when that is allowed to happen, 
especially when we are looking at giving ownership of a Canadian 
port to an American company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely bizarre that we would allow the Canadian 
government and the province of New Brunswick to allow a port like 
that to be sold and allow the highest paid lobbyists in the 
country to represent these companies, every one of these 
lobbyists being former members of the crown cabinet or members of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that I rest my case. I look forward to the response from the 
parliamentary secretary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we cannot comment on 
innuendoes or suggestions.  We must deal with facts and we 
operate under the rule of law in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Charlotte for his question 
concerning Summa Strategies and the divestiture of the port of 
Bayside, New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must emphasize that the divestiture initiative under the 
national marine policy is going extremely well.  In Atlantic 
Canada alone, 38 ports have been transferred, negotiations are 
concluded on a further six, and 10 additional letters of intent 
have been signed with negotiations presently under way.  These 
ports are being transferred to provinces, community based groups 
and private companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada is implementing this initiative under a set of 
guidelines and procedures developed by the department and 
approved by Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Bayside, New Brunswick, the officials from 
Transport Canada convened a public meeting on June 19, 1996 and 
provided a briefing on the national marine policy and the 
positive effect it could have for the stakeholders of a port like 
Bayside.  Subsequent to that meeting, a local group of 
stakeholder representatives was formed and a letter of intent was 
signed with the group on July 29, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charlotte County Ports Ltd. represented by Summa Strategies also 
came forward and expressed interest in the port.  As with any 
other interested party, the process was explained to them and 
they were urged to make contact with the local negotiating 
committee.  Charlotte County Ports Ltd. followed this advice and 
verbally withdrew their expression of interest in favour of 
working positively with the local port divestiture committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the hon. member has questioned the involvement of 
Summa Strategies.  Both of the individuals he has referred to are 
now private citizens and are free to carry out their business 
affairs as they see fit and in conformity to the rule of the law.
