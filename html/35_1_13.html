<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The international community has created an impossible situation for itself in 
relation to Bosnia, especially when the presence of United Nations troops in the 
country is cited as the reason for not enforcing UN resolutions there. The need 
for a new approach could not be clearer-I suggest that the following provides 
the only basis for bringing peace to Bosnia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bosnia must be declared a UN protectorate for a specified period and administered 
by the UN.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All parties must immediately cease all military activity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A large program for handing over arms and those accused of war crimes must be 
agreed and enforced.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A large scale program of civil reconstruction should be instituted immediately with 
the main emphasis being on cross cultural co-operation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As soon as conditions allow, an all-Bosnia assembly must be elected under 
international supervision and on the basis of electoral units, not ethnic affiliation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pressure must be maintained on neighbouring countries, in particular Croatia and 
Serbia, to resolve inter-ethnic relations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the daily <I>La Tribune</I> was reporting today, it is 
with great sadness that we learned yesterday that Dominion 
Textile was closing two factories in Quebec. Tremendous 
international competition and low demand would have 
prompted Dominion Textile to make such a decision.
<P>
	The Domil spinning mill in Sherbrooke employed 275 
workers averaging 40 years of age and 16 years of service. 
Losing a job when times are so hard and when you have devoted 
so many years of your life to it is a traumatic experience. I 
sympathize deeply with those laid-off workers and assure them 
of my support.
<P>
	This new factory closing shows the urgency of initiating 
retraining measures for the workers in areas more and more 
affected by foreign competition. Not only is the federal 
government doing nothing in this regard, but it refuses to 
recognize that vocational training would be better off under the 
jurisdiction of the government of Quebec, the only one able to 
take efficient steps in this area.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As an unemployed person who is required to pay unemployment insurance

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the other day 
my colleague, the Minister of Human Resource Development, 
used the term generation <I>x</I>. Generation <I>x</I> refers to young people 
in Canada who are frustrated with bleak employment prospects

career opportunities available to them.

	In addition to the social challenges facing the youth, 
generation <I>x</I> finds itself wondering why they must shoulder the 
burden of the nation's economic woes which were caused by the 
previous generation. In short they are asking: ``What about us?''
<P>
	The youth of today are tired of means to no end education and 
aspire to more than mere part time jobs. It is time to make a 
change.
<P>
	The government is committed to the youth of Canada and 
must certainly reflect that in the next budget through initiatives 
such as the youth service corps, job training, the national 
literacy program and increased funding for aboriginal 
post-secondary education. The government will substantiate its 
commitment not only to generation <I>x</I> but to future generations as 
well.

there are those who use the tax on tobacco as an excuse to break 
the law, and there are those who invoke civil disobedience as an

<P>
	When Henry Thoreau staged civil disobedience, it was to 
protest the American civil war.
<P>
	When Mahatma Gandhi staged civil disobedience, it was to 
free the people of India from colonialism.
<P>
	When Martin Luther King staged civil disobedience, it was to 
free the American blacks from racial discrimination.
<P>
	However when smugglers deliberately violate the law for 
money and others invoke civil disobedience to protest our tax 
laws on cigarettes, it is pure greed.
<P>
	We cannot surrender the supremacy of law to the lawless. We 
must apply the law of our land to every part and parcel of our 
country.
<P>
	Decreasing taxes on tobacco will increase the consumption of 
cigarettes, causing disabilities, human suffering, a lifetime of 
addiction and premature death.
<P>
	The present and future health of the newborn, children, 
teenagers and adults-all of us-are in the hands of a healthy 
government public health policy.
<P>
	Let Parliament rally our citizens and remind them that those 
who break the law hurt their neighbours, their friends, their

of Wiarton which is a short distance away from the beautiful 
Bruce Peninsula Park of Tobermory.
<P>
	Wiarton Willy has a unique characteristic in that he was born 
on the 45th parallel which is between the equator and the North 
Pole, and because of this he has the facility of forecasting. 
Wiarton Willy happens to be a white albino groundhog and this 
morning the mayor of Wiarton and a group of dignitaries, all 
dressed in white tuxedos, ventured out to speak to Wiarton Willy 
at his burrow. They brought with them a space heater and Willy 
came out and did his thing.

	Why should we pay for the importation of a ferry from Europe 
or elsewhere when we have the manpower and the facilities 
necessary to built it ourselves? In these difficult economic 
times, it is vital that the decisions that we make reinforce 
Quebec's economic activity in the interests of all Quebecers.

steps must be taken to address the issue of tobacco smuggling in 
Canada. It is my opinion that the government can succeed in 
substantially reducing it, without rolling back tobacco taxes.
<P>
	A multifaceted approach must be adopted that includes the 
reintroduction of the highly effective federal export tax, tougher 
enforcement measures, restrictions on the amount of tobacco 
that can be shipped to the United States, measures to prevent 
manufacturers from shifting production elsewhere in order to 
supply the contraband market, and increased pressure on the 
U.S.  government to bring their cigarette prices into line with 
our own.
<P>
	Relying on a tax rollback is a public health risk that will lead 
to increased health care costs as rates of consumption rise. The 
loss in tax revenues will further add to the deficit problems 
being faced by every level of government in the country.

<P>

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The protest movement against cigarette smuggling is 
spreading, but anti-smoking groups are opposed to any 
reduction in taxes on cigarettes.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the government procrastinates and does nothing 
to put an end to the serious social problem cigarette smuggling 
in particular has become in Quebec. Yesterday, two Liberal 
members publicly said they were opposed to cuts in cigarette 
taxes, while the Minister of National Health and Welfare was 
equally reluctant.
<P>
	My question is this: Must we conclude that the government is 
taking such a long time to announce its action plan against 
cigarette smuggling because of profound divisions within 
Cabinet and the Liberal caucus on the Prime Minister's plans to 
reduce this tax?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have been working on this problem for a number of weeks. 
We are in touch with the provincial governments. I intend to 
discuss the problem early next week with the Premier of 
Quebec, as soon as he gets back from his trip, and also with

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for nearly three weeks we have asked the government 
repeatedly to take some kind of action. And what kind of answer 
did we get today? One of the people involved is in Europe, 
others are absent, people are talking and waiting and they tell us 
there may be a decision shortly.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree that the high tax on cigarettes, 
by encouraging smuggling, has in fact made cigarettes available 
to a class of smokers who are now more numerous than ever 
before and who on top of that are not helping to finance health 
care?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
would be very helpful if we could get a clear position from the 
opposition. The other day, the health critic made it clear to the 
Minister of National Health and Welfare that he did not want tax 
rates to be reduced. It would also be very helpful if the Leader of 
the Opposition asked his members not to join demonstrations 
with individuals who are breaking the law in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Argenteuil-Papineau, to whom 
the Prime Minister alluded, made it clear that he dissociated 
himself from any civil disobedience. He made this quite clear. 
However, in the Liberal caucus we hear voices telling us where 
to look and who these people are and that the Solicitor General 
knows nothing, although he has access to the RCMP.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear to the 
Prime Minister that all members of the Bloc, without exception, 
support tax cuts. I want to repeat that. And I would like to ask the 
Prime Minister whether he still agrees it is necessary to lower 
these taxes, as recommended by his Minister of Finance and 
Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad to see the Leader of the Opposition does not agree with 
his health critic. We noted that he clearly said he was in favour 
of reducing taxes. In fact, it is the first time he said so, and this 
will help us when we make a decision.
<P>
	As for the hon. member for Argenteuil-Papineau, I do not 
think any of our members went on television to announce that 
they supported people who break the law and to applaud and 
praise them for doing so. People who break the law should be 
harshly condemned by all members of this House.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard 
today, and I will repeat it for the benefit of the Prime Minister, 
that six white vans loaded with smuggled cigarettes crossed the 
ice bridge on Lake of Two  Mountains, heading for the 10 outlets 
selling smuggled cigarettes in the Oka area.

refusal to take action and the incompetence of his government 
are contributing to destabilize Quebec society as a whole?

have been given to RCMP officers to do their job and to arrest 
anybody who is not following the laws of the land.
<P>
	If the hon. member is aware of some information that can be 
very useful to the RCMP, he should give it to me and I will pass it 
on to the RCMP.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> It would be a good idea to

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the Prime 
Minister not recognize that the inefficiency of his government 
and its refusal to take action have allowed cigarette smugglers to 
expand their network into Quebec high schools?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is easy for the opposition to lay the blame on this government 
which has been in office for two months and a half. We gave 
orders and, as a result, several people were arrested. But the 
problem is not new. It started with the intolerance of the 
Conservative government. In those days the Leader of the

that the government is preparing to impose its views on the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

pressured. On the contrary, they are asking the federal 
government to respond to their efforts to develop new 
approaches to the social security system.
<P>
	It is the Bloc Quebecois, in this House, that is rejecting the 
reform process, thereby isolating itself on this issue. Surely you

of this case and by amending the Canada Elections Act to reflect 
the court ruling?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we believe this case involves very important issues. Therefore 
we think it appropriate that this matter be tested further by a 
higher court, the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	The issues are of sufficient importance that whatever the 
Alberta court of appeal has ruled, Canadians deserve to have this 
matter dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada if it is willing

regarding an agreement, yet another agreement, on manpower 
training. Yesterday evening, the Quebec employment minister 
announced that an agreement was imminent, a statement that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development immediately 
denied. This morning, the Minister from Quebec qualified his

<P>

Mr. Marcil on Monday evening. We see eye to eye on the 
importance of an extensive restructuring of the social security 
system. We share the same determination to fight 
unemployment. We agree that the one-stop concept, similar to 
what we have now in New Brunswick, is a valid goal as far as the 
provinces are concerned. That is what Mr. Marcil said not so 
long ago.
<P>
	Indeed, we will first report to our respective Cabinets on our 
discussion and then, at the provincial ministers' meeting to be

<P>
	Can the minister confirm that the two to three month deadline 
announced by the Quebec minister yesterday-because he did 
mention that yesterday as well- is the same for Ottawa? Are we 
to understand that these negotiations are nothing more than a 
smokescreen put up by the two ministers to prevent this issue

<P>

procedure with that board for making all such expenditure 
decisions public.
<P>
	Second, to rule that June 9, 1993 decision of the Board of

	The board will decide because the board is its own master. The 
decision taken to continue to pay the leaders of the parties and

<P>
	Today, hundreds of people living in inadequate housing took 
their personal budgets to the office of the Finance Minister. The 
objective of this operation is to show the Liberal government 
that serious housing problems are being created in Canada. 
Every month, thousands of households must save on food just to 
pay the rent.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister make his Finance Minister restore 
and increase social housing program budgets and unfreeze the 
budget of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to 
avoid a social housing rent increase?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David C. Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency): </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member must recognize that the responsibility for 
social housing is not just with the federal government. We have 
committed $100 million to RRAP over two years. We have also 
committed the savings under the direct lending program which 
is approximately $120 million for a four-year period to go to 
social housing. In addition, the Government of Canada is 
committed to the $2 billion that we have directly involved in 
maintaining the existing stock in social housing across this 
country.
<P>
	The hon. member knows that the Government of Canada, like 
all other governments, has a limited fiscal capacity. Within that 
fiscal capacity we will do our best to try to obtain additional 
funds in order to address the important concerns she raises.

housing conditions for tenants in his hometown of Shawinigan

<P>
	The Prime Minister has refused to allow members to represent 
their constituents by having free votes in this Parliament. He has 
said in effect that such a reform would be contrary to 
parliamentary democracy. However the mother of Parliaments 
in London has already adopted this reform.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister announce that the government 
will not consider the defeat of a government motion, including a 
spending measure, to constitute an expression of 
non-confidence unless it is immediately followed by a formal 
motion of non-confidence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have already announced some new initiatives for this House 
with the free debates. We have had three so far in less than three 
weeks: one on Bosnia, one on the cruise missile and one on the 
budget. People were free to express their views. I heard some 
members of my party stating views that were in opposition to 
others. That is free expression.
<P>
	Eventually a government has to decide. The budget of the 
nation is a vote of confidence in the government. If the 
government cannot present a budget and pass it, it should call an 
election. It is as simple as that because the government will have 
lost the confidence of the House.
<P>

of record that the British Parliament defeated the Maastricht

	Would the Prime Minister tell Canadians why they should 
settle for any less democracy than the people of Britain?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the hon. member, the Maastricht vote was not a 
budgetary measure. It was voted on again in the House in 
England and eventually was passed.
<P>
	It is not the same thing. The vote was on a more general 
policy. It was not on the budget of the administration in Great 
Britain. When a vote is on the budget it is confidence in the

<P>
	In the meantime, the red book also talks about the need for

These savings will help pay for some of the spending programs 
such as the infrastructure program to create jobs.
<P>
	We have a balanced approach. The Prime Minister talked 
about this earlier in question period. We have to move now 
because the Minister of Finance wants to know how much we 
can cut and where before April 1 when the fiscal year starts.

review is complete?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

$1.6 billion starting April 1 means that we have to make some

	We are trying to deal with excess infrastructure and surplus 
capacity, much of which has not been dealt with by previous 
governments for obvious political and sensitive reasons. We 
hope to deal with any communities and individuals affected in a 
most sensitive manner.
<P>
	I believe all hon. members of the House will probably support 
us in the drive to bring some efficiency and rationalization to the 
armed forces. Later this year the defence review will be able to 
outline the policies required for the military in the year 2000 but 
will have the ability to discharge those obligations.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	On June 23, 1985 an Air-India flight was blown out of the sky 
off the coast of Ireland. The 329 people on board were murdered, 
the majority of whom were Canadian. It was the worst mass 
murder in Canadian history.
<P>
	Press reports now indicate that one of the alleged murderers 
was trained at a Soldier of Fortune training camp in 
Birmingham, Alabama, and further that the U.S. government 
agreed to train terrorists at the request of the late President Zia 
of Pakistan.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why Mr. Frank Camper, the 
operator of the Soldier of Fortune Training School, was not 
interviewed by the RCMP? Given the rather unfortunate and 
tragic history of this matter, would he agree that it is now time 
for a royal commission of inquiry as we promised in the last 
Parliament?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

the hon. member has raised an important question.
<P>
	I am informed that Mr. Camper was questioned by the FBI on 
behalf of the RCMP. I am further informed that the RCMP 
investigation is still active and ongoing. Therefore I would like 
to keep the idea of a royal commission under consideration.
<P>
	However because of the long and distinguished study by the 
hon. member into this tragic matter, I would like to have him 
meet with me as soon as possible so that together we can pursue 
the matter further.

like to make you aware that by agreement of the House leaders 
we had hoped to have a copy of the statement three hours prior to 
its introduction in the House.

	That was not forthcoming and we are very concerned. We 
understand this is a new process for a new government. We wish 
to be most co-operative, but we would expect more notice and to 
have these statements brought to our attention sooner in the 
future. If it does not happen then we will be bringing it to your

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak 
on behalf of our government and accord our other political 
friends on the other side to respond with respect to the levels 
document I just tabled for Parliament.
<P>
	Immigration policy represents one of the most important and 
complex challenges facing our nation. Perhaps more than any 
other area of federal public policy, it is closely tied to our 
history, to the development of our values and indeed to our 
cultural diversity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to put in place an open and progressive immigration 
policy that does not close the door to those who need our help or 
plan to contribute to the growth of our country. This government 
is committed to maintaining a very dynamic immigration 
program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am also committed to a realistic immigration policy. In the 
1994 levels plan we are presenting today, I have identified 
realistic targets and I will push the program and our officials to 
achieve these targets, something that has not been done in recent 
years.
<P>
	The levels also take into account the views expressed during 
the consultation process in 1993 before this government 
assumed office. Nevertheless we have made important changes 
to specific components, and all of these changes reflect the 
commitment this party made in the red book during the recent 
election which fully supports an immigration policy firmly 
based on family reunification while at the same time promoting 
the economic benefits of skilled immigrants and maintaining 
our humanitarian obligations to those who seek legitimate 
refuge.
<P>
	You cannot discuss levels, whether it is this year or next, 
without looking and talking about the long term policy 
directives of our government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Like most Canadians I want our immigration program to be 
managed in a firm and responsible manner. I intend to prevent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="797"> 797 </A></B>
<P>
abuse, protect citizens' interests and limit costs. However, I do 
not agree with those who say that our generosity should give 
way to a tougher immigration approach.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Sometimes we forget or ignore the role that immigrants and 
immigration have played in the development of our great nation. 
Sometimes it does not take too long for the sons and daughters 
and grandchildren of immigrants, for instance, to look at the 
newcomers today and not see one of us but one of them.
<P>
	Periodically throughout our history, especially during 
economic downturns-and we have lived through those in the 
recent years, to be sure-there have been calls to slam the door 
shut to immigrants and immigration. Regrettably that sentiment 
at various times has been translated by governments into 
restricted laws and policies.
<P>
	Canada would not have flourished or progressed if we had 
locked ourselves into such a restrictive mindset that excluded 
the very people who have helped make us grow and prosper as a 
nation. At the same time, an immigration program must be 
effectively controlled and managed. Rules and regulations must 
and will be enforced. Attempts to abuse our immigration 
program at the expense of Canadians or at the expense of people 
who truly need Canada's assistance will not be tolerated.
<P>
	Second, I believe decisions about immigration should be 
made from the perspective of a long term rather than narrow 
version. It is not enough to make those decisions with a view to 
short term gain or as a quick fix or to make decisions based on 
perception or mythology. Decisions made today have 
implications for future generations in our country. Therefore we 
need a clear and practical vision of the kind of nation we want to 
build and build for our children.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Third, I think Canadians should be offered a better chance to 
participate in the development of this vision. Consultations have 
been too limited in my opinion. Too many Canadians did not 
have their say in the process. As our immigration policy takes 
shape in the next 10 years, we will be faced with issues affecting 
the lives of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fourth, I am convinced that we need stronger partnership with 
all levels of government and private sector organization in the 
delivery of our immigration programs. Let me assure my 
colleagues in this House that in the first 100 days of this 
government's mandate we have already begun to forge those 
very and much needed partnerships.
<P>
	All of these principles underlie the 1994 immigration plan. 
While these levels would normally have been tabled last June in 
a previous Parliament, that session was not recalled. 
Consequently legislation requires that in such a case the plan be 
tabled within 15 days of the sitting of the new Parliament, which 
is what we are doing this afternoon.
<P>
	However, the government's commitments regarding 
immigration are already well known. They were set out clearly 
in the red book during the recent election. The 1994 plan meets 
our basic commitment to support a dynamic immigration policy 
that balances humanitarian concerns, demographic and 
economic needs and our basic capacity to absorb our 
newcomers.
<P>
	The highlights of the 1994 plan are as follows: Planned 
immigration levels for 1994 will be set at 250,000, thereby 
honouring our pledge to maintain an immigration level of 
approximately 1 per cent of Canada's population. That 
represents an increase of some 5,000 over the actual numbers in 
1993.
<P>
	Second, in this International Year of the Family, the level for 
family class immigrants will increase by 1,300 over last year to 
a total of 111,000. Consequently the family class portion of 
immigration will roughly represent 45 per cent of the overall 
levels in 1994-again, another commitment that this 
government made in the red book.
<P>
	Moreover, the level for independent immigrants, those 
selected primarily for their labour market skills, will be 
increased by almost 10,000 individuals for a total of 86,700. 
When we join this level-that is to say, the skills this economy 
needs together with the stream of business and entrepreneur 
immigrants-that will reflect a 44 per cent chunk of the overall 
immigration levels. This reflects this party's commitment to 
give priority to independent and family class immigration, 
something that was clearly outlined in the red book. We made 
that commitment and today we are honouring that pledge.
<P>
	Third, I stated in our red book that sponsorship for refugees 
for resettlement from abroad will be encouraged. In 1994 the 
number of refugees resettled from abroad through government 
sponsorship will be increased by some 700 for a total 7,300, an 
increase of some 10 per cent. Private sponsorships will increase 
by 1,400 for a total of 6,000 refugees, an increase of some 30 per 
cent.
<P>
	This is an olive branch to the communities that traditionally 
have come forward to sponsor refugees. We are saying, through 
this statement, that this government is back in the business of 
working with communities that come forward to sponsor 
refugees as a collaborative effort to celebrate that collectivity, 
but also because it is those communities that will be picking up 
the settlement costs rather than simply having the state do that. I 
assure those communities that have played a tremendous role in 
years gone by that our department will strive to process those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="798"> 798 </A></B>
<P>
applications much more effectively and efficiently  than was the 
case in the past nine years under the Conservative government.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	The numbers for overseas refugee resettlement are at a ceiling 
if we are to tie the budgets that are in place for resettlement and 
integration programs. It would simply be irresponsible and 
misleading of this minister and this government to suggest any 
inflated figure for refugees without having respect for the fact 
that a proper level of integration programs is needed. This 
minister will not draw those invisible lines in the sand, as was 
the case in the last nine years. The Conservative government 
that preceded us would always put an inflated level of 13,000 to 
15,000 government sponsored refugees and in the last years of 
its mandate delivered 6,000. Our number of 7,300 is realistic 
and will be delivered.
<P>
	In addition, we will also be accepting an estimated 15,000 
successful in Canada refugee claimants. Those are the 
individuals who apply for refugee status under our refugee 
determination system in Canada. Together the total estimated 
number of refugees for 1994 is 28,300, an increase of some 
3,500 individuals.
<P>
	This government intends to maintain its international 
obligations towards those who legitimately seek refuge in this 
country. We will try as much as we can to mobilize overseas 
sponsorship because it is cost effective, it is quick, and it speaks 
to those refugees who need help the most.
<P>
	We are also doing other things that cannot be disconnected 
from any discussion on levels, but I am sensitive to the time we 
have for this ministerial statement. For instance, there are the 
work permits we announced last week, rather than individuals 
being forced onto welfare; or our action on deterring welfare 
abuse; or the review of how we can enforce those elements of the 
Immigration Act to keep out those individuals or criminals who 
wish to play with our system and abuse that very foundation; or 
the review we have talked about with respect to our 
humanitarian programs as well as a review of business 
immigration, so we can ensure that we are maximizing those job 
opportunities and economic benefits for all Canadians.
<P>
	What about our special program for refugee women, which is 
unique in the world? What about pushing the international 
community to come to grips with the sea of humanity that is 
striving for things that sometimes you and I take for granted? 
We are not going to preach to the world, but we are going to tell 
that world that it does not make sense to have an international 
corridor of locked doors, that we are fooling ourselves if we 
think if we close our front doors we will not get pressure through 
our back doors or through our windows. We will tell those 
countries locking their doors that this is unacceptable and unfair 
to those countries whose doors are still open and whose 
doorsteps are therefore crowded.
<P>
	We should move ensemble as an international community. If 
we move together, not only will we be addressing those 
individuals who clearly need that legitimate refuge, but as 
individual nations we will also be addressing the domestic 
pressures that obviously confront countries of the world.
<P>
	The second part of the levels document we tabled this 
afternoon concerns how we consult Canadians. The government 
has decided to undertake a new kind of consultation. I am 
announcing today the establishment of a new 10-year strategic 
framework under which 5-year immigration plans will be 
outlined.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I know that there are many sincere but conflicting convictions 
on basic immigration issues and how to approach them. It is 
more important than ever for people to engage in an open, 
long-term and comprehensive discussion on immigration 
problems.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We need a form of consultation in which the process is not 
dictated solely by the interests of one government but rather 
shaped by the interests of all of those taking part, provincial and 
municipal levels of government, non-governmental 
organizations, business entities and Canadians.
<P>
	That is why I have asked the public policy forum to join us in 
designing and implementing this more democratic and 
consequently more effective way of discussing and talking to 
Canadians.
<P>
	In early March representatives from a broad range of 
organizations within Canada as well as international experts 
will come together to debate and define the issues. They will 
also help establish a number of individual expert panels that will 
examine in detail the eight, nine, or ten questions that are the 
underpinning of our immigration challenges.
<P>
	In addition, Canadians normally excluded from the process 
will be involved in regional, community and round table 
discussions. The results of these consultations will then be the 
focus of a major conference to be held later this fall so that it 
may be forming the basis of the next 1995 immigration levels.
<P>
	More important, we must begin to answer the question of 
where we want to go as a country in the next 10 to 15 years and 
how immigration as one important tool of nation building can 
help us meet those goals and dreams.
<P>
	In that regard this minister and this government look forward 
to working together with all Canadians and all members and all 
political parties represented in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Canada does face some difficult problems. The economy has 
experienced very difficult times of late. Canadians are in a sense 
angry and frustrated over unemployment. They are concerned 
about losing or regaining their jobs. They are worried about the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="799"> 799 </A></B>
<P>
diminished prospects of their families and they worry about the 
careers of their children, and they have every right to feel those 
pressures and those dilemmas.
<P>
	In the process some are casting blame on governments, be 
they national, provincial or municipal. Some are casting blame 
on those well off, the powerful and the rich in our communities. 
Others are also placing the blame on immigrants, on refugees, 
on newcomers, that they somehow cost us jobs, that they 
somehow cannot adapt to our country, that they somehow are 
engulfing our social assistance welfare roles.
<P>
	I have heard those voices and if we are honest today, we have 
all heard those voices. I am not questioning the freedom of those 
voices to ring in this place. I ask those voices in this place and 
across the country if you are to express those concerns, and we 
will have that debate, rather than only talking about the C.D. 
Howe report, also look at the Economic Council report that 
talked about moving toward 1 per cent gradually, that talked 
about the creation of jobs by immigrants.
<P>
	I ask those voices to be concerned with the fact that 
immigrants are also consumers, that immigrants also become 
entrepreneurs. I ask them to understand as well if you are going 
to look at statistics, Canada's statistics show that on average 
foreign-born Canadians spend less time on unemployment 
insurance than native born.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not castigating anybody, but we have to also speak to the 
fact that if we talk about the welfare rolls we also have to talk 
about the facts. In the province of Ontario, the province that 
receives the most immigrants and refugees, in 1993 had a case 
load of 615,000 individuals on welfare. The proportion of 
refugees on those rolls according to Ontario officials put to me 
in my meeting with them on Monday is 4 per cent, 20,000 to 
25,000 people out of 615,000.
<P>
	I ask my fellow Canadians, in the province of Ontario and 
elsewhere, are we really subsidizing those refugees or 
immigrants?
<P>
	I have heard some of those voices and I am prepared to discuss 
with those individuals the concerns they are expressing. If we 
recall our history as a nation we know that such voices are not 
entirely new.
<P>
	Many new groups of people have come to Canada over the 
years, each of them justifying its faith in our country. They 
raised families, they worked hard and they too sacrificed. They 
helped build our railroads, they helped plough our new frontiers 
out west and they helped raise the great cities of Canada. They, 
along with all of us, helped build the great country and nation 
that we are proud to call home.
<P>
	Why should we believe now at this juncture of Canada's 
history and development that such nation building will all of a 
sudden come to a halt? Why should we contemplate now at this 
juncture of our history and development that today's 
immigrants, today's newcomers cannot be tomorrow's leaders? 
Our government and immigration are still about building a 
better and more prosperous Canada.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order, pursuant to Standing Order 33 and 
routine proceedings as referred to in Beauchesne's 
<I>Parliamentary Rules &amp; Forms</I>.
<P>
	I commend the minister on his remarks, but I ask for 
information on whether it is in order for a minister's statement 
to go over 25 minutes or 20 minutes in length. I quote article 348 
of Beauchesne's:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under Standing Order 33(1) Ministers may make a short factual 
announcementor statement of Government policy. Provision is made for replies by Members of 
parties in opposition to comment on the statement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Article 350 on the same page states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker has emphasized that both the Government and Opposition 
contributions should be brief and factual. The purpose of the ministerial 
statement is to convey information, not to encourage debate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Perhaps I am rising more for direction, being a new member 
of this House of Commons, on whether this ministerial 
statement being 25 minutes long or thereabouts is a usual 
procedure of the House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to the 
hon. member.
<P>
	His leader in the first days of Parliament said that this is an 
unconventional House, that we should not look to precedent. I 
mentioned to my opposition critics that this Prime Minister has 
told the House that important decisions, important 
announcements or important debates should happen here on the 
floor of the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	The tradition has been that ministers of immigration in the 
past tabled the report, as I did, for 30 seconds and then left for a 
press conference outside the House of Commons. This minister 
at this level has taken the opportunity under ministerial 
statements-and I grant the member it may have gone a little 
longer than is traditional-but I thought the issue at hand was 
worthy enough for us to make the statement. Regarding the time 
that I took, if it was 25 minutes, the hon. member, the 
immigration 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="800"> 800 </A></B>
<P>
critic for his party, will have the very same time in order to 
address the very same concern.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> On the same point of 
order, Madam Speaker. I just want to clarify for the hon. 
minister that there may be a little problem with his assuming 
this is a reformer speaking here. He made reference to this 
person's leader, which I think he may have mistaken with the 
leader of the Reform Party. Also, as the hon. member at the back 
is an independent, there could be a little error there about giving 
an equal amount of time. I would just like him to clarify that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> I think the hon. member is absolutely correct. I 
had assumed because of the positioning of the member that he 
was a member of the Reform Party.
<P>
	The issues that I raised still stand, but I stand corrected.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to read for 
the House Standing Order 33(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On Statements by Ministers as listed in Standing Order 30(3), a Minister of the 
Crown may make a short factual announcement or statement of government 
policy. A Member from each of the parties in opposition to the government may 
comment briefly thereon. The time for such proceedings shall be limited as the 
Speaker deems fit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I thank both hon. members for their interventions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
very closely to the statement of the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration. However, I must deplore the minister's failure to 
co-operate with critics from the other parties.
<P>
	We did not receive the text of his statement-a document 
prepared months ago-until 1 p.m. and we received only one 
copy, despite the fact that we had requested two. This is not the 
first time this has happened. The same problem occurred a few 
days ago when the minister gave a press conference. We 
received a copy of his statement only as the press conference 
was getting under way. What happened to the minister's promise 
to work with us? I must deplore this lack of co-operation.
<P>
	Regarding the substance of his statement, I would say that 
immigration policy does represent an enormous challenge not 
just for Canada, but also and above all for Quebec. In referring 
to the new levels of immigration announced yesterday, the 
minister neglected to mention if he had consulted with Quebec. 
If he did, when did these consultations take place and under what 
circumstances?
<P>
	The minister also broached subjects not directly tied to new 
immigration levels. For example, concerning criminals, I agree 
with him that Canada should not let them in, but I hope that he is 
not merely stating good intentions. Precedents in this regard 
were set by former governments, and even by this new 
government of which the minister is a member. We agree that 
immigrants and bona fide refugees should be allowed into 
Canada, but not criminals.
<P>
	Regarding appointments to Canada's Immigration and 
Refugee Board, more commissioners are expected to be 
appointed in the coming months. We will be watching the 
minister closely to ensure that the appointments he does make 
are not based on political affiliation. I hope that he will consult 
with all interested parties, including Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Naturally we share his concern about women refugees. This 
new issue is also a priority for us. We must protect women who 
have been persecuted, raped and abused and when appropriate, 
we must grant them political refugee status in Canada.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, as you can see from my accent and my name, 
I am a Quebecer of Chilean origin. I came to Quebec 20 years 
ago following the 1973 military coup in Chile. I have to say that 
I was warmly welcomed by Quebecers, labour unions, religious 
groups and international co-operation agencies as well as 
agencies working in the field of human rights.
<P>
	Before I arrived here, I was told I would be going to Canada 
and I was issued a visa. I was happy because in my mind, Canada 
was, and still is, a democratic country. However, when I arrived 
in Quebec, specifically in Montreal, I realized that there were 
two countries within Canada, two founding nations and peoples, 
two official languages and two cultures, each with its own 
history.
<P>
	Then, I understood the great aspirations of Quebecers, their 
desire to defend the French language, their traditions, their 
culture and their history, all the more so because I came from a 
country where the people had fought for similar goals against 
powerful forces, against the penetration of English into Chile 
and throughout Latin America, and for the right to develop their 
own culture and traditions.
<P>
	I became a sovereigntist. I have nothing against English 
Canada, where I have many friends especially within ethnic 
communities and within the labour movement. However, I 
support the creation of a country, Quebec, which is the deepest 
aspiration of Quebecers.
<P>
	During my term in office, I plan to travel throughout Canada 
and discuss these ideas with my friends everywhere. When a 
couple has problems and cannot continue to live together, it 
must face reality. I think this analogy can be applied to Quebec 
and next year, the referendum will prove that this is so.
<P>
	Like my party, I am a staunch supporter of immigration and I 
would hope that members of ethnic communities will not fear 
Quebec sovereignty as we sovereigntists feel that they will 
prove to be a formidable asset for Quebec and for Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="801"> 801 </A></B>
<P>
	At this time, I would like to dissociate myself from the 
position taken by other members of this House who are afraid of 
immigration and afraid of refugees. At times they propagate 
anti-immigrant sentiment and demand not only that harsh 
restrictions be placed on Canadian immigration levels, but also 
that claims of refugee status on political grounds and under the 
Canadian Charter be denied. I wish to dissociate myself because 
my position is vastly different from that of members who view 
immigration and refugees in this light.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The minister is not telling us anything new about immigration 
levels this afternoon. He is quoting the same figures a the 
Conservatives: 250,000 immigrants will be admitted to Canada 
in 1994. We have no qualms about this figure as long as Quebec 
can have its say on the numbers admitted to Quebec.
<P>
	As far as the mix of immigrants is concerned, we are in favour 
of Canada and Quebec throwing open their doors to political 
refugees. Canada and Quebec must honour their commitments. 
Canada was a signatory to the Geneva Convention relative to 
political refugees and we have to meet the humanitarian 
assistance requests that we receive from all over the world, 
where over 20 million refugees live in various countries. We 
discussed the situation in Bosnia a few days ago and I mentioned 
at the time that Canada should be open to Bosnian refugees.
<P>
	So, I maintain that Canada must also tackle the causes of this 
form of immigration, that is to say political or economic 
refugies, and try to solve the problem that exist in the countries 
of origin. People leave their countries because of problems such 
as racism, religious strife, poverty, the widening gap between 
industrialized countries and developing countries, political 
repression. We want Canada to be generous with refugees, while 
at the same time addressing the problems that brings them here 
in the first place.
<P>
	Based on the minister's announcement, we can see that the 
number of refugees admitted will increase only slightly, by 
3,500. We think that this is not enough, in view of what is going 
on in the world, in Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia and other countries, 
including El Salvador.
<P>
	I questioned the minister about the situation of Salvadoran 
refugees, but I did not get an answer in this House. Today, we 
read in the papers that the expulsion order has been suspended. 
That is not what we asked to minister to do. We were asking for a 
policy stating that Salvadoran refugees would not be returned to 
El Salvador because there are violent troubles in that area. Last 
December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself was telling 
us that political violence had flared up again in El Salvador. 
Death squads are still active there. Reports from various 
organizations, Development and Peace, Amnesty International, 
the UN and even the Salvadoran Human Rights Commission, all 
note the violence with disapproval.
<P>
	What the minister was asked to do was to apply to El Salvador 
the same policy as for Haiti, China, Iraq or Somalia. That is all 
we were asking and all the fifty or so Salvadoran refugees in 
Quebec were asking.
<P>
	What the press reports today is that there will be a review, but 
that has already been done. What we asked the minister to do is 
to exercise his jurisdiction. He has that power, under the 
Immigration Act, to intervene on humanitarian grounds, and he 
should use it to resolve the case of these Salvadoran refugees.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	He announced to us a few days ago what he intended to do 
about work permits for refugee claimants. We agree, we said so, 
but we would also like the minister to act more quickly.
<P>
	Why wait three months to give a political refugee claimant a 
work permit, as well as a medical certificate which he must have 
obtained before? This still takes a long time. If we do not want 
the refugee to collect welfare, he must start working as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	So far, the minister has not answered requests that these 
permits be granted quickly. In any case, we know that these 
refugees will not compete with Canadian workers because 
refugees will usually get only low-paid unpleasant jobs that 
other people cannot or will not do.
<P>
	I noted a glaring omission in the minister's statement, in that 
he said nothing about Quebec and the Ottawa-Quebec 
agreement. As you know, immigration is a shared 
federal-provincial jurisdiction. Quebec has always been 
concerned about immigration, even in the last century, because 
it is a vital problem for Quebec as it is for Canada. I would say 
that it is even more vital for Quebec because Quebec's birth rate 
is less than the Canadian average. Immigration in Quebec must 
make up this population deficit.
<P>
	Immigration is also intended to ensure economic prosperity 
and openness to the world. Quebec is open to the world, but 
immigration to Quebec must ensure the perpetuation of the 
French fact. Quebec is the only French-speaking state in North 
America. We made demands, we fought the fight and in 1968 we 
created the Quebec Department of Immigration. In 1978, the 
Couture-Cullen agreement gave Quebec the power to choose its 
immigrants. Later, this agreement was improved by the 
ministers, Monique Gagnon-Tremblay and Barbara McDougall. 
Today, regrettably, the Quebec Department of Immigration and 
Cultural Communities has been merged with the Department of 
International Affairs.
<P>
	But our main concern is the survival of French in Quebec, and 
it is closely tied to immigration. You know, as I myself have 
seen, most immigrants to Quebec integrated with the 
English-speaking minority. This has been aggravated by the 
federal government's policy of bilingualism in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="802"> 802 </A></B>
<P>
	We want Quebec to have immigrants. We also want them to be 
French-speaking as much as possible or at least able to join the 
French-speaking community as I was. I speak Spanish; I learned 
French because I joined the French speaking majority in 
Quebec.
<P>
	We also want immigration in Quebec to be regionalized. Too 
many immigrants are concentrated in Montreal, 90 per cent. 
That is why we say and repeat that bill 101 is absolutely 
necessary in Quebec and we would like English Canada to 
understand that.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Since Bill 101 in 1976, our children must attend French 
schools. I hope that this concern for immigration in Quebec, a 
distinct society, will become part of the minister's message in 
the future. Moreover, we want the agreements reached between 
Quebec and Ottawa to be honoured. For instance, by increasing 
the number of people admitted under the family reunification 
program, the minister is imposing a burden on Quebec since 
Quebec has no say in this program. The federal government sets 
objectives and Quebec does not have anything to say about it. I 
hope that in the future you will pay more attention to this aspect 
of the immigration policy.
<P>
	The final objective of our party, and of the entire sovereigntist 
movement in Quebec, is to put the immigration policy under 
Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction. Again, Quebec is open to 
foreigners and immigrants; we want to build a just, democratic 
and fraternal society that is open to the world and based on 
solidarity.

	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I do not want to 
interrupt my hon. friend from the Reform Party. I just wanted to 
respond to my Bloc critic who said that it was his understanding 
that he was to get the documents at noon. I believe my officials 
delivered them at one o'clock.
<P>
	I want to tell the House that I told my officials to provide the 
reports to my critics at the traditional-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, Mr. Minister. 
The point of order is out of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate this opportunity to reply to the minister's 
announcement.
<P>
	This is a policy area of great importance to the people of 
Canada and to Canada's future. I hope the minister will regard 
the alternatives presented from this side of the House as 
constructive and will take them to heart.
<P>
	I do not need again to point out that Canada is indeed a nation 
of immigrants. The country as we know it today would not exist 
were it not for the ambition, struggle and determination of 
millions of people who have landed on our shores in search of a 
better life.
<P>
	Indeed, my parents were immigrants and as such I understand 
the desire for something better which has motivated millions 
over the years to come to Canada.
<P>
	Along with the road to becoming a great nation built by 
immigrants, Canada has also gained the reputation as a 
compassionate nation. It is one that has opened its arms to 
hundreds of thousands of refugees, displaced persons and 
families wishing to be united.
<P>
	We are a compassionate nation. We have stayed true to and 
even gone beyond the mandate created by the United Nations 
Secretary General regarding refugees. I am proud to be a citizen 
of a country that has gained an international reputation for its 
fairness, compassion and its acceptance of immigrants of all 
kinds.
<P>
	Further, I represent a riding that more than any other in 
Calgary is populated by immigrants or the children of 
immigrants. During the course of my campaign I was fortunate 
to have had an opportunity to receive input from hundreds of 
newcomers to this country.
<P>
	In short, I applaud the minister, who is himself an immigrant, 
for his dedication in this area and his integrity. Nonetheless, I 
must seriously question the policy which the minister has 
announced. This policy could be of more harm than help to 
Canada given our economic state.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister has announced that immigration levels this year 
will be about 250,000, a substantial number I might add. Of 
those immigrants 111,000 will come from the family 
sponsorship class, 28,300 will be refugees and 110,700 will be 
economic and independent immigrants.
<P>
	How does the minister justify this level of immigration? Is 
there a need at present for this number of immigrants? Upon 
what rationale does the minister base his numbers? The answers 
to these questions should be discoverable from the minister's 
statement today or from his press kit.
<P>
	However when one searches the minister's statement 
regarding today's announcement one finds that rather than 
answers regarding the rationale behind this level of immigration 
being answered, more questions arise. The minister wrote that in 
1994 immigration levels balanced humanitarian considerations 
with demographic and economic needs. Could the minister 
please explain to this House exactly what sort of a balance has 
been achieved apart from a strictly numerical one?
<P>
	In fact, the minister's projected numbers continue the pattern 
of allowing numbers of family and refugee class immigrants 
that are virtually unheard of in the industrialized world today. Is 
this a balance? Very few other governments would agree. What 
exactly are the demographic and economic needs that Canada 
faces which this proposed number of immigrants will address?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="803"> 803 </A></B>
<P>
	Further, the immigrants that Canada accepts do not settle in 
our sparsely populated regions. Rather they are attracted to our 
already overcrowded and overburdened metropolitan areas like 
Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. Those areas are already 
polluted. Their landfill sites are overflowing, their traffic is 
congested, their crime rates are steadily increasing and their 
schools and hospitals are overcrowded and short of funds. I 
wonder if the Liberal government took these issues into 
consideration when they put together a policy that would add 
more than a quarter of a million new people to Canada per year, 
people who will be attracted to those overburdened metro areas?
<P>
	Why then does Canada need the number of immigrants 
announced? Yes, there was a time when Canada needed vast 
numbers of people, people with very specific skills to open up 
our underpopulated areas. That time has long since passed. Even 
today as a percentage of our population Canada is still accepting 
more immigrants than any other industrialized nation on earth. 
Why does this government want to up the number even more?
<P>
	The government seems to believe that with our fertility rate, 
which is currently about 1.7, the Canadian population will begin 
to decline at some point in the future and further, that the aging 
of our population will place increasing strains upon our social 
assistance systems and a drain upon our federal reserves as 
fewer and fewer young people in the population will be working 
to pay for these social programs.
<P>
	It is as though the government is using a kind of social 
engineering to slow down the aging of the population through 
immigration. Had it studied the demographic projection model 
of the Economic Council of Canada, it would have discovered 
that the council's proposal recommends that immigration levels 
be set at the average of the last 25 years, which is .63 per cent of 
the population per year or about 170,000 immigrants.
<P>
	Of the studies that the Reform caucus has examined even this 
number of 170,000 per year represents the high end. Compare 
that, Madam Speaker, with the 250,000 as the announcement 
indicates that this government proposes that we accept.
<P>
	The government wants us to believe that we will reap 
enormous benefits by allowing this number of immigrants each 
year but it has neglected to mention the costs of immigration. A 
Southam study of literacy in Canada published in 1987 reported 
that about 34,000 functionally illiterate immigrants were 
admitted annually. Does this government not feel that there is a 
cost to be incurred by admitting tens of thousands of illiterate 
immigrants, especially with the cuts in English as a second 
language program that are being made across the country?
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The provinces no longer have the funds necessary to support a 
poorly thought out federal immigration policy. For example, the 
Government of Ontario-and the minister alluded to this-is 
straining with the acceptance of 59 per cent of all of Canada's 
immigrants and while receiving 39 per cent of federal funds.
<P>
	These sorts of problems will only be made worse if we accept 
the flood of immigrants proposed by this government, 
especially when those immigrants are chosen largely from the 
family or refugee classes and not as independent immigrants 
chosen for their human capital; chosen for their skills, their 
ability to quickly and independently integrate into Canadian life 
as well as their ability to contribute to the economic needs of 
this country. Choosing immigrants on this basis is the policy of 
the Reform Party. It is one which we believe would turn our 
present immigration dilemma into a solution to some of 
Canada's economic woes. Just some.
<P>
	On the other hand, the immigration plan put forward by the 
government will actually discriminate against those immigrants 
who could contribute most to Canada's growth and prosperity. It 
gives preference to those immigrants who tend to be a drain 
upon our social services and will lower the average skill level of 
our work force.
<P>
	This government is saying that we need to take in our fair 
share of refugees when in fact Canada's acceptance rate for 
refugee applicants is already among the highest in the world. 
This government says that we need to make family class a 
priority when our family class acceptance system is already 
among the most generous in the world.
<P>
	The government in its red book states that we must take 
humanitarianism and compassion into account in our 
immigration policy. We are already being more compassionate 
than any other nation in the world. Is it not fair to demand that 
this compassion be mated with practicality and a consideration 
of the other needs in the country?
<P>
	I want to stress that the Reform Party does not oppose 
immigration. On the contrary, the Reform Party recognizes that 
Canada is a nation of immigrants, that this nation was built by 
immigrants and could continue to benefit from immigration, but 
only if the immigration is based on a sensible, well thought out 
policy that reflects Canada's needs.
<P>
	The Reform caucus strongly urges the government to 
re-examine its immigration policy. We strongly recommend 
that Canada return to its traditional policy for determining the 
admissible number of immigrants by first determining Canada's 
real economic needs.
<P>
	The government must also re-examine its refugee 
determination process. We believe that only genuine refugees 
should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="804"> 804 </A></B>
<P>
welcome and that bogus refugees, illegal entrants and criminal 
offenders should be immediately deported. Further, anyone who 
engages in  or encourages such activities should be subject to 
severe penalties.
<P>
	I applaud the minister for his plan to open up to the Canadian 
people Canada's immigration policy. If a major overhaul is 
necessary, and it appears that it is, then it should be prompted by 
a national referendum. This would ensure that in the area of 
immigration the Canadian people and not special interests 
would shape this sensitive national policy.

<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The debate is on a motion tabled by the federal Minister of 
Human Resources Development, that a committee of the House 
be directed to consult broadly, to-as the motion says-analyse 
and to make recommendations regarding the modernization and 
restructuring of Canada's social security system.
<P>
	If this motion were tabled in any other Parliament, we would 
be inclined to think it was good news. In the normal course of 
events, a government may wish to review its social programs in 
order to improve them, to make them more productive, as they 
say, and provide more protection and security for those in our 
society who need it most.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have the impression that today, this motion is 
not good news for Canadian men and women. There may be are 
some disturbing developments if we consider that since the very 
beginning of the election campaign, the focus has been on the 
economy, to the exclusion of all other issues in this country.
<P>
	As you know, Madam Speaker, whenever we talk about the 
economy, financial problems and challenges to social choices, 
the prime concern of the people who engage in this exercise is to 
cut social programs. The government must take on a very heavy 
financial burden to honour its commitments to the most 
vulnerable in our society, as expressed in the social programs 
put in place over the years by a succession of parliaments.
<P>
	Inevitably, because of the very size of this budget item, 
whenever there is talk of cutting back and restructuring, social 
programs are the obvious target for all these people who can 
lobby the government and the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Listen to what the wealthiest members of the business 
community have to say about tackling Canada's budget 
problems. Most of them would tell you: Cut social programs. 
Too many people are abusing these programs. Too many people 
are getting around the system and drawing benefits without 
being entitled to them.
<P>
	They will tell you also this is common practice and that there 
are welfare recipients in the provinces who abuse the system. 
They describe one or two or three cases of fraud with a great deal 
of emphasis, to show the system works and how taxpayers' 
money is wasted. That is the kind of answer you get, Madam 
Speaker, when you put this question to the people in our society 
who are well off.
<P>
	When do you hear a wealthy businessman, the member of a 
wealthy industrial dynasty, say that 2,384 cases of fraud in such 
and such an area or over a year or over two years, together 
represent a quarter of a tenth of half of what he saves in income 
tax in his family trust or through tax shelters to which he has 
access? We have reached the point in this country where 
whenever a welfare recipient or a unemployed worker is caught 
in the act of trying to save his daily pittance and is tempted to 
defraud one of the social programs, such cases are given a lot of 
publicity. Every time they are right there on the front page, grist 
to the mill of people who argue against helping the neediest in 
our society.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Tell me, Madam Speaker, when do you hear people wonder, 
worry, or rebel because some succeed in saving-I use the term 
saving out of politeness-taxes through all kinds of legal and 
sometimes not so legal ploys? In any case, our society treats like 
heroes those who manage to avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	There are even companies putting ads in the newspapers 
saying: ``Come and see us. We are experts on tax shelters. You 
do not want to pay any taxes? This is the place to come''. Our 
society is now at the point where it puts on a pedestal those who 
somehow succeed in avoiding paying taxes and giving their due 
to the tax man. On the other hand, every time a welfare recipient 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="807"> 807 </A></B>
<P>
living well below the poverty level manages to defraud the 
system, there is a general outcry right across the country.
<P>
	In this context, and at this stage, we are concerned by the 
minister's initiative. We are concerned because we know those 
who support the members opposite. We know the economic 
interests which have brought this government to power; its 
supporters are among the wealthiest in our society and they have 
direct channels of communications, not with the secretaries of 
state, but with the senior ministers in the Cabinet. It is those 
people who hold real power and who influence the decision 
process.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> When a government is motivated 
by such partisan interests and when the people who support it 
have a perspective like the one I described earlier, it is a concern 
for welfare recipients who have no say in the decision-making 
process and no one in Parliament to inform the ministers of their 
problems.
<P>
	When this session got underway a few months after we were 
elected to come here and work for the well-being of Canadians, 
our leader, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, told us and the 
press that our party would be the protector of social rights in 
Canada. He added that those who have no access to Cabinet or to 
the lobbies of powerful people with contacts and connections to 
influence the government would be able to count on the Official 
Opposition, that is the 54 Bloc Quebecois members, to represent 
them.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> The government takes all these 
measures under the pretense of being short of money. The 
federal administration is in a bad financial situation. The 
government says we must not penalize those who will follow us, 
namely our children. How touching, Madam Speaker! When 
will the decision-makers in this government understand that it 
would be more appropriate to explore new options than to target 
the poor in our society and reduce the benefits of those who 
hardly have anything? We agree that the financial situation of 
Canada is tragic. We agree that the successive governments, 
starting with the previous Liberal administration in which the 
current Prime Minister was Minister of Finance, have generated 
deficits for Canada. Indeed, the Liberal government of the time 
was followed by a Conservative government which continued to 
put us in deeper economic trouble.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> None of that is true.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, truth hurts. See 
how the members opposite become vocal when we point to the 
real problems, when we remind them that their Prime Minister, 
their leader, was Minister of Finance when the financial 
situation started to deteriorate seriously in Canada. Their leader 
was the one who, while he was Minister of Finance, never could 
redress the downward curve the country's economy had 
hopelessly taken. It hurts!
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> At a time when we are trying to 
solve the financial problems of Canada, the members opposite 
have only one suggestion to make: cut social programs, cut off 
the unemployed. There is no other way. This is the third federal 
government to bring us deeper into debt, the third one to add to 
the debt which has now reached $500 billion. That is quite a 
debt! And they want to solve the problem at the expense of the 
have-nots of our society. Do you expect us to accept such unfair 
proposals without a word?
<P>
	If they want to know where to save money, let us explore a few 
avenues before we cut social programs. Let us try to find 
solutions before we cut off the unemployed, welfare recipients 
and old age pensioners, let us try to find a way to trim the fat off 
government institutions. From the beginning of the election 
campaign, from the instant we set foot in this Parliament, the 
Leader of the Official Opposition, our leader, has been 
requesting the creation of a committee where elected members 
would examine government expenditures. Our role should be 
enhanced, they say; well, what better task is there for a member 
than to tell government which useless activities to cut or abolish 
in order to protect his constituents, especially those in need.
<P>
	Three consecutive governments have failed in this 
Parliament; Liberals, Tories and Liberals again can be rightly 
accused of mismanagement and poor administration. Their 
inability to make the necessary decisions, their lack of political 
courage put us in such a difficult situation that today we have to 
call upon the disadvantaged of our society to make up for their 
incompetence.
<P>
	They want to know where to cut? Well then, let the 
government members tell their Prime Minister that they are 
dying, as I know they are, to go through the federal 
government's expenditures, item by item. Let those members in 
power satisfy their burning urge to go and tell senior civil 
servants how harmful some of their department's activities are, 
how useless they are, what a total waste of money overlapping 
is.
<P>
	I can see it written on the faces of some of you here, that you 
have the interests of your constituents at heart and would like to 
do your job as an MP properly and be able to save money, as any 
responsible parliamentarian would. Every time we save 
$100,000, it is $100,000 that will not come out of the have-not's 
pockets, we can be sure of that. And maybe they will get to keep 
it. Only then will we feel we are doing our job of representing 
our constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="808"> 808 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, there is another 
problem which seems to go over the heads of every one on the 
government side in this House, and that is the issue of 
overlapping jurisdictions and duplication of services. If I 
remember correctly, we have been here for three weeks now, and 
if we were to study the issues which have been of concern to us, 
the topics which have been raised the most often for the past 
three weeks, we would probably come to the conclusion that our 
overall concern is the overlapping and duplication we have been 
subjected to by the federal government over the years.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	This administrative overlap is not disconnected from reality; 
everyone recognizes that it does not make sense. In public 
management, every time we mention government deficit, we are 
told about private enterprise: ``Look at how this or that company 
is managed''. Then they give us examples: ``Look at Alcan, at 
General Motors, at Chrysler, at Bombardier. See how successful 
they are''. What did these companies do when they ran into 
economic problems? Very simple. First, they streamlined 
operations.
<P>
	Every time a responsible businessman wants to take 
significant administrative measures, the first thing to do is 
streamline operations. For the benefit of the hon. members 
opposite, streamlining means eliminating all dual 
responsibilities, redundant organizations and non-essential 
services, simplifying administration and lines of 
communications to become more efficient and cost effective.
<P>
	If this is good for private enterprise, if everyone sees it as the 
right approach, why should it not also be good for governments? 
Should the first step to be taken by a government wanting to turn 
around a disastrous financial situation not be to eliminate 
everything that is unnecessary, all overlap and duplication?
<P>
	Before cutting into services and product quality, Chrysler 
Canada went through a crucial streamlining process.
<P>
	The government is doing exactly the opposite. Instead of 
streamlining, they will cut into product quality, into social 
services, they will reorganize by saving a few billion here and 
there at the expense of unfortunate people. I am convinced that 
no administrative measure will be taken to eliminate this dual 
administration with provincial and municipal governments.
<P>
	In the employment sector alone, just to show how political 
beliefs deeply held by the hon. members opposite prevent them 
from being efficient and seeing clearly, there is total unanimity 
in Quebec, except for Liberal members of Parliament who have 
managed to get elected in Quebec. Everyone else, including 
Liberal members of Quebec's Legislative Assembly, is 
convinced that employment responsibilities should come under 
Quebec's jurisdiction. Even the previous Premier had 
understood this and taken a step in the right direction.
<P>
	It is essential to convey our position to the members of this 
Parliament because it is shared by everyone and publicly 
defensible.
<P>
	Do you know how many employment programs there are? 
Give or take a few, there are about 24 in the Quebec government 
and 27 or so in the federal government. An unemployed person 
who wants to get out of unemployment insurance or welfare in 
Quebec is faced with a total of 51 programs under two or three 
different administrations and in different buildings. They are 
not always consistent and he may well lose any hope of ever 
getting out of this vicious circle.
<P>
	What are the hon. members opposite doing in this regard? We 
are looking at $250 million a year. It is an impressive amount: 
$250 million a year. Have you ever thought of renouncing your 
crippling brand of Canadian nationalism, with your tentacles 
reaching into every Canadian province and territory, this kind of 
new disease that makes Canadian federalists want to keep a 
finger in every pie, because the truth lies in this Parliament?
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Do you realize that, if we did without, we could save-and by 
acting diligently we could also solve an extremely serious 
problem-$250 million a year?
<P>
	Instead of making cuts on the backs of the poor, in benefits to 
less fortunate Canadians, old age pensions, unemployment 
insurance or federal transfer payments used to pay for social 
assistance, we could at least manage to save that much, and this 
$250 million could stay in the pockets of people who really need 
that money.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are signalling that I am running out of 
time. I would have liked to take each area of duplication and 
demonstrate, with figures to back it up-because it can be 
done-how many millions of dollars could have been saved, 
how much streamlining of the government system should be 
done and how much simpler relations between Ottawa and the 
provinces could be made. By taking these steps, we would have 
done the very first thing any sensible manager does. Without 
sacrificing quality, we would have cut the fat and taken a hard 
look at administration and bad management.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very attentively to the remarks of the hon. member 
opposite, and I was somewhat surprised. Surprised because the 
words never change. We are always covering the same ground in 
this debate.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member who gave him the right to say 
that only his party speaks for the most disadvantaged in society? 
His party represents only a portion of this country. The Liberal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="809"> 809 </A></B>
<P>
Party of Canada represents all Canadians and all of the 
disadvantaged people in this country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> As a Quebecer and as a member of a 
community that is not one of the country's two founding 
communities, I get the feeling from the hon. member that he 
thinks the people on this side of the House-and let us not forget 
that we are all well off-that we come from a segment of society 
that does not understand the problems of the less fortunate. I was 
rather insulted by what he said because I believe that the Liberal 
Party of Canada and its leader tried to field candidates who 
represented all segments, races, languages and economic levels 
of our society. When our party speaks, it does so not only on 
behalf of the wealthy. It speaks for everyone.
<P>
	Besides, who said anything about cuts? We have not yet made 
any decisions about cuts in this House. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development has yet to make any announcements 
about cuts. Instead, he has welcomed a debate on this issue. He 
has asked members to think about the future of the services 
provided here in Canada. The hon. member has already decided 
that we are going to make cuts, but we have not yet decided 
anything of the sort. We are in the process of holding 
consultations. We have not yet made any decisions. We want to 
consult all Canadians, not just one group or one province, but all 
Canadians. Then we will make our decisions.
<P>
	We are not going to reduce pensions. If the hon. member had 
taken the time to read the Liberal Party's red book, he would 
have seen that we stated clearly that we would not cut pensions 
or target the most disadvantaged members of our society.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for her comments, for this question and for her 
assessment. Of course, far be it from me, if she ever took it that 
way, to say that the people opposite were all rich and 
disconnected from the middle class in this society.
<P>
	What I said, however, is that I tried to explain in this House 
that normally, when you want to find out what motivates a 
particular group, you look at the hand that feeds them. If the 
hand that feeds them is a certain type of people in society, if 
those who support their political party, those who get a good 
hearing from each of the hon. ministers of this government, 
those who are known to be friends of those in power-I am not at 
all calling into question the hon. member-I say that the backers 
of those who are in government and the supporters of the 
political party from which the government is formed have 
well-defined and clearly identifiable interests. That is just what 
I mean, no more and no less.
<P>
	I would simply say to the hon. member that I do not think that 
broad based geographical representation is enough to represent 
adequately the interests of a certain category of people in 
society. Rather, it is the policies proposed which show who 
represents whom.
<P>
	When the hon. member says that there were no cuts and that 
no decisions have been made, I am sorry, I must tell the hon. 
member that I disagree. I noticed that our colleague, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, just before the opening 
of the session, in a speech here in Ottawa, not far from this 
Parliament, said as seriously as could be that 20 per cent must be 
cut from the cost of health care in Canada.
<P>
	I really like the hon. member, I take her word, I wish that she 
had the same weight in cabinet as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, but she does not. He intends to cut 20 
per cent from health care. He said so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, to begin, I found it difficult to 
follow the logic of the previous speaker because at one point in 
time he was asking why the government would not operate the 
same as a business.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that in the case of many of the 
examples the member for Roberval used in his remarks, such as 
Chrysler, Alcan and General Motors, over the last 10 years when 
these corporations ran into difficulty, they came to government 
and asked for help in the interest of keeping their people 
employed. In most cases-I believe in all these three cases-in 
the interest of keeping these organizations vibrant, alive and 
keeping their skilled labour forces active and competitive, the 
Government of Canada supported these organizations.
<P>
	The same thing happened with those organizations in relation 
to the tax act. Many of these organizations have tremendous tax 
preferences and tax grants. I find it inconsistent that the member 
would say we should try to operate this place like a business 
when in fact business gets into trouble, especially big business, 
and usually the first place they come for help is the Government 
of Canada.
<P>
	I am happy to have eight or nine minutes to speak on the 
initiative of the Minister of Human Resources Development to 
attempt to reinvent our social net, not cut or trash it but reinvent 
it, so we can make it much more effective and productive for 
those people in our communities who need it the most.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	The reason I personally have such great confidence in this 
exercise is because I had the opportunity of working with this 
minister during the last great recession we had in this country. 
That was in November 1982. I would like to share with the 
House and with Canadians a very specific initiative that the then 
Minister of Employment and Immigration-today he is 
responsible for human resources-put forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="810"> 810 </A></B>
<P>
	It was November 10, 1982. I went to the Library of Parliament 
on Monday morning to pull this out. It was called the New 
Employment Expansion and Development Program.
<P>
	This was an effort by that young minister to try to put 
unemployed Canadians back to work quickly during that very 
tough recession. I am going to talk for a few minutes about this 
program because I believe this program can work today, and I 
hope that as we go through renewal we would consider going 
back to some of the good things we have done in the past and 
consider them, especially if they worked.
<P>
	What the minister essentially said at that time was that it costs 
on average, using today's dollars, approximately $17,000 to 
$20,000 a year to keep a person on unemployment insurance or 
welfare. Why would we not take that same money and work with 
the small, medium and large businesses of this country in a joint 
venture program to help put people back to work? They would 
have to put in a percentage as well.
<P>
	At that time it was approximately 70-30. In today's terms that 
would mean we would divert the $20,000 for the person 
unemployed and the company would put in approximately 
$10,000. In a five-month period under that NEED program we 
put close to 300,000 Canadians back to work.
<P>
	What I liked about that program was the fact that it used the 
private sector as the operational unit. This was not creating a 
new bureaucracy. This was not using the institution of 
government. This cut out duplication. The Bloc Quebecois 
always comes back to duplication and multiple programs, and 
quite frankly, I share their view. One of the worst states we have 
in this city is the way the bureaucracy has institutionalized itself 
on so many different programs, where 50 cents on the dollar 
goes to supporting the bureaucrats and the end user gets only 50 
cents.
<P>
	If we ran anything like that in the private sector we would in 
fact be trashed. We should be trying to make sure the end user 
gets a majority of the money rather than the bureaucrats and 
their institutions and their paper pushing mechanisms.
<P>
	Those small and medium sized businesses also had a crisis of 
confidence at that time and were reticent about putting people 
on the payroll, because it was a tough time in 1981 and in 1982 
as well. The beautiful thing about the NEED program the 
minister instituted at that time was the fact that this money, 
which would otherwise have gone to a person on unemployment, 
was there as a lever to get people into productive capacity, and 
the fact that they only had to put in approximately 30 per cent of 
the wage was a catalyst. There was very little paper involved.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I believe what the minister was trying to say to us this week 
was that we have to go back to the drawing boards. We were 
elected to put people back to work right away and to do that in 
the most cost effective way we possibly can. I believe that as we 
are going through these programs and as we do this analysis, we 
should not just throw everything out the window. We should also 
take a look at some of the things we have done in the past that 
have worked well for Canadians. If we can see that they worked, 
as the NEED program worked, then we should consider them 
again.
<P>
	What I like about this program is that-and I say this to all 
members-we do not need to reinvent the wheel; we can bring it 
up to date.
<P>
	One of the flaws in this deal, in my opinion, was that they 
allowed government organizations to participate in this program 
at the provincial and municipal levels. I suggest a modification 
would be that it should be only private sector employers and 
only small, medium and large-sized businesses.
<P>
	I believe that with the success rate the minister had in 1982 
with the NEED program, where in a five-month period he put 
close to 35,000 people back to work, if we use that same kind of 
creative thinking today, that notion of reinventing, then there is 
great hope for us to put people back to work quickly. That is the 
kind of thing the minister is hoping we will all participate in.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Prior to going to 
questions and comments, I wish to inform the House that 
pursuant to Standing Order 33(2)(b), because of the ministerial 
statement government orders will be extended by 52 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I too remember the NEED program.
<P>
	As the hon. member mentioned, there definitely is reason to 
resurrect some of the programs that worked. But if we are going 
to resurrect and not reinvent the wheel, we had better go back to 
the marketplace and discuss with people who actually use the 
program what happened as a direct result of the use of some of 
these programs.
<P>
	One of the problems with that particular program was this. 
When the government is prepared to pay 70 per cent, what 
happens is that people get laid off and others get rehired to 
replace them. That may not be the way the program was 
designed but that was the effect of the program.
<P>
	I would suggest further that if this kind of thing is done it 
should be exactly reversed. The majority of the income an 
employee would get would have to come from the employer, and 
if the government was going to top up anything, it would have to 
be the minority amount and not the majority amount.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="811"> 811 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, 
through you to the member for Edmonton Southwest, that is 
where we have an ideological difference.
<P>
	I am speaking now as someone who has the experience of 
living in a city like Toronto, where we have about 650,000 
people unemployed. It is the worst unemployment in the country 
right now and it is something we as a city are not used to. We 
have never had a crisis of confidence like the one we are going 
through right now.
<P>
	Part of my reason for going to this NEED program was that a 
couple of my constituents reminded me about their success in 
being on the program.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	We are so desperate to get people back to work right now, I am 
afraid that if we only come up with 30 per cent of a person's 
wage, I am not sure that would be enough to mobilize the 
650,000 small businesses in my province that we really depend 
on. That is the case not just in my province, but all across the 
country.
<P>
	Maybe I am being a little too generous on this, but I believe 
that the dignity of a person working is very important. We are 
already disbursing close to $20,000 when they are sitting at 
home doing nothing. Maybe we could make this a national 
exercise and maybe only have it in operation for about six 
months, not forever. Maybe we could have a couple of million 
signs sent to every small business person in Canada saying: 
``Jobs Canada, six-month period, here is where it is. You must 
take advantage of it in that six month period to get people back 
to work again or the opportunity lapses''.
<P>
	If we could build in the kind of protections the hon. member is 
talking about we would be able to meet both our objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech of the hon. member and I asked 
myself a few questions. We know that in the past, some 
programs for re-entry into the labour force enabled employers 
to hire new employees whose salaries were paid in part by the 
government. Unfortunately, they were often laid off when the 
government grant expired. Today, in my riding and the 
neighbouring ridings, people are telling me that they do not want 
short term employment, jobs partly paid by the government to 
give the illusion that workers have been rehired, have been made 
to re-enter the labour force.
<P>
	Although I agree with much of what the hon. member said, I 
would not want people to be fooled, I would not like to see 
companies firing their employees once the government funds 
run out. Beyond that, I did not sense in that speech-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question and 
comment period has expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are now returning to debate unless we have unanimous 
consent for a comment.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We do not have 
unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
begin by congratulating all my colleagues who were elected to 
the House of Commons on October 25. I would also like to thank 
the constituents of Lincoln for electing me to office. I consider it 
an honour and will do my best to serve them. I would like to 
thank my family and friends for their support and also the many 
volunteers who worked so very hard during the election.
<P>
	For those hon. members who are not familiar with my riding 
of Lincoln, it includes part of east Hamilton through to St. 
Catharines which encompasses Stoney Creek, Grimsby, 
Beamsville, Vineland and Jordan.
<P>
	Lincoln's workforce combines the industry found in Hamilton 
East and Stoney Creek and the farming area for which the 
Niagara Peninsula is so famous. Both of these industries have 
been under severe pressure due to increased global 
competitiveness. That is why I am pleased to have this 
opportunity to address the hon. members on some of the means 
by which this government will effectively manage its labour and 
employment programs despite the continuing financial 
constraints.
<P>
	At the outset I want to acknowledge the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. My colleague, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg South Centre, is playing a strategic and visionary role 
in leading our government on these critical matters.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development has 
pointed out, in developed societies like ours the primary source 
of income is derived from paid work. Earnings are distributed 
among family members and savings are put aside for education, 
retirement and the unforeseen contingencies.
<P>
	In the same way our social security network allocates funds 
for the benefit of children, the unemployed and our senior 
citizens. Learning, training, income security and old age 
pensions are all inextricably intertwined and this is a reality that 
we must face as we approach the whole question of social reform 
in a rapidly evolving society.
<P>
	We cannot do this in piecemeal fashion, as there are many 
considerations we have to take into account. While this 
government must and will take the lead in this process it is vital 
that all affected parties, particularly labour, business and special 
interest groups, be involved in the consultation process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="812"> 812 </A></B>
<P>
	Recent history shows that countries best able to contend with 
economic changes are the ones committed to strong 
labour-management partnerships. These types of networks and 
alliances set up by consistently successful industrial nations 
illustrate how critical consultation and co-operation are to 
achieving that competitive edge.
<P>
	Human resources are at the very top of this government's list 
of priorities with respect to restoring Canada to a leading 
industrial nation. Our focus is to get Canadians working. To get 
Canadians working the contribution of skills development to 
economic performance must be emphasized.
<P>
	One of the pivotal factors leading to improved productivity, 
trade performance and creativity is the enhancement of those 
proficient skills. These skills are the key to our long term 
competitiveness, both in specific industries and in the entire 
economy. The very nature of employment is changing.
<P>
	Most income securities were designed in an era of strong 
demand for labour at all skill levels. It was possible for 
individuals to leave school at almost any age or to arrive in 
Canada from any country and find work quickly. The prospects 
that work would pay reasonably well and would lead to a career 
with the same employer were quite good at that time but the 
economy and labour markets have changed since the mid 
seventies Traditional sources of high wage and high benefit 
employment such as large companies and government are 
cutting jobs.
<P>
	Most jobs now being created require relatively high skill 
levels. Often these are difficult to fill because too many of the 
applicants lack the required proficiency. This has lead to a 
disproportionate impact on two groups of workers. One 
comprises of the older workers whose skills are now obsolete 
and whose wage expectations are high, and the other group is 
made up of young people who have not undergone the training 
necessary to move into these positions.
<P>
	We all know that young people are facing hardship today. 
They have the highest rate of unemployment in the country and 
in Lincoln, in particular, the unemployment figure for youth is 
close to 22 per cent. We cannot permit this new generation to 
reach adulthood without any sense of achieving employment 
security. It has become increasingly evident that market forces 
alone will not solve our problems. We must focus our attention 
on providing Canadians with the opportunity for meaningful 
employment, employment that contributes to the growth and 
development of our economy.
<P>
	There will be employment gains made in some sectors of the 
economy. For example, the service sector, including both the 
high tech and the more traditional service industries, is expected 
to continue to grow in the 1990s as well as the small business 
sector.
<P>
	Almost half of the new jobs created between 1979 and 1989 
came from firms with fewer than 20 employees. The economy is 
creating jobs that demand more education. Between 1990 and 
1993 jobs from university graduates increased by 17 per cent, 
while those for high school graduates remained about the same. 
More important, jobs for high school dropouts dropped by 17 
per cent.
<P>
	At a time when jobs that pay well require higher skill levels 
we have almost 40 per cent of Canadians with limited or no 
reading skills.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	The statistics are quite alarming but the difficulties that they 
reflect are not insurmountable. Working together we can 
galvanize our intellectual resources and face these daunting 
challenges as we have done in many areas of endeavour before.
<P>
	It will take a collaborative approach with the provinces, the 
private sector and communities across the country. It will also 
take creativity and courage to change our preconceived notions 
about how to go about changing the business of the activating of 
our work force and instilling it with confidence.
<P>
	Through consultation with all members of the House, small 
business, labour and other interested parties, we will ensure 
labour issues are dealt with in a manner that provides for the 
highest possible standards, consistent with progressive training 
and leading-edge technology.
<P>
	Through consultation we may devise restructured working 
arrangements to better accommodate work and family 
responsibilities. This could well involve reducing the number of 
working hours or bringing in shared employment to protect jobs 
and ensure the equitable distribution of the total hours of work 
available.
<P>
	In conjunction with the provinces, private sector, unions and 
local communities, this government will strive to improve the 
income security programs. A comprehensive and integrated 
approach to reforming the whole raft of national and provincial 
social programs is necessary to restore the hope, confidence and 
pride of the Canadian people.
<P>
	These redesigned programs will better meet our current and 
future needs within the context of providing work incentives 
rather than disincentives. The government is undertaking the 
redesign of programs because it has a vision. The vision will 
have the objective of encouraging individual incentive, 
promoting the creation of wealth, and establishing a robust 
export-oriented economy which will benefit Canadians.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We will now move to the 
question and comment period. The hon. member for Portneuf 
has the floor, since I interrupted him during his first comment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="813"> 813 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, this is 
very kind of you. In a way I am glad you interrupted me, because 
the hon. member has said things I did not hear in the speech of 
the previous speaker who has now left.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke about training. He was proposing that 
manpower be upgraded to a level which would allow it to fill the 
more technical jobs now offered. In that sense, I quite agree with 
my colleague, the hon. member for Lincoln.
<P>
	This being said, I am sure that the hon. member will agree 
that, in Canada, industries and companies differ according to the 
local natural resources or the contacts with our neighbour to the 
south of the 47th parallel. Therefore, the needs are different.
<P>
	Is it possible to direct an operation of such complexity and 
such diversity from Ottawa? I do not think so, but I would like 
the opinion of the hon. member on that.
<P>
	I would like to mention a solution that works in Quebec, but 
would probably work even better if the federal government was 
willing to follow up on it. Perhaps he heard about the Société 
québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre. This 
organization would be more than willing to undertake precisely 
what he mentioned. In my opinion, it is high time that his 
colleagues in the Liberal caucus take into consideration his 
brilliant ideas, especially the previous speakers. I wish he could 
propose a regionalization of actions with the help, for example, 
of the Société québécoise de développement de la 
main-d'oeuvre. I would like to hear the comments of the hon. 
member for Lincoln on that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> I appreciate the opportunity to respond. I should 
also state that training is a shared responsibility. Through 
consultations like today, I am sure we will investigate the 
various opportunities available in order to deal with the training.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	As a government we are promoting a national objective. We 
want to increase employment. We are looking at the portability 
of these skills so we can break down interprovincial trade 
barriers and have the movement of skills and capital throughout 
the provinces.
<P>
	Although the hon. member is indicating that the skills and 
training should be taken care of by the province of Quebec, we 
as a government are pushing for the reduction of those trade 
barriers and increasing employment. We are also taking other 
measures besides the national apprenticeship program. We are 
bringing in, as we have announced, an infrastructure program 
right across the country to increase employment. We believe 
that by breaking down these barriers and allowing the transfer of 
skills across the provinces we will achieve success.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to what was said by the last two or 
three speakers and I would like to say I agree entirely with the 
statements of the member for Roberval. On the other hand, I am 
concerned by what I heard coming from the government 
members who have not been reassuring since the beginning of 
this debate. True enough, nothing has been decided yet as 
regards cuts in social programs, but I can tell you that this 
morning's <I>La Presse</I> outlines major problems in the area of 
social housing in Valleyfield, in my riding. Compared to the 
average of 16.9 per cent for the province, in Valleyfield, 19.3 per 
cent of the people have to give more than half their salary for 
rent.
<P>
	There is nothing reassuring in the government's remarks on 
the next budget as far as social housing is concerned. The 
situation is disastrous and urgent; the government must 
immediately find a solution and restore financial assistance for 
social housing.
<P>
	As far as the workforce is concerned, we have been talking 
about this for a long time now. Quebec has its own manpower 
development programs. I see no need for a continuing debate or 
discussion between the two levels of government since it could 
slow down the implementation of those programs. I regret that 
the federal government is asking Quebec for Canada-wide 
manpower programs. We have our own programs; all we need 
now is the money to implement them.
<P>
	You say my time is up, Madam Speaker, but I wanted to stress 
these two points.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to advise the House 
that pursuant to Standing Order 43, our speakers on this motion 
will be dividing their time in half.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to commend the Minister of Human 
Resources Development for his commitment to the process of 
change. I find his remarks both refreshing and encouraging. This 
commitment to the process of change that the government 
proposes generates genuine hope for the future.
<P>
	However, I wish to remind the government of the hope we had 
in 1985 when a new government launched a royal commission 
on unemployment insurance. Then in 1986 those hopes were 
dashed when the Forget commission issued its final report and 
dozens of good ideas were disregarded because of opposition 
attacks on a few ideas that needed a bit more work and more 
input from common sense Canadians. Adversarial politics 
reached its zenith in the 1980s. Canadians expect that 
Parliament in the nineties will be both different and better. 
Canadians expect that the good ideas brought forward in 
Parliament should be implemented regardless of which member 
or which party initiates them.
<P>
<B></B>

<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	In my reply to the speech from the throne last week I talked 
about how our safety nets are catching more people than the fish 
nets in Newfoundland have been catching cod in the past few 
years. While many people have been saved by our safety nets, 
there is a growing number who are caught and trapped in them.
<P>
	<I>W5</I> reported last Thursday night that one in every four people 
in Toronto is dependent on transfer payments from the 
government. Even in my home province of Saskatchewan where 
our unemployment rate is always low because many people 
move out of province when they become unemployed, the 
statistics are still alarming. Spending on social programs has 
increased seven times between 1972 and 1992, and as of 
September 1993 there were almost 40,000 welfare recipients in 
Saskatchewan, a 13 per cent increase in the last year.
<P>
	The tragedy here is that 49 per cent of welfare recipients were 
considered fully employable.
<P>
	Our challenge is to give Canadians new hope for the future. 
Can we give them new hope by going deeper into debt? I think 
not. For years the cry from special interest groups has been to 
spend more and more money, and it has not helped. The problem 
is quickly going from bad to worse.
<P>
	The Newfoundland Economic Recovery Commission recently 
published a report called ``A Proposal for a New Income 
Supplementation Program and Other Reforms to the Income 
Security System''. Page 2 of this report outlines some of the 
weaknesses in our current income security system. First, the 
system discourages self-employment and small scale 
enterprise. Second, the system undermines personal and 
community initiatives. Third, the system undermines the 
importance of education. Fourth, the system distorts the efforts 
of local development groups. Fifth, the system creates 
disincentives to work. Sixth, the system impedes productivity 
for employers.
<P>
	Page 6 of the same report states: ``On the whole the current 
system has induced an unconscionable degree of dependency 
which is unfair to contributors to the unemployment insurance 
fund and in light of recent fiscal restraints is not sustainable''.
<P>
	In order to address this crisis, Newfoundland has proposed to 
replace both unemployment insurance and social assistance 
with an income supplementation plan that would direct over 85 
per cent of the money currently spent on these programs to the 
people in Newfoundland who need them most. I agree with the 
thrust of the Newfoundland proposal, which would basically 
eliminate the duplication of federal and provincial programs 
that have ended up serving much the same purpose and many of 
the same clients.
<P>
	Last week my hon. friend from Medicine Hat outlined some 
key principles that should govern this process of modernization 
and restructuring of the unemployment insurance program. 
First, he stated that all stakeholders  must have a real voice in the 
process. Second, decisions must be made in the long term best 
interests of the country. Third, decisions should take into 
account the current economic, social, cultural and political 
environment. Fourth, the programs must have clear, measurable 
objectives. Fifth, all programs must be user friendly.
<P>
	Some of the people in my constituency say our UI program is 
not user friendly but maybe it is a little too friendly to the users.
<P>
	Sixth, all government programs should treat all Canadians the 
same, regardless of where they live. Finally, he said all 
government programs should promote and encourage personal 
responsibility and initiative.
<P>
	Some principles of my own that I would like to add to my hon. 
friend's list are as follows:
<P>
	(a) Our social programs must be financially sustainable in the 
long term.
<P>
	(b) Our social programs must make people less dependent on 
government. There should be incentives built right into the 
system that would wean people off the system and not make 
them more dependent on it.
<P>
	(c) Our social programs should be designed so that there are 
incentives for the public service when the program objectives 
are achieved. For example, public servants should be rewarded 
for reducing spending. They should be rewarded for lowering 
taxes, rewarded for increasing the number of new business starts 
and expansions, and ultimately rewarded for lowering 
unemployment.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	(d) Our social programs should be designed to eliminate all 
duplication among the federal, provincial and municipal 
governments.
<P>
	(e) Our social programs should learn from the lessons of the 
past and be designed to eliminate the abuse to the system and the 
outright fraud that hurts every Canadian taxpayer and robs them.
<P>
	(f) Our social programs should be targeted to those who most 
need them.
<P>
	(g) The need for social programs should be based on family or 
household income and be administered through the income tax 
system. I believe we should have one income security program 
that would replace all others.
<P>
	(h) Our final proposal for reform of our social programs 
should pass regional fairness tests.
<P>
	(i) Whatever the final package of social reforms looks like, 
the majority of Canadians should be in favour of it.
<P>
	How we manage this process of change will go a long way to 
determine how successful the end result will be. The process has 
to be truly open to new ideas, even radical new ideas. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="815"> 815 </A></B>
<P>
process should be open to new ideas from all Canadians, not just 
the so-called elite.
<P>
	The best design for our social programs will come from an 
open bottom up process. It is time to start putting our trust in the 
common sense of common people. As we embark on this process 
of change, we could learn something from the private sector.
<P>
	Every year the Fraser Institute holds an 
economy-in-government competition. This competition is open 
to all Canadians. Canadians are asked to submit ideas to the 
Fraser Institute on how to save government money without 
reducing services. A panel of experts reviews the submissions 
and selects the finalists, and the finalists submit complete 
proposals. The panel reviews the proposals and selects the 
winners, who win substantial cash prizes.
<P>
	The whole process works much like a suggestion award 
program. The Fraser Institute publishes the winning proposals 
and sends them to the federal and provincial governments. I 
recommend that the government seriously consider this kind of 
approach to kick off this process of reform.
<P>
	This suggestion award approach would be exciting. It would 
permit all Canadians to get directly involved in the 
modernization and restructuring of our social programs and it 
would reward those Canadians who come up with the good ideas 
that government implements.
<P>
	If the government is interested in the grassroots approach, the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development could 
design and administer the suggestion award program.
<P>
	In conclusion, fishermen in Saskatchewan have designated 
many lakes as catch-and-release lakes. This means one can 
catch as many fish as one wants but one releases them so they 
can continue to grow and propagate, providing more fun and 
relaxation for sport fishermen and, I might add, generating more 
revenue for the government. Maybe we should start a 
catch-and-release program for those unfortunate people who 
have got caught in our social safety nets so they can be retrained, 
find work and, I might add again, generate more revenue for the 
government.
<P>
	I look forward to participating in this exciting process of 
change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in my time I would like to address the remarks made by 
the member.
<P>
	I have to say that on a number of issues I would agree in terms 
of where the speaker would have us go. He mentioned things 
such as a consultative process that would buy Canadians into the 
new programs the government will get to. He mentioned the 
need for a consolidated income program, which I would also 
support.
<P>
	The difference, however, is what would motivate the direction 
that is proposed. I made note of the fact that he mentioned that 
the UI program is unfair to contributors-or there was a 
reference to that-or that sometimes UI is too user friendly. As a 
contributor to unemployment insurance, I would rather be me 
than most people in Canada who have to draw on that benefit.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	If there is an unfairness out there, if there is someone who 
needs relief and needs the government to take their side, I really 
believe it is the people on the other side of the spectrum who 
need my contributions, because I really believe they are a lot 
worse off than I am.
<P>
	Having said that, I look forward to the debate. I think it is 
important that Canadians buy into the programs they are called 
upon to finance and support. It is important for the people who 
receive benefits from these programs to know that Canadians 
support these programs as well. I welcome the opportunity to 
debate this. I suspect it is going to be an interesting debate.
<P>
	In large part the kinds of change promoted by the previous 
speaker and the kinds of change promoted by the government 
side are similar. Maybe it is just the motivation that is a little 
different in terms of who it is we are trying to help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate very much the comments that have just been made. I 
also appreciate the atmosphere that exists in this House at the 
present time. It is non-confrontational and we are working 
together. We do not have all the solutions, but I think we can 
work together toward some of them.
<P>
	One thing mentioned was the unemployment insurance. If we 
had taken some of the recommendations of the Forget 
commission and implemented them, if we had put UI on an 
actuarially sound basis where the premiums paid for it and 
employers and employees were responsible for administering it, 
we would not have the deficit or the debt that we have at the 
present time. It is good to implement some of these 
recommendations and not just throw out the baby with the bath 
water.
<P>
	I look forward to working together on this. I do not know if 
there was a question asked, but those would be my comments. 
We should try to get some of these plans on a more financially 
sound basis. We cannot continue to go into debt at the rate we are 
now. It is going to threaten all of our social programs. The 
interest payments, over $40 billion, are horrendous, and that is 
going to bring this country to its knees. We have to do something 
right now to preserve our social programs by being careful about 
how we spend our money.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> It is a privilege 
and a great honour to stand and address the House. Again I 
would like to thank the citizens of Surrey North for providing 
me with this opportunity.
<P>
	Also, Mr. Speaker, I offer my congratulations to you on your 
successful appointment to the position of Deputy Speaker in the 
House of Commons. It is a challenging role at the best of times 
but even more so now, with over 200 brand-new members of 
Parliament here. I am confident that we will receive the 
guidance and direction needed to participate successfully in the 
ways of the House. I wish you every success in that role.
<P>
	Today I will address health care. Specifically I will direct my 
remarks to the national forum on health and to women regarding 
health. My remarks on both topics will be brief and general in 
nature in order to comment on both today.
<P>
	First I would like to congratulate the hon. member on her 
appointment to the position of Minister of Health. I wish her 
success in her new and challenging role.
<P>
	Since health care is a major interest of mine, I shall be 
following closely the activities of the government in this field. I 
can assure the minister I will assist her to meet the health care 
challenges ahead by providing constructive criticism and 
alternate options whenever it seems necessary.
<P>
	I commend the government on its decision to recognize health 
care as a high-priority social program. I think very few, if 
anyone, could find fault with that decision. Its agreement to 
continue to support and fund this program is encouraging news, 
and its objective to seek more efficient ways to spend our tax 
dollars in this field is even better news.
<P>
	The question before us is the nature and effects of these more 
efficient ways. The establishment of a forum on health as a 
vehicle to gather data from as many sources as possible, to 
identify these more efficient ways, has been mentioned by the 
government in its red book, in the speech from the throne and in 
the minister's speech here last Friday, to name but a few 
occasions.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	I think we can safely say that this will come to pass in the near 
future. It seems a main objective of this forum is not to change 
from the five main principles of our health care system, but to 
identify alternate methods or to streamline the existing ones so 
as to allow us to continue with and even enhance our health care 
programs while maintaining these five main principles.
<P>
	In her speech the Minister of Health offered some suggestions 
as to how this may be achieved, and many of her suggestions are 
echoed by other groups such as the Canadian Nurses 
Association. In a brief prepared by this association entitled 
Nurses Make a Difference, reference is made to such things as 
better use of health resources, greater public involvement, more 
equitable access and so forth.
<P>
	I understand there is a project presently under way at the 
University of Ottawa that is being funded by both federal and 
provincial funding sources as well as from some professional 
associations and private enterprise sources. This group is 
examining specifically cost effectiveness in our health care 
system and is also offering suggestions or recommendations, 
some of which are very similar to those made in the speech by 
the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Opinions and options about health care have been expressed 
by health care professionals, other professional groups, the 
general public and our colleagues in this and other Houses 
across the nation. Potential solutions range from managing our 
resources better, changing the structure of transfer payments, 
increasing the provincial jurisdiction over health, and 
increasing public awareness, to name a few.
<P>
	I welcome the decision to establish a national forum on health 
care so that these and other possible options can be identified 
and debated to produce a solution to our economic difficulties in 
maintaining a high standard of health care for all Canadians.
<P>
	I return to the Canadian Nurses Association brief once more. 
It also mentions the need for national health goals, and that 
nurses and nursing associations across our country support this. 
It seems that in September 1991 an agreement was obtained 
from the federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health to 
establish a process to develop national health goals. To date 
little action, if any at all, has been taken to this end. I 
recommend to the Minister of Health that the development of 
national health goals become another objective for the national 
forum on health.
<P>
	I shall now turn to my second topic. Reference has been made 
to women as having special conditions or requiring special 
attention in the health care field. The Minister of Health said: 
``Women do have special conditions, from osteoporosis to 
menopause, and they merit equal attention from research to 
treatment, to care and prevention.'' One could say the same 
thing about men, by changing two words, women to men, and 
menopause to prostate.
<P>
	I caution our use of the word special in this context. Special 
tends to imply a situation or circumstance that differs from the 
norm or status quo. The normal composition of the human race 
is female and male or women and men. The biological nature of 
the body structure and, to some extent, the physiological aspects 
are the reasons for the two categories or components.
<P>
	I advocate that neither one of these components, the male or 
the female, should be seen as special unto itself, but both should 
be seen as equal parts of the whole of the human race, and that 
our health care system should be addressing the needs of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="817"> 817 </A></B>
<P>
human race as a whole by meeting the needs of both components 
and not singling out one over the other.
<P>
	Today we recognize this as a weak area in our health care 
programs, a weakness in the sense that our main focus has been 
and still is more on one component than the other. I believe that 
applying the word special to this weak area in our system, in this 
case the programs for women, will lead to approximately half 
the Canadian population being seen as a special needs group, a 
special interest group or possibly even a minority group. Such a 
concept will be detrimental in successfully achieving equal 
status for and equal attention to the needs of both sexes, genders 
or components, and thus the entire human race. I repeat that we 
should use caution when using the word special so as not to 
single out one component or sex over the other.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	My time for speaking is slipping away rather quickly it seems. 
In closing I would remind the government that the promotion of 
health and the prevention of disease must continue to be the 
major focus in our deliberations on our health care programs.
<P>
	I also advise the government to employ a wellness approach 
versus an illness approach as we seek solutions to manage our 
health care resources more efficiently and effectively. In this 
time of fiscal restraint we face many challenges in our nation 
and an efficient health care program is but one, and a very 
important one, for the well-being of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe this is 
the first speech of the hon. member and I would like to express 
my congratulations to her on her comments.
<P>
	I listened to her speech very carefully. I want to ask her about 
what seems to me to be a lack of a recognition that much of the 
health research over the last decades in this country, and maybe 
the industrialized world, has been focused on men.
<P>
	For example, I believe there is much more information on 
heart disease in the male than there is in the female. I do not 
think in our program we are talking about distinguishing 
between men and women in terms of the care they need when 
something is wrong when they are sick. I think we are focusing 
on the fact that there is not enough data and not enough history 
available on the special health needs of women.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would explain in more detail 
what she meant and whether she is prepared to recognize that 
there is very much lacking in our database and in our research 
with regard to the health needs of women.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his comments on my first speech. I would also like 
to say that possibly we are saying the same thing but using 
different words.
<P>
	I agree with him that today and in the past the emphasis has 
been on men in health care. I personally can recall that the 
average height of a human being when I was studying was that of 
the average man and at that time he was considered to be 5 feet, 7 
inches tall.
<P>
	What I am saying is that the component of women and 
women's needs have not been addressed. It should be seen as a 
weakness in our overall assessment or how we are approaching 
health care. Instead of looking at this as being a special area it 
should be looked at as being part of the whole. At the present 
time we are much better with our approach toward the male body 
than we are to the female body.
<P>
	My fear is that we may go through the next 100 years by 
putting women's health before men's. Let us get matters even 
and look at it as a whole. There are two sexes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to commend the hon. member for 
Surrey North on her first speech. I will be very brief.
<P>
	She mentioned consultation in regard to the national health 
forum. I would like to bring something to her attention and get 
her reaction. In my constituency of 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury we are holding a forum of our 
own on February 27 that will involve probably 100 residents of 
the riding. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Health and the minister of health in the province of New 
Brunswick have agreed to be there. In that way we intend to 
promote participation in this debate of all the people that can 
make it. It will be a televised discussion in the riding. My guess 
is that we will have between 100 and 200 people there. We are 
going to prepare for it with a lot of background information. 
Many of the stakeholders are participating, but also health care 
consumers and many people with alternative ideas on how 
health should be dealt with. I would welcome the member's 
comments on that.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Just before I sit down, the member mentioned her support for 
the five principles of the Canada Health Act. I welcome her 
support for our position against user fees being used in the 
provinces. I would also like her to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I will comment on the 
health forum. It is not a new role that we are looking at in 
relation to gathering data on health problems or situations. In 
my address I said that there were already a great number of 
people out there who have seen the deficiency in the economic 
situation, have already been conducting studies on it and have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="818"> 818 </A></B>
<P>
been offering recommendations either at a federal or provincial 
level. I have named two such groups.
<P>
	Instead of reinventing the wheel over the next few months, we 
must make sure that these groups are part of the national health 
forum and that many other new ideas are brought forth from 
other groups or forums such as the ones the member is talking 
about. Maybe this is something that we should all be looking at 
to get the data. However there are people out there already who 
have some tremendous ideas that certainly should be in front of 
the forum.
<P>
	As far as the five basic principles of the health care program 
are concerned, I do not think anybody is arguing them. They are 
the basis for Canadians having one of the best health care 
programs in the world. User fees come into it as they are a 
component of one or more of those five principles. That aspect 
goes more to the management of achieving those five 
components and providing the service than being one of the five 
components.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I noted the 
member for Surrey North indicated in her comments that the 
average height of a man was five feet, seven inches. I would be 
interested in what the average weight is at some point.
<P>
	I have been sitting here trying to sort out exactly what it is that 
I want to say in only 10 minutes. This is an immense topic. I 
have spent most of my working life in what we are defining as 
the social services.
<P>
	As a teenager I worked in the core area of my city in 
settlement houses. I have worked with handicapped people, the 
disabled and emotionally disturbed kids. I ended that portion of 
my career as the director of child welfare in my province. I have 
wrestled with some of these issues for some time.
<P>
	It is interesting in a sense when I reflect on how I became 
involved in politics. It was in the mid-1970s. I received a call 
from a friend of mine who worked in an agency that was similar 
to the one I was directing at that point. He said that a politician 
wanted to speak to us, that he wanted to meet with a few people 
to talk about social policy.
<P>
	I was a little unsure just what that meant because my view of 
politicians was like that of most people who are somewhat 
removed from the system, but I went. I was maybe a little in awe 
that somebody who we see on TV and who sits in a legislative 
chamber would want to talk to me. That night I met the hon. 
member for Winnipeg South Centre. We spent an entire evening 
just sitting on the couch with a few people talking about what 
was happening in social programs in the city of Winnipeg in 
1975.
<P>
	As we talked we sort of wrestled with what are the things that 
are helping people, what are the things that are supporting 
people, what are the things that are showing signs of success and 
what are the things that need change. Therefore when I see Lloyd 
stand in the House-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> You must refer to the member or the 
minister but not to the member by name. That is a strictly 
enforced rule in this place.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr Alcock:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker; I cannot even argue the 
rule at this point. When I see the minister stand in the House I 
see him making the same offer. He is not standing to put on 
record a whole bunch of Liberal Party rhetoric. He is making a 
very genuine request: ``I ask members of the House and all 
Canadians to work with my government to develop an action 
plan''.
<P>
	Obviously this is an area that interests me, so I read very 
carefully what the Leader of the Official Opposition and the lead 
speaker of the Reform Party had to say. I must say I was a little 
disappointed in what I heard coming from the Official 
Opposition. When I meet with members of the Official 
Opposition, when I talk to members of the Official Opposition, I 
hear them saying some fairly progressive things about social 
policy. I think they have a fundamental understanding of the 
issue. However when I heard their leader speak he said 
something I have become accustomed to hearing from the New 
Democratic Party in my province: ``Don't touch anything. Don't 
change anything. You dasn't muss a hair of this program''. That 
is unfortunate because I think there is a great deal of wisdom to 
be shared with the House as we search for a solution to make the 
lives of Canadians better.
<P>
	Frankly I do not know how to respond to the intervention by 
the Reform Party. I read it several times and made some notes on 
it because I was trying to figure it out. It seemed to say we have 
to cut everything today so we will have it tomorrow. There is a 
curiousness in the logic there that escapes me somewhat.
<P>
	These are serious problems. They affect the lives of real 
people living in our communities. We have right now a 
tremendous opportunity. In the mid-1960s in Canada and the 
United States, at a time when government had huge revenues, we 
created the social safety net or the core of it. Some pieces were 
already in place. Canada has been a progressive country for a 
long time. We created a network of services that was the result of 
our best thinking at that time. We have had experience with it. 
We have learned over time that some of the things we did were 
good and that some were not so good.
<P>
	We learned, for example, that a lot of the services that we 
provide tend not to empower people. They tend to remove their 
ability to function independently. We confronted that in the 
provision of services in a great many communities.
<P>
	We have a fiscal crisis right now. If we want to look at the 
glass half full side of the fiscal crisis, maybe it is a good thing 
the crisis is forcing this debate. Maybe we will finally challenge 
some of our assumptions about how we provide help to people. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="819"> 819 </A></B>
<P>
However let us do it from the perspective of providing some 
assistance.
<P>
	I want to make a few quick suggestions to frame out some of 
the structural issues that I think confront us. Technology offers a 
tremendous opportunity right now. We now have the 
technological capacity to begin to understand what is happening 
out there and to look at the ways in which our services collide. 
Over the years we have built up a patchwork of services.
<P>
	The classic case in the business of child welfare that I know 
best is when one calls for a consultation on a particular 
individual and 15 agencies show up. Obviously there is an 
abuse, a misuse or an inefficiency in the way in which we use the 
resources we have. Technology gives us some opportunities to 
identify that, to iron that out and to understand not the reality 
presented in the newspapers every day. If we read the 
newspapers every day we see terrible problems. In fact when we 
begin to look beneath the headlines at how people are doing we 
forget that the murder rate is going down, that people are getting 
healthier and that people are living longer. In fact we forget that 
we have succeeded enormously in the programs we have 
delivered.
<P>
	We forget it was only a few decades ago when to be old meant 
to be poor, to be old meant to be living in substandard housing. 
Today they cannot rent out all the bachelor apartments in 
housing for the elderly. The elderly have now achieved, because 
of the programs we have created, a certain level of wealth that 
has allowed them to live independently. That is a good thing, not 
a bad thing. That is a thing to be proud of as a Canadian, not to be 
afraid of.
<P>
	The Official Opposition presented some interesting issues 
about interjurisdictional areas.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The minister whom I cannot mention by name has made 
comment in the past that when he was a minister in a previous 
government between 1980 and 1984, he often spent more of his 
time debating interjurisdictional issues than he did debating 
problematic issues.
<P>
	Maybe it is possible to look at the fact, for example, that the 
federal government delivers support to people directly. It does 
right now through unemployment insurance. We forget that we 
give support in many different ways through student aid, 
pensions and half the income security costs. Maybe we should 
look at providing a basic level of support, maybe a guaranteed 
annual income or a basic level of living support to people who 
require it. That may be a good idea. Maybe we should allow the 
provinces to look at the services that get added on to that to 
reflect local needs. It would be a very radical change. Maybe it 
is time we begin to think about it.
<P>
	The last couple of Reform speakers mentioned the income tax 
system. That is an idea that is worth exploring. It is interesting 
there has long been a concept called negative income tax. It says 
that we make our tax system very progressive: when we earn 
money we contribute to the community, we contribute more as 
we earn more and when we do not have the capacity to earn for 
whatever reason we receive basic support. That support 
increases as we move further and further into difficulty. A 
proposal like that was put forward in the 1970s by Richard 
Nixon. It was very progressive. I see the member sort of 
struggling with it, but I think there are some aspects to it worth 
exploring.
<P>
	I would genuinely like to see us sitting here struggling with 
how to make the lives of Canadians better, how to help them. 
The speaker before the last one said that we needed radical new 
ideas. I would like to hear a radical new idea from the Reform 
Party on how we help a million children living in poverty. I 
would like to hear an idea like that.
<P>
	On the one hand we talk about a new form of debate, but on the 
other hand we have the same old kind of politics of just sitting 
and picking little holes in things. Let us get some radical ideas 
on the table. Let us make this a better country for the people.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of the member for Winnipeg South. I 
would like to make a few comments on his speech. Obviously 
there are political disagreements in terms of philosophies in the 
House, but I want to ask the member a couple of questions about 
some of the things he said in his 10-minute usage of time.
<P>
	He attributed to my leader words to the effect of ``cut it now so 
you will save it later''. We in the House need to budget our own 
personal finances in such a way that they do not come after us. 
We need to live within our means. Do we then just spend it all 
now? What happens later?
<P>
	Let me use the analogy of credit cards. Is the member then 
saying that he would be happy or he thinks it is advisable for 
those of us in the country who are responsible for social policy 
to use our American Express card to pay off our Visa?
<P>
	Somehow this vicious cycle needs to end. Having worked in 
the child welfare system he realizes how important it is to look 
after the lives of children. What if his government that is 
responsible for the funding came to him in the province of 
Manitoba and said: ``The gig is up; there is no more cash?'' How 
is he going to protect the lives of the children? Should we not 
specifically target spending to make sure that the people who 
absolutely need it will get that funding? How will American 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="820"> 820 </A></B>
<P>
Express paying off his Visa bill make sure that we do look after 
one million poor children in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I look forward to an opportunity to 
debate this question at great length with the member for Beaver 
River and other members of her party in the House.
<P>
	The problem is twofold. Frankly I hear very simplistic things 
coming out of the Reform Party. I hear this constant noise about 
this being like a business; that if we are going to run it like a 
business and we have no money, we should cut off things, fire 
employees or lay people off, downsize. That is a fallacious 
understanding of how the economy works.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	In a business you do not set the interest rate. You do not set the 
exchange rate. You do not set the regulatory environment. You 
do not have a myriad of levers to pull or buttons to push in order 
to affect the lives of people. That kind of analogy is just a non 
starter for me.
<P>
	The second thing is that it is a little like trying to change 
wheels on a moving car. You cannot abandon everybody who sits 
out there, everybody who receives support and help right now 
while you try to move to this brave new world. You have to move 
through some kind of transition.
<P>
	There are tremendous opportunities to create efficiencies in 
the current system. The problem the member references in terms 
of the size of the economy and the size of the debt is a very 
serious one. Everybody in this House acknowledges that and it is 
one that must be confronted. I believe there are ways to find 
significant resources in the social policy envelope without 
harming a single individual.
<P>
	If we step aside from some of the antiquated ways in which we 
have delivered services and move into the 1990s or if we even 
moved into the 1980s it would be an improvement. We could 
find some resources. There are other ways to find resources and 
they are in the management of this economy. They are in putting 
people back to work. They are in helping to revitalize the 
business community. Simply stepping back from the 
responsibility as a government is not good enough. It does not 
work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member asked if there were anyone over here who could 
give him a radical new idea to support the millions of children 
who are living in poverty. This is a serious question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> I am listening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> What can we do to insure that the people 
who have children, particularly the fathers, support those 
children?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I mentioned in my remarks 
empowerment and how we have tended through our programs to 
take power away from people. One way to empower people is to 
hold them responsible for things. In my province we brought in a 
very aggressive policy of  enforcing child support payments. 
That is a policy that could be looked at nationally.
<P>
	I do not think you let people off the hook and buy them a free 
lunch or any of that kind of stuff. You have to treat them like 
powerful individuals, provide them with some supports and let 
them get on with the management of their own lives. You have to 
be there for them at times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address the motion on the modernization and 
restructuring of our social security system which costs Canada 
at all levels of government $130 billion a year.
<P>
	We in this House are keenly aware of the dual mandate we 
have been given by the Canadian people. On one hand we are 
told to live within our means and cut the cost of government so 
as to reduce and ultimately eliminate our national fiscal deficit.
<P>
	On the other hand we all know well that we must continue to 
provide the kinds of opportunities and services Canadians 
expect from their government to reduce or prevent the human 
deficit. I believe we can follow through on both orders. The two 
are interdependent.
<P>
	What are the objectives of the review? We would like to find 
out what really works, to eliminate disincentives to work and 
training, to head off the alienation of youth and perhaps 
transform unemployment insurance as an instrument of 
re-education. We must synchronize our social security system, 
definitely not to reduce the spending per se but put more people 
back to work. The objective of the process is to allow a 
partnership among all of us in the review of the system and to 
seek the agreement of the provinces and thereby achieve a truly 
participatory process.
<P>
	Why the need for this review? The realities are there. We have 
seen the increasing numbers of users of the system, the difficult 
transition to work, the duplication of government programs that 
we feel are no longer responsive to the needs of the day. We have 
noticed that there have been too many disincentives to work and 
so we would like to modernize the system.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	The ultimate objective at the end of the review is to have a 
modern social security system that sustains the ethic of work 
through its incentives and at the same time guarantees the 
security of citizens in their hour of most need.
<P>
	I said earlier that the twin challenges of reducing the fiscal 
deficit and reducing the human deficit are interdependent. We 
cannot cut the fiscal deficit in isolation without due regard for 
the anguish of the unemployed, for the pain of the poor and their 
children, for the fear of the student facing escalating tuition 
fees, for the anxiety of seniors about their pensions. We should 
not betray the seniors who trusted their  governments during 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="821"> 821 </A></B>
<P>
their working years. Nor can we disregard the decay of our cities 
and municipalities which help secure our streets and our homes.
<P>
	Cutting the fiscal deficit without taking heed of the human 
dimensions of cost cutting would be utter insensitivity and 
would constitute inept governance. At the same time, spending 
on economic and social programs for our citizens without 
attention to their efficiency and effectiveness, even in times of 
plenty, is poor stewardship and particularly in times of fiscal 
restraint would also constitute inept governance.
<P>
	Our social assistance programs which include old age 
pensions, aid to education such as student loans, the Canada 
Assistance Plan, unemployment insurance, training grants and 
medicare ensure that there exists a form of social justice in 
Canada. Very often there is unfairness.
<P>
	It is not fair when you have skills, education and 
qualifications and are denied employment opportunity due to a 
lack of available jobs or to discrimination, be it traditional or 
reverse, or to the inability to have one's credentials recognized 
in another province.
<P>
	It is also unfair when immigrants and new citizens find no 
orderly process for accreditation of their foreign obtained 
credentials. It is unfair when you are unable to work because of 
an illness, injury or physical disability and are not provided with 
a means of overcoming it. It is unfair when after 65 years of 
paying into a pension plan your monthly cheques do not reflect 
the many years of hard work to earn your retirement.
<P>
	The social justice contract under which this nation operates 
dictates that Canadians share their privileges and benefits so 
that no one is left stranded in times of great need.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance is similarly designed for periods of 
crisis, to ensure that basic necessities continue to be provided 
for those who lose their pay cheques.
<P>
	The idea is to see to it that misfortune, in and of itself, does 
not result in a loss of personal dignity. Social programs are not a 
haven for dependency. They exist to serve our fellow Canadians 
in their acute and genuine continuing needs.
<P>
	This is the commitment of people and therefore of 
government, which makes such privileges possible. It is to 
people and to government that we must turn to fix our distressed 
social security system.
<P>
	The numerous privileges our social security system offers are 
accompanied by a number of equally important obligations. It is 
incumbent on all members of society to use the system only 
when needed. Abuse of the security net ultimately results in the 
funding hardship we now face.
<P>
	We must remind those who are inclined to abuse the system 
through a public information program that the people footing 
the bills for their actions are their neighbours, their families, 
their parents and their friends. We must appeal to Canadians' 
innate sense of good citizenry.
<P>
	It is crucial that people come to view social assistance as a 
treatment for the symptoms that ail them, and not as a definitive 
cure. Permanent relief can only come about after we have 
attacked the root causes of financial difficulties.
<P>
	How can this be accomplished? A Canada-made 
modernization of our social security system should reflect our 
values, our priorities and our interests, thereby fostering pride 
in our citizens, who will then be loathe to abuse it.
<P>
	The system might include measures such as the income 
supplement program being considered today in Newfoundland 
and which has been piloted in New Brunswick.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	It could also include provisions for an income contingency 
repayment plan for student loans and other programs such as the 
guaranteed annual income supplement. Let me reiterate that the 
key to achieving a successful betterment of our current social 
security system lies in our willingness to seek the input of 
Canadians.
<P>
	As people on social assistance take on jobs not only will their 
self-esteem be restored but they would then begin to contribute 
to the growth of the economy as consumers and to government 
revenues through the taxes they would pay.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to convey a message to my 
constituents and to all Canadians that we on the government side 
can achieve the dual mandate issued to us by voters. We can 
eliminate our national fiscal deficit while at the same time 
ensuring opportunities and services for Canadians in their hour 
of need. Citizens and government can work as partners to defend 
and strengthen our shared social values of equity, fairness, 
co-operation and generosity.
<P>
	Then and only then can we help ensure the security and 
sensitivity of Canada's social programs for the present and for 
the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking 
as a woman who is aware of the problems of social development, 
I welcome this opportunity today to take part in this debate on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="822"> 822 </A></B>
<P>
social programs. In the riding I have the honour to represent in 
this House, like all regions in Quebec and Canada, we see daily 
so many examples of social problems that are unacceptable in a 
society that ranks among the wealthiest in the world.
<P>
	The lingering recession in Quebec and Canada has added to 
the ranks of the unemployed and welfare recipients whose 
numbers were already unacceptable, considering the standard of 
wealth in our communities. That the federal system has failed is 
reflected in Quebec's high unemployment rate, low job rate and 
unusually high percentage of Canada's poor. According to the 
latest figures from Statistics Canada, nearly one-third or 31.82 
per cent of low income families live in Quebec, although we 
represent only slightly more than 25 per cent of the population 
of Canada.
<P>
	In the course of this debate, the Official Opposition intends to 
condemn any attempts to cut social programs targeted to the 
neediest in our society, while the government tolerates unfair 
taxation, the underground economy, costly and 
counterproductive government spending, and programs where 
taxpayers' money is being wasted, as a result of duplication by 
provincial and federal governments. The government is 
mistaken if it thinks it can deal with its financial crisis by 
drastically cutting social programs that are essential to 
maintaining a minimum of human dignity among the neediest in 
our society.
<P>
	I would urge hon. members on both sides of this House to look 
at the many pockets of poverty that have emerged in their 
respective ridings during the latest recession, and realize that we 
must deal with the problem through effective programs instead 
of cutting into the basic essentials these people need. We believe 
that cutting social spending is the easy way out, to deal with 
budget problems caused by previous governments' failure to 
act. I would ask this government to use a little more imagination 
and provide some hope for the neediest in this country who are 
often the victims of government inefficiency.
<P>
	What must be addressed are the real dangers that threaten the 
economies of Quebec and Canada and which, especially in the 
case of Quebec, are holding back economy recovery. We can 
point the finger at unemployment, the monetary policy, unfair 
taxation, duplication of services, which is not only costly but 
also inefficient, lack of expenditure control, and the unbearably 
high deficit the federal government unloads on Quebec and the 
provinces. Those are the many evils which put 
counterproductive pressures on social expenditures, and prove, 
beyond any doubt, the failure of the Canadian federalist system 
whose unchanging characteristic is that it cannot be renewed, in 
spite of the many attempts to do so.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Fifty years after the publication of the first report outlining 
the premises for our social policy, things have not changed that 
much. Due to poor management in the past few years, the state 
of our social security system is giving rise to a growing concern.
<P>
	For social programs to be better integrated and more 
faithfully reflect national policy, we need uniform standards 
regarding efficiency, fairness, consistency and work incentives. 
These are the characteristics which should still be guiding us 
today. Unfortunately, such is not the case.
<P>
	In the last few years, the federal government has in fact cut 
and altered social programs. Moreover, it has reduced transfer 
payments to the provinces and Quebec for their social programs. 
And, as I mentioned earlier in this House, neither Quebec nor the 
provinces are asking for charity in this respect. All they are 
doing is demanding what is owed them under a duly signed 
agreement, let us not forget that.
<P>
	By raising the standards for unemployment insurance 
eligibility with Bill C-21, and later on, by imposing new 
conditions for entitlement with Bill C-113, the federal 
government gave notice that it had little respect for those who 
were the hardest hit by the recession.
<P>
	While doing the less affluent such injustice, at the same time 
it made Quebec and the provinces bear a heavier portion of 
income security expenditures. In spite of further tax increases, 
the federal contribution to provincial governments for health 
care and social programs has drastically declined, shaking the 
very foundations of the system.
<P>
	Between 1978 and 1993, the federal contribution for health 
care and post-secondary education dropped from 47 per cent to 
34 per cent. This means that less money is channelled back to the 
provinces for established program financing. However, the 
standards that have to be met in the management of these 
programs are not being adjusted.
<P>
	It is not surprising then to hear about user fees. By unloading 
its financial problems onto Quebec and the provinces, the 
federal government sees, as a result, the principles underlying 
the Canadian health policy being undermined.
<P>
	Quebec and the provinces are faced with increased health care 
costs. This increase in due primarily to the following factors: the 
aging of the population, new medical technologies that are more 
costly and a significant increase in spending for pharmaceutical 
products.
<P>
	Canadian and Quebec taxpayers give the federal government 
large amounts of money, some of which is earmarked for health 
care under the agreement of 1977. The problem is that, for the 
past 10 years, the federal government has not been giving back 
to Quebec and the provinces the portion that is rightfully theirs, 
thereby depriving them of the funds intended for health care. 
Instead, it transfers its deficit to Quebec and the provinces, all 
because of the inability of previous governments to control their 
spending. The federal government must be aware that, by 
increasing the tax burden for Quebec and the other provinces, it 
would create a two-tier health system, where the rich will be  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="823"> 823 </A></B>
<P>
able to afford health services while the underprivileged will tend 
to delay or forgo medical treatment.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	We believe in the basic principles of universality, integrality, 
accessibility, transferability and public management of the 
health system. What we are criticizing is the fact that these basic 
principles are being threatened, in every province including 
Quebec, by the inability of the federal government to honour its 
commitments.
<P>
	If you decrease or freeze the federal transfer payments, you 
jeopardize our health system, which is the one component of our 
social programs we most rely on. In Quebec, according to the 
established programs financing legislation, 45 per cent of health 
cost was to be picked by Ottawa. However, faced with the 
economic crisis of the early 1980s and the disastrous state of our 
public finances, the federal government decided to unilaterally 
opt out, so that by 1992-93 the federal transfer share of health 
expenditures had dropped by 33 per cent.
<P>
	This opting out process, often described by the Quebec 
government as unacceptable, unfair and incoherent, was not 
followed by a reduction in terms of federal intervention, since 
Ottawa is maintaining national standards and undertaking 
parallel programs, hence causing overlap problems. The end 
results, as I said earlier, are steady pressure for users' fees or 
other forms of billing, the delisting of some services, a service 
tax on drugs, drastic cuts in hospital budgets and outrageous 
waiting lists in many specialties.
<P>
	Thus, the very foundation of our health insurance plan, that is 
free, universal and accessible care, is in jeopardy. That brings 
me back to my starting point: it is always those most in need who 
are the worst affected.
<P>
	How can anyone speak about social programs without crying 
out against a level of poverty so high that 4.2 million people live 
in poverty in Canada, with Quebec being the main victim? There 
are 1.2 million children living in poverty and that hard core 
poverty is the fate of a large majority of single mothers and 
women raising a family alone. Let us turn now from the current 
costs of that unusual situation to assess the real issues 
underlying that crisis and its long-term impact.
<P>
	Beyond the figures and the statistics, there are real people out 
there who hurt, who are sick and who go hungry. Those people 
wish the government would act responsibly, quit squandering 
money and find lasting remedies. We readily admit that people 
in government need to travel, but how many families could we 
get out of the mess for good with what it costs for a single 
Challenger flight? Every little bit helps.
<P>
	Many studies demonstrate a clear relation between poverty 
and bad health. According to a study by Health Quebec on the 25 
most common health problems in Quebec, almost all of them 
were more acute among low income people than among 
wealthier people. Poor people consume more medicine than rich 
people and require more health care.
<P>
	A report made public by Campaign 2000 revealed a 30 per 
cent increase in the number of children living in poverty in 
Canada. In addition to being a bigger drain on the health care 
budget because they get sick more often, these children suffer 
more often from learning problems and are more prone to 
becoming school dropouts, twice as often as the children of the 
wealthy. Finally and most regrettably, they are more likely to 
become dependent upon social assistance than to participate in 
development.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	In order to better control the global state of health of the 
population in Quebec and in Canada, and hence to limit health 
care costs, we must first wage a merciless war against poverty. 
Therefore, those considerations have to be taken into account in 
the review of our social programs. Ignoring them would have the 
effect of worsening the spiraling deficit and the spiraling 
poverty. We have more than enough of one tragedy already.
<P>
	The only effective remedy against poverty is the creation of 
long-term jobs for people who will have first enjoyed adequate 
benefits. In this context, the direct duplication of similar federal 
programs and provincial initiatives is an absolute waste of 
public money and is also, in most cases, counterproductive. 
Quebec wants an end to this mess in the manpower and job 
training sector which costs its taxpayers $250 million every 
year.
<P>
	In this area, as in many others, the existing rivalry must be 
replaced by effectiveness and efficiency. Our debt as well as the 
chilling reality of the unemployment rate and the number of 
welfare recipients do not allow us to condone waste through 
sheer stubbornness. Administrative overlapping generates real 
costs, one of the most important of which is the inability to solve 
the problem of poverty, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	Poverty, especially in the case of young people, leads directly 
to welfare, drug and alcohol consumption, sometimes jail, and 
even despair and suicide. The fact is that the drop-out rate in 
schools is alarming. In some districts of the island of Montreal, 
close to half of the students quit school without any diploma 
and, as we all know, dropping out of school leads directly to 
poverty, since the job market massively rejects people without 
diplomas. According to Statistics Canada, 65 per cent of the new 
jobs between 1990 and 1993 were filled by university graduates. 
No speech made by governments on employment makes any 
sense if it is not supported by an energetic program to change
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="824"> 824 </A></B>
<P>
the objectives and the education system itself. Young Quebecers 
and Canadians must have access to a very high quality education 
to be  able to take advantage of the need for a highly-skilled 
manpower.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments cannot afford to 
waste time and energy in futile bickering over who has 
jurisdiction, at the expense of a coherent and structured 
financing for post-secondary education.
<P>
	We believe it is more urgent than ever that a House committee 
look into government spending in order to eliminate waste and 
duplication, and to reduce operating expenditures. This would 
enable us to allocate the budgets necessary to maintain social 
programs.
<P>
	We also believe it would be more appropriate to cut military 
spending rather than reduce the budget for health care. We also 
propose a courageous tax reform to eliminate tax evasion, 
unfairness, as well as tax shelters such as family trusts, which 
only benefit the wealthy. This type of reform, and not a charge 
led against the poor through cuts to social programs, would get 
our support.
<P>
	Those are useful solutions to help solve the budget crisis 
which we are concerned about. However, we will strongly 
oppose any violation of the commitment made by this 
government during the election campaign not to dismantle 
social and health programs.
<P>
	In conclusion, there is no doubt whatsoever that the health of 
Quebecers and Canadians is closely related to poverty.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	This House and the government have the moral obligation to 
put in place the necessary mechanisms to provide for the urgent 
needs of more than four million people, mostly women and 
children, for whom poverty has replaced hope.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Environment and Deputy Prime Minister): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I could have sworn that I was in the Quebec National 
Assembly listening to PQ members. The same fancy words, 
inconsistency, unfairness, inefficiency. Sure, and the hon. 
member who just spoke and her colleagues are the only ones 
who possess virtue. They are the only champions of the cause of 
the poor and the disadvantaged and, of course, any federal 
initiative by definition does not work.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that it was a federal 
Liberal government that instituted universal medicare in 
Canada as well as old age pensions, the Canada pension plan that 
the Quebec pension plan takes after, the UI program and 
guaranteed income maintenance programs for the less fortunate 
element of our society and our seniors. If you check in our red 
book, our electoral platform, every subject you have raised is in 
there: education for young people, apprenticeship programs to 
start doubling the number of graduates immediately, childcare 
programs, pre-natal nutrition programs for women, with a focus 
on the underprivileged, as well as a full range of social, 
education and training programs. This entire book deals  with 
just that. You say that this government has two months and a 
half-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I must remind the hon. member that 
members are to address only the Chair, never one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. The hon. member 
being a paragon of virtue stated that all the faults of government, 
our common government, at the federal and provincial level, 
would of course fall back on the provincial government. I sat for 
nine years in the Quebec National Assembly. Problems arise in 
areas of common jurisdiction. We all know that there is 
duplication and that adjustments are needed. Just this morning, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, responding to 
questions from the opposition, said that he was negotiating to 
avoid duplication in the area of manpower.
<P>
	The other day, the Minister of Finance met with his provincial 
counterparts and managed to come up with a tax equalization 
payment program guaranteed for the next five years which was 
approved unanimously by the provinces, including Quebec.
<P>
	Two and a half months later, the hon. member comes and 
criticizes us for having done nothing. But that is what this debate 
is all about, to hear constructive ideas, not only the destructive 
ones, to talk about previous governments from 1978 to 1988 that 
her leader was a member of. He too flew on a Challenger and had 
extravagant expenses when he was ambassador in Paris. Perhaps 
those amounts should been transferred to the less fortunate as 
well.
<P>
	The hon. member and her colleagues must also keep in mind 
that this debate is an opportunity for us to find together the 
remedies we will take to help the underprivileged. Criticizing, 
being destructive and saying that the federal government is at 
fault, while they, over there, are all virtuous, will not resolve 
anything. You solve problems by working together, in 
partnership, by making constructive suggestions.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Having listened to the hon. member for 20 minutes and heard 
nothing but a litany of criticism, I could have sworn this was the 
same speech I had heard back in the days when I was sitting 
across from the Péquists either as a government member or as a 
member of the opposition.
<P>
	Everything and anything that goes wrong in heaven or on 
earth is the fault of the federal government. That may not seem 
to change, but we will change. We will listen patiently and try to 
work constructively, in partnership-and I hope that the 
opposition does not expect us to act on our own-to solve the 
problems of the less fortunate members of our society. We will 
solve them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="825"> 825 </A></B>
<P>
together with constructive solutions, and that is what this debate 
is about.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> The policy that the hon. member has just 
alluded to is outmoded. The fact of the matter, as I mentioned 
clearly in my speech, is that Quebec and the provinces are facing 
a different situation. With respect to health care, I stated that 
health care costs had increased because of the situations I 
described earlier. The problem right now is that the government 
is not channelling back to the provinces the funds that are 
rightfully theirs.
<P>
	As a result, the provinces cannot balance their health care 
budgets. Take, for example, Sainte-Croix Hospital in my 
constituency. It is experiencing an acute crisis because it is 
underfunded. This facility serves a population of 80,000 and has 
a shortage of 100 acute care beds. Hospital equipment is 
outdated and there is shortage of specialists. The situation is 
growing more critical by the moment and it is always the less 
fortunate who suffer.
<P>
	That is what I wished to say to my hon. colleague.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the presentation of my hon. colleague, the member across 
the way, there were a couple of points that became very obvious, 
the first being the reference to programs currently not working 
in Quebec and also that federalism had failed.
<P>
	I would suggest that with the minister's tabling of his report 
and his release on Monday of this week that the exact opposite 
has occurred. There is no question as the old saying goes, at least 
in my riding, if it ain't broke don't fix it.
<P>
	My hon. colleague's statement that in Quebec it is not 
working quite obviously there appears to be a need to upgrade, 
to review, reform and make better the programs that we have for 
all Canadians and that is exactly what the minister stated.
<P>
	I would like to quote once again from the minister's own 
words. He said: ``I am asking the House, our colleagues in the 
Senate, our counterparts at the provincial and territorial level, 
members of business and labour sectors, the leaders of our 
communities and indeed every Canadian to throw out the old 
ideas, put aside vested interests'', which the hon. member 
referred to, ``and begin thinking of the kind of ground rules we 
need in Canada to restore fairness, hope and a sense of 
security''.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to refer to those in light of her 
suggestion that federalism has failed and the programs are not 
working in Quebec.
<P>
	I believe just the opposite with the minister's statement here 
in the House and she has an opportunity to relate, to provide the 
input that the minister is asking for.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
member of Parliament for St. Catharines, may I first 
congratulate my fellow colleagues for being part of the 35th 
Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	As this is my first speech in this House, I would particularly 
like to congratulate the hon. member for Welland-St. 
Catharines-Thorold on his election as Speaker of the House. I 
have had the personal privilege of knowing and working with the 
hon. member for many years and I know that he will continue in 
the tradition he has set as a parliamentarian in this Chamber.
<P>
	I have the honour and privilege to speak on behalf of the 
constituents in the riding of St. Catharines. The city of St. 
Catharines, better known as the Garden City, is located on the 
southwest shore of Lake Ontario in the heart of the Niagara 
Peninsula.
<P>
	The famous Welland ship canal runs through our community 
bypassing Niagara Falls and linking Lake Ontario and Lake 
Erie. The riding is surrounded by vineyards, tender fruit 
orchards and the picturesque view of the Niagara escarpment.
<P>
	St. Catharines is also home of the great educational and 
cultural organizations. Brock University has gained recognition 
not only in education but through its national basketball 
championship team. The folk arts festival held in May 
celebrates with 35 local ethnic organizations and is always one 
of the high points of the year.
<P>
	The city is also home to the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta 
and the famous Niagara Grape and Wine Festival. In all modesty 
I suggest that St. Catharines is a microcosm of Canada. We are 
proving daily that people can and do live in harmony.
<P>
	Over the years I have had the pleasure of serving my 
community as director and chairman of many organizations. My 
involvement in these organizations will I am sure assist me in 
serving my constituents more effectively.
<P>
	Unfortunately the difficult economic times experienced by 
Canadians in recent years has hit St. Catharines and the Niagara 
Peninsula particularly hard. Unemployment in St. Catharines 
has reached record levels. Automotive and small manufacturing 
businesses, the major employers in the area, have seen major 
restructuring and downsizing. The St. Catharines private 
shipyard has been forced to downsize its work base from 1,100 
to some 200 employees. ``Job loss grows in Niagara'' read a 
recent headline in the St. Catharines <I>Standard</I>. Statistics show 
that joblessness is not only more prevalent today but joblessness 
also lasts longer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="826"> 826 </A></B>
<P>
	Many of the social programs set up in the past decades no 
longer serve Canadians as they should. The result is a 
misalignment between what the government should be doing to 
assist Canadians and what the outdated programs are providing.
<P>
	We are here today in the House of Commons to discuss the 
motion of the Minister of Human Resources Development that a 
committee of this House consult with Canadians and make our 
recommendations on modernizing and restructuring our social 
security system.
<P>
	Our challenge is clear. We are committed to maintaining 
Canada's social programs but we are also faced with the 
economic reality of the national debt which absorbs almost 25 
cents of every government dollar.
<P>
	It is clear that a fundamental change in our social programs 
must occur if we are to effectively put people back to work and 
reduce the deficit. As a former executive from industry, I would 
like to focus my remarks on education and training and the 
importance of co-operation between business, industry, 
government and the educators in setting priorities for change.
<P>
	My background in industry has taught me the importance of 
education. Future economic health means investing in people. 
That is the key. The question is this. How do we train and retrain 
Canadians so that they are effective and active members of the 
work force?
<P>
	Do we need to spend more money? Canada presently spends 
more than $44 billion a year on schools, colleges and 
universities. We devote 6.2 per cent of the gross domestic 
product on education, ranking fifth among OECD countries and 
despite these high expenditures rising unemployment rates 
create a growing concern that our system is off target.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	It has been mentioned many times before that youth 
unemployment is of special concern. In June of last year while 
the national unemployment was some 11 per cent, 
unemployment for young people between the ages 15 and 24 was 
approximately 18 per cent. In 1993, 400,000 young people were 
looking for work each month.
<P>
	In theory the employment system assists in the retraining of 
the unemployed for greater long-term employment. In reality 
most funding goes directly to pay unemployment insurance 
benefits with a small portion remaining for training.
<P>
	The financial overview for 1993-94 shows that while 
unemployment benefits will be approximately $18 billion, 
spending on training and other active measures totals $3.6 
billion. We are spending. We need to spend more effectively and 
setting priorities for effective spending for future jobs cannot be 
accomplished blindly by governments. Educators, business and 
industry must be involved.
<P>
	In the mid-1980s Canadian business spent .25 per cent of 
gross domestic product on training and education. In Germany 
this figure was 1.96 per cent, in Great Britain 2.17 per cent, in 
Japan 1.4 per cent and in the U.S., .66 per cent.
<P>
	Business must realize, and some do, that the future is at stake. 
Poorly trained employees cost business money. Business must 
participate not only in the funding of programs but in the reform 
of the process being started by the government. More and more 
education will be key to competitiveness as higher levels of 
education are required within the work force overall.
<P>
	In 1986 just over 45 per cent of jobs required less than 12 
years of education. That figure is estimated to drop to just over 
32 per cent between now and the year 2000. Conversely, jobs 
requiring 17 or more years of education represented only 22.4 
per cent of jobs in 1986 but should rise to almost 50 per cent by 
the turn of the century.
<P>
	The government's election platform in the speech from the 
throne reaffirmed the commitment to investing in people. We 
will work with business, educators and Canadians to ensure that 
a final plan for modernizing our social programs is a workable 
solution. Specifically we must work with the provinces and the 
private sector to help youth be prepared for the transition from 
school to work.
<P>
	The youth service corps is a priority and the Secretary of State 
for Training and Youth has already completed a round of 
consultation on the corps. Apprenticeship or internship 
programs prepare youth for the work force. We are committed to 
bridging the gap between education and employment.
<P>
	Training and skills development must also extend into the 
present work force. Several minutes ago I spoke of the increased 
training levels required for jobs of the future. An enormous 
portion of the present work force will also require retraining and 
educational upgrading in the future.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development said in the 
House this past week: ``If we are to speak of reform of the social 
safety net we must include in that discussion the issues of 
training and education''. Unemployment insurance, social 
assistance and education are all interconnected. We must 
address all of these to create, in the minister's words ``a total 
fabric of opportunity''.
<P>
	Better trained employees create better systems. They reduce 
waste, they make business more competitive and in the end 
reach that objective of creating more jobs. The changes must be 
comprehensive. It must include Canadians; Canadian business, 
Canadian industry, Canadian educators and it must be done 
immediately. In the Niagara area, the Niagara Peninsula 
Industry Council is just beginning and is starting to make 
improvements in our area.

<P>
	Today we begin an action plan for reforming our social 
security system. I am pleased the minister has asked me and 
members of this House to participate in the working groups. We 
have a lot of work to do, but I join my colleagues in welcoming 
the challenges ahead. I encourage all Canadians to participate in 
this process.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to thank my constituents in St. 
Catharines, my family on whom I rely, my wife, Carol, 
daughters, Tamara and Virginia, and all of those in the riding 
who worked tirelessly to give me the opportunity to serve in this 
Chamber.
<P>
	The riding of St. Catharines has been represented by some 
very effective members from my party, namely Jim McNulty, 
Harry Cavers and the Hon. Gib Parent. It is a proud moment for 
me to join my predecessors in service to my city of St. 
Catharines. I look forward to representing St. Catharines in this 
great House.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to respond to the comments made by the 
hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis a few moments 
ago. I had the honour of serving with him in the National 
Assembly.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. You can only ask a question or comment 
on the speech of the hon. member for St. Catharines. Do you 
have a question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Very well, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	Then I will simply follow your instructions and comment on 
this debate and on the position taken by our party and by the 
government. Obviously, we would like our party and the Reform 
Party to reach a consensus on the big issue of the allocation of 
public funds.
<P>
	We know that Ottawa collects roughly $28 billion in taxes 
from Quebec each year and we would like to know how this 
money is redistributed. For the past several years-and the $500 
billion debt confirms this-we have been making suggestions. 
We are always accused of harping on the same old Péquist 
arguments. However, if the government accepted our 
suggestions, then we not go over the same ground again and 
again.
<P>
	We are calling for an end to duplication of services. This is 
nothing new. We are calling for an end to cuts in social housing. 
The situation is pitiful in my riding. There is a shortage of social 
housing and yet the government is poised to make further cuts in 
this area. A decade ago, the soup kitchen in my region served up 
about 35 meals a day. Today, it serves up 400 meals a day. This is 
completely unacceptable.
<P>
	We have made suggestions to the government as to what 
measures should be contained in its upcoming budget. We 
proposed the elimination of family trusts and we targeted such 
areas as duplication in the taxation and services fields. For the 
sake of greater efficiency, we are asking that the federal 
government withdraw from  manpower training programs and 
hand this responsibility over to Quebec.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me say that Mr. Le Hir, the president of the 
Association des manufacturiers du Québec, as well as Mr. 
Ghislain Dufour, the President of-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
was a report in this morning's edition of <I>Le Devoir</I>. The hon. 
member is upset by the truth. These people are not Péquists, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Why have you 
called for order, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have no objections to what the hon. member is 
saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> I am prepared to 
co-operate, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. member has a question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> I do have a 
question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Why is the government not willing to follow the 
recommendations put forward by the opposition party, the Bloc 
Quebecois? Why will it not eliminate trusts, end duplication of 
services and tax large corporations? Why?
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lastewka:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the questioner. I think all 
Canadians have come to the point where they have had enough 
of paying taxes. I agree that we need to take a look at the various 
systems and the waste in the systems. However, we cannot 
forget about the important item of trying to improve the system. 
We need information and consultation from all parties and from 
all Canadians.
<P>
	This a process the minister has started. I think it is important 
for us and for Canada that we continue to have debates and 
consult back and forth and that the people of Canada have an 
opportunity to provide input. Let us not forget that I am here 
representing St. Catharines and Canadians. Canadians feel it is 
important that we do something, that we eliminate the waste 
right across Canada.
<P>
	I agree with that. However I have to do it for the good of all 
Canadians, no matter what province they live in. I am proud of 
my province of Ontario, but I am also proud of Canada. It is 
important, as we consult and debate, that we get input from coast 
to coast and that we make a better system for Canada on a 
continuous basis.
<P>
	Let us not be afraid. For the next two or three years, let us 
make continued improvements for Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with this referral of the review of social policy to a standing 
committee, our government is about to embark on what I 
consider to be the most important undertaking during its first 
term.
<P>
	If we are to bring about social justice to this country, if we are 
to have any ability to bring our financial house in order, if we are 
to find new and innovative ways of conducting business in this 
country, then the reform of our social policy is absolutely 
essential.
<P>
	Our government is committing itself to a most extensive 
public review process. This issue will be debated not only in this 
House, both during the preliminary stages and later when 
legislation is actually tabled, but also through the parliamentary 
committee to which this review is being referred. In addition, we 
will be dealing with both the political and bureaucratic 
components of the provincial government and, through a series 
of consultative processes, with constituency groups, the general 
public, and in particular those individuals presently charged 
with delivering our various and sundry programs.
<P>
	In referring this matter to the standing committee, it is vital to 
outline what I believe to be important governing principles that 
should be considered in the deliberations. These principles 
include equity, effectiveness, co-ordination and accountability.
<P>
	Whatever system we develop must be equitable. To me this 
means we recognize that as Canadians, as a government and as a 
nation we have a responsibility to each other.
<P>
	Going back to at least World War II, there has existed in this 
country an unwritten but very clear social contract between 
Canadians and their government. This contract essentially says 
that on the one hand Canadians will tend to pay more for 
government than perhaps their counterparts in the U.S. and other 
nations, but on the other hand, in return for this we as Canadians 
and as a government have a responsibility to ensure that we will 
not allow individual Canadians to fall below a certain level. We 
have determined as a country that we will not allow people to die 
for lack of medical service, to go hungry for lack of food, to be 
exposed for lack of shelter.
<P>
	This contract is basic to what Canada and Canadians are. 
Whatever the result of our social policy review, it must maintain 
this basic concept of equity that our parents' generation 
formulated, that our generation has attempted to maintain, and 
that we must protect for our children and our children's children.
<P>
	The second governing principle that must be adhered to in our 
deliberations regarding social policy is effectiveness. Whether 
we are speaking about income support, job retraining or life 
skills development, we must ensure the program provides full 
value for each dollar that is spent. We need to set as an objective 
not a decrease in the number of dollars that are placed in the 
hands of individual Canadians but rather an objective  that sees a 
reduction in the number of programs, a reduction in the 
administration costs and a reduction in the duplication of 
services. We do not need more money, we need money better 
spent. We need to bring to an end the bureaucratic practice of 
territoriality, we need to bring to an end the turf wars that 
consume so much of our precious resources, and we need to 
design our programs so that they put the necessary financial and 
other resources in the hands of recipients in a manner that does 
not require a massive bureaucracy be maintained.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	The third principle that I believe should govern our 
deliberations is co-ordination; that is, co-ordination within our 
own government, co-ordination with other governments and 
co-ordination with the private sector. We must bring to an end 
the massive amount of duplication of services that presently 
exists in the area of social services.
<P>
	If individuals today wish to receive training, the largest 
challenge they will face will not be the actual course they might 
take, but rather finding the correct entry point into the system. 
They will find that they have to choose from several entry points 
and sometimes from dozens. Our system must be designed so 
that individuals have one entry point into the system and one 
exit point.
<P>
	Does it make any sense that our income support system is 
made up of numerous programs and that these programs are 
delivered by various levels of government and in some cases 
duplicate programs are delivered by duplicate levels of 
government? Income support should be provided by one system, 
administered by one bureaucracy and developed in as simple a 
manner as possible, one that reflects the economic realities of 
the 1990s and not of the 1950s or 1960s.
<P>
	I can see absolutely no sense as to why an individual who has 
lost his job receives his income support in one form from one 
level of government for a period of time and then receives his 
income support from a different level for another period of time, 
administered by a different bureaucracy. We need one income 
support program, administered by one level of government and 
delivered in a cost efficient way.
<P>
	The final governing principle that I believe should be adhered 
to in our deliberations is that of accountability, accountability 
both from government who administers the program and from 
the individuals who utilize the program. As a government we 
need to design our income support and training programs with 
clear objectives as to what they are attempting to accomplish. 
The effectiveness of these programs should be measured on an 
ongoing basis, both by this Parliament and by the people of 
Canada, as to whether they are achieving their objectives. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="829"> 829 </A></B>
<P>
should be prepared to change programs that do not work or 
amend programs that are in need of revision.
<P>
	But accountability is not just on behalf of the government 
which delivers the programs, but also on behalf of the 
individuals who utilize them. Individuals who receive income 
support must have as their objective, where possible, re-entry 
into the work force and the ability to become self-sufficient. 
Their objective should not be to maintain an alternative lifestyle 
that entails perpetual government assistance from cradle to 
grave.
<P>
	We do have individuals in this country, unfortunately, who 
will need our support not just in the short term but perhaps for 
the rest of their lives. But we also have individuals who, with 
properly designed programs and with the correct incentives, can 
become productive members of society, and we must ensure that 
our social policy review results in a system that will mandate 
this to happen.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me simply state the one governing principle 
that I believe distinguishes a Liberal approach to the issue of 
social policy reform as opposed to one that has been pursued by 
the past government and that I believe is being pursued by some 
of the members opposite.
<P>
	As Liberals, we start with the needs of individual Canadians, 
with the dignity of men and women, the importance of the 
human spirit and the sanctity of human values. From this will 
flow jobs, from this will flow renewed economic activity, from 
this will flow new personal and business prosperity.
<P>
	If we begin the process with our concern being solely one of 
economics, solely one of business profits, solely one of bottom 
line, and we ignore the basic component, which is the individual 
Canadian, then we will continue to take us down a road that we 
have travelled for the past decade, which will create more 
hardship, more unemployment, less economic development and 
a nation that will not be living up to its true potential. It is the 
first option that Canadians have demanded and it is this option 
that we as a government intend to pursue.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the speech by the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka. I had the chance to listen to the previous 
Liberal speakers. We heard three speeches and three different 
positions. One Liberal member who spoke a while ago was 
sensitive to the needs of the population and focussed on the 
poorest members of our society. Another shared most of the 
concerns expressed on this side of the House. Then we gradually 
moved away from this position with the address by the hon. 
member for St. Catharines.
<P>
	I will keep my question short. It is fortunate that I still have 
my sight because I could see that the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka was on his feet but I was hearing what 
sounded like a Reform speech. Could the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka tell me what distinguishes his speech from 
those made by Reform members? He seems to be putting a great 
distance between himself and some of his colleagues who have 
spoken, it must be said, from the back benches, not his 
colleagues from the front benches who are conspicuous by their 
absence from this debate. We are fortunate to have a minister 
present in the House. It is interesting, but the viewpoint from the 
back benches seems a little pro forma and at times sounds like 
what we heard at the Spicer Commission, a kind of cantina 
where everyone brings their own wine and where the bill is 
prepared in advance. While we are talking, I am wondering 
whether the policies have not already been drafted.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka 
is this: Is there a difference between his own personal position 
and that of the Reform Party since this is an open debate?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	There is indeed a great deal of difference between my point of 
view, which is a Liberal point of view, and that of the Reform 
Party. It begins with where we start. If we begin our 
deliberations from a simple bottom line, which is need, then we 
are going to end up where the Reform Party is going to end up.
<P>
	Liberals do not do that. We begin with the need of the 
individual Canadian. We believe in the dignity of individual 
Canadians. We believe in that unwritten social contract of the 
last 50 years where we as Canadians have believed that we have 
responsibilities to each other.
<P>
	As I said in my speech, we believe we will not allow 
Canadians to fall below a certain level. People will not die in 
this country for lack of medical services, they will not go hungry 
in this country for lack of food, and they will not die exposed for 
lack of shelter, because Liberal governments in the last 50 years 
have constructed a social policy in this country that has 
protected individual Canadians, and we as a government in 1994 
are not going to try to dismantle it but find a way to make it 
continue so that we will continue to serve Canadians. We will 
continue with that social contact so that my children and my 
children's children will enjoy the benefits of what Liberal 
governments for the last 50 years have been able to accomplish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed 
listening to the hon. member and I would like to ask a simple, 
straightforward question.
<P>
	Our country continues to plunge into debt, and it appears that 
before we can wrestle the deficit out of existence we could hit 
$650 billion of indebtedness. As each year goes by, we lose a 
little more of our ability to  help the poor, whether it is the needy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="830"> 830 </A></B>
<P>
refugees coming into our country or any other poor within our 
society. What would the member suggest? How would the 
member suggest we help the poor in this country when we lose 
the financial and economic ability to do so?
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, the way we are going to help the 
poor in this country is with what has been said for the last three 
weeks over and over again. We are going to help the poor by 
getting them back to work in this country, by giving them jobs, 
by creating jobs, by creating an environment in which the small 
business sector can create jobs.
<P>
	That is how one gives them dignity. That is how one is able to 
afford it. The red book has outlined a policy through 122 pages. 
It details very clearly how we are going to renew the economy in 
this country, how we are going to put people back to work and 
how the poor will take care of themselves when they have those 
jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
consider it a privilege to debate the reform of social programs in 
the country. For many here today, reforming them to ensure both 
their sustainability and their availability to those who need them 
is a significant reason to have run for Parliament in 1993.
<P>
	We feel grateful that the government has given all members a 
chance to air their views on this issue before legislation is 
introduced. I am sure that all members share my desire that 
backbenchers and constructive opposition members alike will 
be able to see reflections of these debates in the legislative 
program to come.
<P>
	Certainly there is general agreement in this country on the 
need for reform of our social programs. Members on both sides 
of the House again agree that cosmetic changes are not enough.
<P>
	Questions are being asked that would have been unthinkable 
just a few years ago. Is there a better way to deliver this program 
or service? Do we need it at all? Are there built-in disincentives 
to people who need to be fully self-supporting? How much do 
programs cost? Can we sustain them?
<P>
	Watching the finance minister's pre-budget consultation in 
Calgary on the weekend, I was struck by widespread agreement 
on these issues. Almost everyone said that our current method of 
funding social programs is killing jobs and export opportunities, 
that less government intervention is better and that government 
needs to spend less, spend smarter and tax less.
<P>
	Spending less does not mean taking Canada back into the dark 
ages. What it really means is that funding must be refocused and 
it is incumbent on this House to lay down the principles that will 
guide a rechannelling of program assistance in a way that is fair, 
effective and compassionate.
<P>
	Other speakers have already discussed a number of principles. 
One of them is that spending in the future must be based on need 
rather than entitlement. People with high incomes do not need 
the same kind of help as those with low incomes. Therefore the 
fact that they belong to a particular ethnic or demographic group 
should not automatically entitle them to extra government 
support.
<P>
	We feel that tomorrow's programs will be delivered more in 
concert with private groups. People in need will work with a 
community based network rather than those who are simply paid 
to supply them a service. These private groups may be part of the 
answer in helping an individual emerge from this chronic 
position of need.
<P>
	There should be also a stated objective of other programs that 
recipients be required to undertake training or community 
service that will enable these people to acquire the skills that 
will reduce their future dependence upon governments.
<P>
	These principles are significant. I have the privilege of 
addressing the most important principle this afternoon and this 
evening. That is the position of the family in relation to the state. 
This principle is important because it questions the assumption 
of the welfare state that has become entrenched in the post-war 
era, the assumption that has spurred this magnificent fiscal 
situation in which we find ourselves today.
<P>
	I am speaking of the concept of the paternalistic state, the 
notion that the state or the government has the capacity or even 
the duty to somehow replace the family as the basic unit of 
nurture in our society.
<P>
	This sentiment, while never accepted by most Canadians, was 
heralded when Bonnie Kreps announced to <I>Maclean's</I> magazine 
in 1969 that her group's objectives included getting rid of the 
conjugal family unit. For decades this idea has occasionally 
found its way on to the desks of government policy makers. 
Many feel today that families have been unappreciated and 
under supported as a result.
<P>
	While the role of the family has been questioned, the concept 
of the state is also changing.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	People are disillusioned. They no longer believe it is possible 
for government to provide all of the solutions. Certainly its 
scope is shrinking because of its financial problems. In a way 
this could be a positive thing because with a little help human 
relationships could fill in the gaps left by government programs.
<P>
	The basic unit of care should not be a government cheque or 
the department of something or other or a social worker. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="831"> 831 </A></B>
<P>
unit must be the family. Society has yet to develop a better way 
to care for the young, protect the weak and attend to the elderly.
<P>
	People who come from dysfunctional families need special 
help at times and then the government must step in to do the best 
it can for the individual, realizing that it will always be an 
inferior choice to a functioning and loving family.
<P>
	In some ways governments have even played a part in 
encouraging dysfunctional families because they support people 
without reference to their family ties. An example is a young 
person who rebels and leaves home only to end up on some kind 
of government assistance, or the husband who moves to another 
province to shirk his responsibility to pay for court ordered 
support.
<P>
	Governments should require people to demonstrate at least 
this minimum level of responsibility toward their relationships 
and this might even lead to an increased incentive to make 
families work.
<P>
	There are other positive things government can do to 
encourage strong families. I would like to see some aspects of 
our tax structure changed, especially encouraging couples with 
children. Last year's tax ruling against married couples in an 
Alberta court sent a mixed message to Canadians. Incredibly, 
the courts ruled that while married couples have suffered tax 
discrimination in years past, it is acceptable because families 
have suffered less discrimination in the past than other 
stereotyped groups. Surely this was and is wrong.
<P>
	Another positive change could involve day care. Those who 
advocate the welfare state would like to see government workers 
control the care of children. However, the Reform Party prefers 
a de-institutionalized setting that gives the choice to parents.
<P>
	As Margaret Wente mentioned in her column in Saturday's 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>, if we really want to help parents, why not put 
extra money directly into their pockets and let them figure out 
how to spend it? The government's role would be relegated to 
licensing and monitoring day cares, allowing parents to choose 
their own system, be it a day care, a nanny or some other 
personalized arrangement.
<P>
	I want to touch for a moment on the reasoning of the welfare 
state and why it can be damaging. Advocates of government 
solutions feel that the government is somehow objective and 
that families are unobjective, unenlightened bastions of 
conservatism.
<P>
	While it is probably true that families are more conservative 
than your average university professor, I do not believe that 
there is any such thing as a value neutral objective authority. If 
the authority of the state replaced that of the family it would 
simply teach and impose its own values through that system.
<P>
	It is quite clear to me that the values of big government are 
frequently a fundamentalist mish-mash of left wing, politically 
correct dogma that in its own way is far more conservative and 
legalistic than that held by most families. Any concerted, large 
scale attempt to replace the authority of the parent with that of 
the  teacher, the social worker or even the courts will be resisted 
on this side of the House.
<P>
	Where is this debate going to take us? We have heard some 
discouraging debates in the last few weeks, talk of maintaining 
universality regardless of need or broadening the tax base and 
changing RRSP rules. Each of these proposals would adversely 
affect families.
<P>
	How will they hurt them? By maintaining or adding new 
programs at the urging of special interest groups or failing to 
address our debt and deficit problem squarely and honestly, by 
refusing to prioritise the dwindling resources of our government 
we will harm the most vulnerable in society, including young 
families, in the years to come.
<P>
	There have also been glimmers of hope during these debates. 
Speaker after speaker has begun his or her speech with 
passionate thanks to the people who count the most to them, 
their families. During the one minute presentations that precede 
Question Period, many single out family members for special 
recognition. Honourable mention for the international year of 
the family continues to sprinkle our discussions.
<P>
	The death certificate of the family has been written 
prematurely. Statistics will show that Canadians, especially our 
youth, hold a strong family life as a measure of true success. It is 
my conviction that history will judge legislators, at least in part, 
by the way we treat our families.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to read a quote from someone who shared this 
concern: ``Men say to us, `there is this problem with the family. 
How are we to preserve it? It seems to be dissolving before our 
eyes'. This has been true perhaps always and everywhere. 
Everywhere good things have seemed to be going. Yet 
everywhere they are merely struggling to their new birth''.
<P>
	The family has been under many stresses in this generation 
but it cannot be extinguished. It is merely struggling to its own 
sort of new birth.
<P>
	Our social programs as well need to struggle for a new 
expression in order to serve the needs of Canadians. We have 
been discussing principles upon which this rebirth can stand. I 
would suggest to this House that any principle upon which our 
social programs are reordered must strengthen the social unit 
which forms the historic bedrock of our nation and that 
foundation upon which all strong nations are built, the family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the hon. member's speech with great interest. He emphasized 
the family as a basic core for the way people live and come 
together in Quebec and Canada. He is quite right, the family is a 
fundamental value. He also highlighted the fact that 
governments, our government, are jeopardizing this family unit. 
He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="832"> 832 </A></B>
<P>
even used an  expression, ``The death certificate of the family 
has been written prematurely''.
<P>
	There is another kind of family in this country, namely the 
provinces. Indeed, does Ottawa's passion for centralization not 
endanger not only the family unit but also the provinces' ability 
to meet their responsibilities for their own people? Of course, I 
am talking about Quebec, but not just Quebec-all the other 
provinces. What is his experience? What is the hon. member's 
experience in his community?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments and 
thank the member for the encouragement. He is taking quite a 
leap here from my discussion of family into the constitutional 
swamp, as we have talked about before, of trying to relate that 
somehow to Quebec and its relationship to Canada.
<P>
	I would say that for many of us in the west if you are asking for 
the British Columbia perspective, or the perspective from where 
I come from and where I have been elected from, in many ways 
we do see Canada as a family in the sense that we think Canada 
has 10 parts, 10 equal members, 10 siblings, 10 people, all part 
of this family that together forms a country.
<P>
	In many ways there is a support in the west, in B.C. 
particularly, for the idea that when you have a family everyone 
is treated equally. No one is put down and no one is elevated 
because a family works best when 10 provinces or 10 people are 
treated the same.
<P>
	Although there are different programs and different priorities 
in different areas, and that is as it should be just as 10 children 
are unique, they are not treated specially, they are part of a 10 
member family.
<P>
	I will take the leap with the hon. member and I will talk about 
the family in that sense. Certainly, as has always been said in a 
family, all members are always welcome and all members are 
discouraged from leaving.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened 
attentively to my colleague in his remarks. He went on at some 
length with regard to his high regard, and compliment him, for 
the family. Perhaps he would take a moment or two and explain 
to the House the definition of family to the hon. member but 
more important to the party which he represents.
<P>
	Second, while he is on his feet if he would indicate to the 
House the role that he believes the state should play in 
facilitating and assisting the family. I refer specifically to the 
role of the Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. Most of my 
discussion tonight was about my concern for families and the tax 
disincentives. For example, the court decision I quoted was that 
in the past somehow married couples were not treated the same 
as couples who decided to live together. That is what the court 
ruling referred to.
<P>
	I have been talking about the need for the state through its tax 
laws and through other means to monetarily encourage families 
especially while they are raising children. That is basically what 
I was talking about. We have to find ways to make sure that we 
do not penalize people for trying to raise a family.
<P>
	I do not have the motion in front of me, but it refers to 
children, young adults and families. I do not think anyone will 
dispute the idea that we need to support families because 
families are our future.
<P>
	We see the government's role as supporting the financial 
needs of people rather than picking a program and stating: ``This 
is the program you have to try to fit into, whether you are a 
square peg in a round hole''. Instead we should say: ``If you have 
a financial need, then the social contract is there to make sure 
you do not fall through the cracks and be left to your own 
devices''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, tonight I am going to speak about a subject that is dear 
to everyone's heart and in particular to our electorate in this 
country.
<P>
	When I was running for office I found, as I am sure many 
members did, that one of the biggest considerations and 
concerns of Canadians was what was going to happen to their 
health care. There were a lot of concerns and a lot of problems 
and nobody knew which way to go. Canadians are very 
concerned about what is going to happen to their health care in 
the future. To that extent I would say that their health care is 
probably the most valued thing they have in their lives.
<P>
	The greatest guardians to good health that exists is our 
personal responsibility for a healthy lifestyle and our national 
health care system. The first one the government can do 
absolutely nothing about, but in the latter the government 
certainly can.
<P>
	I believe as a physician and a consumer that our system is the 
best in the world. It is the envy of people outside of our country. 
We just need to look at the United States to see how they look 
enviously at our country to emulate for their new health care 
program.
<P>
	Canadian citizens receive the best health care free of charge. 
They are governed by the five basic tenets under the Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="833"> 833 </A></B>
<P>
Health Act. They are: universality of care; comprehensive 
coverage for all essential services. I under line the word 
``essential''. It is a very important point  to remember. It also 
provides reasonable access by health care providers as well as 
consumers; portability of benefits from one province to another; 
and, the administration of health care by a public agency on a 
non-profit basis.
<P>
	To give an idea of what we are talking about in terms of 
figures, in 1990 over $60 billion was spent on health care alone 
in this country which represents almost 10 per cent of our gross 
domestic product.
<P>
	The financing of the system is divided between the federal 
government and the provinces. The provinces manage the actual 
day to day affairs and how the money is spent but they have to do 
it under the Canada Health Act; otherwise the federal 
government will withhold funding. In other words, the federal 
government takes their money and uses it as a wedge or a threat 
to the provinces regarding what they can and cannot do.
<P>
	Over the last decade some situations have occurred in this 
country that have greatly jeopardized publicly funded health 
care which will ultimately lead to the collapse of health care as a 
publicly funded system. Not only health care but every social 
program in this country will be jeopardized by the following 
situation. This has been spoken about quite eloquently by my 
colleagues in caucus today as well as other members in the 
House.
<P>
	The escalating debt over the last 12 to 14 years that we have, 
which has risen from $125 billion to $500 billion today, is the 
biggest threat to health care and social programs in this country.
<P>
	To give an idea of what has occurred, back in 1984 28 cents 
out of every dollar was spent just to service this debt. Today it is 
about 33 cents. By the year 2000 at the current rate of spending 
40 cents out of every dollar will be used merely to serve the debt. 
As can be seen we have less and less money to spend on other 
things such as social programs. This is a system that cannot last.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	The other side of the health care situation is that expenditures 
are escalating dramatically. They are growing at over four times 
the rate of economic growth. There are a number of reasons for 
this. Briefly, number one is the ever-increasing aging 
population which consumes over 70 per cent of the health care 
dollar. Two, our technologies and intervention and therapeutics 
are becoming more advanced and more expensive all the time. 
Three, there are new diseases such as AIDS which are increasing 
in frequency tragically which also cost a significant amount of 
money.
<P>
	If we accept the facts as I have outlined them today the system 
that we can see now is living on borrowed time. The dwindling 
funds and increasing costs are going to crush this system in the 
future. That is inevitable.
<P>
	Despite this fact, that the writing is on the wall, the federal 
government continues to hamstring the provincial governments 
by preventing their ability to get their health care under control 
by forcing them to adhere under the tenets of the Canada Health 
Act and threatening its contribution to financing health care 
under the health act.
<P>
	There are a number of things we can do. Not to do this will 
contribute to the suffering of the Canadian people.
<P>
	What can we do? We need to modify the Canada Health Act to 
stop penalizing the provincial governments when they try to get 
their health care costs under control. We need to strike a 
committee to define what essential health care services are, 
which means delisting some services.
<P>
	I put to you, Mr. Speaker, that those services which the public 
and professionals decide to delist will not be essential for 
health. These will not be essential for a good life or for having 
adequate treatment in hospitals.
<P>
	We need to set up an accountability system on the part of the 
consumer. Currently very little value is placed on a system and it 
is doomed financially unless there is some value placed on this 
by the consumer. Therefore I would suggest to the provincial 
governments to entertain the thought of such ideas as modest 
user fees and deductibles for some groups.
<P>
	People believe that the Canadian public does not want this but 
recent statistics show that over 80 per cent of the people in 
Quebec for example, and some studies were done to show this, 
would not mind paying a $5 to $10 user fee. The lowest 
socio-economic groups I would emphasize would be treated 
regardless. These tenets are still consistent with the ideas of 
universality of coverage and access.
<P>
	We also need to concentrate on education of the public in 
terms of the costs. One of the things we can do is to have 
statements of account at the time of consumption preferably or 
during the course of the year.
<P>
	We need to emphasize health education, especially in the 
early grade school years. This will pay off dramatically in the 
future. We need to focus on preventative medicine, on leading a 
healthy lifestyle with the aspects of drinking excessively, 
smoking and diets. From a physician's point of view it is 
amazing and also profoundly tragic the lack of knowledge that 
some children have when they get into the teenage and 
adolescent years and we all know the manifestations of that.
<P>
	Health care professionals must be educated in the cost of 
technologies and interventions and therapeutic options that they 
have. I can say again as a physician that we have not done a good 
enough job on this at all.
<P>
	I would also suggest that health care professionals be allowed 
to run private medical services. This would enable some people 
to get health care services done in a private situation, but all 
people, whether they are in a  public or private situation, would 
have their health care services done earlier. This would decrease 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="834"> 834 </A></B>
<P>
the amount of pain and suffering in the community, decrease the 
cost to the economy, decrease insurance costs and so on.
<P>
	It is in fact a win-win situation. To anyone who would argue 
that this a two-tier system, I say to them that anybody in this 
country involved in health care will say that there is a two-tier 
system in this country right now.
<P>
	The most important thing that the government needs to do 
with respect to health care is as I said before get their fiscal 
house in order. Until we get our spending under control as a 
nation we simply cannot afford to support social programs in the 
current state of affairs that we have. To not do that I think would 
be morally reprehensible and a tragedy for the Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	The last thing I would like to touch on for a moment is 
decreasing tobacco taxes. I feel this is an indefensible situation. 
Every year the cost to the country in terms of smoking is 
horrendous. It costs billions and billions of dollars. There is a 
loss of productivity and an increase in health care costs. Over 
40,000 people in this country die of smoking related illnesses.
<P>
	To increase the cost of cigarettes has resulted, as has been 
proven, in a decrease in consumption especially among the 
young. Therefore I suggest that instead of decreasing taxes on 
tobacco that we maintain them; and instead of caving in to the 
criminals who are engaging in this smuggling activity I would 
also suggest that we add an export tax to cigarettes going into 
other countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say 
that I enjoyed the member's remarks but my curiosity was 
peaked by his comments about the Canada Health Act. It 
brought back vivid memories of the election campaign last fall 
when underlying many of the public meetings we had in our 
riding were questions about the future of our health system 
under a regime which might include Reform Party proposals.
<P>
	I would ask the member to tell this House if he really believes 
that weakening in any way the Canada Health Act, in any way 
dismantling the thrust and the strength of that legislation to 
protect this country, that we can put our full faith in the 
provinces to maintain a national system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. member for his comment.
<P>
	As the elected members of the provincial legislatures are 
answerable to the Canadian public it would be political suicide 
for them to create a health care situation where the people who 
elected them to office would suffer.
<P>
	It behoves every elected individual in this country to face the 
writing on the wall, to realize that we have a situation where 
health care costs are increasing at four times the rate of 
economic growth and governments are dealing with deficit 
spending with less and less money being applied to health care.
<P>
	We have to face up to this. It is not just dismantling or 
destroying the Canada Health Act, it is modifying it to make it a 
better situation. To accept the current situation as it is now is to 
merely stick one's head in the sand. It is incumbent upon all of 
us to do something about it in order to preserve essential health 
care services for all Canadians so that they are not going to 
suffer, they are going to have their operation and they are not 
going to die as they do down in the United States due to lack of 
care.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca has replied to the question 
I put to his predecessor who, by the way, left his parents to get 
married. The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The federal government is preventing the provinces from  
putting health care under control by threatening to cut transfer 
payments''. And he is right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I like what the hon. member said because it is exactly what we 
feel in Quebec. This means that, both in the West and in the East, 
the federal government threatens the very principles of 
universality and accessibility. And that is a serious problem. A 
few moments ago the question was asked as to whether the 
provinces were in a better position to maintain these principles. 
Let us take a good look at the situation: in the last ten years or so, 
the federal government has been systematically cutting transfer 
payments and has now become the biggest threat to universality 
and accessibility.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important for the hon. opposition member to understand that 
health care services are pulling the wool over the eyes of the 
Canadian public by instituting a concept called rationing. That 
means they are telling hospitals how many hips or bypass 
surgeries they can do. As a result the Canadian public is being 
deprived of service under the guise of so-called universality. In 
this current situation people who need essential health care 
services are not getting them because of the rationing and the 
withdrawal of services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="835"> 835 </A></B>
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are trying to say that people who are 
sick are not obtaining services in a timely fashion. Let us 
recognize that. Let us do something about that with the amount 
of funds we have now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this evening I had the pleasure to listen to members of 
the Reform, the Bloc and the Liberal parties put forward their 
presentations. It is refreshing that people have come here with 
an honest concern for considering the social aspects of the 
society in which we live.
<P>
	I have had experiences working for three years in a boys' 
school that I will likely never forget. I guess another name for it 
would be reform school. Hon. members would like me to 
recognize the school was for wayward people who were to be 
straightened around. I did not want to tell them but it is true.
<P>
	One young fellow who was there while I worked there ran 
away to his home in North Battleford. He visited me while I was 
attending university. He wanted to know what he should do. We 
sat there for two hours, at the end of which time I said: ``Make up 
your mind. If you want to go back I will take you back''. He 
decided to go back and serve his time, which he did.
<P>
	On returning to the institution one of the people working there 
called him a stupid so-and-so and said: ``What are you doing 
back here? Why didn't you keep running?'' Those were the 
people who were looking after him. Those were the people we 
entrusted with our young people.
<P>
	As I travelled to Moose Mountain after the election I picked 
up a young fellow in Grenfell, Saskatchewan. He was from 
Richmond, B.C. He was 18 years old and did not even have a 
grade nine education. He was going to Winnipeg to get a job as a 
salesman. Now it is true some people would say that is fantastic. 
I tried to encourage him to go back home to his parents and 
improve his education. I hope he does.
<P>
	I bring before us these analogies of the problems that face us 
all. We elected four Liberals from Saskatchewan. They wanted 
to make sure there was a balance so they put a teacher on the 
ballot. I know that one of those four, a fellow member, is a 
lawyer. He feels there is an equal balance now: three lawyers and 
one teacher.
<P>
	With regard to human resource development we are honoured 
to have the hon. member for Winnipeg South Centre as minister 
in charge. My constituents have made clear in many meetings 
and discussions that they have many concerns regarding our 
social programs, a fundamental part of our country that requires 
review.
<P>
	On the issue of fiscal relations and federal spending power, 
concern revolves around our ability to form a partnership of 
fiscal cohesion throughout the country to deliver social 
programs. When one considers that federal spending on social 
programs is between $70 billion and $80 billion annually, which 
equals as much as two-thirds of program spending at the federal 
level, there is a level  of dissatisfaction among the voters of 
Souris-Moose Mountain over the manner in which our social 
programs are structured. I would like for a moment to discuss 
some of the needs we see in regard to the Unemployment 
Insurance Commission programs. We feel we need to move 
toward a level of maximum payout so that there is a ceiling on 
earnings one can make during a year in order to be beneficiary of 
UIC. In my opinion seasonal jobs which continue to require a 
payout year after year need to be reviewed. We cannot 
constantly require a higher contribution from both employer and 
employee in particular seasonal occupations.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	Also we have to allocate earnings more effectively to those 
who are receiving unemployment so they can be actively doing 
something, performing some type of work or receiving some 
form of education during the period between jobs. If we can 
improve their educational background we can provide them with 
the additional incentive to be able to enter the workforce in a 
productive nature.
<P>
	As well, we have to encourage employers to retain staff so if 
they wish to downsize they do it through natural attrition rather 
than make thousands of Canadians face job loss and uncertainty. 
Nowhere in the history of Canada have we seen so many people 
going to work day after day fearful of losing their jobs.
<P>
	I would like to highlight those students completing degrees 
and looking to go into the workforce but are unable to find work. 
They should have an opportunity to work as assistants to senior 
people in their chosen fields. This would help them gain some 
credibility and obtain a work record. This would also help them 
to enter into the job placement process.
<P>
	I would like to address a concern of mine regarding education 
and young people receiving assistance in the form of student 
loans. We have to ensure that their expectations in terms of 
paying back their loans are reasonable. We must frame it in a 
manner in which repayment of the loans is reasonable and they 
have some certainty of a place in the job market when they have 
completed their degree. As well interest rates must reflect the 
ability of young people to pay. If we want our young people to be 
educated and our human resources to be competitive 
restructuring of the student loan program is essential.
<P>
	When we review social security programs some very serious 
facts need to be addressed. My riding includes seven First 
Nations bands. I know their hopes and aspirations. They hope 
for recognition as a First Nation and for self-government. They 
too search out in hope for the best for their families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="836"> 836 </A></B>
<P>
	We now find that families in which both the husband and wife 
work outside the home are nearing 60 per cent of all families in 
the workforce. There are many latch-key children, youngsters 
leaving home for school likely with no breakfast, returning 
home at noon likely with no lunch and coming home after school 
with no adult to greet them.
<P>
	This is a very serious problem. I am not questioning the 
actions of parents. Many families would much sooner have one 
parent at home. However the reality is that they need two 
incomes just to keep the family together and to pay the bills. We 
see many single parent families headed by women. They are 
growing at an ever increasing rate. We have the highest 
incidence of low income in this group. The needs of these 
families are real and great. The demands placed on single 
parents are even greater.
<P>
	The schools could have a great deal to do with before and after 
school programs. The infrastructure and the schools are there. 
They are heated. We could create programs within the structure 
to assist parents requiring assistance with their children while 
they must be at work. What about the children of the next 
generation? We know that 1.1 million people live in households 
with social assistance as a way of life. We also know that in 
March 1993 three million Canadians required social assistance.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	This year is significant in that it is the International Year of 
the Family and the International Year of Indigenous Peoples. 
For each member of the 35th Parliament, our concerns for these 
groups are very real and growing. We must address their 
concerns and we will. For the young, we must address their 
family needs; for youth, the need for jobs; for seniors, a social 
safety net whereby they are assured their pensions will not be 
eroded. We cannot allow the poor and the disadvantaged to go 
unheard. We must assist.
<P>
	The payouts for these programs are significant: $7.4 million 
in welfare payments. When we take a look at our red book we 
find that our proposals show a strong desire to return hope for 
desperation, to remove fear and to provide a decent way of life 
for Canadians. The challenge is tremendous.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As hon. members are aware, the debate 
will be extended until 8.52 p.m. Since we have five minutes left 
for questions and comments, I now recognize the hon. member 
for Beauharnois-Salaberry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the comments of the hon. 
member who just spoke. In his speech, he showed his concern 
for people who are employed but are afraid of losing their jobs. I 
must say I share his concern because we have a plant called 
Expro which manufactures military equipment. Not so long ago, 
the plant had 1,000 jobs, and now there are only 400 left.
<P>
	As part of the pre-budget process we are involved in today, I 
would like to make a suggestion and also put a question to the 
previous speaker. Would his government be able to do what was 
done in the United States by Bill Clinton, who set aside a certain 
amount of money in the defence budget for reconversion of the 
defence industry? Now that the cold war is over, we do not need 
as many plants. Orders are shrinking, and that is what causes 
lay-offs. In the United States, they set aside a certain amount of 
money in the defence budget to be invested in converting 
defence plants to civilian production.
<P>
	Does the hon. member who just spoke agree with this 
suggestion? Would he be willing to put this proposal to his 
government so that we could convert defence plants to civilian 
use?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I respect the question of the hon. 
member. I feel that he is as competent as I am in making that 
suggestion to the government. As I see the 35th Parliament, all 
of us are that government. Each of those suggestions have merit. 
Why not put it forward? I certainly have no problem with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to congratulate the hon. member for an excellent 
presentation. I am sure many people on this side of the House 
agreed, as did I, with virtually everything he said. It is probably 
because he came to the Reform honestly, as did I, except that I 
attended reform school when I was about 12. That was when I 
got started in Reform.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would mind expanding on student 
loans. This is an extremely important situation facing thousands 
of graduates who are going into default because they cannot get 
jobs and therefore cannot pay back their student loans.
<P>
	I wonder if, from the member's side of the House, he could 
start to do something and we could carry forward a student loan 
repayment package, perhaps as promulgated by the Canadian 
Students Association.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, having a son who went through 
nine years of university and accumulated well over $50,000 of 
debt and happens to live in Alberta, I appreciate what the 
member is saying. I agree wholeheartedly with him. We have to 
assist students. We do not want to throttle them so they have no 
chance of getting a job and repaying their debt. Therefore I 
support the member wholeheartedly. That is the way we have to 
go. Otherwise we are going to frustrate young people so that 
they have no thought about even going into the educational field 
or any post-secondary field because of the problems they are 
going to be confronted with.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
congratulations again to the member for Souris-Moose 
Mountain on an excellent speech. I notice his real concern for 
the families and the young children of this nation. His concern is 
that there are so many families with single parents and the fact 
that their incomes are low.
<P>
	He also mentioned that he thought perhaps the school system 
should be used to provide after school care for families that do 
not have a a parent at home. There are a large number of families 
in this country with both parents working who do have a very 
high standard of living. It is their choice not to be there at home.
<P>
	Is he suggesting that this nation again subsidize those people 
who can well afford to look after their children and provide that 
kind of care after school? Does he feel that we as a society are 
obligated to provide that to anybody who would like it just 
because the kids do not have someone at home when they get 
home?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, as an educator for over 31 years I 
had the opportunity to deal with the rich, the poor, the wise and 
those who were not so wise. I was happy to have them all. I say to 
the hon. member that if I knew of one youngster who needed my 
attention, rich or poor, I would want to be there as an educator, as 
a parent and as a citizen of this country.
<P>
	The day we start elevating those who are rich and 
distinguishing between rich and poor, we are in a real problem 
state. I say to the hon. member that this is the problem in 
education. We have lost our commitment that we do have 
something to give these youngsters. If any one of them stayed 
away from problems because I looked after him, I would feel 
that is one thing I did to help him along the way in life. I see no 
problem there. I want us to have those opportunities for them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the education and 
youth critic for the Official Opposition, I wanted to take the 
opportunity afforded by this debate on social programs to draw 
the attention of hon. members to the alarming situation 
prevailing among young people in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	In Canada, to recall a few statistics, 17.5 per cent of young 
Canadians between the ages of 18 and 24 are now unemployed, 
which means more than 600,000 young people; 30 per cent do 
not finish high school; 51 per cent of high school graduates earn 
less than $10,000; and only 11 per cent earn over $20,000. More 
than two million young people are living in poverty. 
Furthermore, 12 per cent have serious drug problems.
<P>
	Since the government has often said it wanted to give 
Canadians and Quebecers renewed hope and dignity, it will have 
to do something about these alarming statistics. After all, our 
young people are our future, are they not?
<P>
	Another disturbing phenomenon is the increase in violence 
and intolerance among young people. According to the 
Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, the number of young 
people accused of violent crime has increased by an average of 
14 per cent annually since 1986. Considering the problems we 
mentioned earlier, this should come as no surprise.
<P>
	In the past weeks, a number of members raised the issue of 
stricter treatment of young offenders. I agree it is necessary to 
send a clear message to young criminals. Their crimes should 
not go unpunished, but we believe it is absolutely essential to 
examine the social context that breeds violence and intolerance 
among young people.
<P>
	Second, I would like to talk about the situation of young 
people in Quebec which is even more alarming and distressing. 
According to a recent report by the Conseil permanent de la 
jeunesse du Québec, nearly 40 per cent of young Quebecers live 
in poverty and 50 per cent do so for at least five years. More than 
150,000 young Quebecers are on welfare.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	The Quebec coroner's office has recorded an average of some 
350 suicides by young people every year since 1987. The youth 
unemployment rate in Quebec is nearly 20 per cent, or over 
137,000 young people just in Quebec. At least 45,000 jobs 
would have to be created annually in Quebec to absorb the young 
people arriving on the labour market. The high-school dropout 
rate is now 32.2 per cent in Quebec.
<P>
	Vocational training is also deficient. Most of the 26,000 
people waiting for training to improve their chances on the 
labour market are young.
<P>
	The alarming situation of young people affects not only their 
own future prospects but also the economy. More and more, 
young people must face the same prejudices as all unemployed 
people and welfare recipients. The confidence and dignity of our 
rising generation suffer greatly as a result. The vicious circle of 
unemployment and poverty- I realize that this does not seem to 
interest the people opposite, but I would not like us to be 
drowned out by their laughter and their talking. They are 
disturbing us.
<P>
	It is not easy to get out of the vicious circle of unemployment 
and poverty. It leads to an extreme loss of motivation which can 
increase the social problems of our young people. The situation 
of young native people is even more alarming and requires more 
specific help that is better suited to what they are going through.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne, the government said that it was 
considering self-government for native people. It could start by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="838"> 838 </A></B>
<P>
giving them the necessary resources and  support so that they 
can take better care of their young people too.
<P>
	One of the most important aspects of the reform of social 
programs proposed by the Minister of Human Resources is 
consultation. Taking so much time and resources reminds me of 
the operation which followed the failure of the Meech Lake 
Accord and led up to the famous Charlottetown accord. The 
more things change, the more they are the same. One could say 
that this government does not know how to learn from past 
failures. If only we were assured that the consultations will 
proceed in the spirit of openness described in the speech from 
the throne. But judging by previous consultations, that will 
surely not be the case. If the consultations preceding the speech 
from the throne are any indication, how does the government 
intend to ensure the openness described in the Speech from the 
Throne?
<P>
	I would like to mention here something that happened to me 
on January 15. Having learned the day before that the Secretary 
of State for Training and Youth was holding consultations in 
Quebec City, I contacted her office to be invited as an observer 
in my capacity as opposition critic for training and youth. No 
way, I was told, it was by invitation only, and they did not even 
tell me where it was taking place, even though Quebec City is 
across from Lévis, right near my riding.
<P>
	Since this consultation was for all young people in Quebec, I 
later contacted the main youth organizations to find out if they 
had been invited. None of these groups, except the permanent 
council on youth, a Quebec government agency, had received an 
invitation. Invitations were made over the heads of the umbrella 
groups, sometimes directly to some member organizations or to 
organizations which have nothing to do with training. As if that 
were not enough, student organizations were completely 
overlooked, and students will soon be on the labour market. Is 
that how this government intends to consult? That is a fine way 
to consult!
<P>
	Another gem about the Secretary of State for Training and 
Youth is her statement last Monday on Quebec. She said: ``I 
have been to Quebec twice and I have a fairly good idea of what 
the people there want''. I have been to English Canada several 
times myself, and in all modesty, I cannot say that I know very 
well what the people in those provinces want. If you think you 
know what Quebec wants after two visits to Quebec, I think you 
are fooling yourself.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	Even if there are a least a hundred federal programs available 
to young people, very few are reserved specifically for them and 
when they are, they are inadequately funded.
<P>
	The worst thing that happened to young people during the 
Conservative reign was not the elimination of the Katimavik 
program, the demise of which went virtually unnoticed aside 
from the remonstrations of Senator Jacques Hébert. No, the 
worst thing was the elimination in 1987 of a provision which 
gave priority to young people in so far as federal programs were 
concerned. Another dramatic situation that young people face is 
when they are caught in the middle, that is when they meet 
neither the criteria of the federal government, nor those of the 
provincial government. These young people do not have access 
to occupational training if they do not receive unemployment 
insurance or social assistance or if they have not been out on 
their own for at least two years.
<P>
	Even though the federal government does not seem inclined to 
respect provincial jurisdiction over training, it could at least 
respect existing structures before creating new ones, especially 
given the context of budget cuts. Consider the example of 
employment development agencies and agencies that sponsor 
training extension programs. There is a comprehensive federal 
network in place in Quebec and elsewhere and I think these 
structures should be strengthened before new ones are created.
<P>
	In point of fact, the demands of young people have been well 
known for many years in Quebec. A national youth summit was 
held in 1983 and more than 133 agencies participated in public 
hearings in 1989. One very important fact emerged from these 
consultations, namely that jobs were a priority. According to 
young people and to groups that made representations, the 
ultimate goal that the government should be pursuing is full 
employment.
<P>
	In pursuing this objective, consideration must be given to the 
characteristics of the various groups of unemployed people and 
to the realities in the different regions. People in the community 
must be involved to a greater degree. Without regional 
solidarity, there can be no worthwhile job creation plan. Young 
people are also critical of the multiplicity of programs and of the 
way in which resources are allocated. Specifically, they lament 
the fact that each time a new government comes to power, the 
names of the programs change.
<P>
	Quebec youth want a quick end to duplication and to futile 
struggles between governments. They also want to be involved 
more in the process. Young people have set up youth 
consultation forums in the regions but they need more money to 
support their action. They are also hoping for improved funding 
of local youth community organizations.
<P>
	To help young people the government intends to create a 
Youth Service Corps, an initiative that should give them the 
opportunity to undergo a training period to acquire experience 
and build up confidence. This project is strangely reminiscent of 
the old Katimavik program abolished by the Conservatives in 
1986. The  Youth Service Corps does not stress second language 
learning as much as Katimavik but it does not offer any new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="839"> 839 </A></B>
<P>
solutions to young people's problems; it is recycled material. 
The Youth Service Corps mostly offers occupational activities 
without direct links to the workforce of today and tomorrow.
<P>
	Again, instead of creating a new program and a new structure, 
we should better support youth organizations by giving them 
extra resources to adjust to today's reality. It would be a unique 
opportunity to combine job training with regional development. 
Young people should have a chance to become familiar with new 
computer and other technologies while helping their 
communities.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to add a few comments: even if the 
youth service corps appears at first glance to be motivated by 
good intentions, it hides in my opinion an effort to gain time 
before tackling the real problems of young people. It is a flashy 
operation that will reach very few young people, 10,000 in three 
years, when there are over 600,000 unemployed Canadians 
between the ages of 16 and 24. The youth service corps is merely 
a recycled Katimavik program. This is an old remedy for a new 
problem. It is also one more incursion into an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. The only positive side that I can see is organizing 
activities for young people who want to take a sabbatical before 
making a permanent career choice. However, this is certainly 
not a priority compared with the needs already identified by 
organizations involved in training young people.
<P>
<B>(2010 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments of the hon. member but I was particularly interested 
in his criticisms of the proposed Canadian youth service. He 
makes a somewhat disparaging reference concerning the 
Katimavik program which was cut by the previous Tory 
government. I believe if Katimavik had not been cut we would 
have seen, with experience, that program blossom into a very 
useful and very helpful program for young people.
<P>
	I want to ask the member if he does not believe it is helpful for 
young people at the critical age of 18, 19, 20 to maybe get out of 
the home. If they do not have an opportunity to work in a 
community near their home, they could work in another part of 
the country. If they are from B.C. they might work in Nova 
Scotia or Quebec; if they are from Quebec they might work in 
Ontario or Alberta.
<P>
	Does he not think it would be very helpful to these young 
people to have a real work experience even if it is not in their 
ultimate area of professional expertise later on in life?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his question. Obviously, if we were not in a particularly tight 
financial situation, an experiment like Katimavik would be 
entirely praiseworthy, and I agree with what he just said.
<P>
	However, when we compare the need for personal 
development and experience, travelling and all that with the 
other needs of youth-needs that I have described in the first 
part of my speech-young people who are living in extreme 
poverty, who are desperate to get some kind of occupational 
training after dropping out of school and then after a while want 
to get into the labour market and still do not have the proper 
training and experience they need, when we compare that with 
the experience of going to another province or another part of 
one's own province to do the kind of things described in the 
Youth Service Program such as cleaning up the banks of a river 
or doing various jobs to beautify the environment, we realize 
there is no future in cleaning up the environment with brooms 
and shovels. It does not provide a direct link with the labour 
market. This kind of work tends to be done by volunteers rather 
than employees. These jobs are typical volunteer work. In my 
riding, civic-minded residents do this kind of work for a couple 
weeks in the spring as volunteers. In fact, it is all part of 
environmental awareness.
<P>
	It may have worked from 1980 to 1986. Perhaps the financial 
resources were there at the time, but we should remember that 
even in its heyday, the number of young people involved in 
Katimavik did not exceed 10,000, at a cost of $10,000 per 
person.
<P>
	You may consider this is a stiff price to pay for the experience 
of living in another province for nine months, as described in the 
youth service program, Sir-oh, I am sorry-Mr. Speaker, since 
I am supposed to address the Chair while trying to get the hon. 
member's attention. Trips and room and board are expensive.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	So if we consider other training needs, it seems to me that we 
must get our priorities straight. If it were up to me personally, 
obviously I would be more inclined to favour those who will 
have to enter the labour market. And I would do that because I 
have looked at various reports and heard the demands of youth 
organizations which are saying: jobs come first.
<P>
	During the election campaign and in the throne speech, the 
Liberal Party told us that jobs came first. Occupational, 
recreational, leisure and cultural activities are all very 
interesting, but not in the financial situation we have today.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member for Lévis for his fine speech.
<P>
	I noticed his concern for the need to create jobs. He said there 
are about 45,000 jobs that had to be created in the province of 
Quebec to help the young people there. A great social cost is 
being handed from generation to generation as these people lose 
hope and motivation.
<P>
	These things all take money. Education takes a great deal of 
money. The province of Quebec is a net recipient of equalization 
grants. I wonder if the member for Lévis is looking toward the 
federal government to pay for education, to pay for job creation, 
to pay for the social problems that exist in Quebec. Where else is 
the money going to come from? I would like to hear his point of 
view on that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will simply repeat the message that 
this side of the House is desperately trying to send, namely that 
duplication and overlapping must end. As regards job training, 
if the present government delegated the responsibility, and the 
related budget, in accordance with the established jurisdiction 
of the provinces in the field of education, it would eliminate 
duplication and save Quebec taxpayers $250 million. In fact, by 
eliminating duplication and overlapping, the federal 
government would save a lot more than that, probably an amount 
equivalent to ten times the cost of running the Youth Service 
Corps for the first year.
<P>
	If you include all the provinces, the savings would be close to 
$1 billion dollars. The $250 million figure for Quebec was never 
challenged. Nor was the $1 billion estimated by the other 
provinces. Such savings would be made by simply putting an 
end to duplication and bringing the program closer to the 
regions which, by the way, consult each other more and more 
and are better able to identify the training and employment 
problems facing young people, and that is very important.
<P>
	Moreover, the problem with the Youth Service Corps is that it 
creates yet another structure and, of the $10,000 which will 
supposedly be allocated for young people, $4,000 will be 
reserved for administration purposes. It is a very good idea to set 
up a program to help young people, but such a measure should 
not be an excuse to create a new structure absorbing $4,000, or 
40 per cent of the amount allocated. I believe that all sides in this 
House should agree to avoid creating new structures and instead 
strengthen social programs by using existing ones.
<P>
	We also say this to the government: ``Respect your areas of 
jurisdiction; respect the areas of jurisdiction of Quebec and of 
the other provinces''. By simply doing this, savings will result.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for questions and comments 
has expired. Resuming debate. I must apologize, with all the 
members surrounding the member for Lévis, I forgot the next 
speaker on the list; it is unfortunate since he is a former 
professor of mine. I apologize to him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Never mind, 
Mr. Speaker. I enjoyed listening to the member for Lévis. I 
really appreciated his remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am reminded it is a long day. My day began 12-1/2 hours ago 
with a regional caucus meeting. One of these days somebody 
should write a book on how Parliament makes a law. We would 
discover in empirical fashion that it is not made in the give and 
thrust of debates in Parliament, in the Chamber, although that is 
important. It is made in the dialectical processes of exchange of 
views and compromises and give and take in committees but it 
can be the committees in which they have all the parties fully 
represented. That is where we reach our compromise and our 
consensus and that is how we make laws.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	I suppose it is an interesting lesson in our approach to this 
problem of social policy. I am most impressed by the statement 
by the distinguished Minister of Human Resources 
Development and one has to remind oneself that however 
important a portfolio is it is not an island to itself. We are 
reminded again of the Liberal Party program which for better or 
for worse was to accept the grave problem of the deficit that 
exists. One must do something about it.
<P>
	One will solve it not by cries of despair alone but by trying to 
create employment, the jobs, the flow of revenue and 
maintaining our comprehensive social security network in 
which we lead the world and of which we are very justly proud.
<P>
	If we approach the issue of human resources and what the 
ministry should do, it is concerned with many facets of cabinet 
operations and many portfolios.
<P>
	I am reminded of one of those distinguished papers which I 
reread quite recently issued in the Second World War by 
Archbishop Temple who later became Archbishop of Canterbury 
on the need for reconstruction in the post war period. He was 
emphasizing then that you must use your human resources and 
to get an economy moving you must create employment. It is an 
older truth but it is still true today.
<P>
	When I look at the situation in Canada today the most obvious 
need is for a long term strategy and the long term strategy in 
terms of human resources is to create globally competitive 
industries, leading edge technology that provides not simply 
short term jobs for tomorrow or even the day after tomorrow but 
10 years from now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="841"> 841 </A></B>
<P>
	In a very real sense this is the challenge for my own province 
of British Columbia as we have tried to escape from an original 
primary resources based economy to a more sophisticated post 
industrial economy that recognizes the glut in primary resources 
around the world that you cannot base your economic 
well-being on primary resources any more alone, although I 
must say with imaginative management policies and investment 
in the search much is being done to remain ahead of the rest of 
the world.
<P>
	You must invest in industry and leading edge industry and that 
means an relationship not merely between the ministry of 
employment but the ministry of education. These go together. 
The Japanese miracle is to understand that the post modern 
society's technology is based on research and that is based on 
education and on universities but universities of the 21st 
century.
<P>
	For those who have spent, as I suppose most people here have, 
much of their lives in universities we would have to recognize 
that the dead hand of tradition lies very heavily on universities. 
There are obligations to stay abreast with the scientific 
technologically based community in which we are living. 
Universities need to move into that threshold between pure 
study and application and in some ways the technische 
hochschule, those technical universities in continental Europe, 
give us a lead which the Japanese took up and which is the 
explanation of the Japanese miracle.
<P>
	In our attempt in British Columbia to escape from the primary 
resources based economy we have invested heavily in 
education, in science, in pursuit of advanced technology and the 
jobs that flow from that.
<P>
	If I may I will refer to a case study, as it were, of this. I would 
stress, though, that science is not simply the cataloguing of dead 
knowledge from a past era. There is a poetic element in the great 
scientists that distinguishes the Einstein from the ordinary 
scientist. Those inductive leaps into the future require that 
element of vision.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	We are very fortunate in British Columbia to have had a 
scientist of the calibre of Erich Vogt who has that poetic vision 
and a strong university president who recognizes that if you 
invest in the science of tomorrow, you may have to wait 10 years 
for the fruits to come back. But they will come back in a much 
better and a much larger quantity than if you are simply looking 
for results that will show on balance sheets next year or 18 
months from now.
<P>
	It is what Dr. Strangway, the very brilliant administrator at the 
University of British Columbia calls the development in North 
America of ``hot spots''. One of the interesting things is the 
development of pharmacological research with its offshoots into 
applied industrial development. It is a feature of that area of 
land that encompasses British Columbia, Oregon and 
Washington. These universities and the communities 
co-operating together are pushing the world community  to the 
advanced frontiers of pharmacological research, one which by 
the way yielded a Nobel Laureate for Canada several months ago 
by the name of Dr. Michael Smith of the University of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	New technologies, pion therapy for example for brain 
tumours or the superconductors which are the product of the 
TRIUMF project at the University of British Columbia are not 
projects created in the abstract, pure ventures in science that do 
not have a spin-off. For example KAON and TRIUMF spend 
approximately $30 million a year for research. The spin-off to 
industries such as the Ebco Industries Ltd. in Richmond, British 
Columbia, a company that started as a small tool manufacturing 
company developed by two German immigrant brothers has 
been converted into a $100 million a year export industry as a 
direct result of the TRIUMF research and the spin-off secondary 
industry resulting from it.
<P>
	If British Columbia and Canada are to create the jobs, to 
create those incomes and the flow of revenue to reduce the 
deficit, this is the way we should be going, investing in that 
frontier of science and knowledge, investing in education. It 
does mean, and I do not wish here to get into constitutional 
issues to which I have given a good deal of my professional life, 
but I do think we are looking at a stage at which national norms 
with a large element of imagination and leadership in them are 
required. Whether that is reached by strong federal government 
alone or in co-operation with provinces is an matter we will be 
discussing with the minister in charge of intergovernmental 
relations in the future.
<P>
	I am a little concerned, and I have voiced this in other arenas 
than the present one, with the possibility that TRIUMF and its 
progeny the KAON project, because of under funding by the 
Canadian government, by foreign governments that perhaps are 
not kept fully to their obligations by pressure from our own 
government, might fail. I would view that as a tragedy in the 
sense that a thousand scientists from around the world grouped 
together in a Canadian university community, researching 
together on common projects, the spin-off in those small 
commercially usable cyclotrons, the objects of this sort that are 
the rich product of that investment in money and research. There 
is a case for pure science. The federal government has led here in 
the past and I would hope it will do so in the future.
<P>
	The investment is worth the trouble. The investment in some 
senses is a challenge to the Canada of the 21st century that the 
present government committed itself to building. We will 
conquer the deficit by new jobs and the new jobs will be leading 
edge technology with the education to support it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
greatly appreciated the comments made by the hon. member 
from British Columbia.
<P>
	I gathered from what he said that he was a university teacher 
for a number of years, like me I might add. I especially 
appreciated his comments on education. I agree with him totally 
when he says that education is fundamental, essential, and that 
we must do our utmost to have a good education system because 
it is really basic, not only if we want to create lasting 
employment, but also if we want to promote a more democratic 
society, an imaginative and innovative society in all areas.
<P>
	Of course, much could be said about education. I disagree 
however with one of his remarks. I have no doubt that the hon. 
member is an experienced teacher as well as an intelligent man, 
but I have some difficulty with this idea of national standards in 
education. Certainly not at the university level. There is no need 
for that whatsoever. Several Canadian universities excel while 
relying on their own means to achieve high levels in research 
and quality. That is a given.
<P>
	In fact, academic work is clearly one of freedom and 
independence. I see absolutely no value in national standards. 
Even at the high school or elementary level, it seems to me that 
one of great things about education is this freedom of 
expression, this freedom to discover, this freedom enjoyed even 
with the teacher.
<P>
	I find that, in Canada, we have too many standards, too many 
national standards, too many government-imposed restrictions 
as it is. We do not need more national standards, we need less. 
We need teachers, at all levels, to be freer to provide young 
people with the kind of education that best relates to their life 
experience.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the speech by 
the hon. member of the Opposition. As you will undoubtedly 
remember, I was a special constitutional advisor to a few 
premiers of Quebec, Ontario and other provinces. I have always 
advocated a pluralistic federalism based on co-operation and 
consensus.
<P>
	I never suggested that standards should be imposed by a 
federal government or authority. I only said that, in setting 
scientific standards, we are often behind other countries with a 
strong national consensus. These are scientific matters. It is not 
an ideological or constitutional issue in my opinion.
<P>
	I never insisted on the application of a consensus by a 
sovereign and higher authority. Consensus means something 
else. I am not too happy with the National Research Council, 
which is overly centralized in Ottawa and does not fully meet the 
needs of British Columbia, for instance.
<P>
	My position is much more pluralistic in this respect. I call for 
the co-operation of the hon. members from Quebec and the 
other provinces. Nothing in current government policy seems to 
reflect this. If I may give a further explanation, nothing in my 
speech implies a constitutional theory, much less an overly 
centralized federalist policy. I am a constitutional pluralist.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact I am 
likely the last speaker today I think you will find the best has 
been left for last. Since there are relatively few members here to 
witness this just keep it to yourselves.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra. I 
always appreciate hearing his interventions. They are well 
thought out. Although I would add to his comments about the 
relevance of debate in this place vis-à-vis the relevance of 
compromise and discussion in committees.
<P>
	He will agree with me that it is the debate in this place that 
really focuses one's attention and really focuses the thinking 
that needs to surround the very important subjects that we must 
deal with.
<P>
	The member for Lévis was talking about the relationship of 
youth, employment and the social safety nets. It really struck 
home that this whole discussion and exercise is about the 
relationship between jobs and the social safety nets.
<P>
	If everybody were working we would not have need for a 
social safety net. If there were nobody working we could not 
afford to have a social safety net. It is really impossible to 
participate in this discussion without linking at all times jobs 
and the strength of the economy, which defines the level of our 
employment, with our ability to provide those social safety nets, 
those supports for those who for various reasons cannot work, 
whether they are too young, disabled, too old or they are just not 
in a position to find employment because of the economy of 
their area.
<P>
	In linking jobs to the whole question of social safety nets, I 
doubt there is really anyone here who has a full grasp of what our 
social safety net situation is like in this country right now. It is a 
huge monster in many ways. I feel it is madness to suggest that 
we should not completely review our social safety net programs. 
They have evolved over the years by piecemeal additions of one 
program or another, changes here and changes there, some good 
and some bad. If we do not take the opportunity now to totally 
review these programs we are just going to make the problems 
more difficult to tackle later on.
<P>
	Many of these programs were instituted by previous Liberal 
governments, and wisely so, but times have changed and we are 
the first ones to recognize it. I really pay tribute to our Minister 
of Human Resources Development who has demonstrated tre-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="843"> 843 </A></B>
<P>
mendous  leadership. As I review the consultation plan that he 
has put forward I marvel at the breadth of the program.
<P>
	If you look closely it is a three pronged approach involving 
the standing committee and members of Parliament, as members 
of the committee and as representatives of their ridings. It 
involves consultations with the provincial and territorial 
governments as a second attack. Third, the minister will have a 
special task force of non-partisan professionals who have been 
dealing with these issues for years to also provide advice.
<P>
	This three pronged approach will conclude roughly the end of 
March and will tie into the government's action plan which will 
be the subject of scrutiny until this coming September and then 
the parliamentary debate and review later this fall and into next 
year which involves the two years that the minister talked about.
<P>
	This is such a comprehensive set of consultations but it really 
bespeaks the kind of government that we are putting in front of 
the people, a transparent government, a government willing to 
listen to people and the fact that we are having this debate here.
<P>
<B>(2040 ) </B>
<P>
	We really are putting a new face to the people of Canada and 
giving Canadians a chance to have confidence again in their 
government.
<P>
	The first 100 days of the Liberal government have 
demonstrated that we are serious. There will be some mistakes, 
no question about it. With due respect to opposition members 
when the score is counted at the end of another four or five years 
we will be judged well in our efforts to listen to the people and 
try to develop programs that make a lot of sense.
<P>
	Our social safety net is full of holes, unfortunately. Imagine 
being a trapeze artist with a safety net below you that had holes 
in it. One would not feel too excited about taking that next swing 
under the circus tent.
<P>
	There are young people, seniors and people with families in 
this country who are very fearful about those holes in the safety 
net. Like most of us, I am not fully aware of all the elements of 
our safety net programs.
<P>
	It really behoves us to look at it all so that we can identify 
those holes. I will talk about a few as part of my intervention.
<P>
	In my riding of Algoma we have a single industry town, Elliot 
Lake, which has virtually lost all of its uranium mining. It is now 
struggling, struggling valiantly, and doing well to diversify its 
economy to take advantage of the beautiful natural resources in 
the area along with the tourism and so on.
<P>
	The neighbouring communities along the north shore are 
struggling with the problems that face single industry 
communities and areas. The problems that come with major 
shutdowns require a certain kind of response from federal, 
provincial and local governments.
<P>
	Those kinds of responses are different than what is required in 
other areas of the country like the Manitoulin and north shore 
areas of my riding where we have systemic unemployment and 
seasonal employment, or seasonal unemployment to look at the 
reverse.
<P>
	Tourism is wonderful but unfortunately until we can expand 
our tourism to all four seasons we will end up with seasonal 
employment. We have tended over the years to look at 
joblessness as one kind of problem. Past governments with all 
due respect have tried to deal with this on a piecemeal basis.
<P>
	I would like to pick out a few of the holes that have crept into 
the system. A few years ago in 1985 the previous government 
made changes to the Unemployment Insurance Act which 
changed the application of severance pay as it related to 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Severance pay was intended when it was first designed to 
allow laid off workers a bit of breathing space while they moved, 
retrained or made the necessary adjustments in their families to 
deal with being laid off.
<P>
	Lo and behold, about seven or eight years ago the previous 
government changed the definition or the application of 
severance pay so that it had to be used up as income. There in 
one fell swoop severance pay was changed from an insurance 
against loss of employment to simply another form of income 
that the government took advantage of.
<P>
	That was a tremendous problem for laid off workers in Elliot 
Lake and other parts of the riding of Algoma. There was a 
tremendous hue and cry. That is a major hole in the safety net 
that we have to deal with as part of our overall review.
<P>
	How many of us have met people who have been laid off from 
a certain type of industry and are being retrained in another field 
for which there is absolutely no prospect of employment. There 
are cases in which major industries have shut down in the 
community and we retrain people as welders. However, there is 
no chance of there ever being employment in any major way for 
welders in that community again.
<P>
	We really have to do a better job of matching the jobs aspect of 
our economy and the safety nets aspect of our economy. When 
we allow some people on UI to be retrained and others not to be 
retrained because some are in this part of the country or have 
faced a designated lay off, when we discriminate between one 
kind of unemployment and another, then we have problems.
<P>
	If one is not working, one is not working. It does not really 
matter in the long run how one became unemployed. We really 
have to be more fair to our workforce, to individual workers.

<P>
	The holes in our safety net often leave our seniors behind. 
How many poor seniors do we have in our economy? There are 
far too many people facing retirement with little prospect of any 
kind of comfort in their twilight years. We owe them much more 
than that, having really counted on them to build the country. We 
really owe them much more than pushing them off and leaving 
them to try to survive on limited incomes.
<P>
	Throughout the campaign last fall I met many young people. 
It hit me so graphically that unlike when I went to university 
back in the late sixties and early seventies, believe it or not, 
young people who are now looking at going to university or 
college in the next year or two may face a situation where they 
are competing for fewer seats. Our support programs have 
withdrawn seats from our post-secondary education 
institutions.
<P>
	When I think back to when I was in high school the fact is that 
I could enjoy high school. I could do a reasonable amount of 
homework and at the same time prepare for the future socially 
and scholastically. I look at these young people now and they are 
under so much pressure to get high marks to go to university that 
they are almost losing their teen years. When those years are 
gone, they are gone. The economy has deprived them of that.
<P>
	Our social safety nets have yet to respond to the big problem, 
the total problem. I do not believe the debate here is necessarily 
the place in which to put forward solutions, although many of us 
have. I have been quite impressed with the level of debate, but I 
point out that there must be a linkage between jobs and the 
safety net. We cannot divorce the two. We cannot discuss one in 
isolation from the other.
<P>
	As we look forward with some anticipation to great challenge, 
the most valuable attitude we can have toward our future 
planning is that of being creative. We must do some lateral 
thinking: think about things that perhaps we would not have 
thought about before, think about solutions that maybe we 
would not have considered five or ten years ago. Now we have to 
put everything on the table. We have to consider seriously, 
maybe for the first time in our history, where we are going.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks by suggesting to the House that 
the government was elected fundamentally on its ability to 
project hope. I suggest we can build on that hope by building on 
the people who make up the country. It is the people who have 
jobs. It is the people who fall into the safety net. That is the 
common denominator. We would not be here if it were not for 
the people.
<P>
	It boils down to some very simple points. I believe more 
members should take the opportunity to share their views and to 
share in rebuilding the country.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the 
speech made by the hon. member for Algoma and I join with him 
in praising the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra whose 
speeches are indeed impeccably thought-out and delivered.
<P>
	What I appreciated the most about the remarks made by the 
hon. member for Algoma was their great sincerity as well as the 
fact that they touched upon a great many of the real issues 
confronting us. However, there is a point on which I disagree 
and that is the three-step consultations that his party is 
proposing.
<P>
	I could introduce the hon. member for Algoma to a fair 
number of residents of my riding who do not need lengthy 
consultations to tell you what the real issues confronting us are. 
As we speak, there are 25,000 people waiting for training in 
Quebec, and I would imagine that the situation is the same 
elsewhere in Canada. As we know, if you do not have adequate 
training, you cannot find a job, so you are unemployed and then 
you get health problems and so on. You are locked into this 
vicious circle.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member for Algoma to tell my 
constituents, who are probably watching us at this time of day, 
and to those in Bloc Quebecois ridings throughout the province, 
in what way delaying these three-step consultations further will 
help solve the urgent problems facing these 25,000 young 
people waiting to be enroled in classes, which the SQDM would 
be prepared to arrange immediately but is unable to due to this 
government's inaction.
<P>
	I hope that my colleague from Algoma will be convincing 
because I, for one, find this situation extremely difficult.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Algoma has been 
invited to address the voters in the riding of the hon. member for 
Portneuf.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments and 
questions by the member for Portneuf, my good neighbour.
<P>
	Eight weeks is not very long. Ten years or twenty years is a 
long time, but eight weeks is not so long. The first stage of the 
consultations will be completed by the end of March. As part of 
the consultations I want to have some meetings in various areas 
of my riding of Algoma. I suppose I could advertise those right 
now while I have the opportunity. There will be more 
information on them in the local newspapers in the very near 
future.
<P>
	We want to hear from the unemployed in our communities. If 
we attempt to move forward without taking some serious time, 
even if it is only eight weeks at this stage, we will make a serious 
mistake. Over the last 10 years we saw some pretend consulting. 
I say to my good friend, the member for Portneuf, that the next 
<P>

<B><A NAME="845"> 845 </A></B>
<P>
eight weeks we will see a major step forward, what I call the  
scoping phase of the consultations. The member may choose to 
have consultations in his riding. I suspect he will, even if it 
means talking to individual members of his communities.
<P>
	In those eight weeks the standing committee will start its 
work. The minister and his task force will start their work. 
Individual members will start their work. The discussions with 
the territories and provinces will continue. By September we 
<P>
should have something on the table for Parliament to discuss, 
which is not such a long time. It is very important we take that 
time.
<P>
<B>	The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 8.52 p.m. the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 8.52 p.m.)
