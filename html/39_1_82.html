        <div><b><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78805,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78805&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise this morning to speak on the private member's bill before us. This is a bill of some social significance. Aimed at students, it ensures that they have access to financial assistance to pursue their studies. This is a long awaited bill. It is essentially updating the legislation by taking the regulations made under the previous bill to incorporate them into the act. This makes for something much stronger.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned that the bill had some social significance because, unfortunately, not everyone in our society can afford post-secondary education. I will cite the example of the aboriginal issue, which I have had the privilege of defending during my first seven years here in Parliament. I would sometimes visit reserves where children who completed high school were being told, “Sorry, but the band council has no money to pay for your post-secondary education”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time, I felt a pinch in my heart. To think that, in a country of abundant means and resources like Canada, young people were being told that they cannot continue school the following year. That was just unacceptable to me. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing is happening in society today. We know that the number of single-parent families, for example, is growing. As a result, single parents often not only have a hard time paying for what their children need, but also have to tell their children that they do not have enough money to pay for post-secondary education. This, too, is unacceptable. All young people who want to continue their education should be able to do so without worrying too much about debt, which is another problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in school, I had to take out student loans, which I subsequently repaid. Students today have a substantial debt load, and it is time we agreed that in Canada, no one should be penalized for pursuing post-secondary education. As well, it is always tempting for young people, early in life, to take a low-paying first job, which can delay post-secondary studies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, even though we have some reservations about this bill, on the whole we are satisfied with it. As for our reservations, you will not be surprised to learn that we feel that this bill encroaches on an area of provincial jurisdiction. However, clause 14 of the bill states that a province can opt out of the program with full compensation, and that suits us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the bill says that regular students can receive up to half of their tuition, to a maximum of $3,000. Students can also receive assistance for more than one year under the bill. Previously, assistance was available only for the first year of study. Now, it is understood that if students want to complete their post-secondary education, it might be important to help them until the end of their studies if their families cannot afford tuition. Up to $3,000 is granted for this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another important aspect to this bill: it helps students with disabilities. These may be young people who are blind or who have a mobility impairment. They will receive assistance, which is commendable. As I just said, assistance will be available not only for their first year of study, but for all years of their post-secondary education from now on. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the reserves I mentioned earlier, not only would this interfere with Quebec's jurisdiction, it would also fail to solve the fundamental problem from our point of view. We think that once the federal government corrects the fiscal imbalance, this kind of problem can be resolved in its entirety, rather than piecemeal. You are well aware of the fiscal imbalance. Members of Quebec's National Assembly, including the Liberal government, have also acknowledged it. It adds up to $3.9 billion. That is a lot of money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student associations are now asking the government to inject a billion dollars into education. If we correct the basic fiscal imbalance, we will not be forced to take a piecemeal approach every time, encroaching little by little on Quebec's jurisdiction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that he did not want to encroach on provincial jurisdiction. He also wants to fix this problem using transfers—by either correcting the fiscal imbalance or offering tax points or some other way. We have to fix this problem, but that is not what we are doing right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that Quebec's system is exemplary. I think we proved this in the case of the infamous millennium scholarships. Unlike the millennium scholarships, Quebec's system takes more than merit into consideration. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the exact correlation, but often, students who do very well in school had an easy childhood and wealthier parents—factors that helped them reach their academic potential. Now they are the ones getting the millennium scholarships. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec's program is more universal and based on need. If a single parent family is unable to cover the post-secondary tuition fees for a child, Quebec recognizes this and wants to help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I already said, I am grateful to the member who introduced this bill for realizing that this is a provincial jurisdiction and that there can be a transfer with compensation. I think this will be quite interesting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we must take into account that there is a growing number of single parent families. There is significant poverty among single parent families. The idea of helping young people who want to pursue their education has a lot of merit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I was talking about students with disabilities. A description of that clientele exists. Significant functional deficiencies include severe visual disability, severe hearing loss, a motor disability or an organic disability, which prevent the student from accomplishing daily activities easily and limit his or her ability to study or work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These students must not be left behind on the pretext that they do not have the necessary faculties or aptitude. I met some young people who are blind and who have great intellectual faculties. Just because a person is blind or deaf does not mean they should be cast aside. I think this is important. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not give these young people access to the system, we will come to realize in a few years time that they will always have difficulty. However, if we take care of them, we might find them contributing a great deal to society. Those are my thoughts on the matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by saying that a society's wealth is not in its forestry, mines, streams or natural resources. A society's greatest resource is its youth, the young pupils in our schools. We have to take care of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec has always kept tuition fees low. We are proud that our tuition fees are the lowest in Canada. Why are we proud? Because this allows more young people to register for and complete their studies. We help out these young people. A society's resource is its youth. The more our young people are educated, the further they will go and the better they will ensure that our society lives on.</div>

    </p><a name="Para285891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this bill does not address all of the problems in post-secondary education and is itself imperfect, I do support this bill. I believe it represents a more progressive and efficient approach to increasing access to post-secondary education by providing direct funds to students in need at the time when tuition is due.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my community in Toronto I have spoken with young people who have completely written off the possibility of attending post-secondary education. They believe it is only for the wealthy. Increasingly, I think, these young people are losing hope that they can better themselves and make a constructive contribution to society. That is a terrible tragedy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also speak to many other young people who have gone through post-secondary education but who are now living under an incredible, crushing debt. Some of them live with a debt of tens of thousands of dollars, which is the size of a mortgage for some people in some parts of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For young people trying to get a foothold in the workforce, starting out with that kind of debt is ridiculous, especially if they are living in a city like Toronto, with our housing prices. They simply cannot do it. I have young people coming to my office in tears because they are not able to meet the requirements for paying back their student debt. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pressing need not only for these young people, but for our society. Post-secondary education is a public good. It is a social good. If Canada is to remain a wealthy developed country in a 21st century economy, we need to attract the best and the brightest, not only the wealthiest, to proceed with their education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen huge cuts to education over the last several years. The Liberals, when they were in power, cut over $2 billion to post-secondary education in the 1990s and slowly added a convoluted patchwork of so-called student assistance programs, tax credits and savings schemes that disproportionately benefited high income families. The Conservatives have perpetuated this system with the textbook tax credit and by raising the student debt ceiling in the budget of 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that all Canadians have a lifelong right to learn. While post-secondary education is important for young people, it is also a public good, and it should be accessible and of high quality for all Canadians. As we see our economy changing and evolving, people no longer expect to be in the same job over a lifetime. As a society, our best adjustment programs recognize this. They help people to keep learning throughout their lives and therefore better equip themselves for different jobs down the road. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we have seen our education system, which had been relatively affordable, become one that is relatively unaffordable. It is interesting to speak to this right after my colleague from the Bloc, who described the system in Quebec. Not only does Quebec have the lowest tuition rates, it offers a universal assistance program for students. Over 70% of students identify financial barriers as the greatest reason not to pursue post-secondary education. Education has become less affordable and less accessible, more so than at any time in our history during this century, which I find astounding. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para285899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support the bill, I do have concerns. While assistance for the lowest income students is important, assistance for middle class students is also important. The amount being offered to low income students is insufficient when we take into account the true costs of post-secondary education. They still incur enormous debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for the program is based on income instead of need. Regardless of what kind of program a student is taking, the amount is not increased. As I mentioned earlier, it is important for Canadians to have access to lifelong learning and mature students are excluded. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program also excludes financially independent students. Even though they live on their own and are financially independent, their eligibility is linked to parental income. As the previous speaker indicated, they do not target students from rural and aboriginal backgrounds where there are particular challenges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the bill is a step in the right direction and deserves support. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this one bill cannot solve the problem. Canada's post-secondary education system needs an overhaul. An NDP government's first priority for post-secondary education would be to dramatically reduce student debt. We would ensure that tuition is no longer out of reach of even middle income Canadians and that debt levels are reduced. We would shift the focus of student aid to more non-repayable grants and ensure the grants are available when tuition is due. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP would ultimately enact a Canada post-secondary education act that would legislate stable, core funding from the federal government for post-secondary education and enshrine the principles of accessibility, quality, academic freedom and accountability of a public, not for profit post-secondary education system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, while I support the bill as a long overdue first step toward helping students and their families cope with high debt and rising tuition fees, the overall national need for a comprehensive approach to post-secondary education is greater now than ever. This is fundamentally what our country needs to address in the coming months.</div>

    </p><a name="Para285907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that the hon. member has family roots in Meadow Lake, a town in my riding celebrating its 70th anniversary this year and a town that is well-known for its community spirit and hospitality. The second reason is that the bill would create real opportunity and respond to challenges in Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the Canada access grants gives students from low income families and students with disabilities tremendous aid to meet Saskatchewan's emerging labour force gap.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saskatchewan is at an unique place right now. Many of our baby boomers are starting to retire. As a result, many jobs, ranging from teachers to nurses, to welders, need new people to come in and fill these positions. To respond to this gap, there is an emerging youthful population in northern Saskatchewan where much of the wealth-generating natural resources are. Thus, northern Saskatchewan represents, in many ways, an emerging new Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting Saskatchewan's labour gap and building this new Saskatchewan will require many strategies but, most important, we need to enable all young people, regardless of background, to have access to the best skills training and education Canada provides.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Canada access grants provide financial assistance to students from low income families and students with disabilities for their first year of study. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> would extend the availability of this grant to all four years of study. The bill would also give Canada access grants a statutory base that would make it difficult to end or change without parliamentary scrutiny, giving the grants program long term stability. The bill meets a need I saw time and again when I was a student, a teacher and now as a parent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I have watched, with immense pride, our oldest children go on to post-secondary education at the University of Saskatchewan. Their accomplishments were as a result of many years of dedication and hard work. Added to that pride is knowing that they are attending a school with the best college football team in Canada, the U of S Huskies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest challenge for all students is trying to meet numerous costs, like housing and food, while paying for tuition. I know people who simply could not make ends meet and had to drop out regardless of merit and ability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I graduated from the U of S, I became a teacher back home in Pelican Narrows. I had the opportunity to meet with some of the greatest emerging minds of Canada, my students, and to help them explore their potentials. However, I was far too often faced with the terrible sight of youth, regardless of obvious merit and tremendous ability, being denied the opportunity to go on to post-secondary only because of a lack of funds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over this last week I saw many of the new future leaders of Saskatchewan as I spoke and met with students across my riding. At Meadow Lakes Carpenter High School and Creighton Community School, I spoke with grade 12 students who asked tough questions and had insightful opinions that showed sharp, inquisitive minds and remarkable potential.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also met and spoke with NORTEP and SIIT students in La Ronge, students who are further along in their journey of learning. They will soon be assuming the leadership role they have worked so hard to achieve. I am very proud of all of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these students are on the cutting edge of Saskatchewan. They represent the new Saskatchewan. However, many challenges still must be addressed. Many communities face poverty, need improved roads or basic infrastructure. There also needs to be more investment into education at all levels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would help so many to contribute by taking away much of the burden of tuition and unmanageable debt. Students would l get the opportunity they need and I know many will take this opportunity and run with it for the rest of their lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also had the opportunity to meet with students from the northern adult education class in Green Lake. These students are making education a priority for their lives and their children's lives. This commitment and dedication is an inspiration. However, there is also a deep disappointment with the impact of the Conservative government cuts to literacy. There are feelings of deep betrayal and of being targeted for no good reason.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard of the disappointment from other groups as well. Community access programs and youth employment opportunities are threatened without the commitment of the Conservative government. Industry Canada officials also admit that there are no plans to continue first nations SchoolNet, a huge blow to learning at schools on many first nations reserves. The cuts and lack of commitment to educational tools have hurt northern Saskatchewan. We need to take advantage of all learning opportunities and build more of them.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before discussing the substance of this proposed legislation, I would like to reassure the member opposite that Canada's new government is committed to supporting access to post-secondary education. Moreover, I believe our government shares with the parties opposite a common recognition that education is the key to prosperity and advancement. As the philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, so eloquently pronounced:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural resources of Canada will be shaped by cultivation but our human capital, the future generations of leaders and visionaries, will be shaped by education. Through education, we will create the vibrant and dynamic workforce Canada requires to compete and, more important, succeed in a global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamentably, during the course of its 13 year tenure, the previous Liberal government's commitment to post-secondary education was questionable at best, negligent at worst. In the words of the member from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78821,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78821&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Kings—Hants</A>, currently a Liberal leadership aspirant, the former Liberal government systematically “slashed transfers to the provinces to such an extent that it created a tremendous vacuum in funding for universities throughout the country.The provinces were simply not able to maintain adequate funding to our post-secondary universities and community colleges across the country. As a result of the deficit that existed in the funding of post-secondary education, we saw, for instance, the doubling of the average amount of student debt after a four year program in Canada. We saw tuition doubling, not just in one province but all across the country”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government, on the other hand, has recognized the need to support the future well-being of Canadians through investments in post-secondary education along with increased individual support for apprenticeships and students. With respect to supporting apprenticeships, our new government has introduced new measures that provide both strong incentives for employers to hire new apprentices and to encourage many young Canadians to pursue apprenticeship training.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These incentives include: first, a new apprenticeship incentive grant which will provide grants to apprentices in the first two years; second, an apprenticeship job creation tax credit to encourage employers to hire new apprentices; and third, a new tools tax deduction to help tradespeople with cost of tools. These new measures will encourage new registrations in apprenticeship programs and support the successful completion of this training.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in budget 2006 we have demonstrated our commitment to assist students acquire an education. We have done so by offering substantial measures, such as the new textbook tax credit, expanded eligibility criteria for students seeking Canada student loans and exempting scholarship and bursary income from taxation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2006 also allocated $1 billion to the provinces and territories to support pressing investments in post-secondary education and infrastructure, such as libraries and laboratories. These measures were well received. As Claire Morris, president of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada stated, they underline Canada's new government's “commitment to promote a more competitive, more productive Canadian economy”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the measures announced in budget 2006, the Government of Canada provides nearly $15.5 billion to the Canada social transfer fund which provinces can allocate toward post-secondary education and social services. These include $1.7 billion to support post-secondary education research and $1.8 billion in grants and loans to enable students to access post-secondary education.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, our government also provides a wide range of tax measures and savings incentives to assist Canadians with their post-secondary education. These measures include the tuition tax credit and the education tax credit to help cover non-tuition costs of post-secondary education and the student loan interest credit. Also, the Canada learning bond and the Canada education savings program help hard-working families save for their children's post-secondary education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to stress that in cooperation with the provinces and territories we continually examine ways to improve supports for post-secondary students. In this context the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78764,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78764&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A> has been given a specific mandate to undertake discussions with the provincial and territorial governments to discuss the overall objectives for post-secondary education and training, appropriate roles, and ensuring appropriate accountability measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having provided the appropriate context for the balance of my remarks, I will now address the substance of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A>. Each year the Government of Canada makes significant investments in non-repayable assistance for students in need. This assistance includes, for example, grants specifically designed to help students with permanent disabilities, high need students with dependants, and students from low income families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Canada access grants for students from low income families are available to students enrolled in the first year of their first post-secondary program of study, provided this occurs within four years of their graduation from high school.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> proposes to enable students to receive the grants in any year of their first program of study, again providing they started that program within four years of completing high school.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that these grants were just recently introduced in August 2005. Accordingly, the Canada access grants for students from low income families have been in effect for only one single year. As a result some observers have noted that there is insufficient data available to confidently conclude what degree of impact this grant has had. Prior to extending this grant it would be beneficial to wait for more data to become available. This additional data would enable us to better analyze and predict the potential impacts of extending the grant to additional years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important consideration in the Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> debate is the reality that such a proposed change would necessitate extensive intergovernmental consultation with participating provinces and territories. Moreover, further analysis would also be required to determine the extent to which non-participating provinces might be eligible for increased alternative payments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to further point out that the second component of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A>, which proposes the repeal of the Canada access grants provisions in the Canada student financial assistance regulations and their incorporation in the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, would have significant consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that incorporating the Canada access grants directly into legislation would make it burdensome to adjust both the criteria and the amount of the grants should changes become necessary. The inclusion of the Canada access grants in the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act would mean that Parliament's approval would be required for any future enhancement of the Canada access grants for students from low income families and the Canada access grants for students with permanent disabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusting these grants through the regulations in which they are now included is a far more efficient and effective way to make required changes. Moreover, placing the Canada access grants in legislation would also create a discord of governing authorities over the various grants available through the Canada student loans program. While the Canada access grants would be governed by legislation, the grants available under the Canada student loans program would remain subject to change through regulatory amendments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the aforementioned reasons the House should objectively consider the manner in which Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> proposes to modify the Canada access grants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I conclude, I would like to again assure the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78801,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78801&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax West</A> that we share a common commitment to support access to post-secondary education.</div>

    </p><a name="Para285946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can tell, Mr. Speaker, for our caucus this is a very important issue, probably one of the most critical issues facing our country today as we look to the future and as we plan for a full employment economy in an era of new technologies and new ventures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is our obligation as members of Parliament to ensure that all of our young people have access to post-secondary education if they so choose. We know, from the lineups at community colleges and from the demands we are hearing at universities, that the young people of this nation are prepared to make a commitment to the future of this country, to do their best to further our values as Canadians, and to pursue the very best in all of us. However, they are facing huge difficulties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obstacles to post-secondary education are incredible. The cost for students in this day and age are enormous and many families are finding huge difficulties in creating those opportunities for their young people. As we know, many families will do anything to help their children pursue their life's dreams. We know that some families make this their top priority. They will mortgage their homes. They will go into debt. They will ensure that they scrimp and save on many things in order to be able to afford the ever increasing education costs and rising tuition that young people are faced with today. Anything we can do as a Parliament to ease the way to make it possible to access post-secondary education is absolutely imperative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this should be the number one issue for the federal Conservative government as it approaches both its economic update this Thursday and its budget in the spring or late winter. For years we have devoted time in the House to the urgent priority of health care. We set that aside as a number one issue. Canadians believe it is a number one issue and we have done a great deal. We may not have conquered that frontier yet, and there is still much more work to be done. However, we also know that it is imperative for us to invest now in education. It is imperative that we ensure that the government provides increased cash payments to provinces for education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal we have before us today is one small piece of a big puzzle, one small part of a solution, and one answer to a big problem facing students today, when we think about the fact that the cost of tuition for entering first year university is probably getting close to $5,000. In my day and age, when I went to university some 35 years ago, tuition was less than $1,000. It was probably about $500 a year and we were able to access very reasonable student loans and grants. Today, that is gone. Students have not got that same access to low tuition and they have not got the same access to decent loans and grants. We do not have a comprehensive universal program to ensure that all students, no matter what their income, are able to access post-secondary education. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a band-aid of programs. We have the millennium scholarship. We have the RESPs. We have the tax credit for text books. We have a little bit here and a little bit there, but not the universal program that we need. The bill before us is another piece that helps improve the overall situation and that is why we support it, but it is not sufficient. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140">(1140)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para285952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is truly required here is for the government to say that this is the number one challenge we face as a country. Let us ensure that our share of money going to the provinces gets back up to at least 25% on an annual basis. We know that we are now looking at single digit numbers. In fact, the federal share of education is below 10%. In other words, the vast majority of the cost for the system is coming out of provincial coffers and individuals, and that has to change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we truly believe in creating a bright future for this country, if we truly believe in developing a civil society, in being a leader around the world and being a star on the global horizon, then surely we have to make this our number one priority do everything we can to reverse the present trend. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw with the Liberals serious ongoing cuts to education over the last 13 years. We still have not recovered from 1995 when the Liberal government took a huge bite out of transfer payments, $6 billion altogether in terms of health, education and social assistance, the biggest bite out of social programs in the history of this country. We have not recovered from that point. We were not able to convince the Liberals in the past to restore cash payments and to put in place a formula that would ensure money growth according to population and according to GNP. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now at the crossroads, where the Liberals neglected to address this issue for over a decade and now the Conservatives have come with some more tinkering. The last year's budget change, a credit for textbooks, is a little bit of a help, but hardly a replacement for the serious erosion that occurred under the Liberals. We have two governments that have basically put education at the low end of the list of priorities for this country. We must raise that here and now in this Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill helps us to focus our attention on this issue, helps us to move a little closer toward a more complete system of assistance for students. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us be clear. Until the government makes this a priority, and until it actually decides to return to a system of serious partnership with the provinces, we are in deep trouble as a country. We will not be able to train and educate our young people to meet the challenges of the future. We will be lost on the global front because we failed to actually equip our students with both the specific tools of the new trades of the future and because we did not create a lifelong learning process where we understand and encourage the notion that education is about learning how to be good citizens, how to participate in a full, meaningful way and create the fundamental building blocks of civil society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge members to support this bill, but I urge them to do more than that, to go beyond this band-aid approach and to start putting pressure on the government. The government itself must start looking inward and make this our new frontier. Education is about who we are as a nation, how we treat our young people, and how prepared we are for the future.</div>

He has been a real champion on behalf of those in most need in our society. Who could be in more need than low income and disabled Canadians looking for an opportunity to improve themselves by getting post-secondary education so they can fully realize their aspirations and their abilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the government simply does not seem to get it. In fact, one of the Conservative speakers has said that having the lowest debt to GDP level in 24 years is bound to help all aspects of our economy, including children looking to obtain post-secondary education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the government is paying down debt, et cetera, but the rubber does not hit the road. The federal government needs to have programs that target them. We cannot only say that the economy is improving and, therefore, low income Canadians will have more income to pay for important activities of their children, such as post-secondary education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very disappointed with the government's attitude toward what it has done and how that supposedly will take care of the situation raised by the hon. member. I have looked at some of the issues members have raised. They talk about a text book tax credit, which is about an $80 value. The rest of the things, whether it has to do with an infrastructure trust or some of the other aspects, are global issues that will not target those who need the help the most. In fact, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> raises the fact that the Canada access grant is only available for the first year of study. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens after the first year? How do low income Canadian families and families with disabled children carry on? How do they finish what they have started? Nothing will change dramatically in the one year. This is the beauty of the bill. This good idea has been started, but we need to finish the job to make absolutely sure that those who embark on the challenge of post-secondary education have every opportunity to fully complete the program and to take their place as a contributing member of our workforce.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last Conservative speaker tended to suggest that it would somehow be a real burden for the government to change legislation. All of a sudden, instead of being a regulation, it now has to make changes to legislation. I do not think Canadians will accept the fact that somehow it is a burden to government to make some modest changes in order to implement important programs, where the changes will translate into assisting people who need our help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the newspaper today I read a piece about Preston Manning and Mike Harris. They have put out their next missile targeting Canadians yet again. They have said that government has to get out of funding provincial responsibilities. In other words, this is the Conservative brain trust saying to Canadians that the government should get out of this. This is the ideological difference here. The Conservatives want to get out of anything that has to do with provincial jurisdiction. It means not supporting the bill and getting rid of things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait until there are more attacks on the whole aspect of how we support Canadians in areas which have principally been provincial jurisdiction. It is like saying that health care delivery is the responsibility of the provinces so the federal government should not support it when it involves the delivery. However, federal governments have supported it because it is important. Many times prior governments have looked to providing capital funding for MRIs, CT scanners and special programs for wait times. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150">(1150)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para285967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the $42 billion deal with the provinces to provide the necessary funding so our health care system can establish wait times for critical areas. This was done because the federal government was playing a role in an area particularly to do with provincial jurisdiction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when it comes down to it, the measure of success of a country is not an economic measure. It is a measure of the health and well-being of its people. That means the federal government has a role to play, regardless of jurisdiction. There are ways to collaborate and to work with the provinces to ensure the objectives of all Canadians are met.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very disappointed to see that the Conservative brain trust decided that we had to get out of funding provincial responsibilities. The government itself has said that one of the big things it has done is transfer $15.5 billion to the provinces for post-secondary education. It did that because it was part of its ongoing responsibility. It was not a decision of the current government. In fact, this is under the transfer arrangements that the federal government has with the provinces with regard to health care, post-secondary education and established program financing. Those are ongoing responsibilities of the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will know that the provinces continue to put pressure on the federal government to continue to provide additional funding up to certain levels so they can deal with the growing demands on our health care system, post-secondary education and established program funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thought it was interesting that Mr. Harris and Mr. Manning said that the government should get out of funding welfare, that it had nothing to do with welfare. They want to get out of child care. Does this not paint a picture by two prominent Conservative persons, one a former premier and one a former leader of the official opposition for the then Reform Party or the Canadian Alliance Party? </div>
    </p><a name="Para285972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says that the federal government is getting out of supporting people. It is basically saying that they should fend for themselves, that it will not provide those programs. The line I heard was something to the effect that Canadians should no longer be dependent upon their government for things, that they should not be reliant on the government for anything, that they should take care of themselves, that they have to do their own thing. I cannot believe this is the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a knowledge based economy. We are an economy where the degree of education of a Canadian will be extremely important in terms of the success rate. I remember doing work some years ago on the economics and implications of a post-secondary education. In fact, in terms of unemployment rates, people with no post-secondary education had a 15% unemployment rate. Those who had some education had an unemployment rate of something like 10%. However, those who had a post-secondary education, whether it be university, community college, apprenticeship or skills training, had an unemployment rate of only 3%, much below the national average. In fact, a post-secondary education was the key determinant of whether someone would have a job. </div>

They are important to Canada. They are important for our future economic strength and well-being.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have said that they cannot afford post-secondary education. We want to eliminate that as an excuse. People should never say they cannot afford it. As a matter of fact, we have to say to people that they cannot afford not to get a post-secondary education. It is because of the unemployment rate, which I mentioned. It is also because of the spread in the income that persons can earn.</div>

The previous speaker said that we should wait for a little while to see what the reaction was to the first year of the proposal and then we could think about it and make a decision. It is a no-brainer. We should expand the bill to cover all four years of a post-secondary education.</div>

    </p><a name="Para285978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have heard during the debate, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A> asks us to endorse the extension of the Canada access grant for students from low income families from one year, as it is currently, to all years of a student's first program of study. In addition, it proposes we vote to repeal the Canadian student financial assistance regulations that apply to this grant and incorporate them into the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to reassure Canadians that the government is determined to find ways to support students from low income families in realizing their dreams of a post-secondary education. We want to enable these young people to obtain the skills and knowledge that post-secondary education can provide. We want all young Canadians, regardless of the incomes of their families, to have the opportunity to compete for the challenging and fulfilling careers of tomorrow. Access to post-secondary education will help them contribute their skills and knowledge and will make our national workforce stronger, more flexible and better positioned to compete in the global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as other members have pointed out in the debate, to extend the Canada access grant for students from low income families to cover all years of a student's first program of post-secondary study, while perhaps noble in intent, may be premature at this time. It should be noted that this has been only operating for little more than a year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is doing many things to help post-secondary education and to help access to it across our country. However, before extending this grant to all years of a student's post-secondary education, I believe it is essential that we consider Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A>'s proposals in the larger context of the support of Canada's new government for post-secondary education, which does include various forms of assistance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, we are providing $1.8 billion in grants and loans to help students access college or university. This is in addition to $15.5 billion that the government will provide this year through the Canada social transfer for provinces and territories to allocate for post-secondary education. We also have a wide range of tax measures, including the tuition tax credit and a tax credit for textbooks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is doing many things to help access to post-secondary education, but at this time we believe the proposal is a bit premature. Fundamentally, not only are Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2170256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2170256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-284</A>'s proposals not informed by hard evidence, but they would impose an unnecessary obstacle to the provision of effective and efficient support for Canada's students.</div>

I know that this is a matter of interest to many, and it should be a matter of interest to many, because if we are going to build a stronger, more prosperous society and a stronger economy in the future, we have to invest in education. We have to invest in young people who are trying to get an education, especially those from low income families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. Conservative colleague who just spoke said that the government is determined to find ways to help low income students access education. This is a perfect opportunity for the government to demonstrate that. We have seen very little evidence of it so far.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, in the budget there was the $80 tax credit for textbooks, which is not a heck of a lot when we consider what textbooks cost students every year. Moreover, it was a measure that students have to wait to benefit from until April or later, after they have filed their taxes. The fact is that students need assistance when they are starting in the fall and paying their tuition, not six or eight months later. That is a fundamental problem with the modest measure the government offered in the last budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities has been travelling and doing a study on employability. We have heard a lot across the country about the looming skills shortage. A shortage has already begun in many sectors in many parts of the country. We are seeing a looming need because of the fact that people who are in the baby boom age are heading toward retirement. More and more boomers are going to be retiring over the next 5 to 10 years or so, creating a lot of spaces for people in various sectors that will need highly skilled people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, not only do we need literacy training to build up the foundation for people, but we also need skills training and higher education. All of these are essential. We cannot leave anyone behind. </div>
    </p><a name="Para285989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of this bill is not to be the be-all and end-all, of course, or to solve all problems. It is to help one particular problem, that of helping low income students get access to and be able to afford post-secondary education, whether it is university or community college. That is absolutely vital. I think we have seen very little interest or action on this from the government side. I hope this will cause the government to reflect and will put pressure on the government to do more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the Speaker has ruled that this bill requires a royal recommendation, which is to say that it cannot become law unless the minister of the Crown actually gives it her endorsement. That is disappointing. So far we have not seen this endorsement from the government and I do not think that we are going to now, which suggests that the government is not interested in helping low income students in this very effective way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a program that already exists for first year students who have low incomes or disabilities. We have a vital need to make sure that both of these groups are included in the prosperity of our economy so that we utilize the skills and talents of these people. If we do not provide assistance to them and more assistance to education generally, particularly to universities and community colleges, then we are not going to be able to have all the people who have the talents to be in university and community colleges to be there. They will not be able to afford it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to do more to make it more affordable. I agree with the idea of the dedicated education transfer to the provinces, but I also think it is important that we have direct assistance for students, the kind of assistance that this program provides. It is, in fact, one part of the puzzle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78691,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78691&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parkdale—High Park</A> was concerned that the bill did not provide for middle income students. I agree with her wholeheartedly that there is a need to have measures to provide for middle income students. That is why in the election campaign we had in our platform the fifty-fifty plan, which would have paid for half the tuition for a student in the first and last years of an undergraduate program. I think that was a very good measure. It was not the be-all and end-all, but it was a very important start and it would have helped.</div>
    </p><a name="Para285994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programs like that are important, but I think that this program, the Canada access grant program, is one important program that helps low income students and students with disabilities get into university and it makes it more affordable for them. I think the bill deserves the support of all members of the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am rising to speak once again to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, the federal accountability act. I would like to say that it is a pleasure for me to rise again to speak to this bill, but I am very disappointed by the attempts of certain senators to dilute this piece of landmark legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government was elected on a plan for change. This government was elected because Canadian voters and Canadian taxpayers wanted change. Voters said they wanted an honest and accountable government, a government they could trust. They want to know that elected officials and public service employees act in the best interests of Canadians. I believe that this trust must be earned each and every day and it starts with making government more accountable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why our first legislative priority focused on making government more open, more honest and, most important, more accountable. The public was so suspicious of government as an institution that the then leader of the opposition made a commitment that this would be the first piece of legislation his new government would bring forward, so that there would be no excuses as to why it was not introduced and successfully passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 11, only nine weeks after this government officially took office, I was very pleased on behalf of Canadians and on behalf of the entire government caucus to introduce the federal accountability act in this House. The act and the accompanying federal accountability action plan, almost as important as the act, focus on making everyone in government more accountable, from the Prime Minister down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that our success as a nation depends on instituting a more effective capability to get things done better for ordinary working Canadians and their families. By instituting an unprecedented level of rigour and scrutiny across the federal public sector, the federal accountability act provides a firm foundation for rebuilding Canadians' trust in government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell the House that in drafting this legislation we paid careful attention to a couple of very important factors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we did not want to establish more red tape, more bureaucracy or a significant increase in the number of rules. Most of the new entities created in our bill replace or strengthen the independence of existing ones. Where there are new rules, we have endeavoured to make them simpler, more straightforward and more effective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we did not want to build a government that stifled innovation and created within the public service a culture that is overly risk averse. We wanted to balance more effective oversight with flexibility. This is incredibly important if we want a dynamic public service for the next generation and the next century. We want to have the best and the brightest in the public service, recognizing that whenever people of good faith act, there will be mistakes from time to time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, this government listened to many stakeholders. We received contributions from all parties in the House. I believe that made this piece of legislation stronger. Members of the House of Commons worked to pass the federal accountability act in 72 days. They thoroughly reviewed and analyzed hundreds of separate clauses and amendments. They put in well over 90 hours of work in six weeks, above and beyond their regular duties, to make sure they got it right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78377,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78377&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Nepean—Carleton</A> in that committee.

    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para286084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the former hon. member for Repentigny, Benoît Sauvageau, who worked very hard. As a new member and new minister, it was definitely a great pleasure for me to work with Mr. Sauvageau. His efforts, hard work and friendship were well known to all members. Above all, I would like to underscore here in this House just how important his work was, enabling us to introduce this bill within the first 72 days of this 39th Parliament.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para286085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benoît Sauvageau will be greatly missed, not just within the Bloc Québécois caucus and his own constituency of Repentigny, but by those of us on all sides of the House. Many Canadians watch Parliament, not least of which my performance, and they see a very adversarial system from time to time. What they do not see is quite often members from different parties are able to work together. The late member for Repentigny's work is the best example of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that we did a good job in the House of Commons. The committee did a good job. The government did not get everything it wanted, but the bill came out of the special committee stronger than it went in. I firmly believe that this House did its work. I do note that not a single member of Parliament in the House of Commons wanted to go on record as opposing this bill. I do recall that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Quadra</A> said in his first two minutes of speaking that he supported the bill, as did the member from the Bloc Québécois, and of course the New Democratic Party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from a few typos and ambiguities in wording, the bill as sent to the Senate was effective, comprehensive and carefully focused. Unfortunately, the majority of the more than 100 amendments proposed by the Senate have drastically diluted the objectives of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>'s wide portfolio of initiatives. I have grave concerns that most of the amendments passed by the Senate, if left in place, would do irreparable damage to the overall intent and effectiveness of the federal accountability act. These include the most egregious examples of amendments, including increasing the political donation limit from $1,000 to $2,000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to end the role of big money in politics. One thing we can say about Mr. Chrétien and the Liberal government he led is that they did a lot in this regard. We are finishing the Chrétien work and making it even more modest to ensure that it is middle class Canadians, and not the interests of a few high powered financial contributors, who have a bigger voice in politics. This was a welcome change of which I think all members took great note.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate also proposed amendments to delay the implementation of the new political financing laws until as late as 2008. That is too late. These measures should be put in place in very short order so that Canadians can have the benefit of this new regime. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had discussions with members of the official opposition and we made what I think is a reasonable and honourable compromise to have these new limitations come into effect on January 1 so it would not affect the current Liberal leadership convention. This was also an issue which was spoken to by the Bloc Québécois and others. In the spirit of working together, in the spirit of cooperation, something, Mr. Speaker, which you know I bring to this House each and every day, we agreed to consider a change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to political staffers jumping the queue and getting priority placement over other applicants for public service jobs, the Senate wants to allow partisan political aides to get into our non-partisan public service. This is something that has deeply troubled public servants in the nation's capital for many years, where they want to compete for a job but the competition is cancelled and a political appointee gets the job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we believe in the merit principle, there should be competition, and that is what we are seeking to do. This is an issue which was brought to my attention even before the election by the Public Service Alliance of Canada representatives, and it is certainly one which I support. Political aides, whether they be Liberal, Conservative or what have you, have a great deal of experience, but they should have to compete like everybody else for a job in the public service.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I had was the removal of the Canadian Wheat Board from inclusion under the Access to Information Act. We want to bring light where there is darkness. We believe that wheat and barley producers in western Canada should have the right to know what is going on at their Wheat Board. That is important. I was terribly distressed to see the unelected Liberal Senate try for the very first time to remove an agency from coverage under the Access to Information Act. Some people said we were not going far enough but then wanted to retreat. I say to the Canadian Wheat Board and its supporters, what have they got to hide? Let us bring more openness to the Canadian Wheat Board.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding exemptions for foundations under the Access to Information Act caused all of us a great deal of concern. It is no exaggeration to say that many of the Senate's amendments would place an unfair burden on the private sector, would shackle managers in the public service and would stifle innovation. This is especially true with the Senate's amendments to the sections dealing with whistleblowing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistleblowing is important to me. It is important to the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78377,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78377&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Nepean—Carleton</A>, and I know it is important for all members. For my constituents in Ottawa West--Nepean this was an issue in the recent election. We want our public servants to be confident that they can step forward and follow a simple process to report wrongdoing without concern that they could lose their jobs and not be able to provide for their families. This is a change in culture that we want to take within the public service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect the measures contained in the federal accountability act go further than measures in any other western democracy with respect to protecting whistleblowers. I am very proud of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House presented a balanced piece of legislation to the Senate and we are now faced with the task of having to restore that balance. This is especially dismaying given that the government demonstrated its willingness to work with the Senate to achieve a strong consensus. We agreed to a number of amendments to the bill, some before it ever reached the Senate, and others subsequently during the clause by clause deliberations in the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I should underline the great work done by the chair of that committee, Senator Don Oliver. He is an exceptional Canadian and he did an excellent job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this spirit of cooperation was either misunderstood or simply ignored by some hon. senators. That leaves the members of the elected House of Commons facing a major challenge. We must rebuild this legislation. We must strengthen it. We must restore the measures for increasing the accountability that Canadians want and deserve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look at each of the Senate's proposed amendments on a case by case basis. We will judge each one on its merits. Some are acceptable, but the government cannot support them all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very eager, as are my constituents in Ottawa West--Nepean, as I believe are Canadians in general, that the bill be implemented quickly, but we will not compromise our commitment to deliver more accountable government simply for the sake of expedience. In fact, let us be clear. The Senate, in proposing a host of counterproductive amendments, has unnecessarily delayed passage of the bill. Canadians will see this for what it is and I believe they will ultimately hold those responsible to account.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal accountability act and our federal accountability action plan as passed by the House focused on fixing problems. They focused on rewarding merit. They focused on achieving value for money and on being more honest and building a more effective government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 16 I noted in the House that if this Parliament could do one single thing, it would be to end the culture of entitlement and replace it with a culture of accountability. This government remains absolutely committed to achieving that crucial objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge members of the House to help us meet this challenge by demonstrating the same spirit of cooperation they so wisely adopted four short months ago. Together we can ensure that the federal accountability act serves the purpose it was designed for: to provide a government based on openness and honesty which reflects the very best that Canada has to offer. </div>

The minister is aware that the parties agreed not to have a vote. In fact, it was deemed to have been voted on and supported by all parties, but there still were concerns. The concerns were with regard to the haste at which the bill was put together. My issue is not so much there other than to make the point that about a third of the amendments that were proposed to the bill by the Senate were by Conservative senators. That is proof positive that there were some flaws in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question has to do with the whistleblower act which was given royal assent last November in the last Parliament. It was a Liberal bill. It had the support of all parties; it passed unanimously in this place. It was going to create a new officer of Parliament. It was going to provide protection for whistleblowers, public servants who came forward to identify, as the minister quite rightly pointed out, wrongdoings by departmental officials and the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is that the government still has not proclaimed that act. It has been a year now and it is not an act of law in Canada today because the government has not taken the opportunity to put it into place so that public servants could go to a new officer of Parliament and outline their concerns about the waste and mismanagement of the government.</div>

Its schedule was very intensive, as the minister proudly pointed out. In six weeks' time, there were 72 days of meetings, totaling 890 hours. It was much too fast. The witnesses were paraded through at a dizzying pace and we did not even have the time to get to the bottom of our questions or explore all their comments. People were rushed through in groups. For example, there were people from the executive offices of all political parties, all sitting at the same table at one time.

    </p><a name="Para286125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, every stakeholder group opposed the previous Liberal bill on whistleblower protection. There was no support among whistleblowers and virtually no support among public sector unions. There was strong opposition from PSAC. Every whistleblower who came before the committee opposed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1395901,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1395901&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite to the contrary, the Conservative accountability act provides for two years of jail time for anyone who punishes or bullies a whistleblower. The bill would create a tribunal of judges who would be capable of ordering the restoration of a whistleblower's career and even provide back pay and consequences to those who abuse whistleblowers. All of that would be managed by an independent tribunal of judges, not by bureaucratic or political leaders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it would remove the two cover-up clauses that the Liberals had put into the last whistleblower protection bill, the clauses that would have allowed information related to a whistleblower disclosure to be hidden for up to five years. We have eliminated that and the other cover-up clause.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, this Conservative minority government—and I emphasize the word “minority”—is trying to use the House of Commons for partisan purposes. Once again, Conservative partisanship has prevailed over the common good and the interests of all Canadians. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we clearly see why the minority government wanted to rush the bill through the House, the committee, then on to the Senate and through its committee. The Conservatives thought no one would see how partisan and biased it actually is in certain respects. The more time we spend on the bill, the more flaws and loopholes we find. That is why there was such a dépêche, quite a rush to get the bill out from the spotlight and the microscope of the committees, which did good work, and to the final passage of the bill in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it, therefore, as quite ironic in that the Conservatives' campaigned on the promise of cleaning up government and to play by the rules and how today they are trying to tweak the law to sneak in some self-serving loopholes on political donations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this after an Elections Canada investigation targeted the Conservative Party, following a statement by the President of the Treasury Board to the effect that his party had forgotten to declare costs of some $2 million relating to its March 2005 convention.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para286143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of the hearings, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> admitted, particularly in the case at the Senate level, that the Conservatives forgot to declare convention fees as political donations for their convention of March 2005.

    </p><a name="Para286144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we will see, as the theme of the response to the speech by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A>, that it was really all about cover-up and legitimizing something that is quite possibly illegal.

    </p><a name="Para286145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, I am not the only one saying this. The people of Canada should know that the Chief Electoral Officer, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, repudiated the Conservatives' excuses and ruled that the party violated the rules.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the convention attendance fees, les frais d'inscription pour les congrès de partis politiques, the fees paid by every party member attending a convention, in addition to the colouring of those as non-political donations, erroneously and quite possibly illegally, the Conservative Party had the temerity and gall in practice to allow corporate observers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of footnote, we must remember that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',654227,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=654227&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>, the very fine Liberal bill brought in under the Chrétien government, made it law that corporate and union donations would not be acceptable.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this government is unable to move from talk to action. On the one hand, it boasts about being a champion for transparency, but on the other hand it finds it normal not to have declared costs of close to $2 million relating to its March 2005 convention. Today, the Conservatives want to use Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> to correct their own mistakes of the past.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accountability, however, is not a bendable concept that can be adjusted to fit partisan objectives and past illegalities. Contrary to what the Conservatives may think, the Liberals believe accountability should apply to all parties all the time, not only when it is convenient to do so or in their case, when they get caught.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> is necessary because there is more than just the passing illegality and cover up, Watergate-like as it is, by the government with respect to political donations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some accomplishments at the legislative committee with respect to making deputy ministers more accountable to Parliament. This is a good thing, with a tighter lobbyist regime. At first the Conservatives did not want people who were past workers for them in opposition to be able to ratchet up the ladder of influence when the government changed, but there was much debate on that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some discussion of the access to information program and Access to Information Act pertaining to some of the agencies, boards and commissions which it can be argued is good and bad depending on the commission, agency and board. Time does not permit, unlimited as it is, for me to get into all of the agencies, boards and commissions involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bears saying there were also some Liberal accomplishments. The Liberal members, at committee, following on the advice of the legal counsel to this Parliament protected an 1868 constitutional privilege which in their haste the Conservatives tried to roughshod through the House. The Liberal opposition members removed the aspect of the secret ballot and most importantly, despite the words of the minority government, saved aboriginal first nations communities from the overreach of audit principles to be imposed by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there were some significant missed opportunities in not properly debating, in the haste that was the aura of both committees frankly, many amendments that were brought forward by all parties with respect to some very key elements which might have made the bill stronger. There was a proposal to eliminate donations from people under 18 years of age. This was ironically proposed and was ironically defeated by the Conservative majority on the committee with the help of the New Democratic Party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might also be said that in the haste to put the Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> legislative committee together there were no opinions from constitutional scholars. There was neither the time nor the inclination of the leading constitutional scholars to give evidence at those committees. One wonders if we had the sage advice, for instance, of Donald Savoie and his thoughts regarding the freeze in public sector and lobbying industries with respect to how government should work, how much different a bill we might have.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the Conservatives campaigned on six key words. We often think they only had five principles, but they are much more imaginative than we give them credit for. They actually used six words in their platform. They used: accountability, opportunity, security, family, community and unity, and those are good words. Now let us take a minute to analyze what the government has done since it came into power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day the Conservatives announced over $13 billion in surplus, thanks to good Liberal management, they cut funding to some of the most important community programs in the country, including: literacy, aboriginal programs, minority groups support and women's equality issues. This is their vision for community presumably from their election campaign. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cut many youth programs that aimed at promoting exchanges between young Canadians of different regions such as the summer work student exchange program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Prime Minister publicly accused many Liberals of being anti-Israel. This is presumably their vision of promoting unity, a further campaign promise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservatives decided in favour of sending a $100 monthly cheque per child to Canadian families, a sum not good enough to pay for quality day care services and child care services, especially when this measure is taxable, while creating no new child care spaces whatsoever. This must be their concept of family as enunciated in their campaign strategy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for security, another key word, the Conservative minority government decided to bring forward a very American “three strikes, you're out” law with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397807,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397807&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-27</A>. The concept of innocence until proven guilty is out the door. This must be the Conservative vision of justice. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245">(1245)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the theme of accountability which is dealt by this bill. In light of what the Conservatives are proposing to do with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, it is clear they believe that accountability should mostly be a tool to help clean their own past mistakes, especially the $2 million in convention registration fees that have not been disclosed, that are the subject of complaints officially filed with Elections Canada, and the untotalled amounts of corporate observer fees given by corporations who were, by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',654227,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=654227&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>, outside the scope and allowability of political contributions before this act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have large sums of money that have not been accounted for, so how is it that this government can stand on this bill with respect to political contributions and say that it is truly an accountability act? It cannot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last word in the Conservative's campaign was opportunity. Once again, what the Conservative minority government is trying to do with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> is to create a partisan loophole, weakening the access to information laws, and watering down the federal accountability act. Opportunity is probably the word that currently best describes the government's principles and modus operandi. More specifically, it is highly opportunistic and partisan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the government should truly stand up for Canada as it promised to do. It promised to adopt the recommendation of the Information Commissioner's report on access to information. It has already had two chances and yet it continues to break this promise. If the government truly wants more transparency and more accountability, it needs to leave partisanship behind and support these amendments. This is what true accountability is all about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to underline that we have supported in many instances this bill and its thrust, but it is important to underline that the concept of the bill is nothing new. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9027,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9027&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>, as the hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> has already said, was a very good step.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit with which the Liberal government brought in Bill<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',654227,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=654227&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> C-24</A> and with which it promised to implement the recommendations of Justice Gomery's report, we moved forward with the deliberations on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> and are happy in the further vein to propose these amendments.

The Liberals have complained that the Conservative Party decided not to charge taxpayers for the cost of its convention. Let us be clear on what this accusation entails.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party could have considered all of the convention fees that came from its last convention as political contributions and issued tax rebates or return funds to the original donor. That would have benefited the Conservative Party dramatically. It would have been in the Conservative Party's financial interest to go about its affairs in that way because it would have cost taxpayers to subsidize the convention and not just the donation amount above and beyond the costs of the convention, but the entire convention delegate fee would have been subject to a tax credit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he is right in one sense, that it would have provided a significant financial benefit to the Conservative Party for it to have considered those delegate fees to be donations. However, our party does not believe that taxpayers should fund our operations at a political convention. Therefore, we made the principled decision to forgo the tax credit that goes along with the donation. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, does it another way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he is in fact right, is he going to recommend to Revenue Canada that it provide tax credits to all those people who attended the convention? How much would it cost the Canadian taxpayer if all those convention delegate fees were then turned into donations and taxpayers were forced to pay out a rebate? </div>

I do not think that is the way it works. In fact, that is not what we heard by way of blathering hyperbole from the hon. member during the hearings on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me remind the member that there is a law called the Canada Elections Act. There is a section in that act, if the member wishes to write it down for future reference he might be more suited to speak on the subject next time with more information, and that section is 404.(1) of the Canada Elections Act. That is the section that declares or sets out what a financial contribution for which tax receipts would be issued. We have Mr. Jean-Pierre Kingsley saying that the convention fees are political donations and they must be declared as such under section 404.(1). </div>
    </p><a name="Para286201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, at least the way I see it, and it does not matter the way I see it I suppose but the way more importantly Jean-Pierre Kingsley sees it, a violation of the Canada Elections Act. What this amendment brought on by the Conservatives attempts to do is to codify their illegality, to slip it through under the white knight of accountability in general, when it is in fact an anathema to the whole principle of accountability and the fact that all laws should grace legal actions, they should not condone illegal actions. It is a fundamental principle that laws cannot condone illegal activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my friend asks the question the wrong way. His answer, however, is simply this: section 404.(1) exists, the Conservative Party broke that law, and now it is attempting to cover that up.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to come back to something he said about the haste with which the committee worked on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> and, later, the comprehensive work of the Senate. Let us recall that, indeed, our work at committee was performed at breakneck speed. We had far too many hours of sitting each day when the committee heard witnesses. Witnesses showed up very well prepared, with submissions 30 or so pages long. Because we had heard three testimonies before and had four more scheduled that day, we did not have any time to read these submissions or even take a glance at them. We had to make do with the two minutes witnesses were allotted for their presentations and the minute we had left for putting questions to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the minister indicated earlier, the committee was very proud of how quick it had been, 92 hours and seven weeks. He was pleased to see all this work be done only nine weeks after the federal election. It did not produce good work. We complained at the time about having to work too fast and not having enough time to consider, analyse and read documents. It made no sense. It is true, however, that another group took over, which took the time to study the bill and, what is most important, which took the time to reflect between reading submissions and hearing witnesses. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not have much time. I would like to mention two extremely important things that happened during the committee proceedings. First, during the testimony of Mr. Donison of the Conservative Party, we learned that the Conservative Party had forgotten to declare the registration fees for the convention it held in April 2005, if I remember correctly. Second, during the Senate committee hearings, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> said that these fees amounted to over $1.7 million. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two examples show that the work of both committees on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> was effective and important, despite the fact that both committee members and witnesses were rushed through the process.

    </p><a name="Para286216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin, I would say that the Bloc Québécois will support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. While the bill is not perfect, it introduces measures that will increase government accountability and transparency. This bill lays the foundation for introducing a culture of openness as opposed to a culture of secrecy, which we have seen before; a culture of accountability as opposed to a style of management with no regard for the values of the public good. From that point of view, the Bloc Québécois is very happy that this bill paves the way for solutions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, especially because it introduces, in the form of a law, a code of ethics for ministers. In addition, the bill puts an end to the favouritism that enables political staff in ministers’ offices to enter the public service ahead of qualified public servants—which we have unfortunately seen in the past. </div>

This bill significantly reduces the influence of money in election campaigns, nomination meetings and leadership campaigns. In addition, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> establishes the position of Director of Public Prosecutions, thereby reinforcing the independence of the judiciary.

    </p><a name="Para286219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois especially supports this bill because many of its traditional demands have been incorporated into Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, in particular, the appointment of returning officers by Elections Canada on the basis of merit. </div>

As a result, corporate donations will be forbidden and individual contributions will be limited to a much more reasonable level. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be seeing the powers of the Auditor General strengthened, as I said earlier: she will now be able to follow the money to its end recipients. As well, unlike what was in the initial bill brought forward by the government, rewards for whistleblowers have been eliminated. We argued—and we still argue—that a measure like that would have resulted in an unhealthy culture of informing being created in the public service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc had also asked for something else: that the Ethics Commissioner, rather than a minister, have the power to exempt political staff from the act, particularly in the case of students, junior employees or part-time workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also very pleased that a requirement has been incorporated in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> for the Conflict of Interest Act to be reviewed in five years. At that time, members of Parliament will have an opportunity to consider the effects of the act. In our opinion, that exercise will tell us that the Conflict of Interest Act has no teeth and no power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also, and most importantly, the request made by my former colleague from Repentigny: that the word “imputabilité” be replaced by the word “responsabilité”, so that the title of the act is now written in correct French.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois supports the government’s motion concerning the amendments proposed by the Senate. It supports the government’s adoption of a number of Senate amendments that promote ethics and transparency, and in particular the improvement of access by the Parliamentary Budget Officer to government financial and economic information, by replacing “access at all convenient times” with “access”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well, it strengthens the Access to Information Act by allowing the National Arts Centre Corporation to protect the identity of patrons who insist on anonymity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also have more transparency in relation to exemptions granted to the Ethics Commissioner, who must now publish the exemptions he grants. That is amendment 16. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment 95 is in response to a criticism by the President of the Public Service Commission, who was afraid that clause 106 of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> would allow ministers to appoint special and political advisers to the public service. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois also supports the government’s rejection of a number of Senate amendments that do not promote ethics and transparency. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some senators would like to keep their own Senate adviser and a puppet adviser under the authority of Senate committees. A number of Senate amendments would have operated to reduce the time the Ethics Commissioner and the Commissioner of Elections have to prosecute offenders. That is amendment 89. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Senate amendment introduced a grandfather clause that would allow political staff to continue to join the ranks of the public service for another year, with priority over other applicants, and this is contrary to a measure like the one we have just supported. Some amendments proposed by the Senate operated to exclude certain public bodies from the Access to Information Act. Here again, we will have to speak to those amendments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said earlier, this is not a perfect act and we regret that the government is rejecting several Senate amendments that were valid in the eyes of the Bloc Québécois. By amending Senate amendment 67, in our opinion, the government is trying to exempt certain political contributions from the scope of the political party financing legislation. The government is rejecting several Senate amendments designed to provide better whistleblower protection. The Senate suggested broadening the definition of “reprisals” in order to include “any other measure that may directly or indirectly harm a public servant”, which to our mind was much better. The Senate suggested increasing the time limit for filing a reprisal complaint from 60 days to one year. The Senate also suggested eliminating the $10,000 ceiling on awards for pain and suffering. The Senate suggested increasing the maximum for legal advice reimbursements from $1,500 to $25,000, or not setting any ceiling, at the commissioner’s discretion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment 119, which adds an interpretation clause, would authorize the communication, for reasons of public interest, of any banned document. This would be a very significant improvement to the Access to Information Act, in particular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is amendment 85, designed to solve the problem of consultants who are retained by certain departments to provide them with assistance in developing policies and who then lobby the same public servants on behalf of private clients. There is an ethical issue here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment 90 gave more clout to the lobbying commissioner. Under this amendment, the commissioner can prohibit lobbyists from lobbying for two years if they do not comply with the law. If a lobbyist failed to comply with the lobbying prohibition, he would be subject to a $50,000 fine.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois also condemns the fact that the government is trying to exclude from the political financing legislation the contributions made by supporters during conventions. It also condemns the fact that the Conservative Party did not keep its campaign promise to subject all crown corporations and foundations to the Access to Information Act. This is no longer in the bill. It is also disgraceful that the government refused to increase penalties for people who violate the ethics legislation. Another negative aspect is the fact that the new parliamentary budget officer is attached to the Library of Parliament.</div>

I was saying that several elements are far from perfect, particularly with regard to access to information. The legislation was adopted in 1983 and has remained virtually unchanged since then.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all the work done over a period of 20 years, the various governments in office have always put their foot on the brake pedal when it came to modernizing the Access to Information Act, and it is going to be interesting to understand why.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that it is important for us also that the Canadian Wheat Board be subject to the Access to Information Act. In addition, I believe the whole question of the ethics commissioner is extremely important. This is a crucial issue: we must restore the original proposal, which is to have a single ethics commissioner. </div>

    </p><a name="Para286269"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also know that your former colleague from Repentigny, Benoît Sauvageau, and your deputy House leader, whose constituency name I cannot remember, and I worked almost as a team on several sections of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> C-2</A>.

Does the Bloc Québécois still believe that this foundation should have that protection? </div>

    </p><a name="Para286277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by laying the foundation of the remarks that I hope to make. I firmly believe that if we did nothing else in this 39th Parliament other than to pass the federal accountability act and give meaning and substance to the clichés of transparency and accountability, we would at least be able to say that we spent our time well and we would have something to show the Canadian people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start my remarks with that note because I can say without any fear of contradiction that the federal accountability act is in a very fragile state as we speak. We run the risk, and I believe due to political mischief, of losing the federal accountability act, this great project that we undertook many months ago. At that time we cautioned that if we did not move swiftly, with a collective will and with some cooperation, a project of this magnitude is fraught with pitfalls and could easily collapse under its own weight or fall vulnerable to political influence and political mischief that have nothing to do with making the nation-state of Canada more transparent or the system accountable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate will become very complex as we debate 154 amendments from the Senate. A comprehensive amendment from the Liberal Party has just been moved, as has a comprehensive subamendment from the Bloc Québécois. Let us bring this back to basics. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we started back in April with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, the federal accountability act, would have given us for the first time ever comprehensive whistleblower protection. That alone I would have voted for in Bill C-2, just to be able to have done that one thing in this 39th Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public appointments commission, the PAC, alone would put an end to patronage. Imagine, on behalf of the people of Canada, putting an end to pork-barrel patronage in the 39th Parliament. We could tell our grandchildren that we did something in this Parliament if we could deliver on that one chapter of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> alone. It would be spectacular. It would be sensational. Those things are at risk as we speak.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary budget officer, the director of public prosecutions, all of these worthy initiatives that are not very controversial and have broad support from all the political parties, are now vulnerable. They could crash and burn as we bicker and toss back and forth between the Senate chamber and the House of Commons amendments on the most minuscule, trivial, virtually meaningless things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us strip it down to basics. The one thing that is holding up the bill right now is whether or not a single ethics commissioner would administer the two codes of conflict of interest for this chamber and the Senate or if there would be multiple ethics commissioners. We are debating how many ethics commissioners can dance on the head of a pin. That is really what the whole thing boils down to. All of these wonderful initiatives will fall by the wayside if we cannot agree to something that silly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the senators tell it, it would be a constitutional crisis if there were two ethics commissioners. Constitutional crisis is a phrase that is tossed around in modern day Canada, saying constitutional crisis is the last refuge of a scoundrel in Canadian terms. It is a smokescreen to stall and delay the important reforms that Canadians expect, Canadians demand and which Canadians sent us here to put into place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People tuning in or trying to weave their way through this quagmire that is the federal accountability act and all the amendments, subamendments and compounding amendments, should just remember that we are trying to implement whistleblower protection. We are trying to implement a public appointments commission so we cannot make political patronage appointments to unqualified nephews, et cetera. We are trying to put in a parliamentary budget officer, and we are hung up on things like how many ethics commissioners shall administer our codes of conduct. It is so petty that a lot of people would not believe that we could be tripped up so readily, to have such a noble pursuit held up, intercepted and sabotaged by such trivial arguments. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very proud of the role that the New Democratic Party has played in trying to make sure that at least the key elements of this bill are salvaged and come to possible fruition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should pay tribute to the contribution of my former colleague, the former leader of the New Democratic Party and member for Ottawa Centre, Mr. Ed Broadbent. In the 38th Parliament it was Ed Broadbent, in coming back to the House of Commons after many years of doing other work, who recognized there were enormous gaps and lapses in the ethical standards and conduct of the Parliament that he left those many years ago. He put in place a seven point ethics package. A great deal of the elements from Ed Broadbent's recommended package of reform for this House of Commons found its way into Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a natural match. For those who may think it is strange bedfellows to see the NDP in support of an ethics package put forward by the Conservative government, we did not find it to be contradictory at all. Nobody has a monopoly on ethical standards. We were pleased to see some of the things that were suggested and recommended by Ed Broadbent in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, so we could say that we would support it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly think sometimes that we in the NDP over here in this corner are wearing blue helmets, like peacekeepers, in this initiative. We are the honest brokers in this. There is politics being played over there. There is politics being played over there, and yes, there is politics being played by the federal government in trying to achieve secondary objectives with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. We in fact have a sincere and genuine interest in trying to fix the things that are broken so that we can be proud when we go home and tell our people what we did for them when they sent us to Ottawa.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear. The power to kill Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> rests totally with the backrooms of the Liberal Party as we speak. It is the Liberal Senate that has been holding this bill up unreasonably. I heard comments from my colleagues. Maybe they did not notice but the Senate had this bill for months and months. It heard the same witnesses that we heard, asked the same questions that we asked, endless and needless hours of study that we believe was designed to stall this bill until the Liberal convention was finished. They were hung up on how the election financing changes would impact the Liberal leadership convention. They pretty much served notice that they were going to sabotage and undermine the bill when it was introduced in April, at least until it got past that hurdle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking them now to stop their delay and stalling tactics. They got away with it. They managed to delay implementation of the bill until their convention is over. The implementation date is January 1, 2007. They should stand down on that issue because the undemocratic and unelected Senate did not just amend the federal accountability act, it took it hostage. Today we are debating the outrageous ransom demands that still threaten to kill Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> unless we give in. Well, we have given in on a great deal, incidental issues that simply do not weigh enough to justify blocking the passage of the whole bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are saying that it was the rudderless Liberal Party that allowed those rogue senators to run amok, as it were. It would be interesting if some of the Liberal leadership hopefuls would show some leadership and maybe intervene at this point and rein in their rogue senators, those senators who have blocked this bill and still threaten to kill it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not kid ourselves. If we send this bill back to the Senate again and the senators still do not like it--let us say it still calls for separate ethics commissioners--they have the ability to debate it endlessly, send it back to committee, make more amendments and send it back to the House of Commons, until we reach an absolute impasse, a logjam. If we delay it much further, we can all acknowledge we will be at the polls sooner rather than later. This entire project could collapse and I do not know how it would ever get rebuilt.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really only in minority parliaments that we can do these kinds of comprehensive amendments. I do not like our chances of getting a sequel, bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> the second, through in a majority parliament, whether it be a Liberal majority or a Conservative majority. Maybe if it was an NDP majority government this initiative would survive. We would be proud to make it our first bill in an NDP government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In much of what the Senate did, and my colleagues in the Bloc should be very sensitive to this, the Senate exceeded its place in the Constitution. It is supposed to be a chamber of sober second thought. It is supposed to watch for constitutional or legal errors that may have been made by this chamber. It is never supposed to interfere with a piece of legislation from the elected chamber to the point where it would be a serious policy shift. It is not supposed to undermine the government's initiatives or the initiatives of the elected chamber.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the amendments that the other place put through did all of these things. Many of the amendments that it put through are spurious, mischievous, raise constitutional problems and some of them are simply in error. I will point out some of those should time permit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that I am speaking broadly and in general terms. I will narrow my remarks to the amendment moved by the Liberal Party. I can support half of what the Liberals put forward as an amendment to the motion put forward by the government and I will have to reject the other two. Let me speak specifically. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part A of the Liberal amendment speaks to the Senate ethics commissioner. It brings back the notion that there should be separate ethics commissioners, one for the Senate and one for the House of Commons. I do not care. It is not that important to me. I am not going to jeopardize the success of this whole project arguing how many ethics commissioners can dance on the head of a pin. I do not care if we have 10. I will recommend that the NDP vote in favour of this amendment that the senators have their own separate Senate ethics commissioner. I do not buy their line that it is a constitutional crisis, but I do firmly believe that if they are going to get stubborn and ruin this whole project, the senators can have a separate ethics commissioner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part B argues that the Wheat Board should not be subject to the Access to Information Act. I also will vote in favour of this. I support this, notwithstanding what went on at the committee meeting on <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. Since that time the government has launched a full-blown attack on the Canadian Wheat Board. An absolutely mad crusade has begun to undermine the important work of the Canadian Wheat Board and I will not be a party to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will officially state that I will not support anything that will undermine that great prairie institution the Canadian Wheat Board. I will proudly stand in my place and vote in favour of the Wheat Board. I will not participate in this lynch mob mentality, tactics that Mussolini would be proud of, in trying to undermine the Canadian Wheat Board, denying its members even the right to vote. Their statutory guaranteed right to vote on their own future is being denied to them by the Conservative government. I will not be a part of it. I will not be a party to it. I will support the Liberals' amendment regarding whether or not the Canadian Wheat Board should be included under the ATI provisions of the act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part C deals with internal audits and papers. It says that the Liberal Party believes that internal draft documents should be subject to access to information as well. I would only ask that my Liberal Party colleagues look at what the Auditor General had to say about that. She does not believe this is a good idea. She specifically spoke to this at committee not only once, but twice. She feels it would be a serious error if all of the working documents and draft notes dealing with an audit were subject to access to information requests because much of her work relies on the free communication of background information. People would bury that information and would simply not have it available if they were worried that it would become public. This is a bad idea. I wish my colleagues of the Liberal Party would reconsider this. We will vote against this one which amends Senate amendment 118.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340">(1340)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on Senate amendment 119, the Liberal Party would have us introduce the concept of a public interest override within the context of the Access to Information Act. The NDP will not support this either. There is good background for that. NDP members are not being stubborn. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that if the public interest override were introduced to the bill as contemplated by Senate amendment 119, it would put the public interest override in the hands of the head of the institution and not in the hands of the Information Commissioner. It actually would weaken the Access to Information Act and the discretionary authority of the Information Commissioner. Again, I do not think the Liberals thought this through, but I wish they would reconsider. The NDP cannot support this at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last element of the amendments put forward by the Liberal Party deals with convention fees. This has been the second source of mischief that has delayed and stalled this bill, the first being the dual ethics commissioner and the second being the whole sensitive subject of convention fees, election financing limits, et cetera. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NDP members read the current Elections Act the way we always have. We have no conflict. We have no misunderstanding. We do not believe it should be changed or altered in any way. We believe the election financing limit should be $1,000 per year and that convention fees should be viewed as political donations and should be treated that way, just like we have always treated them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the other parties are having problems, partly due to their own greed. When a party charges $995 for a convention fee and the donation limit per year is $1,000, that party is going to run into trouble. NDP convention fees are $135, with an early bird fee of $95. We in the NDP do not have that problem, so I would advise the parties that are having difficulty fitting in underneath the new election campaign donation limits to look inward, to have a look at themselves in the mirror. That may be where they find the problem, not within the Elections Act.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the subamendments that have been put forward by my colleagues from the Bloc Québécois are concerned, I know that Bloc members are not big fans of the accountability act. It is no secret that the Bloc Québécois will do better in the next federal election if the federal government is still corrupt. Those members do not really want the federal government to be cleaned up, because they have to be able to point to a corrupt federal government to justify voting for the Bloc Québécois. We in the NDP do not buy into that and will not support that. So the Senate ethics--</div>

The Senate has overstepped its boundary. It has interfered with this bill in a way that is far beyond what senators are mandated to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me simply and by example say that even though there was great urgency to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> and even though we wanted the bill to be passed in the first session of this Parliament, the Senate took the entire three month summer break. When the Senate came back for a week, it lost another full week of work because one of the senators had to be on a parliamentary junket to the Philippines. One senator was on a beach in the Philippines and we had another week's delay for Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>.

    </p><a name="Para286323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, many of the amendments that the Senate has put forward simply put the Senate's nose into business where it has no place being. In regard to the public appointments commission, some of the amendments put forward by the Senate say that the Senate should have a role in the process of appointing those commissioners. That is simply problematic. It is unclear if it is a constitutional issue.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of what the Senate did was self-aggrandizing. Fully 43 of the Senate's 154 amendments dealt with this separate ethics commissioner, as to whether there should be one, two or three ethics commissioners. It was all about the senators. It was not about making the bill better. It was all about protecting their own backyard. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Senate wasted an enormous amount of time. I do not apologize to anyone for saying it. I think it was political mischief so that the Senate could delay this bill until the Liberals have had their Liberal leadership campaign. Those Liberal leadership hopefuls should fall in line now, show some leadership and tell their rogue senators to stop mucking around with this bill and allow it to pass.</div>

    </p><a name="Para286337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Wheat Board is not a government agency. It is an organization of farmers. Not one penny of government money goes into the Canadian Wheat Board. The government has a plan to try to abolish the Canadian Wheat Board. The Conservatives are on a mad crusade to try to abolish the Canadian Wheat Board because they are ideologically opposed to collective action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the collective action of farmers trying to look after their own interests that formed the Canadian Wheat Board and continues to serve them well. We should not play into the Conservatives' scheme to undermine the will of the people on the Canadian prairies. The Canadian Wheat Board is a great prairie institution. We on this side of the House will do nothing to undermine it.</div>

Shortly following our treatment of the Wheat Board at the committee, the government undertook a full frontal assault on the Canadian Wheat Board, announcing that it would undermine the board's single desk selling without a vote, and muzzling farmers and the Wheat Board from even representing their own points of view. It then became clear this was part of a package to undermine the Canadian Wheat Board. We will not play into that. We may have been duped at one point. We are going to fix that today.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autism is a neurological disorder that impairs social interaction and communications skills. Despite autism's sometimes serious impacts, there is treatment available to help many of those affected. For example, applied behavioural analysis therapy has proven beneficial for many autistic children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While funding for this therapy is at the discretion of Canada's provincial governments, our new government is proud of the $1.1 billion increase in the Canada health transfer that we have provided in budget 2006. Our government is also proud to invest $3.5 million annually in research into the causes and treatment of autism.</div>

    <center><b>Question No. 94--</b></center><b>Ms. Penny Priddy</b>:<a name="Para286602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to programs and spending administered by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, within the riding of Surrey North: (<i>a</i>) what is the total annual budget of CMHC spending in 2006; (<i>b</i>) what is the projected budget for 2007; (<i>c</i>) how many CMHC funded housing units for singles and families currently exist; and (<i>d</i>) how many CMHC funded housing units for singles and families are planned for the remainder of 2006 and 2007?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Diane Finley (Minister of Human Resources and Social Development, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para286603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, with respect to programs and spending administered by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, within the riding of Surrey North, CMHC currently administers 681 units, representing current annual funding of some $600,000. There may be additional units receiving ongoing federal assistance under federal-provincial programs administered by the province of British Columbia. The province has the lead role for these units and does not report subsidies by project to CMHC.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under federal housing renovation programs, some $47,000 has been committed for 11 units in the riding between January 1, 2006 and October 31, 2006. CMHC is unable to provide a forecast of how many more units and dollars will be committed by year-end 2006 or 2007, since this will depend on the number of applications received and approved, as well as the availability of funding in 2007-08.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbia Housing administers the Canada-British Columbia affordable housing program agreement. According to information provided by BC Housing, there have not been any commitments under this program in the riding of Surrey North to date. It should be noted that BC Housing is not required to provide forecasts of units planned by riding to CMHC.</div>
    </p>
    <center><b>Question No. 96--</b></center><b>Mrs. Irene Mathyssen</b>:<a name="Para286606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With regard to the $45 million funding cuts over the next two years to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, announced in September 2006: (<i>a</i>) from specifically where within CMHC does the government plan on cutting this funding; (<i>b</i>) when will these cuts take place; and (<i>c</i>) will the government provide a detailed timeline for these cuts?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Diane Finley (Minister of Human Resources and Social Development, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para286607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the $45 million in efficiency savings will come from the assisted housing programs line in Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's, CMHC’s,  2006-07 main estimates and the equivalent line in CMHC's 2007-08 main estimates, when approved. The assisted housing programs budget line primarily supports funding for some 633,000 existing social housing units and the affordable housing initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efficiency savings apply to social housing that is funded and administered by CMHC through a number of existing agreements. The efficiency savings result from lower than forecast mortgage interest rates and inflation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social housing is funded through long term federal subsidies. Social housing expenses usually include a mortgage cost component which may vary as mortgage interest rates increase or decrease over time. Non-mortgage expenses increase or decrease over time due to inflation. At the social housing project level, the cost of CMHC’s assistance can also increase or decrease accordingly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumptions regarding increases or decreases in expenses are factored into CMHC annual program budget costs and the corporation's main estimates. If mortgage interest rates and inflation were to go up, the cost of CMHC housing subsidies would go up. If mortgage rates or inflation were to decrease, CMHC subsidy costs would go down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final social housing costs for 2006-07 and 2007-08 are expected to be lower due to lower than assumed interest rates on social housing renewals and inflation. The efficiency savings devoted to expenditure review will be $30 million in 2006-07 and $15 million in 2007-08. The timeline for the realization of the savings is relatively constant over the two fiscal periods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing funding contracts with provinces, territories and third-sector housing providers, e.g.,  non-profits and  housing co-operatives, continue to be fully honoured as federal funding will be sufficient based on the terms of these contracts. There is no impact on low income tenants of the social housing in question since they will continue to pay the same level of subsidized rent.</div>
    </p>
    <center><b>Question No. 100--</b></center><b>Ms. Olivia Chow</b>:<a name="Para286613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With regard to the government's plans for child care: (<i>a</i>) how many spaces will be created by the end of March 2007 from the $650 million that was transfered to the provinces and territories to create child care spaces; (<i>b</i>) what kind of phase-out plan will be implemented to deal with the loss of those funds on April 1, 2007; (<i>c</i>) what is the timeline for launching the $250 million child care spaces initiative; and (<i>d</i>) how many child care spaces will be created from the $1.6 billion universal child care benefit?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Diane Finley (Minister of Human Resources and Social Development, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para286614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, in response to (a), the Government of Canada is recognizing the diverse needs of Canadian families through Canada’s universal child care plan, a plan that is providing universal support for all parents of young children. The plan is composed of two key elements: the universal child care benefit and the child care spaces initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As per budget 2006, the Government of Canada has provided $650 million in 2006-07 to all provinces and territories, distributed on an equal per capita basis.  This funding provides provinces and territories with transitional funding as the bilateral agreements for early learning and child care that were reached under the previous government are phased out.  In order to assist them in adjusting to this new federal approach, provinces and territories have flexibility to use this funding as they see fit for early learning and child care.  </div>
    </p><a name="Para286616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provinces and territories are committed to clear accountability to Canadians and already report on their annual activities and expenditures related to early learning and child care.  Provinces and territories will continue this practice and include information on this funding and how it has been used for the creation of child care spaces in their annual public reports. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     In response to (b), in February 2006, all provinces and territories received notification that the bilateral agreements for early learning and child care that were reached under the previous government would be phased out as of March 31, 2007.  This provided all provinces and territories with more than 14 months’ notice to adjust to the change in federal approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Only three jurisdictions, Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec, had signed bilateral funding agreements with the previous federal government.  Those agreements had a clause allowing either party to terminate them with 12 months’ notice.  The Government of Canada provided those jurisdictions with formal written notice invoking the termination clause of their funding agreements.  For the remaining jurisdictions, the Government of Canada provided notification of the federal intention to provide one year of transitional funding for 2006-07.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As per budget 2006, the Government of Canada has provided provinces and territories with $650 million in 2006-07, distributed on an equal per capita basis, to assist them in adjusting to the new federal approach to child care.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     In response to (c), the Government of Canada recognizes that the availability of child care is a challenge faced by many Canadian parents.  That is why, as set out in budget 2006, the federal government will be investing $250 million per year, beginning in fiscal 2007-08, to support the creation of child care spaces across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to (d), through the universal child care benefit,  UCCB, the Government of Canada is providing universal support to all families with young children through an income benefit of $100 per month, up to $1,200 a year, for each child under the age of six.  Beginning with the first payment in July, approximately two million children and their families are benefiting from this new initiative each month.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of this initiative is not to create child care spaces, but rather to provide all families with support that they can use to provide their children with the kind of care they choose.  For example, families could use this benefit to offset part of the cost of child care fees or part time preschool programs, or for occasional care by a friend or neighbour.  By providing a universal benefit, the federal government is recognizing the diversity of family needs and preferences when it comes to caring for their children.</div>

    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para286638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four principal amendments put forward by the Liberals that I would like to address. I would like to discuss what they would actually mean for the accountability act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, the Liberals in this House have put forward an amendment that would exempt their friends in the Senate from a new ethics watchdog created by the accountability act. The accountability act seeks to put in place a tough watchdog who can keep tabs on the ethical behaviour of members of Parliament and senators. We propose in the interests of fairness that this watchdog be responsible for all members of Parliament, including those in the upper chamber.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals for some reason believe that their senators should have a free escape hatch, that they should not be covered by this watchdog. They therefore have put forward an amendment denying this new ethics watchdog the right to watch over the behaviour of Liberal senators.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House believe that senators should have nothing to hide, that all senators should be prepared to live up to the same standards as their democratically elected counterparts here in this House. As such, we will not support amendments to protect Liberal senators from accountability. We believe accountability should apply in both chambers and as such, we will seek to give this new watchdog the power to oversee the ethical conduct of members in the upper chamber as well as here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Liberals seek to take away the right of farmers to have access to information at the Canadian Wheat Board. Liberals believe that farmers should not know what is going on with the Canadian Wheat Board, that they should not have the ability to access critical information, such as the budgetary decisions of the Wheat Board, the hospitality expenses, the decisions that affect the bottom line of everyday farmers. All of that should be kept secret from farmers according to the Liberal amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side believe that the Wheat Board should have nothing to hide. If the Wheat Board is conducting its affairs above board and with the utmost of integrity, the Wheat Board should not have any concern whatsoever with giving farmers the right to access to information. This is the same exact right that we have extended as a government to crown corporations that are competitive, to government departments, to a whole assortment of organizations that operate in a competitive environment. All of them must live up to the demands of the Access to Information Act. That is a method of accountability, because everyday people ought to have the right to know what their government institutions do. In this instance, farmers ought to have the right to have access to information over the Canadian Wheat Board which controls and monopolizes all the distribution of Canadian wheat in the Prairies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Liberals have put forward an amendment called the public interest override related to access to information. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A> has already demonstrated with great clarity that this amendment would actually decrease access to information and would inhibit the ability of Canadian taxpayers to access information that would otherwise be secret. It puts the executive branch of government, that is, the bureaucratic and political leaders of this country, in charge of determining the public interest. Those political and bureaucratic leaders under the Liberal amendment would have the ability to reject access to information requests in order to keep secret documents and information that they want held back from the public. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Liberals in this House want to force Canadian taxpayers to pick up the tab for their convention. Liberals believe that convention delegates who pay a fee to be part of a grand political event, a convention, should be allowed to do so on the backs of taxpayers by using the political tax credit. We on this side of the House of Commons believe that taxpayers should not be forced to unduly subsidize political conventions. As such, we have not reported as political donations the delegate fees that go to finance those conventions.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515">(1515)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Liberals had their way, they would retroactively apply a new rule forcing Canadian taxpayers to pay the cost of political conventions. Let us ask ourselves what this means for the Conservative convention that was held in April 2005. If they were able to change the interpretation of the law to force delegate fees to be considered as political donations, the Canada Revenue Agency would be forced to go back two years and issue hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax rebates to Conservative convention goers. That might be in the interests of the Conservative Party, but we do not believe that taxpayer funded conventions are in the interests of Canadian working families. As such, we do not support the Liberals' interpretation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note that in every instance the Liberal Party seeks to structure the rules in a way that is most financially beneficial to the Liberal Party itself. We on this side of the House would like to structure the laws in a way that is most financially beneficial to the Canadian taxpayer. As such, we did not ask taxpayers to subsidize our last convention. It is the Liberal Party that has done so in its coming convention. In order to cover their tracks and justify their behaviour, the Liberals are now asking the Conservative Party to go back retroactively and do the same. We disagree and as such, we will vote against this amendment.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para286648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to return to a point I mentioned earlier concerning the Canadian Wheat Board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to thank the former hon. member for Repentigny, Benoît Sauvageau, who worked so hard to increase government accountability. This member worked with members from all parties in order to improve our system of government. He and his party supported an amendment to include the Canadian Wheat Board in the Access to Information Act. It is a matter of principle. I would therefore like to thank this hard-working member. He is no longer with us and will be sadly missed. We were all together for his funeral and I would like this House to recognize his contribution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Bloc Québécois proposed an amendment to make the Canadian Wheat Board subject to the Access to Information Act. On behalf of western farmers, I would like to thank the Bloc members who proposed this amendment, because it is a good principle. Although the Bloc does not represent western Canada, I believe it made an excellent decision in supporting the rights of farmers to access information. I am very proud to work with the Bloc and with all members who support transparency in order to ensure this right for our farmers in western Canada.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520">(1520)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para286651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say in English as well that I thank the members of the Bloc who put forward an amendment to include the Canadian Wheat Board in access to information so that western Canadian farmers have the right to know how the Wheat Board functions and the ability to know what is going on with the organization that monopolizes the distribution of their wheat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there are Liberal members across the way who have something to hide, who do not want certain information to be available to farmers, who have conducted themselves in a way that they perhaps do not want the public to know about and they are working feverishly behind the scenes and publicly to prevent farmers from having the right to have access to information. I regret that a great deal, but we only ask what it is they are hiding that they do not want farmers to have the right to access to information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some in the Liberal Party have said that this has something to do with supply management. Anybody who knows anything about agriculture knows that the Canadian Wheat Board is not a body of supply management. It does not carry out supply management. It is a marketing board. It has nothing whatsoever to do with supply management. They are engaging in specious arguments to distract from the fact that they are hiding critical information from farmers that they do not want to be made public.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that when members stand in the House to defend their decision to deny farmers the ability to have access to information, they should tell farmers what it is they are personally hiding, what it is they might have personally been involved in that they do not want farmers to know about. Certainly, farmers want to have that right. They want to know what is going on in their organization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have said that access to information at the Canadian Wheat Board would cause some sort of competitive disadvantage. We are putting crown corporations that compete in the open market under access to information. For example, we are putting Export Development Canada under access to information. That is a group that actually competes internationally. We are putting the Business Development Bank under access to information. A whole assortment of organizations that compete internationally and that compete here at home in Canada are all going to be covered under the access to information law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument by some who want to cover up information at the Wheat Board that it cannot happen due to commercial confidences is a specious one. They ought to explain why they want farmers to be denied the right to have access to all that information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what some people think of the Wheat Board, there are various opinions and I respect them all, one thing about which farmers are unanimous is the view that they ought to have access to information related to the function of the Wheat Board because that wheat board has total control over the marketing of their grain as a monopoly. That organization, which was sanctioned and put in place by the federal government, ought therefore to be open to the farmers that it is meant to serve. I would defy any member of the House to oppose farmers' rights to access to information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would reiterate the importance of the act. The accountability act bans political patronage in an amendment put forward by the NDP. It brings ironclad whistleblower protection to public servants who are conscientious enough to speak out against wrongdoing. It expands access to information to roughly 30 new organizations, some of which the Liberals are trying to take back out, but that is what the original act intended to do. It bans big money and corporate cash from political campaigns. It expands the powers of the Auditor General to shine her light in every dark corner in her hunt for waste and corruption. It moves in all directions toward more transparency and more openness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical objective of the House must now be to pass the accountability act into law. There have been thousands of hours of study. It went through record hearings in the Senate. The Senate saw the bill for twice as long as it was studied in the House of Commons. There has been plenty of time, plenty of debate. In fact, many of the measures in this bill have been discussed now for roughly a decade. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for talk is behind us; the time for action is now. If the Liberal Senate and the Liberal Party continues to delay the passage of the bill, then they very well might get their way and delay it until the election comes at which time, by convention of Parliament, it would die. They would, as a party, be forced to explain that conduct to the Canadian electorate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians voted for the accountability act in the last election. We, as the Conservative government, followed through on our promise to them by introducing the bill as the first piece of legislation before the House and introduced by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A>. It is the toughest anti-corruption law in Canadian history. It expands accountability in every single way. It fulfills the hopes of thousands of Canadians and hundreds of members of Parliament in the House to have a cleaner more accountable government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have worked as a government to bring forward this legislation because the Canadian people voted for it. They demanded it. We have now delivered on it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would ask that members of Parliament and members of the Senate stop their delays, and allow the bill to become law, allow the Canadian people to have their aspirations for more accountable government fulfilled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that not one single solitary member of the House has proclaimed him or herself against the accountability act, not one. All members say they support it. Not one member of Parliament voted against it when it came before the House, not a single solitary one. Not a single member of the committee on the accountability act voted against the bill. Every single member of the House has voted for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if members are true to their word when they say they support the bill, then they ought to allow it swift passage into law. The time has come and the place is here. I ask the members of all parties to join and lock arms with all of us to put this historic law, the toughest anti-corruption law in Canadian history, into the statutory books of this country. I now anticipate the queries of my distinguished colleagues.</div>

    </p><a name="Para286667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask him to answer this question, if he could, directly. Did I hear the member correctly when he said that it was absolutely unanimous among western farmers that access to information should apply to the Canadian Wheat Board?</div>
    </p><a name="Para286668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he did not, I ask him to be very careful in his answer, because I know that not to be true. The Canadian Wheat Board is probably the most transparent organization in the country. He may have never been there. He may never have visited its offices. He is obviously listening to the propaganda from the international grain trade which wants access to information to the Canadian Wheat Board, not necessarily on the commerciality of the operation but clearly to be a nuisance factor. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that the Canadian Wheat Board has an annual report audited. The Canadian Wheat Board is not a crown corporation and the government knows that. It says that specifically in the act. The Canadian Wheat Board holds district meetings in every one of its districts with officials of the Canadian Wheat Board there to answer any questions, financial or otherwise. It is very transparent. It has a department within the operation which answers calls 24 hours a day, so it is very transparent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary said that farmers unanimously wanted access to information to apply. Most farmers do not. I wonder what concrete evidence does the member have to make that statement in the House of Commons or is he just trying to mislead the Canadian people.</div>

It answers the phone. It has a department that responds to questions. It has annual meetings. It has audited books. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is true of every department in the government, so by his logic, we would eliminate access to information for every department in the Government of Canada because they have audited books, they answer their phones, and they have annual financial statements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he really believes that all of those things disqualify an organization from coverage under the Access to Information Act, then he ought also to believe that there is no organization in Canada in the government that should be covered by access to information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exactly what he is suggesting. If he believes that an organization of the government, which spends public money, should not be covered by access to information just because it answers the phone, just because it holds an annual meeting, and just because it has audited books, again he would literally eliminate the very existence of the Access to Information Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that the Canadian Wheat Board is already open. Fair enough, I will take his word for it, but what is the problem with having a belt and suspenders? If the organization is already 100% transparent then it should have no problem responding to access to information requests. In fact, I would be surprised if anyone would even file an access to information request. If the organization is already 100% open, there would not be any need for it, but there is nothing wrong with having a belt at the same time as suspenders, just to make sure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just go back to the same question. What is the member afraid of? What are the people who are opposed to access to information hiding?</div>

This is prime example, I think, of a government in such a hurry to prove that it is doing something that it has made an elementary mistake. In English it is possible to say the <i>Federal Accountability Act</i>, but anyone with the least knowledge of French should know that in this language it would be the Loi fédérale sur la responsabilité. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should add that it was Mr. Sauvageau, the hon. member for Repentigny at the time, who moved an amendment to the bill to correct the French title. Although I thanked him at the time, I would like to thank him again posthumously. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Electoral Officer interprets the statute. He decides whether or not the Liberal Party of Canada, the Bloc Québécois, the NDP, the former Progressive Conservative Party, the former Reform Party and the former Canadian Alliance acted appropriately and within the law with regard to reporting convention fees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary is trying to distort the debate. The Conservative government knew that the Canada Elections Act requires a political party to disclose the registration fees for its conventions to the Chief Electoral Officer. Then why did it not do so and why did it hide these registration fees? Today we learned that these fees totalled $2 million. This party hid the $2 million from the Chief Electoral Officer and it is now under investigation. If he really wanted to speak honestly, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78964,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78964&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board</A> should have mentioned it in this House </div>
    </p><a name="Para286702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we, Liberals and Bloquistes, put questions on the interpretation of section 404.1 to the chief electoral officer and to political party officials, everyone unanimously agreed that the interpretation of the chief electoral officer was the correct one. Convention fees should be considered political contributions and, therefore, they should be declared by the party to the chief electoral officer. The government is omitting to mention this in the House in order to create a false impression in the minds of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Senate, because of the dishonest behaviour of that party, makes the law very clear on this issue, what does the government do? It wants to reject the Senate's amendment, while claiming that the Senate has dragged its feet, has engaged in filibustering, etc. This same government does not want to tell Canadians that the quality work accomplished by the Senate has made the government realize that some fifty amendments were necessary to correct the legislation, otherwise its own bill would not make sense in a number of areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a little reminder of the facts. The Senate heard over 140 witnesses during 98 hours of hearings. It came to the conclusion that the accountability bill was seriously flawed, and that amendments to this legislation were required to live up to the commitment made by the minority Conservative government. Of course, a number of amendments were made. Some are accepted by the government today, but others are not, which explains why the Conservatives are attempting to make their gimmickry retroactively legal. Hiding political donations of $2 million from the chief electoral officer is indeed engaging in gimmickry.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this government were honest and the<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> were an honest man, he would admit it in this House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Speaker of the House has already ruled, saying that if the person were honest, he would do something. So it is parliamentary. I said it, if the President of the Treasury Board were an honest man, an honest person, he would say that it is not true that this government wants to shed light on the federal government’s work. It is not true. If it were true, certain amendments that the Bloc and the Liberals tried to make as part of the House legislative committee—for example, to the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act—would not have been blocked by the Conservative members, with the support of the NDP. Still the Senate was able to adopt them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I return to my subject. Concerning political financing, the Senate suggest setting the limit on political party donations at $2,000 a year. This decision was made because the government was not able to demonstrate that the current limits undermined electoral procedure at the federal or provincial level, where the limits, when there are any, are much higher than those proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, donations made to political parties play an important role in our democratic system. Limiting them too strictly might affect the participation of small parties in political life. Furthermore, limiting the amount of these donations too strictly reduces the resources which political parties must have to fulfil their legitimate role in debates in Canada, and this leaves more room for third parties that wish to influence the debates. This is interesting. The Prime Minister, who was formerly, I think, the CEO or president of some federation, of an NGO, appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada for third parties to be allowed to advertise and spend during a federal election campaign, claiming that the limits the former government had put in the Canada Elections Act on spending by third parties during an election campaign were unconstitutional. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting because this Prime Minister has still not disclosed who the donors to his own party leadership race were. He still has not disclosed who the donors were to the federation which he led before returning to politics. It is interesting for a Prime Minister and a party that pride themselves on wanting to ensure accountability and transparency. But they are hiding things.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to access to information and privacy, the Senate and the senators are proposing to remove the Canadian Wheat Board from the coverage of the Access to Information Act so that the board can stand up to international competition better when representing Canadian farmers. Here again, the Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board is claiming that the Liberals are supporting an amendment that will remove the Canadian Wheat Board from the coverage of this act because they have something to hide. He knows that this is completely untrue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Wheat Board represents Canadian farmers on the international stage against competitors from other countries.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to address the issue of better protection for personal information on donors to the National Arts Centre.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artists may also donate their time and talent or charge much less than the regular market rate. But they do not want potential clients to know that they donated their time or gave a concert for no charge or for half price for charitable reasons or because they want to promote a certain type of music or activity. They do not want this information made public. A potential client could say the artists billed only so much and that it will therefore pay them only a given amount.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate brought into place many excellent amendments. It pains me to see the government continually talk about how the senators have attempted to block the legislation, that the senators do not want to see transparency, that the senators do not want to see accountability and that Liberals, the official opposition, also do not want to see it. Nothing is further from the truth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at it. It was a Liberal government that adopted whistleblower protection legislation, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1395901,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1395901&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>. It was never brought into effect by the current government. There were witnesses who came before us who said they would like to see that legislation enacted immediately. I remember Mr. Sauvageau and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78589,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78589&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Rivière-du-Nord</A> asked that the government proclaim it and bring it into force immediately while we had the opportunity to study and work properly on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. The government refused.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then attempted to bring amendments here. Here are some of the amendments the Liberal members tried to bring forward and the government, with the aid of the NDP, blocked: one, to provide a reverse onus so that any administrative or disciplinary measure taken within a year of a disclosure would be deemed to be a reprisal unless the employer showed otherwise; two, extend the time limit to file a reprisal complaint to one year instead of the 60 days that the Conservative government proposed and is now trying to bring back; and three, remove the $10,000 limit on awards for pain and suffering and increase the amount for legal advice from $1,500 to $25,000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are reinforcements that we attempted to bring forward and the Conservatives and the NDP blocked them, yet they say they are for protecting public servants who divulge wrongdoing on the part of government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I dislike about this Parliament is if there is any difference of opinion on facts, the accusation of liar, liar goes back and forth. In fairness, it probably exists on both sides of the House. No party in the House, least of which me, can claim innocence on that. However, people can have different opinions.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member opposite has said that many of the Senate amendments are excellent. I take no fault with the Senate wanting to take a reasonable period of time. There was some suggestion it should pass this immediately in July. In fact, we said that if it wanted to take three months to review the bill, in addition to the 72 days the House took in addition to the 58 day election campaign, by all means take it. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not take issue with wanting to sit 120 hours. What I did take issue with was the amount of time it cumulatively took. The Senate took one week in the end of June. It took off for seven seeks. Then it came back for a week. Then it took off. We expected it would have looked at the amount of time all members of Parliament in the House took to deal with the bill. The bill is not perfect.

The experience I had under this legislative committee for Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> was literally horrendous. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat on a legislative committee that dealt with an amendment to the Constitution of Canada. The committee was allowed the time to fully hear witnesses. The committee was given the time to hear witnesses when they brought forth briefs. Sometimes those briefs literally contained hundreds of pages. They were very dense and dealt with very complex matters. We had the time to sit, to read and to study them and to go to committee prepared. It also allowed the parliamentary staff, our researchers and our clerks, to properly do their job. It meant that the quality of the work, which was done at the end of the day, made up for the time that was taken because the legislation was not flawed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative committee on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> was literally forced by the majority held by the government, with the cooperation of the NDP. When votes were tied, the chair, who is a Conservative member, broke the tie and sided with the government. We were calling witnesses a maximum of 24 hours before the date of the committee hearing, asking them to provide a brief on a grave issue that required serious research and reflection. In some cases they were told they did not even have five minutes to explain their position. Witnesses were leaving the Bill C-2 legislative committee, some of them almost in tears, saying that they did not have an opportunity to express themselves and that they wanted to come back. Guess who refused it? It was the Conservatives members with the help of the NDP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gained no pride whatsoever from the work of that legislative committee of the House of Commons. We were denied the possibility of doing quality work. We were denied the possibility of ensuring that the legislation did in fact do what the Conservative minority government had promised, which was it would provide transparency, it would provide real protections for whistleblowers in the public service and it would ensure that Canadians could have access to information and that their personal information would be protected. That bill did none of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate attempted to correct as much as it could. Even the Senate was limited. Certain rules and regulations did not allow the Senate to do everything. The Senate was not given the scope to do everything.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government trying to do now? It is trying to reinstate virtually the identical bill that went out of the House and into the Senate, knowing full well it was a flawed bill.</div>

        <div><b><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78589,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78589&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ms. Monique Guay (Rivière-du-Nord, BQ)</A>: </b><span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1779682"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_left.gif" border="0" alt="previous intervention"></a></span>&nbsp;<span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1780012"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_right.gif" border="0" alt="next intervention"></a></span></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a minute to remember my former colleague, Benoît Sauvageau. He worked on this bill with me, bringing much wisdom and many improvements to it. I would like us to take a moment to remember him because he devoted a lot of time and energy to this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and I worked together for an unprecedented number of hours during that time. I have never seen such a thing here in Parliament. In 13 years, I have never seen a legislative committee sit for so many hours over such a short period of time because the government insisted on passing this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason it was so adamant is clear: it s well aware that the Liberal convention is looming and that this bill contains detrimental provisions—provisions that affect, among other things, the $1,500 convention registration fee. Jean-Pierre Kingsley made it clear that such fees are considered donations. The bill puts a $1,000 cap on donations. It was clear to us that this would apply to the Liberal Party convention and that this was why the government wanted to ram the bill through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the important thing for the Bloc Québécois is to improve it as much as possible because we need an accountability act. As my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78353,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78353&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</A> said, we fought incredibly hard for the word “responsabilité”. We had to go to the Office québécois de la langue française. We had to make use of every tool at our disposal to make the government understand that the word “imputabilité” was clearly an anglicism, not a French word at all. Eventually we won. We made the government understand that the appropriate French term was “responsabilité”. Unfortunately, a lot of time was wasted just on that, even though there were other extremely important issues in the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague referred to this earlier, and I think it is worth mentioning because it is true: many witnesses wanted to appear before our committee. Many had things to tell us, many wanted to improve the bill and noticed flaws in it, but did not get a chance to appear because they only had 24 hours notice. They did not appear because 24 hours was not enough time for them to draft a brief, in both official languages, to satisfy the requirements of our legislative committee. These people were left empty-handed, and we can imagine that, today still, they are extremely unhappy about not having been heard. While ours is supposedly the greatest democracy, these people did not get to be heard by the committee. It is extremely important to point this out again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told that the Senate heard more than 140 witnesses and that a number of amendments will have to be taken into account because they were made in a structured fashion and make some sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have been saying since the beginning, we have never filibustered at committee and we have no plans to do so here, but we have things to say about this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merit-based appointment of returning officers is a fantastic gain. It is well known that the process for appointing returning officers was a partisan one. I know this for a fact because it happened in my region. When the Liberals were in government, a good Liberal would be appointed, a guy in charge of overseeing our campaigns. Very often, in several ridings, this caused partisanship problems to such an extent that the system did not work. In addition, being a good Liberal and a decision having been made to make partisan appointments, efforts were made to thwart the candidates from the Bloc Québécois or other parties. But no more; from now on, returning officers will be selected based on their merits, not on their political allegiance, which is an excellent thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were even consulted. They actually consulted members of Parliament, asking us if we were happy with our returning officers. This is a step in the right direction to ensure the legitimacy of the selection process for someone who is, after all, appointed for a ten-year term.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610">(1610)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is someone who is in office for a long time. He or she must be appointed on a non-partisan basis and in light of his or her ability to play that role for the next 10 years, especially since, with a minority government like the one we currently have, we have repeated elections. We had elections in 2004 and 2006, and we could have another one next year or even this year. These people become extremely important. They have non-partisan training and have to provide services for all the candidates in their riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the whole issue of the political party financing legislation. The Bloc could not disagree with that, because we already comply with the legislation in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I do not have many donors who give me $2,000 during the course of the year. I receive far more $5 and $10 donations than $2,000 donations during an election campaign or a fundraising campaign. There are people involved, party members, people who do not write cheques for thousands of dollars. There are no such people in my riding, and I would be very surprised to receive such an amount. In Quebec, we already comply with this requirement, and we will continue to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it is time to make major changes at the federal level, because the parties could receive donations of thousands of dollars from companies. This is not conducive to non-partisan work by members or ministers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone gives me a $25,000 donation, I will feel indebted. But if I receive relatively equal amounts from my various constituents or party members, I feel much more at ease. I am indebted to everyone because I am elected, but I do not feel particularly indebted to someone who gave me $25,000 or $30,000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the whole issue of whistle-blower compensation, which was discussed at length. Several witnesses testified that it was not a good idea to pay a whistle-blower $1,000, $2,000 or $5,000. That could lead to informing, something that must not be encouraged.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, public servants are duty-bound to report any wrongdoing, any mismanagement in the department where they work or anyone who is not doing his or her job properly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not make sense to begin rewarding whistle-blowers. It should be part of the duties of a public servant who learns about an instance of wrongdoing, work not being done properly or mistreatment to report it. How that person learns about it is not important. That person should report it without a reward. In our opinion, it did not make sense to offer a reward. The government realized this, so this is a good point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, the Senate heard from 140 witnesses, calling certain witnesses back to clarify certain clauses of the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some clauses are good and others are not as good. I cannot list all of them here, but one in particular is very important and the Bloc Québécois condemns the fact that the government rejected this amendment because it was an important one. The Senate proposed increasing the ceiling on fees for legal counsel from $1,500 to $25,000, or removing the ceiling altogether, at the commissioner's discretion. I would like to explain why the Bloc supported that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw in committee the number of hours legal counsel spent working, yet could not keep up. The maximum of legal counsel were hired, but they could not keep up despite crazy hours.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615">(1615)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people deserved additional remuneration. That was part of it. The government does not agree with this. I do not know how this is going to play out, but I thought it was a good measure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate also proposed removing the $10,000 limit on awards for pain and suffering. Depending on the situation, I think the Senate was right to propose this measure. We cannot put a limit on a sum of money for pain and suffering. Each case must be examined to determine how much the individual was affected and to then decide the amount of the award. But the government rejected this amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must explain what happened during the committee's hearings. This is very important. Things were going so fast that, at one point, all committee members, from all parties, received a notice from Mr. Walsh, telling us to stop. Mr. Walsh is not just anybody. He is a very important official in the House of Commons. He is the guardian of the rights of members of Parliament and senators, in other words our rights as parliamentarians. At one point, Mr. Walsh alerted us. He told us that this bill would restrict the rights of members of Parliament and senators, that we were mixing legislative and parliamentary issues. We wanted him to appear before the committee, but some Conservative members had a fit and asked who that person was. As we can see, there are people who do not really know how things work around here. Everyone knows who Mr. Walsh is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said that we absolutely wanted him to appear before the committee, because what he had to tell us was very important. We were playing with our rights as parliamentarians. We were mixing judicial and parliamentary responsibilities. The work that we do here, in Parliament or in the Senate, could have been challenged. That did not make any sense. So, he brought important amendments to the committee to protect our rights as parliamentarians and elected representatives. Most of these amendments were accepted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proves one thing: when we try to go over something too quickly, when we try to run faster than we can, this compels the primary guardian of our rights, here in the House of Commons, to react very strongly. Indeed, the way the bill was drafted did not make sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there were some extremely serious problems. We solved a few of them, but there are still some left. This is not a small bill. What I find reassuring is that we demanded, and the government accepted, that the bill be reviewed in five years. At first they wanted a review in 15 or 20 years. Imagine what it would be like to work with a piece of legislation that is not reviewed regularly because it was decided that the act would be implemented for an unlimited number of years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agreed to support the bill on accountability. We understood that the government wanted this to go quickly, but this legislation needed to be reviewed in the next five years. This is new legislation and it is extremely complex. When it is implemented it will need to be reviewed as soon as possible in order to correct any mistakes in it. I am certain that when it is implemented we will realize there are some aspects that cannot be put into effect. We will have to go back to the drawing board and do it over. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as access to information is concerned, the Conservatives refused to budge. The Access to Information Act was passed in 1983. Since then, despite a number of requests for its revision, it has stayed essentially the same. The Conservative government chose not to include reform of the Access to Information Act in its Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. We would have nonetheless appreciated the government agreeing to this. If we are going to have legislation on accountability, why not include the Access to Information Act? It is complementary and we could have had a truly complete piece of legislation.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620">(1620)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this did not happen because we were told there was not enough time, we were told that 100 recommendations were needed to revise the act, we were told that the accountability bill had to be adopted before the year-end, we were given 100,000 reasons save one—the real reason why we were unable to confirm all of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot of confusion in this bill. We will have to see how the senators' amendments that are accepted fit in with the bill as it stands. Our legislators will be able to tell us. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is extremely important and it cannot be done in five minutes. I know that the Conservatives want this to move along very quickly. However, so long as the two bills—the one here in Parliament and the one in the Senate—are not similar, there will be no law and we will not be able to promulgate this law. We will play ping pong for who knows how long because we will send the bill back to the Senate, the Senate will again make its recommendations that will come back to the House, we will then make our recommendations that will go to the Senate, and so forth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we find a way to not delay unduly the implementation of Bill  <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> and we will not be the ones to do so. We have said it from the very beginning. My colleague for Repentigny at the time and I were accused of filibustering and delaying adoption of the bill. That was not our intention. We wanted the bill to be a good one. For it to be good, such an important piece of legislation on accountability must be well written and properly implemented.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say it again. Mr. Walsh made some very important recommendations. If Mr. Walsh had not sounded the alarm, all of us in this House would have lost fundamental rights that we cherish, our rights as parliamentarians here in the House of Commons. Mr. Walsh finally got his message across to the other side of the House. Mr. Walsh is a non-partisan individual and he is there to protect the rights of all members. If Mr. Walsh had not been there, we can just imagine what might have happened to us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very significant, important and broad bill. In my opinion, some people also raised the alarm in the Senate, and we should look at this carefully. It goes without saying that we should not engage in filibustering for no reason, but we can definitely not pass this legislation at full throttle. We must be absolutely sure, and so must our researchers and the legislators. All those who worked on this bill find it complex. They know that once it is enacted, it will become the law. We must not create conflicts of interest with already existing laws, because this bill amends a large number of them. So, things must be clear and we must do serious work. This is what we have done in the past, and this is what we will do in the future. We will support this bill, while taking into consideration the points that I made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If some people, some experts feel that major changes should be made to the bill, because it impacts on another act, or because it completely destroys it—and this could well be the case—these people should have the time to thoroughly examine this bill in order to propose the necessary changes to improve it, change it and amend it, so that in the end it will really work and we will have a true accountability act, a true piece of legislation that will compel us to be responsible as parliamentarians, ministers and elected representatives.</div>

    </p><a name="Para286772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to raise a question with her because it is her party, the Bloc Québécois, that has put forward an amendment to bring the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information at, no doubt, the behest of the Prime Minister. I am absolutely amazed that the Bloc Québécois would follow the endeavours of the Prime Minister to put the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Leon Benoit:</b> What are you hiding?</div>
    </p><a name="Para286774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Hon. Wayne Easter: </B> The member opposite wants to know what I am hiding. The one thing he knows about the Wheat Board is that it is transparent. It is out there and it provides the information. The member wants access to information to apply to the Canadian Wheat Board because he wants the nuisance requests coming in from its competition, the big grain trade, so it can undermine the Wheat Board and not allow it to do its job in terms of representing primary producers and maximizing returns to primary producers. That is what that party is all about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am absolutely surprised at is that the Bloc would fall for that endeavour of the government because within the province of Quebec there are other agencies similar to this. Does the same principle hold true? </div>
    </p><a name="Para286776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act itself states that the Canadian Wheat Board is not an agency of the Crown. It is not a government institution. It is a marketing institution of farmers. Does the Bloc not fear that by allowing access to information to apply to a farmer marketing institution it is running the risk of the same thing happening to some other agencies within Canada that operate in the interests of Quebec farmers?</div>
    </p><a name="Para286777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely believe that the Bloc is making a tragic error as it relates to the farm community and I would ask the Bloc to reconsider its position on this amendment.</div>

Our fear was that with this access to information, Quebec's toes would be stepped on yet again. Quebec is very well served by the UPA. In that regard, hon. members will simply have to accept our position. We have a different way of doing things in Quebec and we find this is an encroachment into our existing jurisdictions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, as my colleague who loses his cool quite easily—I guess that is his nature—can see, we will never have unanimity here. There will always be someone complaining that something does not work in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, that something—an article or a comma—should not be included in it. We did this work in committee and this was done in the Senate. Nonetheless, I believe that we can still discuss this and see whether there are still some things that can be settled. Through working on this bill we know it well and have assimilated it. We made some recommendations, as did the Liberal Party and the NDP. Even the Conservatives made recommendations because they themselves realized that some things did not make any sense in this bill. But we worked very quickly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members know my concern about passing this bill too quickly. There are still 158 Senate amendments. We are trying to pass it very quickly here in the House of Commons. In my opinion, we need to take the time to go over this thoroughly. Maybe the senators proposed other amendments because they met other witnesses who raised red flags like Mr. Walsh did for us. We have to take the time to consider this and make all the necessary improvements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, it is clear that the accountability act will never get the full support of the House. There will always be something someone does not like or some small problem. If it includes most of the Bloc Québécois' amendments, most of what we asked for, as it does now, we will vote in favour of the bill. However, we cannot ask for the moon. I think that everyone has found something in this bill that is worth supporting. I know that we will vote in favour. The NDP will probably vote in favour, but in the end, the important thing is to have a good law. We have never had a good accountability law, and it is high time we did. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, we must proceed with wisdom and knowledge. We must ensure that it is well-written and that we do not end up with legislation that will cause chaos in the departments or clash with other bills. That is extremely important. So let us take our work seriously, as we have done from the beginning. Obviously, when things are different for Quebec, we will act accordingly. That is why we do not support this amendment.</div>

There has been much discussion on the accountability act since we came back here after the January election. It was discussed in detail by the House and then referred to the Senate. The Senate, as we have heard today on many occasions, spent a lot of time, energy and effort on it, and the senators have suggested a number of amendments. I believe there are 150 amendments. The bill is back before this House for debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say at the outset that I do support the general principles set out in the proposed act, the broad thrust, so to speak. Some issues that I am passionate about are in here and I do support them. In my view, the most important concept by far is the one making deputy ministers accounting officers accountable to Parliament for the individual financial management of their respective departments. Others are some of the provisions concerning lobbying, the repeal of the section of the public service act that allows exempt staff preferential treatment in the civil service, appointments based upon merit, and certain provisions dealing with whistleblower legislation. I, as a member of Parliament, certainly do support them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as has been pointed out by a number of speakers today, this is an omnibus bill. I believe it has about 220 pages. It deals with a whole host of issues dealing with political financing, oversight bodies, et cetera, much of which, I submit, has very little to do with accountability. I believe the previous speaker pointed that out in a question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for the sake of reference, I note that there are many definitions of accountability. One that I use refers to the way in which office holders, elected and non-elected, explain the actions taken through the use of powers delegated to them by ministers or other office holders. When we refer to that definition and other definitions, we see that basically accountability is a duty to explain. It is the duty of those who are responsible to explain their actions. When we take that definition or any other definition of accountability, we can see that most of the provisions in the bill, not all but a lot of them, have very, very little to do with accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back, the bill was referred to a legislative committee of the House. I want to thank each and every member of that committee for the time and effort they put into the bill. It was sent to the Senate. There were 150 amendments made and it was sent back to this House. I should point out for any viewers watching and listening today that a lot of these amendments are inconsequential. They are spelling errors or minor errors that were made in the original drafting of the legislation. Even some of the amendments that we are debating here today are not as substantive or fundamental as perhaps one would consider.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that we are in a minority government. No party has a majority. It is our duty and obligation to express the will of the Canadian people, so I say that once we have this debate here in Parliament, then we vote on the amendments. Then the accountability act of course will have to go back to the Senate. The accountability act will then become law and we can move on to other issues which, I submit, are just as important as the issue we are dealing with at present, or perhaps more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to spend a minute, if I may, talking about the issue that I think is so important in this proposed act. At present, I chair the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. There is a recommendation that we in our committee have made on a number of occasions and it is finally seeing the light of day in the accountability act. That, again, is the concept of making deputy ministers accounting officers to Parliament so that they are personally responsible for the financial and other administration of their particular departments. They would be accountable to organize resources, to deliver programs in compliance with government policies and provisions, to establish and monitor the system of internal control and the signing of accounts so that all accounts truly reflect the actual financial transactions that happened in their particular department, and of course there is the performance of other specific duties.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640">(1640)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this in the context that deputy ministers have very difficult jobs in government now. They are under intense scrutiny from the media, the public, the courts, the opposition and oversight bodies. They answer not only to their ministers but to the Privy Council Office and the Prime Minister. There is a whole host of horizontal issues that they have to deal with on a daily basis. Generally what I am saying is that Canada is well served by its deputy ministers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I look at what has come before the public accounts committee in the last six years, I believe the pendulum has swung too far in one direction, in that the deputy ministers are too much concerned with horizontal issues and policy issues and not as concerned as they ought to be with the actual day to day management of their respective departments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I believe that this provision, if it is coupled with other provisions I will speak to, will improve that particular situation. However, it will improve the situation only if other events happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One issue is the whole oversight regime of the Treasury Board Secretariat. In the public accounts committee, we are presently in the middle of a review of its mandate, roles and responsibilities, with particular emphasis on the change in regime with the expected proclamation of the federal accountability act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I want to say that I believe a lot of work has to be done in developing just exactly what happens to these so-called accounting officers once the act is proclaimed and on the development of a protocol, the role of the comptroller general and how this new system will work. I believe there may be some in government here in Ottawa who just consider that nothing will change. I hope they are not right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that of course is not covered in the act goes right to the foundation of accountability and again very much relates to the topic that I am discussing, That is the tenure of deputy ministers. This is another issue that the public accounts committee has recommended for on many occasions. It has been ignored by the government. The present government and the previous government have basically said that it is no business of Parliament. I find that distressing and disturbing. I do hope that the government will follow the recommendations of the public accounts committee and increase the tenure of deputy ministers so that we can get true accountability on the management of government operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what I find extremely puzzling in this particular legislation is the total disjointedness between what the act says and what the government has been doing since it was sworn in earlier this year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had the Gomery commission. I have a copy of the report right here in my hand. It is called “Restoring Accountability”. It was a very extensive work and made 19 recommendations. The accountability act deals with about five of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will talk about some of the most important. One is that to “redress the imbalance between resources available to the Government and those available to parliamentary committees and their members, the Government should substantially increase funding for parliamentary committees”. Another is that it should increase resources for the public accounts committee. Another is that there should be a charter for public civil servants. The list goes on and on. Thirteen of the 19 recommendations have been ignored by this bill, basically, and some others have had only partial attention paid to them. I find that extremely troubling. I am going to come back to that a little later.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the actions of the government are totally disjointed from what the bill states. Right from the beginning, what did the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> do? The very first thing he did was appoint his co-chair to the Senate. What was the second thing he did? Does anyone know? He appointed his co-chair/senator to cabinet. That is what he did. Does that comply with what the bill states? Is that accountability?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had established a couple of years ago a fundamental principle of accountability in that the committees of this institution elected their own chairs. What is the third thing that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> did? The third thing he said was that is over. The committees that the government chairs would be appointed by the Prime Minister of Canada. He would tell those people that they are the chairs and that is how the system would operate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that accountability? We have the muzzling of members of Parliament in this House. We have had the muzzling of the whole cabinet. We had the spectacle over the weekend of the Prime Minister's communications director writing secretly to the communications directors of all cabinet ministers asking for a review of their respective ministers. That is not accountability. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the appointments process right in the accountability act in the summary. It indicated that appointments would be based on merit. What has happened? Everyone in this institution knows what has happened. Everyone in Canada knows what has happened. Every appointment has been based upon one basic principle, membership in the Conservative Party. A person has to be a high ranking Tory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been following this issue very closely since February. I cannot speak for all provinces so let me say east of Montreal. If there is anyone in this House that knows, of all the dozens and dozens of appointments that were made, of any person east of Montreal who was not a high ranking Conservative member, please stand up at the end of my speech and identify that person. I do not know that such a person exists. Is that accountability?</div>
    </p><a name="Para286819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making is that there is a total, absolute, and utter disturbing disconnect between what the act states and the actions of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I identified some of the broad thrusts that I certainly agree with and am very supportive of, but there are certain things that I really think should not be happening. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole act talks about compliance and the avoidance of sin. We do not need more rules. This is certainly the feeling of the Auditor General. She agrees with me on that. We have sufficient rules. We have the Financial Administration Act. We have a whole host of guidelines, policies and procedures issued by the Treasury Board Secretariat. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe from my experience that those are sufficient. They have to be understood. There has to be a culture of compliance. There has to be compliance in the fundamental principles of personal responsibility and accountability, and if there is any non-compliance, of course there must be sanctions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act calls for additional oversight bodies, a director of procurement, a director of advertising, and a director of prosecutions. It is my view that these oversight bodies are not needed. It amounts to Parliament abandoning its accountability role. It is up to Parliament and the committees of Parliament to hold the executive of government to account.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This institution is an institution of accountability. If we read the recommendations of Mr. Justice Gomery, he comes back to that fundamental principle. He comes back to restoring the imbalance that exists between the legislative branch of Parliament and the executive branch of government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated, there were 19 recommendations made and only five or six were partially adopted. I would ask members to read the recommendations. I would ask members to ask themselves why they were basically ignored and why there was no discussion about these individual very important recommendations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general problem is that there is an imbalance. I have pointed that out. We have the executive of government, the Governor General, the leader, the cabinet and the whole bureaucracy. We have of course the judicial arm and the legislative arm. It is our job and duty to approve appropriations, to pass legislation and, of course, hold the government to account.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650">(1650)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 50 or 60 years we have allowed a very severe imbalance to develop between the legislative arm of government and the executive arm of government. Of course, the executive arm of government has allowed a very severe imbalance to develop between the executive generally and the office of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. We can see what is going on these days when the control is put on individual cabinet ministers. We do not have to say anything more. We can see what is going on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am not suggesting that this started with the office of the present <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. This is a trend that has been developing for the last 40 or 50 years. It has gotten worse in the last eight months, but it did not start eight months ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to restore accountability, we have to cure the imbalance. I suggest and submit that the first step would be to read the first recommendation of the report of Mr. Justice Gomery. He talks about restoring that important balance that is necessary so that we have accountable institutions in Parliament. That is an issue that has been talked and written about but of course nothing ever gets done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making is that there are some good provisions in this act. There are some that I support to my dying breath, but the act, to a large extent, has very little to do with accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I agree with the overall thrust of the legislation. We have, kicking around the chamber, approximately 150 amendments. Some are very inconsequential. Some have been agreed to by the parties. It is up to us as parliamentarians to continue the debate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very complicated piece of legislation. We are getting into the law of unintended consequences, when we think it is good but when somebody else points out something in another act, it may not be as simple and uncomplicated as we first thought. Sometimes it takes a little more thinking and deliberation than we initially thought. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to us to continue the debate and put the amendments to a vote in the chamber. We, representing the Canadian people, will vote on them. The amendments that pass this House will become law. The amendments that do not pass the House will not become law. Let us see the act become law as soon as possible.</div>

We are dealing with situations where if we make one amendment it involves another act. Sometimes it deals with the executive arm of government and sometimes it deals with the legislative arm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not simple. In fairness to everyone who was involved, it is my honest view that the legislative committee put a lot of time, effort and work into this and did its best. I believe the Senate equally put perhaps more time. It had more time to spend on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like a lot of amendments, but again, a lot of them were inconsequential, some of them were spelling typos and things like that, and it is just a matter of the work that went into it. It relates to the complexity of the legislation. As has been pointed out before, the amendments are before us. Let us talk about them. Let us, by representing the Canadian people, vote on them and let us see that this legislation becomes law.</div>

For heaven's sake, for 13 years we had a government that stacked all these boards with its own members. These boards are now recommending certain members who happen to be Conservative. I think that goes to say how very intelligent some of the recommendations are. We have only been in government for nine months and we sure cannot clean up 13 years of Liberal appointees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government made an attempt to put forward the name of a man who was the top, most respected CEO in the entire country. His name is Gwyn Morgan. He would have worked for $1 and would have taken these decisions out of the hands of folks who use patronage to get ahead and infiltrate, almost to the point of infesting all of those areas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the members opposite have a hard time believing or even thinking that anyone but a Liberal could make an appointment to the bench or make any kind of an appointment. However, we put forward an opportunity to remove the patronage issue from this process. To hear the member stand and complain about what is going on is, frankly, very funny but atypical of the members opposite.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member would like to comment on our attempts to clean up the process versus the members' opposite attempt to keep the status quo.</div>

It is a pleasure to again speak to a bill that we worked hard on and to which I have personally contributed on the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with the title of cleaning up politics because that is the title of the document put forward by my predecessor, Ed Broadbent, before the last election. The document is entitled “Cleaning up Politics: Demanding Changes in Ethics and Accountability”. The seven point plan that Mr. Broadbent put forward is pretty straightforward but still a little elusive, notwithstanding some of the important things that have been brought forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point was to have democratic accountability for MPs. What he was referring to was that no MP should ignore the wishes or intents of his or her voters for personal gain. What he was talking about is that MPs should not be able to cross the floor simply so they can be vaulted into cabinet. It is important to note that he was not talking about the present government. He was talking about the previous government. That is something we were not able to attain in this bill but we will continue to fight for that because the basic premise of democracy is not to have MPs cross the floor at their will and for their personal gain. It must stop. The government in Manitoba is putting forward a bill that will do that and the Government of Canada should do the same.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point on his list was fixed election dates. I am glad to say that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2221899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2221899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-16</A> is on its way. Hopefully it will pass through the Senate a little easier than Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> will, for the sake of all of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point was to have transparent leadership contests. A certain member of the Liberal Party, who went on to become the leader of the Liberal Party and the prime minister, was able to raise $12 million for his leadership campaign. Some would say that the $12 million were not necessary because, as we all know, it was not much of a contest. However, before the government gets too high on its horse, the present Prime Minister spent $2.7 million for his leadership contest. It seems like a bargain by comparison but, nonetheless, we need to have less money injected into the body politic and take the money out of politics. We saw what kind of effect that can have on the body politic in the most recent American elections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point was real electoral reform. We will continue to fight for this. We do not believe that what we have seen with the unelected Senate is anything that anyone can be proud of and it is certainly showing that our democratic institutions need an overhaul. One of the things we have put forward, following along many reports going back to the Pépin-Robarts report and others, is the need to change our democratic institution so it is reflective of the will of the people. We can look at perhaps a first past the post system with proportionality, such as they have in New Zealand, Scotland and, in fact, in most of the rest of the world save two other jurisdictions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point was to end unregulated lobbying. I am pleased to say that there are changes in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> about lobbying. I am sad to say that there are some amendments being put forward by the Senate to change that. What seems to be elusive is what my colleague, Mr. Broadbent, put forward, which is that we deal with firms that act as both lobbyists and government consultants. This is a conflict of interest as they are playing both sides of the street. We saw that with the previous government and we do not want to see that happen in the future. If a firm is working for government one day, the firm should not be able to turn around and lobby the next day. It creates a perception of influence peddling, and we have seen examples of that before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to still deal with is the fact that lobby firms, public relations firms, must have clear rules in front of them for the sake of our democratic institutions and we need to ensure it is understood that government is here to serve the people and not the friends of any particular party. Sadly, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> does not end that type of lobbying and we need to continue to work on that. We provided amendments but they were ruled out of order. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710">(1710)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth point on Mr. Broadbent's list was ethical appointments. Just recently a panel of experts looked at reforming the National Capital Commission here in Ottawa. It should be noted that the National Capital Commission, which goes back to 1959, was always an appointed body based on who one knew and on political patronage. We hope that will change but it should not be based on a whim. It should be based on a structure so that appointments can function properly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We proposed, and the bill does have amendments, to have a public appointments commission. Those amendments were taken from Mr. Broadbent's work on ethical appointments. We believe we should toss out the whole idea of patronage when it comes to appointments. With a possible 4,000 appointments, we believe it is dangerous to allow them to be motivated by politics. In fact, they should be motivated by merit to serve Canadian people and not to serve any political party which, sadly, was the case, not just with the previous government but back all the way to Macdonald. Canadian history is littered with problems in and around political appointments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commission that my colleague from Winnipeg worked on and was derived from Mr. Broadbent's idea makes sense. As was mentioned earlier, the government had concerns about the person it tried to appoint to fulfill this job. The problem was not necessarily with Mr. Morgan's abilities to do the job but with the way in which it was being done. We had in front of us a bill that would change the appointments process and the government tried to cut off the process and appoint its own person but then cried foul when it was not accepted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was that we had a bill before the House which talked about a public appointments commission but the government decided it knew better and wanted to appoint its person who, quite rightly, was rejected. It was not because of the person himself or his merit. It was because the government put forward someone ahead of a bill that was in front of Parliament to create a public appointments commission. On another day I could give my opinion on that person for that job, but I will leave that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have a public appointments process and that brings in ethical appointments. It is too important for Canadians and for the body politics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point Mr. Broadbent put forward was to reform the access to information and, my gosh, do we need work there. We have problems presently with the government. I recently had an access to information on something that was not controversial and I received three lines and 18 pages blanked out. I wondered if something as controversial as a museum was actually of note to the security of the country and puts us all in jeopardy. Apparently it does and one of the problems is that the Access to Information Act is too limited, too controlling and does not serve Canadians well. We clearly need to change that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure light is shed on government and that we have a window on the decision making of government, not simply to allow people who want to be critical of the government, while that is important, but to allow anyone who wants to understand how government works and the motivations behind policy and, quite frankly, being able to form policy, are allowed to have their voices heard by way of knowing what the decisions were of the government. There are changes in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> but we need a heck of a lot more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about some of the things that we were able to provide and propose as a party. We did not oppose the idea of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. In fact, in principle we supported it in committee and where we thought changes were needed we proposed alternatives. I already mentioned our proposal for the public appointments commission which was accepted as amended and put into the bill. One of the things I put forward was to ensure that all contracts of $10,000 or more be on the public record. We had to fight to get that in but it is in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715">(1715)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para286878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One concern Canadians had with the previous government in the sponsorship case was contracts without a paper trail. Often we did not know who was providing the service or what that service was. One of the amendments the NDP put forward in the area of procurement was to ensure that all contracts of $10,000 or more would now be on the public record. I would have preferred that it had been a lesser amount, but that is what we agreed to on compromise. Now any Canadian can find out who is providing a service to the government and who is getting the contracts. They will know if they are getting value for their money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP believes fundamentally in lowering the donation that people can make to $1,000. Sadly, in the amendments before us, the Senate has deemed it in its infinite unelected wisdom to change that to $2,000. I know this was something the Liberal Party preferred. I think most people would agree that $1,000 is fine and reasonable. We would like to see that amendment defeated. No constituent of mine has called me to ask me to ensure the donation limit is increased from $1,000 to $2,000. In fact, I would submit that any member of the House could go out and claim that was a good idea in a town hall meeting or in a householder.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP also believes it is important to strengthen the whistleblowing protection in the act. Before I was elected to this place, I worked with many people in the community around whistleblowing. When Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1395901,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1395901&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> was before the House, it was not sufficient. I was delighted to see it was not proclaimed because it was not good legislation, as some might have suggested. In fact, people who had been negatively affected as whistleblowers were adamant. They said we needed to change those parts of the whistleblower protection act to ensure it reflected their concerns. That has been done and I hope we will not tinker with that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflict of interest rules allowing Canadians to make complaints to the new conflict of interest and ethics commissioner is something we have provided by ensuring that positive propositions were added to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of first nations' rights within the act is something I personally moved through committee to ensure they were not sideswiped by something that was not about them. First nations were almost folded into the equation when they should not have been.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP amended the bill to ensure we not only changed the appointments process, but in effect changed the whole notion of patronage. If there is one thing, as my colleague from Winnipeg has said, we should ensure that the public appointments process remains in the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way appointments were done in previous governments was via a telephone and a Rolodex and who was known in the PMO. Those days are gone, fineto, adios. Canadians have been clear that this kind of politics is not only admonished, but it is something that will not be accepted. I challenge anyone in this place to go out and debate the need to bring back patronage appointments in our democratic system and our democratic framework. Thankfully those days are gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure we have a clear understanding of the bill. It is not about getting a pound of flesh. If it is about that, then I suggest members have missed the point. If the government or any of the opposition parties are trying to exact revenge with this bill, then they are clearly misguided. Canadians are tired of it. We do not need to deepen the cynicism of politics. In fact, what the opposition is trying to do is to ensure there are clear rules so we can build back the trust that has been lost with Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, we need to pass the bill to ensure we have merit based appointments so we no longer have people appointed to bodies, which are so important to the public good, who potentially undermine the public good.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the bill in total, all of us have concerns about it. We have stated those concerns in committee. We proposed alternatives to it so it would be something of which we could be proud. In the end, we wanted to go back to our constituents and say that we did everything we could to ensure we had clear rules that would bring back responsibility to government, that would bring back clear representation to our citizens, the constituents we represent. No longer could we say that the decisions being made in government were being made under a cloud of suspicion over whose interests were being served. Quite frankly, that was the equation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure the following: when people are lobbying the government, they are not doing it because of who they know; when people blow the whistle, they will not have their career ruined because they stood up for the public interest; when someone is appointed to the head of a Crown corporation, it is based strictly on merit alone; and when people decide they will contribute to government, it is based solely on the public good and not on their private interests. Those are the key issues we all have to look at when we look at Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, the amendments that have come back to this place from the other place do not do that. They are riddled with self-interest. They will undermine the public trust and ultimately, I believe, undermine the whole notion of the necessity for the other place. When we have the other place sending legislation back to this place, legislation that has been gutted of many well thought out sensible ideas for its self interest, it speaks for itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could underline many of those amendments, but two in particular are worth underlining. First is changing the limit one can give from $1,000 to $2,000. This has been put forward by people who are not even elected, which raises all sorts of question marks. Many people in the other place spend much of their time raising money for political parties. Perhaps that is the reason. The other issue we have to examine is changes to lobbying. We need to strengthen our oversight on lobbying, not weaken it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, we have an unelected body, the other place, sending back to an elected body incredible amendments in terms of the number, but more important, in terms of the scope and what they will do to the bill. That raises the question of the value of the other place when it does such a thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about real accountability and when we see what has recently happened and how the bill has been played with and manipulated by the other place, we have to then suggest this. The next project, after the bill has passed, is to take a look at how we can reform, modify and change the other place to make it a lot more accountable and democratic so it will not meddle in the voice of everyday Canadians who elected us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if the bill is destroyed and not passed, every one of us will have to answer as to what we did and why. My belief is Canadians wanted to see us pass a bill with clear rules and clear reform for them. The bill is not about us. It is about Canadians. We need to pass the bill and ensure the values that Canadians entrusted to us to promote are the bottom line, not the interests of people in the other place or anywhere else.</div>

    </p><a name="Para286896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence of the work of the government operations and estimates committee, the bill was virtually rewritten. One of the changes was to create a new position, a new public integrity officer of Parliament, who would be in the same vein as the Auditor General or the Privacy Commissioner, et cetera. That bill was unanimously passed by all parties in committee with all of those changes. It came to the House, was fully debated and unanimously passed by all parties in this place. In fact, on the second last day of the last Parliament, it received royal assent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bill is extremely important to the whole accountability mechanism. It provides protection for the public service, for those who feel they have information about some alleged wrongdoings or other reprisals, as defined in the bill, to come forward to get explanations to this watchdog who will report to Parliament.

That is really important. This is cutting edge and if Bill C-11 had been proclaimed then, the government of the day would have had the excuse of saying it wanted to see it operate for a while.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak to people who have actually blown the whistle, like Dr. Chopra. Ask what he thinks of it.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another side to that is that we need to extend the whistleblower legislation beyond crown corporations and governments.

We need to take a look at that after the bill is passed and perhaps amend it down the road. I suppose that is for another day but for now, we should pass this bill.

Liberal members raised these concerns at committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the vast majority of amendments proposed by the Liberal members on the Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> committee last spring were defeated by the NDP-Conservative coalition. This was done for political and partisan reasons. It was clear then that public relations and scoring cheap political points were more important than bringing forward legislation that would in fact live up to its name.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing more than 140 witnesses through many hours of hearings, the Senate committee under the leadership of Senator Day has placed before us amendments that we should seriously consider. Notwithstanding the constant flow of feigned outrage from the Treasury Board president, it would be totally irresponsible for the government and the House to ignore reasonable amendments that seek to strengthen the legislation thereby ensuring that it is in line with the charter and in the public interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Treasury Board president</A> who suggested in his own appearance before the Senate that the bill had been, to use his exact words, “examined with a microscope”. We now find out that this microscope was more like a periscope: long on rhetoric and narrow in focus.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Hutton, coordinator of the Federal Accountability Initiative for Reform, described the drafting process that was employed to craft Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> as “deeply flawed”. He said that the bill “is complex and is full of loopholes when you dig into it. I feel that the committees have been given an impossible task, namely trying to turn this into effective legislation that meets intent”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to repairing numerous drafting errors which should have been caught before the bill was introduced, key amendments that came back include political financing. This is an area of particular importance to me, as it is to all members of the House of Commons. Not only am I a member of Parliament but, as many other members have done, I have run campaigns for other candidates and have worked a lot of elections. I was the president of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party sitting on the national executive and got involved in the financing of political parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that we ensure that any new political donation regime does not unfairly restrict the participation of political parties in debate. I suggest the proposed change to $2,000 per year, the limit that came back from the other place, is an important change.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003 <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',654227,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=654227&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bill C-24</A> was introduced and passed by the Liberal government of former prime minister Jean Chrétien. It radically changed how elections are financed in Canada, notably reducing the amount of allowable donations to political parties. The current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board </A> acknowledged the usefulness of Bill C-24, which in fact contained a clause for its review, but there has been no review. There has just been introduction in this bill of more political reform, which I do not think makes a lot of sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the government has failed to produce any evidence that the existing limits are undermining the electoral process at the federal level. Furthermore, political donations play an important role in our democratic system. Limiting them too strictly has the potential to limit participation of smaller political parties, as well as all Canadians who wish to participate in the political system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would the government introduce these strict limits? If we look across Canada at what provinces are doing in their own electoral districts, it is pretty interesting. I would like to take a minute to let people know what those limits are across Canada right now.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly not just Liberals who are making the case that these stringent donation limits are unreasonable and unnecessary.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the maximum personal contribution to $2,000 from the proposed $1,000 would still be a significant reduction from the current $5,400 that came in under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',654227,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=654227&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>, but I would support the $2,000 limit. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other amendments that involve access to information and technical changes that were necessary because it was rushed legislation. Certainly, the clearest proof of that was the recent attempt to alter the legislation to cover up the practice of the Conservative Party of not counting delegate fees as political donations, which was clearly not the intent of the act. It was never understood by any political party that I know of as being the case, and it has been acknowledged by Canada's Chief Electoral Officer as being the wrong policy.</div>

Of some 140, I think 40 were actually made by Conservative senators. They have a job to do and it is reflective of the work that they did. It is a mischaracterization of the Senate's work to say that they are dragging their feet because they did their job. They had the time to do it which we were not given in this place. That is the reality.</div>

It dealt with accountability. One of the consistent messages coming from the legal professors and experts commenting on the bill was that they were concerned that the bill was based on a foundation of presumption of guilt of the public service, politicians and everyone involved in public life as opposed to the presumption of innocence. The concern was that many of the administrative overlays being proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> would decrease the productivity of the public service because everyone was swept under the same umbrella of guilt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting point for them to raise. I wonder if the member has a comment on whether or not the concerns with regard to the accountability of this place should have focused more in terms of where the risk elements were and where we needed to shore up things rather than to blanket the whole system with a layer of administrative and unproductive activity.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from the opposite side that some of these recommendations came as a result of circumstances reported by Justice John Gomery. In fact, Professor Denis Saint-Martin of the University of Montreal said, in terms of recommending what needs to be fixed, the two approaches are totally different. In some other ways, as I indicated with political financing, we are not getting at what the problems really are. We are focused on the wrong issues and taking attention away from those things that really matter.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this place all agree that the people at the Public Service of Canada are worthy of our respect and we are thankful to them. They are honest hard-working people. We need to ensure that any changes that we make respect that and if there is behaviour that needs to be corrected, we catch that behaviour, but not blanket the entire public service and direct our attention on circumstances or issues that are not broken. We should focus on things that need attention.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> stated that he was proud of his race for the Guinness record. He said that this bill could have been adopted just nine weeks after the election on January 23 and that members had put in 90 hours of work in six weeks and had passed the bill in 72 days. He was bragging and very proud of this performance, when he should have been a bit sad. Today, he can see that that whole mad dash was for nought.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the pleasure of sitting on the Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> legislative committee. I saw, with my own eyes, that the witnesses did not have time to explain fully. They had only two minutes each and had to speak in quick succession. The witnesses had no time to go into detail, and we did not have time to question them. They gave us lengthy documents that we did not have time to consult. We did not even have time to read them between the meetings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only natural that a bill that was looked at quickly should come back to this House today with so many amendments. This is a substantial bill approximately 200 pages in length, with 300 clauses. Some witnesses even refused to appear before the Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> legislative committee, saying that they had not had time to study and analyze the bill. As a result, we did not hear all the important witnesses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there were witnesses, I nearly always used what little time I had to ask them one question that I felt was crucial. I asked them whether they believed that, with the bill as it is currently written, the sponsorship scandal could happen again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately none of the witnesses said this could not happen again, despite the 300 clauses in the bill. This needed to happen quickly and we did not have the time to look at anything. Furthermore, we knew, and we said, that this bill had some problems. If you check the blues of that committee, you will see that a number of committee members—witnesses as well as MPs—noticed these problems, raised them and deplored them. We said time and time again that there would be problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying that goes, “Slowly but surely”. Another one goes, “Something worth doing is worth doing well”. We cannot make a flower grow any faster by pulling on its stem. Often a bill is like a small flower. Today, this government is no further ahead. It is far from its nine weeks—maybe it had an even shorter goal—and 72 hours of work. We should have taken our time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work done in committee is extremely important. However, it is nice to have the time, between two witnesses, to read what the witnesses have prepared or even to read it in advance if they had time to send documents beforehand. The members of the legislative committee did not have time to read the documents beforehand and did not have time to read them afterward because they had to hurry off to attend another committee meeting. In the meantime, while we were going over Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics slammed on the brakes, even though the Access to Information Act should have been included in BIll <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2.</A></div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2000, the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Justice at the time struck a task force to review the act, the regulations and the policies on which the present access to information scheme is based. In November 2001, the Bryden committee—I do not know if that name rings a bell, Mr. Speaker, but it has been coming up regularly for quite a while in this place—proposed a dozen recommendations that it regarded as priorities. I should point out that the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> signed that report. This House also had an opportunity to debate this act, when a number of members introduced private members’ bills.

    </p><a name="Para286986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is another proverb which says that nature abhors a vacuum. This is why the Senate proposed 158 amendments. Senators took their time. They reviewed the legislation and in fact they heard witnesses who had come before our committee. However, they took the time to talk to these people, to read their submissions and to listen to what they had to say. So, senators proposed 158 amendments. Now, the government is coming back with 50 clauses that it wants to change regarding these amendments. The Liberal Party also has an amendment dealing with at least four aspects of the bill, while the Bloc Québécois is proposing an amendment dealing with four measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the House of Commons is doing the work that the committee should have done last spring, slowly, not too quickly, but surely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc's amendments are very relevant. First, we have the two ethics commissioners. It is obvious that there should only be one commissioner, because the Senate's ethics counsellor is only accountable to a Senate committee. There is no need to elaborate on this situation. Let us just say that their ethics counsellor is somewhat like the Howard Wilson that we had here, who was accountable to the then Prime Minister. </div>
    </p><a name="Para286989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Canadian Wheat Board, it is appropriate that it be added to the list of organizations subject to the Access to Information Act. Why? Because three administrators are appointed by the government. The Auditor General already has the right to audit this board. Some say that the government does not fund this organization, but that is not true. It guarantees the contracts of the board's clients. For 20 years the Canadian Wheat Board has cost Canadian and Quebec taxpayers several billions of dollars. That is right. The money is not an issue. But at least the board should be subject to the Access to Information Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc amendments also require that documents used to prepare internal audit reports be subject to the Access to Information Act. Recent events, including the sponsorship scandal, have shown that it is absolutely necessary for the public to have access to these documents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an interpretation clause on the public interest. It seems to me that it is important to be able to act in the public interest when a document is not accessible. We must prove that it is in the public interest to have access. If it is proven to be in the public interest, it seems normal to me that a government open its books.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, delegate expenses at political conventions must be considered donations because that is what they are. Delegates are charged almost $1,000 to attend a convention or meeting. However, we know that is not the real cost. Obviously a profit is made and that must be considered as financing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para286993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the Bloc subamendments. As I mentioned earlier, the House of Commons is now doing the work that it should have done slowly but surely last spring.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Wheat Board is financed in part—if one can say “in part”—by Quebec and Canadian taxpayers. That is why we feel it is important that it be subject to the Access to Information Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General can investigate the organization. The government appoints five directors. It is not quite the same as a crown corporation, but we cannot say that whether some crown corporations are subject to the act depends on how much money they get from the government. The Canadian Wheat Board is funded in part by the government—indirectly, perhaps, but it is funded. Directors are appointed and the Auditor General can investigate. We think it makes sense for it to be subject to the Access to Information Act. </div>

The fact is that the Government of Canada does not in any way subsidize the Canadian Wheat Board. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government of Canada does, from time to time, by order in council, is it provides guarantees to the wheat pools in terms of the marketing of grain. I will give an analogy. It would almost be the same as acting like a bank. If the government were to provide a loan guarantee to a manufacturer, it would not be reasonable to expect that the manufacturer should then become subject to access to information. On the contrary. A person interested in the issue would make an access to information request to the government that provided the money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore is wrong to suggest that the Government of Canada is providing billions to the Canadian Wheat Board because it is not. An incident occurred five or six years ago where it had to provide some millions of dollars to back up the government guarantee on initial prices but that money went to producers, which was a good thing. I would hope that the Bloc Québécois reconsiders its motion to put the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to speak to the accountability act and amendments made thereto. Specifically I will address the amendment made to put the Canadian Wheat Board under the Access to Information Act. It was interesting earlier listening to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78964,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78964&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board</A> as he tried to justify putting the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information but he failed miserably in terms of his argument. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked the parliamentary secretary to justify his statement that farmers wanted access to information to apply, he failed to answer the question and went on a bit of a rant by saying that anyone who would oppose access to information must not want any crown corporation to fall under access. He knows that is not true. We believe that, yes, government agencies and government departments should fall under access to information, but let us be clear, the Canadian Wheat Board is not a government agency and that is the bottom line.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food </A> has tried to imply the same thing many times. In fact, in a letter to the chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs who was looking at this bill, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That parliamentary secretary is wrong also. The Canadian Wheat Board does provide basically the same as access to information but does not need to deal with the nuisance requests that we get through access to information. It provides an annual report. It has elected directors and those directors hold meetings with their constituents, the same as we do. That is a way of providing access. They hold annual meetings at which financial officers of the Canadian Wheat Board are there to answer questions. They have full access through the audited report. The Auditor General also is a possibility, as well as the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways, the government opposite does remind us of a government in the 1800s in terms of some of the policies it brings forward. Maybe it is thinking back to the time prior to 1998, when in fact the Canadian Wheat Board was seen as an agency of the Government of Canada, but that changed legislatively in 1998. Amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act were made and control of the corporation was given over to farmers. What it says in the act itself about whether it is an agency or not is found in subsection 4(2) of the Canadian Wheat Board Act, which states:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, this amendment is back in here by the Bloc at the behest of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, who will do almost anything to undermine the board's competitiveness.

    </p><a name="Para287038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at a little history. Initially, the government and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> himself did not bring forward a government amendment to put the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information in the first instance. There is a reason for that. The minister knows and he knows full well that the legal advice from within the Government of Canada from the Department of Justice was not to put the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information, because it is not a government entity and it is not a government agency. That is why. To this day we have not seen an amendment from the government itself to put the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the bill was at committee, it was really the NDP member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A>, in his brief love affair with the Conservative government as they worked on the accountability act together, who was trying to do things.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A> made an amendment in haste to put the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information and the government was overjoyed to accept it. When the bill came back to the House, the NDP had seen the error of its ways and agreed to vote in favour of another amendment that would have taken access to information out of the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the meantime, something happened. We really do not know what. We do know that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> had a little chat with the leader of the separatists and suddenly the Bloc Québécois voted against the amendment to take the Wheat Board out from under access to information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a deal cut? I do not know, but it seems awfully strange to me that a discussion between the Prime Minister of Canada and the leader of a separatist party would create a deal to put the Canadian Wheat Board under access to information. It is awfully suspicious.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do know what the end result of this will be.

Is the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> doing favours for them? Or who? In any event, we know that the Bloc sold out western farmers in that amendment by putting access to information up against the Canadian Wheat Board. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bill got to the Senate, the place of sober second thought, the Senate did in fact amend it and got it out again. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bill got to the Senate, the place of sober second thought, the Senate amended it and sent it out again. Now we have the Bloc bringing forward the amendment again. What is happening is interesting. Something is going on between the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the leader of the separatist party but it will be the farmers in western Canada who will be paying a price for the Prime Minister's little arrangement with the leader of the separatist party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have this deal for the third time to weaken the board by access requests. The government has only one agenda with respect to the Canadian Wheat Board and that is its destruction through any means, which it will take right up to the very line of legality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary told the western producer, which was quoted in an April 20 article of this year after the bill had been introduced and the provision of the Canadian Wheat Board was not included, and keep in mind that I said the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> and the government did not include it, that “The minister”, meaning the President of the Treasury Board, “told me that there is every intention to make the change (to include the Canadian Wheat Board) but there just wasn't time to get it into the bill”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say that the real problem was trying to “get the wording right” in order to find a way to prevent the loss of commercially sensitive information. Given that the government never introduced the amendment, we can only conclude that it never found the right wording to protect the commercially sensitive information and the government accepted the NDP amendments to include the Canadian Wheat Board because it no longer cared if that information was protected.</div>

Because there were so few people in the House it would give them a chance to have a dialogue. That change was adopted by the House and I am pleased that I had an opportunity to leave that fingerprint on this place.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in June I asked a question of the foreign affairs minister. It had to do with Mr. Huseyin Celil who had travelled to Uzbekistan, had been detained by the Uzbek authorities and had been sentenced in absentia to death in China for apparently alleged terrorist activities, et cetera.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had this conversation with the parliamentary secretary before, but it is timely that we have just come through a situation with the APEC meetings that the Prime Minister had an on again, off again, on again, off again meeting, albeit an informal one, 15 minutes long to discuss numerous issues. Interestingly enough the name that came up with regard to human rights was Huseyin Celil. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Celil has become the government's poster boy on the issue of human rights. I am really surprised that at the APEC meetings the Prime Minister chose Mr. Celil as the person whose case would be used with regard to our concerns for human rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a long tradition of defending the rights and freedoms of the individual. We have a Canadian citizen, Mr. Celil, an imam of the Muslim faith.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had asked my question at a time when Mr. Celil had been detained by the Uzbek authorities. There is a relationship between Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China and others. It is called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. It is similar to Interpol. It basically says that if someone is in a jurisdiction and there is a quasi-Interpol notice that the person be detained, it will cooperate and have the person extradited to a jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is that Mr. Celil was detained in Uzbekistan when he was there visiting with family members and he was going to be extradited. I asked the foreign affairs minister whether he would visit the ambassador in the U.S., since Canada does not have an ambassador from Uzbekistan, to negotiate the release of Mr. Celil and send a delegation to Uzbekistan to get Mr. Celil into Canada's hands. The answer from Uzbekistan was that it would have preferred to have Mr. Celil released to Canada but Canada had shown insufficient interest in the file.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Mr. Celil has been extradited to China, why is it that now we are talking about Huseyin Celil when it is in fact too late?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeated representations have been made.

    </p><a name="Para287068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the hon. member that we are making every effort to obtain access to Mr. Celil in China. We will continue efforts to confirm Mr. Celil's well-being and to ensure that he is afforded due process and that his rights are protected. Meanwhile, DFAIT officials continue to maintain regular contact with Mr. Celil's family in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and China share important political, economic and people to people ties. Canada remains committed to building our strong bilateral relationship. This government is chairing Canada's relationship with China very effectively. Our primary goal is to protect the interests of Canadians in tune with our values. We understand China's considerable and growing importance to Canada and to the world politically and economically. For these reasons, we are committed to full and constructive relations with the government of the People's Republic of China wherever our interests are at stake, including in trade and investment, human rights and the rule of law, security, for example, on crime and terrorism, health and on the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there challenges in our relationship? Of course there are challenges. There are differences in outlook and interests in all bilateral relationships. That is the nature of and reason for diplomacy. This government will always defend the interests of Canadians and will seek to influence China on issues of significance to Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada maintains five diplomatic missions throughout China. Canada's embassy in Beijing is our largest in the world. It operates major trade and political development assistance and immigration programs. China is Canada's second largest trading partner after the United States, and commercial activity between our two countries continues to grow. China is also a source and destination for investment and a partner for science and technology.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government is working to create the right environment for Canada's business community to benefit from China's potential in all these areas through the negotiation and implementation of various agreements. Therefore, our relationship with China is very important and we bring this issue out in front.</div>

I am really saddened that he brought in this information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, China does not recognize dual citizenship. It does not recognize Mr. Celil's Canadian citizenship. </div>
    </p><a name="Para287075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the parliamentary secretary said, Mr. Celil has been tried. He has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. There was no legal representation. This was in violation of the Vienna convention and a bilateral agreement on consular affairs. We were not advised that he was in China's custody. There was no disclosure of the charges. There was no consular access. He was not assured of having due process under the law, and in fact, he had no legal representation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para287076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary is a good man, I understand that, but he is totally misinformed. Mr. Celil has now been sentenced to 15 years and it is because of the incompetence of the Conservative government that he is in jail. It did not take action when it was asked to take action, to go to Uzbekistan and get that man out.</div>
