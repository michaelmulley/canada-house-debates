<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC)</B> moved that Bill 
C-249, an act to amend the Access to Information Act (Crown 
corporations and the Canadian Wheat Board) be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is certainly nice to be back in the 
House after the Easter break.  It is also nice to see you in the 
Chair, as well as my colleagues from the House, and to get back 
to the parry and thrust of the House and politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to stand, as the first member in the House 
after the break, to talk about something that I am very 
passionate about and something I feel is very important with 
respect to governments of all kinds, that is, openness and 
transparency, where in fact governments and crown corporations 
should be accountable to the people that they serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the bill speaks to the Access to Information Act 
and openness and transparency, particularly by crown corporations 
but also by the Canadian Wheat Board.  Being a member of 
parliament from an area in western Canada, I have a great deal of 
responsibility for the agricultural community.  A lot of 
producers talk to me on a fairly regular basis with respect to 
not only agriculture but the role that is currently being played 
by the Canadian Wheat Board in western Canada and the marketing 
of particular products, such as wheat and barley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-249 unfortunately, and I underline the term 
unfortunately, has been deemed to not be a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also sit on the private members' business committee.  We are 
currently looking at the possibility of having all private 
members' business, whether it be bills or motions, made votable. 
I personally believe a good first step to the renewal of this 
Chamber and this House would be to give all members of parliament 
the opportunity to put forward what they feel are necessary 
changes to government policy and to have their changes voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this bill is not votable.  Having sat on that 
committee, I do take some responsibility I suppose but I still 
suggest very strongly that this bill should be votable.  I know 
other members of other parties will agree with me when I say that 
the Access to Information Act is not there simply for governments 
to be able to not put information forward but for members, not 
only of parliament but also of the public, to access information 
from crown corporations and government which they feel is 
rightfully theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill raises a very important question for policymakers to 
answer.  Should the Access to Information Act be extended to 
include crown corporations, including the Canadian Wheat Board as 
it is currently structured, as defined under the Financial 
Administrations Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some crown corporations are already subject to the Access to 
Information Act, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. Others, such as Canada Post and the Atomic Energy of 
Canada Limited, are not.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument made most often by these companies and the federal 
government is that because they are subject to competitive 
pressures of the marketplace, they should be exempt from the 
Access to Information Act.  Their legitimate fear is that their 
competitors will use the act to obtain sensitive information that 
could be used to undermine the corporation's competitive 
advantage.  That is a legitimate concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What most people do not realize, however, is that under section 
18 of the Access to Information Act, government institutions can 
exempt competitively sensitive information.  The act says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of a government institution may refuse to disclose any 
record requested under this Act that contains (a) trade secrets 
or financial, commercial, scientific or technical information 
that belongs to the Government of Canada or a government 
institution and has substantial value or is reasonably likely to 
have substantial value; (b) information the disclosure of which 
could reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive 
position of a government institution; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I read that section is that we already have the 
ability under the act to not provide information that would or 
could reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive 
position of a government institution.  We cannot use that excuse 
to not open up the boundaries of access to information to other 
crown corporations, including the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to exclude information, the disclosure of which could 
reasonably be expected to be materially injurious to the 
financial interests of the Government of Canada.  Section 18 then 
may offer exemptions significant enough under the act that crown 
corporations and the Canadian Wheat Board would be able to comply 
with the act without having to disclose sensitive, competitive 
information.  What it would do is allow that openness and 
transparency of these corporations, including the Canadian Wheat 
Board, to be made mandatory to give information that does not 
fall within these categories.  I will talk to that briefly in a 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill I have put forward today not only addresses some of the 
most paramount concerns farmers have with the Canadian Wheat 
Board but of all crown corporations that include transparency and 
accountability.  As in any crown corporation or, as the Canadian 
Wheat Board is now known, a mixed corporation, Canadians expect 
no less and they should continue to expect no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Wheat Board was incorporated by the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act in 1935 it was established to market, 
interprovincially and for export, Canadian wheat and barley for 
producers.  The wheat board is a monopoly system.  If a producer 
wants to sell wheat or barley outside the Canadian Wheat Board, 
he must apply for an export permit.  This means he sells his 
product to the Canadian Wheat Board, obtains a permit, buys the 
wheat back from the Canadian Wheat Board and then sells it on the 
open market.  In other words, the farmer has no choice as to how 
he markets his commodity.  It has to go through the Canadian 
Wheat Board, a wheat board that generates sales of wheat and 
barley in excess of approximately $6 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am getting at is that the farmers do not have a 
choice but to market through the Canadian Wheat Board.  There is 
a lot of money at stake for the producers so why should the CWB 
not be accountable and transparent to those very producers, those 
very people it is there to serve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere throughout the over 65 year history of the Canadian 
Wheat Board, farmers started to question the agency that was 
supposed to represent their best interests.  They started to 
question its monopoly and the returns compared to that of the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most farmers in western Canada do not want to eliminate the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  Others may speak to that comment and may 
well disagree with it, but the people I have talked to have 
initially said that they do not want necessarily to get rid of 
the Canadian Wheat Board.  They simply want it to be able to 
compete in an open and transparent basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect accountability for publicly funded 
institutions, as they should be.  I firmly believe that the bill 
before us today would only add to that accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk very briefly about why this particular piece of 
legislation is before the House today:  openness and 
transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a previous life and in a previous form of government, I 
learned a long time ago that it is much better to be open to the 
people and the public we serve.  In the municipal government 
there is nothing hidden behind closed doors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1115

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found out a long time ago when there is a closed door meeting, 
even if they are only talking about what to serve on the menu, 
immediately there is some distrust.  When the doors are closed 
and the information is not flowing, something is happening behind 
those doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening with the wheat board.  I do not 
believe that there is anything sinister happening behind those 
closed doors.  I believe that the Canadian Wheat Board is hiding 
behind those doors and not allowing the true information to come 
forward.  If it does, I do not believe that it will be 
detrimental to the operations of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one small example.  A number of months ago the 
Canadian Wheat Board commissioned a survey.  It was its survey, 
done of its producers.  Some 1,500 people were surveyed. They 
were asked to answer questions.  The questions were asked, the 
data were gathered, and that information is not available to the 
public.  Although it was gathered from the public, gathered from 
the people who are the stakeholders in the corporation, the 
information from that survey is not made available publicly 
because, I am told, it is way too sensitive commercially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even accept that the information gathered was too 
sensitive commercially.  By the way, I went to the access to 
information office and was told quite emphatically that the 
corporation did not fall within the guidelines of access to 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then wrote a letter to the board and asked for the survey 
results and was told that I could not access them or be given the 
results.  Then I asked a simple question: could I have the 
questions that were asked in the survey?  I did not ask for the 
information that was gleaned or all the data gathered.  It was a 
matter of the questions that were asked of the people who 
supplied the information.  I was told that the information was 
way too sensitive and commercial.  I could not even get the 
questions that they asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board asked those questions of 1,500 people.  They were not 
meant to be kept secret.  It was simply a matter of giving me the 
questions asked, and I could not get them.  Even though I believe 
the information the board would have given me would not have 
impacted on its operations at all, it tells me that there is a 
closed door mentality that it does not have to give information 
and therefore it will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That adds another nail into coffin of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
That is not what I want.  I want openness and transparency from 
the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information is supposed to work quite simply.  A 
person filing a request pays $5 to ask for a range of records 
held by federal departments and agencies including memos, 
briefing notes, expense reports and audits.  For the initial $5 
fee the person receives five hours of government search and 
preparation time, beyond which departments may charge additional 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information does not go as smoothly as it is supposed 
to go.  In fact a recent report by the information commissioner, 
Mr. John Reid, was highly critical of the federal government for 
undermining the spirit of openness by showing palpable animosity 
toward the process.  The commissioner stated that some 
bureaucrats have even threatened the career prospects of their 
staff members that investigate complaints from dissatisfied 
people who have filed access to information requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally contrary to the act.  Moreover, Federal Court of 
Canada Justice Edmond Blanchard ruled recently that the federal 
government tried to circumvent the will of the information act by 
refusing to release papers explaining the reasons behind one of 
cabinet's environmental decisions relating to Ethyl Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ethyl Canada requested discussion papers from cabinet members 
referring to the decision to ban the fuel additive MMT.  When 
access to the documents was denied, Ethyl Canada filed a 
complaint.  Judge Blanchard subsequently found that Ethyl Canada 
had a well founded complaint under the Access to Information Act, 
noting that the purpose of the access law is to give the public 
greater access to the inner workings of government.  That is what 
the act is there for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what brings us here today.  It is an effort to 
open up government and its institutions to Canadians.  A federal 
task force was also appointed last August, headed by Ms. Andrée 
Delagrave.  It is currently studying and reviewing ways to 
improve the Access to Information Act.  It is inviting the public 
to comment over the next two months on its improvements.  The 
task force is meeting with bureaucrats who process the reports, 
historians, librarians, journalists and other users of the law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members of parliament would also be a part of that 
process.  I know that my office and the offices of other members 
use access to information quite regularly in order to have 
openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill I have before the House today is non-votable.  I find 
that somewhat disturbing.  Hopefully in the not too distant 
future the House will allow these types of bills and motions to 
be voted on so that we can see where members of the House stand 
on accountability, openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to specifically target the Canadian Wheat Board, 
although it is mentioned specifically in the bill as are other 
crown corporations.  When public funding is a major cornerstone 
of organizations, it is my belief that those organizations should 
be open and accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the act there are safeguards with respect to commercially 
sensitive information, with respect to competitive interests, and 
that crown corporations can use to stop unnecessary information 
flow to individuals asking for it.  However it does stop the 
closed door mentality of corporations that are not prepared to 
give the most minute details, which I believe is a right of the 
citizens they serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not stop here with the piece of legislation I have before 
the House.  Other legislation will come forward and I suspect 
eventually the Access to Information Act, even through the task 
force, will be changed quite dramatically so that Canadians will 
have access to information they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before resuming debate, allow me to 
return the good wishes of the member for Brandon—Souris and say 
how pleased I am to see him and all our colleagues on both sides 
of the House following the Easter recess, and particularly to 
find them in good spirits and good humour. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have 
the opportunity to speak to Bill C-249.  If passed, the Canada 
Wheat Board would fall under the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only say that such a scenario, if realized, would be 
completely unacceptable, not because the government is not open 
to accountability of its agencies and departments, as it most 
certainly is, but because it would run contrary to common 
business sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders if the hon. member who put forward the bill and 
represents a western Canadian rural riding does not realize how 
the Canadian Wheat Board operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is not a government department, not a 
government agency or even a crown corporation.  It is a rather 
unique entity in Canada and perhaps the world in that it is a 
single desk marketer founded by federal legislation but not 
funded by taxpayers.  Rather it is co-operative in style and is 
paid for by the farmers whose grain it markets.  It is 
financially accountable to those farmers rather than to Canadian 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a business.  By no means is it an insignificant 
business.  It is a huge, highly successful commercial operation 
selling billions of dollars worth of Canadian wheat and barley 
each year to scores of countries around the world.  Its success, 
which I hasten to add could not have been attained without the 
high quality wheat and barley our western farmers produce, makes 
it both the envy and the bane of its competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a business it competes with the Australian wheat board and 
major transnational companies that are similarly huge, such as 
Cargill, ConAgra and ADM.  It is run by a board of directors, 
two-thirds of whom are elected directly by prairie farmers.  As a 
business and a single desk marketing organization, the Canadian 
Wheat Board is probably subject to more audit scrutiny than any 
corporation either public or private could ever be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say, to suggest the Canadian Wheat Board should 
fall under the same information legislation as government 
departments is quite frankly ludicrous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is to advance the interests of farmers it serves, the 
Canadian Wheat Board must remain competitive in the global 
marketplace.  Certain commercial or strategic information, if 
known to its competitors, could be used by them to gain 
commercial advantage, much to the detriment of Canadian grain 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding, the hon. member or any farmer, or any Canadian 
for that matter seeking information about the dealings of the 
Canadian Wheat Board, has several easily accessible options to 
pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the CWB annual report, a comprehensive document 
which in terms of the information disclosed goes above and beyond 
the annual report of the Canadian Wheat Board's commercial 
competitors.  The most recent annual report is 60 pages long and 
includes detailed information about stocks, market trends, export 
volumes, client countries and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board, as with any other business, is audited 
every year by an independent, internationally known accounting 
firm.  Detailed results of that audit are also part of the 
Canadian Wheat Board's annual report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the Canadian Wheat Board does not release any information 
that would pertain to specific transactions or that would 
identify individual customers or shareholders.  Nor do any of its 
competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers need to be knowledgeable about their wheat board and 
have every right to information pertaining to the CWB's 
performance and to facts that will help them make decisions about 
their own operations.  The Canadian Wheat Board provides much of 
this information through market commentary, delivery related 
information, pool return outlooks, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers can also obtain facts about the Canadian Wheat Board 
through their elected directors.  Directors have access to any 
and all of the Canadian Wheat Board's sales data and any other 
information pertaining to the wheat board's operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any business, nothing is off limits to those who sit on 
the board of the Canadian Wheat Board.  It falls upon the 
directors to use their best judgment as to which pieces of 
information should be public and which should not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I go back to a key point, which is that the Canadian Wheat 
Board is a commercial operation in a dog eat dog world.  In these 
troubled times for grain producers, why would we add to their 
worries by making the board more vulnerable to its privately held 
secretive competitors?  That is not to say that the Canadian 
Wheat Board is any less transparent than its competitors.  To the 
contrary, it is more so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members might recall that when the government made changes 
to the wheat board in 1998 it was with a view to making it more 
open and accountable to the farmers it serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the many actions the Canadian Wheat Board has taken to 
become more responsive and open to the farmers it serves was the 
development of an information policy.  Let me be clear.  This is 
a policy created by the board of directors in order to be 
directly accountable to farmers.  The preamble to the information 
policy states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a producer controlled marketing organization, the CWB has a 
responsibility to provide meaningful and relevant information to 
its farmer shareholders.  Information is key to increasing 
producer knowledge and understanding of CWB operations and 
performance, and will ensure that the CWB is accountable and 
meets producers' needs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It further states that goals of the information policy are to: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. enable farmers to make a meaningful assessment of CWB 
performance; 2. provide meaningful and relevant information to 
farmers for use in their operations; and 3. ensure farmers' and 
the CWB's strategic and commercial interests are not placed at a 
competitive disadvantage by any information release. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key element of the policy is if farmers want any information 
that is not disclosed through the usual audits and annual 
reports, meetings with the board of directors or other channels 
of communication they can simply request it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that the policy calls for the Canadian Wheat Board 
to respond to requests for information within 15 days or, if it 
cannot provide the information requested within 15 days, it must 
tell the requester how long it will take.  In comparison, the 
Access to Information Act provides for a 30 day response period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard no great hue and cry from farmers wanting the 
Canadian Wheat Board to fall under the Access to Information Act. 
Is this bill the result of stacks of petitions as is often the 
case with private members' bills?  Not likely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave it to others to speculate on the motive behind this 
bill.  I would like to close by simply urging members to vote 
against Bill C-249 because a vote against this bill is a vote for 
the commercial interests of our western Canadian grain farmers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have just come back from 
southwestern Saskatchewan where the new crop year is beginning. 
Ranchers are out in their fields and calves are just being born. 
They are watching their new crops come to life.  Farmers are 
beginning to go into their fields now to start their farming 
year, and within the next month will start to see their crops 
come to life, in the same way that western Canada is trying to 
come to life economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having a tough time in agriculture and producers are 
trying to respond and be successful.  As we move into a new 
season and see it come to life, it is fair to ask:  Should 
producers know about their product? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When growing a product there are some questions that are fair to 
ask and we should be able to get answers to those questions.  It 
is reasonable to ask where the product is being sold and where 
the market is for it.  It is reasonable to ask how much a product 
sold for, how is it blended and mixed out and if a maximum price 
was received.  It is fair for the producers to ask if they got a 
fair price for their product.  It is also fair to ask how much 
other people are benefiting from production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are a few of the areas that producers need to know about. 
They know very little today because of the lack of information 
coming from the system.  Producers should know this, and the bill 
today begins to address that problem and process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-249, an act to amend the Access to Information Act 
particularly with respect to the Canadian Wheat Board is 
important for several reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we continue to live in a democracy.  As we saw this 
weekend, people have the right to participate in and be a part of 
a democratic process.  Farmers can be trusted.  They do not need 
to be shielded from information about their own industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, producers need and can use this information.  Farming is 
changing very rapidly these days.  The old days when we trusted 
those above no longer exist.  The days when everything was done 
in secrecy are not acceptable to producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board was developed during the war years to provide 
Europe with its source of cheap grain.  It did that job.  The 
wheat board did a good PR job from the beginning but there has 
been a culture of secrecy around since it was put in place. 
Basically farmers were told to trust it and not ask questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember as a young person on a farm being in a situation 
where farmers did not know what freight rates were and what they 
were paying to get their product to the market.  They did not 
know what deductions were being taken off their crops.  They did 
not know where their production went or how it was priced.  Those 
days are over.  It is not good enough any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only in the last 10 or 15 years that producers have 
realized that the wheat board and other organizations have not 
necessarily been looking after their best interests.  One of the 
best examples I saw was in the early nineties with some frozen 
feed wheat.  We were told by the board that it did not want it. 
It was not prepared to market much of it that winter.  Farmers 
went out and found markets.  They took their wheat across the 
border and arranged for pricing.  They found out it was not 
quite as bad as it was thought to be in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were prepared to go through the buyback system from the 
board.  It was not the board that contacted them.  It was the 
grain company in the United States that phoned and said it did 
not want to buy their wheat at the price which had been 
negotiated.  It said it could get as much as it wanted at 85 
cents less than what the farmers had negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It became obvious to the people who knew what was going on that 
our interests were not always being looked after but we could not 
get the information in any way, shape or form to prove it.  I 
think we could agree that government organizations that 
withhold information have seen their day.  We saw a good 
example of that this weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once it was stay at home and let someone else make decisions 
about the farm, but not anymore.  The era of “we will look after 
you” is over.  The farmers who are succeeding in agriculture 
today are some of the sharpest and most successful business 
people.  They are usually the people who insist on managing their 
own resources in order to be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farming is a tough business today.  Success means being on top 
of the industry.  It means having all the information available 
to make decisions.  Virtually every other commodity allows that. 
Wheat is one of the few that does not because we cannot get the 
information from the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of an industry that has grown phenomenally and where 
people can get information is the pulse industry.  Over the last 
few years pulse acres have grown by 2,000%.  That industry 
continues to grow in western Canada.  It is interesting that it 
has been one of the industries which has had the least government 
involvement of any industry in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers need information which deals with the products they 
are growing.  We need this bill for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is a desperate need for accountability at the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  It has a long history of denying access to 
information.  Without information there can be no accountability. 
Anyone who thinks about that statement will realize it is 
accurate.  Without information no one can be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an information wall, almost a code of silence. 
We heard the member for Brandon—Souris speak about trying to get 
generic information and was absolutely stonewalled.  It is a 
process familiar to those of us who have tried it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area in which we need information is the buyback 
system.  Over the years if farmers wanted to market their own 
grain they had to sell it to the wheat board and buy it back at 
an inflated price.  This restricted and did not help producers. 
In particular it restricted diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western Canadian economy is struggling right now.  One of 
the things we absolutely need is value added processing and 
diversification.  The buyback which the board has in place 
hinders that in every way.  There is a restriction on getting 
information on how the buyback is calculated and why we should 
have to pay the price it is asking.  Producers are not allowed to 
question the figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the beginning of accountability would be to open 
up the Canadian Wheat Board to the Access to Information Act. 
There is a principle which applies here.  People should be able 
to make their own choices and be educated enough to make them. 
The only way to ensure accountability is to let people 
participate voluntarily.  I would suggest that while this bill is 
a good start, we need to go further.  We need to take a look at 
voluntary marketing of our wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give three examples of producers who are hurt by the 
current system of forced participation and the inability to get 
information from the Canadian Wheat Board system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first example is western Canadian farmers who have been able 
to contract their grain.  Farmers who have found markets for it 
have been restricted by the Canadian Wheat Board from marketing 
the grain themselves.  Ontario farmers have a choice when it 
comes to marketing grain but not western Canadians.  Not only can 
we not get information but we have no freedom to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are sending out a task force to talk to western 
Canadians about agriculture.  Maybe they can start with this. 
One reason why there is alienation there is that people are 
treated differently in different areas of this land when it comes 
to marketing their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example of producers who are hurt by the current 
system is the organic farmers.  They do a very good job of 
selling to niche markets.  In the last few years the wheat board 
has tried to step in and take that away from them.  Organic 
farmer organizations have a tough time marketing their grain 
because the wheat board does not sell well to niche markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third example is producers who want to add value to their 
communities.  Right now, because of the buyback system and the 
entire wheat board system, there is an inability to diversify in 
rural communities.  We absolutely have to do that.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no opportunity, no information and no choice.  I believe 
we should have a voluntary marketing system that would remove the 
problem of not being able to get information.  However I do not 
see anything that progressive coming from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that I do not think there is a need to 
oppose this bill.  The Access to Information Act gives adequate 
protection to the Canadian Wheat Board.  If it does not want to 
release information it feels is commercially sensitive, it does 
not have to.  If people have ever seen an ATI, they will know 
that there are more black felt pens probably used than there is 
clear ink on the page. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to have the guts to use this 
bill as a good beginning.  It leads to greater freedom and 
autonomy for producers.  I call on the government to go 
further in establishing a voluntary Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My challenge to the government is that it quit being afraid to 
lead.  It is time to treat western Canadians as grown-ups.  We 
are all familiar with the Berlin Wall that surrounded its people. 
The results behind that wall were inefficiency, a huge 
bureaucracy, an air of intimidation when it was challenged and no 
accountability.  I encourage the government to get over that 
mentality concerning the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear the wheat board, with its lack of openness to its 
policies, will drive the prairie wheat producers into the ground. 
I ask that this bill be supported.  Although I know it is not 
votable, I ask that its provisions be brought to reality in the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la-Mitis, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I had a marvelous speech prepared but I am going to 
shelve it.  It will end up in file 13 rather than on the record, 
because I am somewhat scandalized to learn that the decision has 
been made that this bill will not be votable.  This is quite 
simply a very fine and very simple bill: an act to amend the 
Access to Information Act (Crown corporations and the Canadian 
Wheat Board). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examining the Access to Information Act, hon. members will see 
that it contains a schedule several pages in length. 
It will be seen that the bodies not covered by the Access to 
Information Act include the Canadian Wheat Board and the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that, for a government that has just signed an 
agreement with 33 other countries and says that democracy is 
something important, it should start by having some democracy at 
home, before trying to lecture on law and morality to the 33 
countries of the Americas.  It should start by setting an 
example within the country, by ensuring that access to 
information is available in all crown corporations, particularly 
in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough time has already been wasted.  The government got fed up 
with our constant questions about Grand-Mère.  It said that we 
had nothing better to do, that we were wasting our time here in 
the House. 
This morning they are wasting our time by bringing us together 
to debate a bill in a vacuum, which will go nowhere.  We will 
talk about it for an hour. This will be a wasted hour of the 
time of all House employees.  Electricity will be wasted.  The 
salaries of employees will be wasted, because we will have to 
work and debate for no reason.  It is time to reform this 
parliament and to do something here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not be possible to introduce bills that are not 
votable.  They should all be votable, from the first to the 
last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real shame that we have a government that hides 
and is afraid to make information accessible.  And yet, when we 
look at the work of the Canadian Wheat Board—it does its work 
quite decently—it is apparent that the directors have set 
themselves a code of conduct and follow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the auditor general, I will use a quote I had included in 
my text to praise the Canadian Wheat Board.  I will not have 
worked for nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> We will get something out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> We will get something out of it.  The 
auditor general wrote this in his report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-1990s, the level of defaults, especially relating to 
the Prairie Grains Advance Payments program, threatened to 
undermine the viability of the entire cash advance program. When 
it became apparent that losses were becoming unacceptably high, 
the Department together with the Canadian Wheat Board took 
action to try to reduce the level of defaults. The changes they 
introduced to administrative practices contributed to reducing 
loan defaults from their peak of $61.6 million in 1993-94.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this excerpt, the auditor general praises the work of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. The directors came up with an acceptable 
code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government refuse to let the Canadian Wheat Board 
be subjected to the Access to Information Act? Why does it 
prevent crown corporations, including the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, which spends taxpayers' money to the tune of $1 
billion per year, from being subjected to the Access to 
Information Act? Why does the Liberal government reject 
transparency? What does it have to hide? This is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never stop saying that we must absolutely manage to 
implement a reform and live the way we should in the 21st 
century. Gone are the days of horses and buggies. In case the 
government does not realize it, we are living in the era of the 
high speed train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Times have changed and, together in this House, we should be 
discussing important issues. But I will stop here, because it is 
pointless to carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, perhaps we could get the unanimous consent of the 
House, so that this work will not have been done in vain and ask 
that the bill be deemed a votable item.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the 
first day back after the Easter break it is a pleasure to speak 
in the House on this private member's motion, which requests that 
there be a new definition of government institution to open up 
financial administration and which includes the Canadian Wheat 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have not been here for a long time, this is for me a 
bit of déja vu because we debated this issue in 1997 and 1998 
when we were dealing with Bill C-4, the act to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  Certainly the New Democratic Party had a lot of 
difficulty with parts of that bill at that time and we 
subsequently voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we think there is some justification for lack of 
disclosure on this particular piece of legislation and in this 
particular area.  The reason I say this is that the Canadian 
Wheat Board goes head to head with some of the largest 
multinational corporations in the world and we certainly do not 
see companies like Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill making 
available in minute detail all of the access to information that 
would be required should this motion ever be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first blush, obviously, when we think of transparency and 
access to information we might wonder why anyone would be opposed 
to this.  However, if we think beyond this a little bit and 
realize that we are dealing with some very large multinationals 
that the Canadian Wheat Board is in direct competition with, we 
can understand why the board has not made this available at this 
time.  I find myself in support of that rationale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that all directors will be entitled to 
the complete disclosure of all Canadian Wheat Board facts and 
figures, including but not limited to fully audited financial 
statements, so they will be able to examine the price at which 
grain is sold, the price premiums achieved, the operating costs, 
and whether or not the Canadian Wheat Board is being run 
efficiently.  That is a result of one of the changes in the 
1997-98 legislation, which opened up the Canadian Wheat Board by 
allowing an elected board of directors of farmers.  It is a 15 
member board, 10 of whom are elected and 5 of whom are appointed 
by the government.  With the full knowledge these 15 directors 
have of the Canadian Wheat Board and its global competition, the 
directors would be, will be, and are in the best position to 
assess what information should be made public and what, for 
commercial reasons, should remain confidential.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the New Democratic Party finds itself in opposition 
to the motion before the House.  It is important to point out at 
the same time that not only the Canadian Wheat Board but the 
Export Development Corporation and Canada Post do not fall under 
the Access to Information Act.  There are reasons for that 
situation and, as I have tried to point out, they are logical and 
well founded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will note as an aside that at the moment under chapter 11 of 
NAFTA there is currently a very major dispute going on behind 
closed doors involving United Parcel Service and whether or not 
the Canadian government is going to be required to pay several 
hundreds of millions of dollars.  UPS is arguing that Canada 
Post-Purolator is competing unfairly against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly the point that the Canadian Wheat Board finds 
itself at:  by publishing that data we would put ourselves at a 
commercial disadvantage to the Cargills, the ADMs and the other 
multinational giants engaged in the wheat industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are others who wish to take part in the debate and 
there is time allocation, so I will conclude by making three 
brief points.  First, the Canadian Wheat Board is a commercial 
organization and information pertaining to sales and prices is 
restricted, as it would be in any private organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a board of directors heads the Canadian Wheat Board. Ten 
of those fifteen directors, the majority on the board, are 
elected farmers.  They and they alone are responsible for the 
performance of the organization and the information it releases 
to its farmer constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Canadian Wheat Board is not responsible to the public 
at large as it is not a government department.  It is paid for by 
the producers in western Canada.  The corporation submits its 
annual report to parliament each year and, may I add, they do 
have an auditor.  I believe Deloitte and Touche is the company 
that audits the books every year and presents those facts.  I an 
also given to understand that the Auditor General of Canada, as 
part of the wheat board bill of 1997-98, the old Bill C-4, will 
be examining the books of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I have satisfied the House as to why the New Democratic 
Party would not be in support of this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to stand to oppose the motion by the member for 
Brandon—Souris, because the net impact of the bill would be to 
undermine the ability of the Canadian Wheat Board to do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is the fact that the bill could even hurt 
producers' returns by, as the member who just spoke said, 
providing the competition with all the commercial information, 
the marketing information, et cetera, that the Canadian Wheat 
Board has available through its diligence and through the good 
work of its market information section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should not be surprised by the tactics of the member for 
Brandon—Souris, who is now using this new tactic under the guise 
of the access to information bill he is pursuing here to again 
attack the integrity of the Canadian Wheat Board.  It seems to be 
commonplace for this member and members of the Canadian Alliance 
Party opposite to do that.  They do it through the process of 
maybe stretching the facts a little and I would not want to go 
much further than that.  They are building on myths about the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would use this as an example.  In his closing remarks, the 
member for Brandon—Souris said, and I quote, “When public 
funding is a major cornerstone” of the organization then the 
Access to Information Act should apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is the Canadian Wheat Board is not 
publicly funded.  The Canadian Wheat Board operates under the 
legislation of the House.  The Canadian Wheat Board is financed 
by farmers.  The Canadian Wheat Board is controlled by a board of 
directors elected by farmers through legislation passed in the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, there is no commercial organization in the country more 
transparent than the Canadian Wheat Board.  It upholds its 
tranparencies in a number of ways.  First, there is the elected 
board of directors who have to stand for election.  Second, there 
is the annual report that is presented to the minister of 
agriculture.  In fact, the member for Brandon—Souris, if he so 
desired, and I imagine he does, would be able to bring the 
Canadian Wheat Board before the standing committee on agriculture 
and question the board in terms of its activities.  Can he do 
that with Cargill Grain and those other commercial grain 
institutions that he seems to be supporting in the guise of 
attacking the Canadian Wheat Board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, there are the district meetings held in all the elected 
districts across western Canada.  As well, there is the monthly 
newsletter that goes out from the Canadian Wheat Board.  Also, 
there is the auditor general, who looks at the annual report of 
the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much more transparent does this organization have to be in 
order for the member to understand the fact that certain 
commercial information should not be made available to the 
competition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that the member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands was on the typical Canadian Alliance rant 
against the Canadian Wheat Board.   I want to underline the fact, 
in disagreement with what he had to say, that the bill would hurt 
primary producers.  It would seriously hurt farmers in western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If some of these members would tour the Canadian Wheat Board 
head office in Winnipeg, they would see how it gathers its market 
intelligence, how it is one of the best sellers out there in 
terms of being able to maximize returns, and how, through its 
system of pooling, it is able to prevent negative competition 
within Canada and maximize what is in the international market 
and efficiently get the maximum returns from the international 
marketplace back to primary producers.  If they would look at 
that business operation, they would see why the Canadian Wheat 
Board is so often so able to beat the competition.  If the 
members opposite did a little research, they would find that the 
Canadian Wheat Board, in terms of some analyses that have been 
done, has been able to beat the open market pretty nearly all the 
time, not all the time, but most of the time, in terms of 
maximizing returns to primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands also talked about the 
culture of secrecy of the wheat board.  That is another myth. 
Nothing is further from the truth.  Earlier in my remarks I 
outlined the reports, the meetings, the annual report and the 
information base.  There is no culture of secrecy at the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  Indeed, it is the direct opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill would very seriously hurt the farm 
community.  As I said earlier, I should not be surprised, but I 
am amazed that the members opposite continue to use any vehicle 
to try to build on the myths that are out there rather than 
talking about the strengths of the Canadian Wheat Board and how 
it can be used to assist farmers in their time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the Canadian Wheat Board is farmer financed. 
This access to information proposal from the member for 
Brandon—Souris would in fact put it in the position of actually 
having to subsidize the competition.  The member, through his 
efforts in the bill, would actually subsidize the competition, 
the likes of Cargill Grain and other grain export companies, by 
having the Canadian Wheat Board, through its farmer financed 
organization, provide information on markets, on the markets of 
other countries, on weather patterns and all that intelligence 
base that the Canadian Wheat Board uses to assist in its market 
intelligence to try to make the best sales possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, all of this would possibly have to be turned 
over to the competition.  In effect, the competition would have 
to spend far less time in research in terms of corporate 
operations because the member's bill would be actually 
subsidizing the competition against the very farm community he 
proposes to speak for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to stand and oppose a bill that would 
undermine our farm community in western Canada if it were allowed 
to pass in the House.  It would also put the Canadian Wheat Board 
at a disadvantage with its commercial competition in terms of 
trying to maximize returns to primary producers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank each member of the House who rose today to speak to the 
proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not surprise me but it does disappoint me that the 
member for Malpeque still cloaks himself in the paranoia that is 
out there.  He did not look at the content of the bill dealing 
with access to information, the honesty and the transparency. He 
would rather go on a rant as to what is right and what is wrong 
with the Canadian Wheat Board.  That is not what the debate was 
meant to be about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems obvious that some members were not able to grasp the 
issue at hand, which is that openness and transparency is the 
only way in which any type of organization can be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excuses I heard from the member for Malpeque, as well as 
from the member for Timiskaming—Cochrane, included the words 
never, ludicrous, not necessary, trust us and be happy.  The 
member for Malpeque suggested that the bill was a way of 
backdooring the Canadian Wheat Board.  If he had listened to what 
I had to say he would have heard that this was not meant to get 
rid of the Canadian Wheat Board in any way, shape or form.  This 
was simply meant to strengthen its operations in a number of 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that it does open up, especially for the hon. 
member, is how information from the 1950s could be seen as 
sensitive and commercial in nature by the Canadian Wheat Board 
and yet that information is not forthcoming.  When the wheat 
board hides behind closed doors and does not even answer 
questions in a survey, it conjures up an impression that it has 
no desire to be more open and transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get to the big picture which deals with access to 
information.  The rules have to be expanded as we are having 
difficulties right now accessing information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have the two members on the government side ever filed an access 
to information request?  Have they ever gone through the process 
of finding out what it is like to get access to information? Has 
the member for Timiskaming—Cochrane ever met with the board of 
directors of the Canadian Wheat Board?  I have met with those 
people and I have filed access to information requests.  Quite 
frankly, the questions the members have asked I have already gone 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should be votable but unfortunately it is not.  I hope 
the debate has indicated that this is an issue that will not go 
away.  It can be resolved.  The wheat board can continue to 
operate.  It can be open, honest and transparent if it is given 
the tools.  The member for Malpeque never mentioned this, but the 
wheat board also has the ability under the act to stop access to 
sensitive commercial information.  That does not have to happen. 
The nonsensitive and noncommercial information should be open and 
available, not only to myself but to the producers that the board 
serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can use that excuse to go to the board of directors but it 
also signs pledges that it will not give any information outside 
the board.  Changes have to come from the government so that the 
information is made accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired.  As 
the motion has not been designated as a votable item, the order 
is dropped from the order paper.

<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak today at third reading of Bill 
C-13, the Sales Tax and Excise Tax Amendments Act, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would reaffirm the government's commitment to making 
our tax system simpler and fairer for individuals and for 
Canadian business.  The principal purpose of the bill is to 
implement measures relating to the goods and services tax and 
harmonized sales tax that were announced in the 2000 budget, as 
well as the additional sales tax measures proposed in the notice 
of ways and means motion tabled in parliament on October 4, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures were aimed at improving the operation of the 
GST-HST in the affected areas and ensuring that the legislation 
accords with the policy intent.  The bill would also implement 
two amendments to the Excise Tax Act relating to excise taxes on 
specific products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by outlining the measures contained in the 
bill that were proposed in budget 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the GST-HST is designed to ensure that Canadian 
businesses and products are competitive in the export markets.  A 
number of measures in Bill C-13 are aimed at achieving that 
specific objective.  Specifically, these measures relate to the 
GST-HST treatment of export distribution activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would implement an initiative referred to as the export 
distribution centre program.  It is an initiative that addresses 
a cashflow issue faced by limited value added export oriented 
businesses. It would also help ensure that the GST-HST does not 
present an impediment to the establishment of North American 
distribution centres in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to the opportunities provided by the establishment 
of EDCs in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 contains a measure that would ensure that the GST-HST 
does not make Canadian suppliers of warranty repair or 
replacement services less competitive relative to foreign 
suppliers when in fact these services are provided to 
non-residents.  It also expands on an existing program known as 
the exporters of processing services program.  Refinements to the 
program would ensure that the GST-HST does not impose prohibitive 
cashflow costs for businesses that provide storage or 
distribution services for non-residents in respect of goods that 
are for export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another proposal in the bill relates to the cross-border 
transactions, in particular the sale of railway rolling stock to 
non-resident businesses.  Bill C-13 proposes an amendment to 
ensure that the use of railway rolling stock to ship goods out of 
the country in the course of the exportation of the rolling stock 
itself would not disqualify it from tax-free treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 introduces the new residential rental property rebate, 
another important sales tax initiative.  The measure stems from 
the 2000 budget and would be of significant benefit to builders 
and purchasers of new residential rental accommodation.  It would 
reduce the effective GST rate on newly constructed rental 
property by 2.5% which is the same federal tax rate reduction 
that applies to purchasers of new, owner occupied homes under the 
existing new housing rebate program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 builds on the government's commitment to continue to 
work on improving health care and education in Canada.  In the 
area of health care, the bill proposes an amendment to continue 
in force an existing GST-HST exemption for speech therapy 
services that are billed by individual practitioners but are not 
covered by applicable provincial health care plans.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to education, Bill C-13 contains a measure which 
would ensure that vocational training provided in different 
provinces receives the same GST-HST treatment regardless of the 
regulatory regime that exists in each province with respect to 
vocational schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes, as do all members of the House, the 
important role that charities play in helping Canadians and in 
enriching our communities.  The bill proposes amendments to 
ensure that the GST-HST legislation properly reflects the 
government's intended policy of generally exempting from sales 
tax the rental of real property and related goods by charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation proposes a number of clarifying amendments to 
ensure that there could be no doubt as to the application of 
these provisions for both future and past transactions, for 
example the issue of excise tax on automobile air conditioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 reflects a number of improvements to the 
administration of the tax system, which is in keeping with the 
spirit of the government online initiative recently announced by 
the Prime Minister.  There is a movement within government and in 
the public to ensure that it meets its target of getting on line 
in the very near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend a few moments on a part of the bill which 
has not received the attention it should have received to date. I 
would like to raise the awareness of the creation of export 
distribution centres by explaining what they mean and their 
potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of export distribution centres enhances Canada's 
ability to conduct export distribution activity.  The program 
does not create any artificial advantages for any Canadian 
community.  Instead, it unleashes their inherent geographic 
advantage.  If the 49th parallel did not exist, in other words if 
the entire continent was Canada, our communities would be host to 
a significantly greater number of distribution centres for goods 
produced abroad because of our geographic advantage.  That this 
is not the case today is due to legislative and regulatory 
barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the U.S. foreign trade zone program, we find 
that an overwhelming number of such zones are located in the 
northern tier along the Canadian border.  That is because the 
northern part of our continent provides the natural entry point 
gateways to the NAFTA economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EDC program which would be created as a result of Bill C-13 
would allow communities in every part of Canada to participate in 
the fast growing distribution and logistics industry.  It is also 
important to note that the program is not zone specific; it would 
be market driven.  Unlike the United States, which geographically 
decides where a trade zone is to locate, the Canadian export 
distribution centres would be market driven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a program that is universal.  Any location in Canada and 
any business could seek to participate.  Unlike programs in the 
U.S. and elsewhere, it does not create any unique privileges for 
specific locations.  I am already aware, as are many close to 
this issue, of groups in Hamilton, Montreal, Vancouver, Gander 
and Regina that are pursuing the EDC opportunity.  It is truly a 
coast to coast opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of these groups have told us that the opportunity 
to engage in this kind of activity has been there for some time 
but it has been hindered by existing regulations.  Bill C-13 
removes this impediment for local community development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Stoney Creek the legislation would allow us to 
make full use of the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport 
as an economic development engine.  The airport is well placed 
and well prepared to attract logistics and distribution 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tony Battaglia, president of TradePort International, the firm 
entrusted with managing the Hamilton airport, commented that the 
airport would be able to compete with similar facilities in the 
United States.  The proposed changes in Bill C-13 would provide 
the necessary tools for Canadian facilities that move goods by 
air, road, water and rail.  These tools would allow such Canadian 
firms to compete and attract global commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean in terms of job creation?  Professor Michael 
Tretheway of the University of British Columbia's transportation 
and logistics program has estimated that within 10 years Canada 
will be able to create up to 50,000 jobs in the distribution 
sector.  Job creation can only be enabled if we can offer 
distribution firms in Canada the same advantages that locations 
in the United States offer to their distributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, existing programs in Canada allow the storage and 
re-export of goods in a duty and tax free environment.  However 
they do not allow the addition of Canadian value to the goods 
being re-exported.  The situation is paradoxical.  On the one 
hand, the current program encourages distribution centre 
locations in Canada but, on the other hand, it discourages the 
adding of value and the job growth that results from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation seeks to redress the imbalance by providing a 
program that allows the creation of distribution centres in 
Canada in a duty and tax free environment where value could be 
added when goods are intended for distribution into the broader 
NAFTA marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consultation period a concern was brought forward by 
a number of individuals that the legislation would enable growth 
in the distribution sector at the expense of Canada's domestic 
manufacturers.  The program has strict limits so that it cannot 
be used for full manufacturing.  Furthermore, 90% of the goods 
must be re-exported.  The program is intended to attract 
distribution centres for goods already being manufactured 
overseas and exported to the U.S. and broader NAFTA markets. 
There is no displacement of domestic manufacturers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation is strongly supported by Canada's 
airports.  The Canadian Airports Council has been a very strong 
supporter of the EDC program.  It sees an opportunity to develop 
its airport lands for the benefit of its communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EDC program would allow the airports council to lever its 
air service and ground transportation networks and build the flow 
of goods and jobs between Asia and Europe on the one hand and the 
U.S. and NAFTA economies on the other.  Companies in Europe and 
Asia that wanted access to NAFTA markets were not looking to 
Canada for foreign trade zone possibilities.  However, because of 
Bill C-13, they now can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in Bill C-13 that I have outlined today propose to 
refine, streamline and clarify the application of our tax system. 
The bill would provide an opportunity for economic development 
specifically through the creation of export distribution centres. 
At the same time, Bill C-13 reflects the government's commitment 
to ensure our tax system is fair.  I urge all hon. members to 
pass the measures quickly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of Surrey Central, I 
am pleased to participate in the debate today on Bill C-13, the 
sales tax and excise tax amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I point out that I will be sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Richmond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are debating today has been before committee and is 
now going through its final debate in the House. 
The purpose of the bill is to simplify the tax code, but probably 
not to the extent Canadians would like.  The measures are aimed 
principally at improving the operation and fairness of the GST or 
HST in affected areas and ensuring the legislation accords with 
the policy intent. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 implements two amendments to the Excise Tax Act.  The 
first clarifies the deferral of tax on various automobiles and 
car products to the time of sale or importation to a 
manufacturer.  The amendment is made to clarify the deferral of 
existing excise taxes on air conditioners, for example, installed 
in automobiles and on new heavy automobiles at the time of 
importation by a licensed manufacturer or sale to a licensed 
manufacturer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment provides the Minister of National Revenue 
with he discretionary power to waive or cancel interest and/or 
penalties.  The second amendment provides discretionary power to 
the minister, as I have said, to cancel penalties calculated in 
the same manner as interest under the excise tax system, which is 
consistent with the discretion already provided to the minister 
in relation to the sales tax and income tax systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary goal of the bill is therefore to correct some 
administrative oversights in the February 2000 budget concerning 
the application of the GST and HST.  The bill is technical 
amending legislation.  The official opposition therefore supports 
the bill, but we believe the government could have done more to 
address other pertinent issues relating to taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of GST and HST measures in the bill.  I will 
briefly describe them.  The export distribution centre and export 
trading house programs amendment would implement new rules that 
ensure the GST and HST do not impede North American distribution 
centres in Canada.  Businesses would be able to purchase or 
import inventory and customer goods on a tax-free basis rather 
than having to pay the tax and later claim a refund.  This might 
help combat fraud, which is unfortunately part of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The non-residents and cross-border transactions amendment 
ensures that no tax is payable on goods imported solely as 
replacements under warranty.  It also ensures there is no tax on 
the service of storing goods for a non-resident business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is that the real property amendment implements the 
new residential rental property rebate, which is a partial rebate 
of GST on newly constructed or substantially renovated long term 
residential rental accommodation.  I see many such accommodations 
in my constituency of Surrey Central.  The builders or the people 
involved in that kind of construction will feel some relief in 
that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is important because it permits a credit for work done on a 
new home used primarily as a place of residence or as short term 
public accommodation, for example a bed and breakfast 
establishment.  Such establishments will get some sort of relief. 
That is particularly important because the previous rules 
disallowed homeowners the credit if they ran small businesses out 
of their homes.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other amendments.  The health amendment continues to 
be in force.  There are GST and HST exemptions for speech therapy 
services that are billed by individual practitioners and not 
covered by the applicable provincial health care plan.  The bill 
will provide some relief for people who use such therapies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The education amendment ensures that similar vocational training 
across the country is provided the same exempt treatment, 
regardless of how vocational schools are regulated in each 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The electronic filing amendment removes the requirement to apply 
to the Minister of National Revenue for permission to file GST or 
HST returns electronically over the telephone or Internet. 
Canadians are busy preparing their tax returns.  If the bill is 
put into place it will probably give relief to people who must 
seek such permission.  It allows anyone to file taxes that way, 
provided they meet the criteria set out by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there are miscellaneous amendments which correct 
ambiguities in existing provisions consistent with current 
industry practice, administrative interpretation and the 
underlying policy intent.  These are some of the areas the bill 
focuses on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are watching I will quote from the Canadian 
Alliance policy, which is the grassroots members' policy. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will restore public confidence in the fairness of the Canadian 
tax system by reducing its complexity.  We will restore 
indexation and move towards a simpler tax system, built around a 
single rate of taxation to ensure lower taxes for all Canadians. 
We believe that all Canadians above a minimum income level should 
share in the cost of the services provided by government, which 
benefit us all. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas of concern.  I was talking with my 
constituents during the two week break.  They are concerned about 
gas prices because there are taxes on taxes on taxes.  I regret 
that the sharp spike in the price of home heating oil and 
gasoline, which has hit us all so hard, is not addressed in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians suffered this winter in the cold climate.  The 
Liberals did not foresee or prevent the 70% hike in natural gas 
prices, which they should have if they had prudent practices in 
place.  They did nothing about it except send out cheques for a 
couple of hundred dollars.  The government completely missed the 
target.  Instead of sending cheques to those most in need of 
assistance it sent them to people who probably do not pay heating 
bills such as students, prisoners and even deceased Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal finance minister has no sympathy for our seniors or 
for persons on fixed incomes.  These people have so little money 
that they must choose between filling prescriptions, buying food 
or paying for heat.  It is the Liberal government's fault because 
the government keeps our taxes high and our dollar weak.  We are 
being hurt twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the tax on gas which has driven the price upward.  The 
price we pay at the gas pumps includes a tremendous amount of 
tax.  The price of crude gas is something like 29 cents, but 
these days we are paying 74 cents or so at the pumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why when the price of gas or oil on the world market is 
hiked we feel it more.  Not only is the price hiked but the taxes 
go up accordingly.  That exacerbates the increase in the 
wholesale price.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have the federal excise and sales tax on gas.  On top 
of that we have a provincial excise tax.  On top of that we have 
a provincial sales tax.  On top of all that we have the 7% GST. 
In other words, we are paying GST on the taxes as well which is 
wrong.  We have a tax on a tax on tax on a tax.  That is the kind 
of system we have in gas pricing and that is very unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My province of British Columbia gets less than 5% of the amount 
of federal taxes paid on gas for transportation and 
infrastructure development.  The federal Liberals rake in about 
$700 million a year in fuel taxes from British Columbia alone, 
and this is the only province that does not have any four lane 
highways.  We cannot even buy enough street lamps with the 5% the 
federal Liberals are returning to us for transportation and 
infrastructure development.  That is the kind of situation we are 
facing with respect to that particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we support this bill but we again urge the government 
to lower taxes for Canadian families, consumers and small 
businesses.  Those lower taxes will help boost our economy.  We 
want lower taxes and a simplified tax code.  Our tax code is very 
complicated, probably one of the most complicated of any country 
which I have visited or heard about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarifications in Bill C-13 should only be a temporary 
measure on the road to tax reform.  The steps are in the right 
direction but they are baby steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of Bill C-13 enact corrections to last year's 
budget and the fall mini budget.  The government should be moving 
toward simplifying and broadening the base of the tax code.  If 
the tax code was simplified, endless exemptions and further 
clarifications would not be necessary.  There may not be any need 
to do what we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this point, lowering the taxes of all Canadians will have a 
far more positive impact for everyone.  With the exception of the 
new residential rental property debate, the amendments will have 
little impact on the government's revenue.  Expected costs for 
the new residential rental property rebate are estimated at $15 
million for 2000-01, $40 million for 2001-02 and $45 million for 
subsequent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we will support the bill but we remind the 
government that it should lower taxes for Canadians and simplify 
the tax code.  I believe Canada can be a competitive leader in 
the global economy of the future and I believe Canadians can 
enjoy a higher standard of living and a better quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However to get there we must blaze a trail of tax relief and 
debt reduction.  We need to lower taxes such as payroll taxes. We 
need to cut the tax on investing.  We should not be penalizing 
those investors who invest in Canada, who boost our economy and 
who help create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should cut the taxes on high tech businesses.  It is time 
these businesses be promoted.  That is where our future lies. 
That is where more jobs will be created.  However the government 
does not realize that we have to cut taxes for high tech 
businesses as well as small businesses.  Ninety-six per cent of 
jobs are created by small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the points I wanted to add to this debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Peschisolido (Richmond, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the 
point which my colleague from the Alliance Party made that as the 
opposition party the Alliance supports Bill C-13.  Our concern 
though is that this will be viewed as a final step and not as a 
temporary, necessary technical change in our tax system on the 
long road to full taxation reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get into the details that were discussed by my 
colleague on the Alliance policy on tax reform.  However I do 
want to speak about a luncheon I attended last Friday for the 
Vancouver Board of Trade.  It was very illuminating for me.  The 
guest speaker was the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Dodge. 
He spoke about the variety of variables that go into having a 
sound economy.  It was like a lesson on 101 central banking.  The 
unfortunate thing though was that he did not once mention the 
taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know in the House that there is a great link between 
monetary policy and fiscal policy.  As my colleague just 
discussed, taxes are high and the Canadian dollar is low.  What 
the Alliance puts forth, and I say, is that taxes are high therefore 
our Canadian dollar is low.  More important, it does not allow 
the Governor of the Bank of Canada to do what is right with 
monetary policy, which would be to have lower interest rates at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Greenspan, the chair of the federal reserve in the United 
States, dramatically and successfully used the proper monetary 
tools at his disposal and reduced interest rates a full half a 
per cent.  Obviously, he believed there were further tough 
economic times.  The Bank of Canada put forth a very anemic 
quarter per cent interest decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not because the Governor of the Bank of Canada does not 
understand that we need a softening of monetary policy to deal 
with these tough times.  It is simply that he cannot.  His hands 
are tied because of the lax fiscal planning of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and the Alliance Party believe that the chair of the federal 
reserve of the United States will follow up with a further half 
per cent decrease.  However our Governor of the Bank of Canada, 
legitimately so, is so concerned about the level of the Canadian 
dollar that his hands are tied.  Why are his hands tied?  They 
are tied because there is a direct correlation between economic 
performance wich includes all of the variables and the level of 
the Canadian dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of the Canadian dollar, outside of the fluctuations on 
a day to day basis, is simply a reflection of the economic health 
of the country.  Tax policy is a key in that economic health.  If 
Canada were a patient, it would not be doing very well right now 
because our economic policy is correctly reflected by our low 
Canadian dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should the Canadian government do?  Bill C-13 is a positive 
step.  Why?  It deals with certain technical problems that the 
government itself created in the past seven to eight years.  That 
is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern with Bill C-13 is not what is in the bill but what is 
not in the bill.  As my colleague said so eloquently, the 
economic problems we face in Canada should be dealt with quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give one example.  There is a severe housing shortage 
right across this country.  Even in an area such as my 
constituency of Richmond, British Columbia, which is viewed as a 
middle class rather affluent part of Canada, we have a problem as 
well.  It is the problem of not enough housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know about the tragic, and I use that word carefully, 
situation in Vancouver East which the member of parliament for 
that area eloquently spoke about.  I do not agree with many of 
her proposals on how to fix the problem, but I do agree with the 
point that there is a problem and the Liberal government is 
ignoring it. 
Sure it throws $25 million here and $25 million there.  I would 
argue that that is exacerbating a problem rather than fixing it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not utilize the tax system to urge the creation of rental 
stock through the private sector?  Yes, there is 5%, 10% or maybe 
15% of the population who are marginalized and have other 
problems that have to be dealt with, such as alcoholism, 
drug abuse and coming from broken homes.  The government has to play a 
role there.  However on the creation of a housing stock, that is 
where the tax code can be utilized and it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that apartment owners and builders are not treated as 
a business when it comes to capital gains, rollovers and loss 
allocations?  It is a simple step.  Rather than taking moneys and 
providing housing in a grandiose national plan, perhaps it would 
be a better approach to allow the private sector to build 
affordable housing with the provision that there is a segment of 
marginalized Canadians who have to be helped in a different way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Liberal government for the variety of technical 
bills it has put forth in this session to deal with the 
inadequacies that it created.  However it is a first step.  I 
hope that in the next step of dealing with the economic morass 
that we are in, it will put forth more substantive tax reductions 
to deal with an economy that is declining.  I do not say that 
with partisan vigour.  Sure there is the parry and thrust of 
debate.  Sure there is a partisan element of the electoral 
process.  However I think we all agree that we do not want a more 
complicated tax system.  I believe we all agree that the 
reduction of capital gains tax is a way to spur economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in the next few months we will have from the 
other side of the House real substantive tax reform and not 
simply necessary and technical amendments to problems that were 
created by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I had the honour to represent Yorkton—Melville in the 
House for 25 years.  I understand why you said Yorkton—Melville. 
I want to say a few words on the changes to the GST, which the 
bill before the House implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the great debate in the House of Commons when the GST 
went through.  I believe it was in 1991.  There was a great 
debate about changing our taxation system.  We used to have what 
was called a manufacturers' sales tax.  The government of the 
day, the Mulroney Conservative government, decided to replace 
that tax with the goods and services tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a great debate in the finance committee.  I was a member 
of the finance committee at the time as the NDP finance critic. 
We studied the issue ad nauseam.  We had hearings on it.  I 
remember spending several days writing a report on it with 
members of the finance committee.  We made recommendations. There 
were all kinds of changes made at the time to the initial 
proposal of the government.  The GST came in and the old 
manufacturers' sales tax disappeared.  At the time we voiced a 
lot of concerns about the GST itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the problem with the GST is that it is a tax that the 
government likes.  It takes in a lot of money, I believe 
$23 million to $24 million.  Every point in the GST brings in 
roughly $3.5 million of revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with the GST is that it is all encompassing and 
taxes things like funerals.  It taxes reading materials, books 
and a whole series of things that are necessities of life at the 
same level it taxes things that are not necessities or things 
that might be purchased for entertainment, luxury goods and 
things of that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing is that the GST is a very regressive tax.  It does 
not matter what our income is, we still pay the same GST.  We pay 
7% for a haircut.  Whether we are rich or poor, we still pay that 
same 7%. 
When we buy clothes we pay 7%.  It is a very regressive tax in 
terms of having a fair and balanced tax system.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always believed that in a democratic society that looks 
after the common good we should pay taxes based on the ability to 
pay.  If we make more money we should pay more in tax.  The tax 
rate for those making $100,000 should be higher than it should be 
for someone making $30,000, $40,000, $20,000 or $25,000 a year. 
For those making a million dollars a year the tax rate should be 
higher still.  There has to be a progressive taxation system in 
the country.  The problem with the GST is that it is not 
progressive.  It hits everybody in the same way in terms of 
paying the same rate of tax on the same goods and commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look around we see many necessities on which people pay 
GST.  I mentioned haircuts, all kinds of clothing and a lot of 
the necessities of life on which we pay GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Home heating fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Home heating fuel is a very good 
example as well.  With the price of energy going up, particularly 
the price of natural gas, a lot of ordinary folks who are on a 
very tight budget or on a fixed income have real difficulty 
paying the 7% on a home heating bill that may have been $75 or 
$80 a few years ago and is today maybe $150 or $250, depending on 
where one lives.  The GST adds an awful lot in costs for the 
ordinary consumer who is paying the heating bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a measure of a society is to have a taxation system 
based on the ability to pay.  That is the most important part of 
this.  It should be based on ability to pay.  Our party, the NDP, 
realizes, of course, that there should be a very important role 
in our society for government.  In the last few years the role of 
government has diminished too much in terms of deregulation, 
privatization and cutbacks to social programs.  Health funding is 
the best example of that.  We have a health funding crisis in the 
country.  The federal government cut back by billions of dollars 
transfers to the provinces for health care.  The member for 
Winnipeg North Centre, who is our critic, knows the cost of that 
to ordinary people across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need taxation revenue coming in, but the principle is to 
find the money on the basis of the ability to pay.  The taxation 
system in the country should become more progressive, not less 
progressive.  To do that I think we eventually have to phase out 
the GST, to roll it back from 7% to 6% to 5% and to 4%. 
Eventually, when we have a fair taxation system and the economy 
grows and becomes stronger, we have to eliminate it altogether. 
Our party said that in 1991-92.  That is what we said in the last 
campaign.  That is what we say now.  The goal is to eliminate the 
GST in the country in order to have a fairer taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The Liberals used to say that, it seems 
to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  As the member from Winnipeg says, I 
remember the debates in the House of Commons in 1993 when members 
of the Liberal Party got up and said “elect us and we will get 
rid of the GST”.  I remember the Prime Minister saying that if 
he was elected Prime Minister he would get rid of the GST.  That 
is on tape and can be seen by looking up the old speeches from 
question period in 1992-93.  I ask the Liberals across the way 
what happened to that fundamental promise they made to the 
Canadian people.  What happened?  The Liberal member across the 
way is clearing his throat in embarrassment.  What happened to 
that campaign promise the Liberals made to the Canadian people in 
1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder people are cynical about the electoral process, 
politicians and political parties when a political party can make 
a very serious promise to the country and then break that 
promise.  In hindsight, the only member across the way who did 
not break the promise was the minister of heritage, the member 
for Hamilton East.  She was deputy prime minister.  She resigned 
her seat in the House of Commons, probably in 1996, and went back 
to Hamilton East for a byelection.  She said she had made a 
commitment on the GST, the government had changed its mind and 
she sought a new mandate for herself as the member of parliament 
for Hamilton East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the rest of those members?  They made the promise, 
they broke the promise and they are still in government.  That is 
one reason why more and more people in the country give up on the 
political process and rank politicians so low in terms of 
credibility. 
The goal has to be to gradually eliminate the GST in order to 
make it a more progressive taxation system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People are in the final process of filing their income tax, with 
the deadline being April 30, which is only a few days away.  When 
Canadians file their income taxes they are reminded that too much 
of the taxation burden in Canada is still on low income and 
modest income people in Canada.  These are people who have 
families and are struggling to make ends meet.  I hear stories 
day in and day out about low income people having trouble with 
the taxes they have to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet there are so many loopholes in our taxation system.  We have 
the family trusts for the Bronfmans and the wealthy, and they can 
really get away from paying taxes, from paying their fair share. 
These very wealthy people, the billionaires, do not pay their 
fair share and we have the Liberals across the way who will not 
do anything about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Operation loophole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Yes, there is the whole case of 
operation loophole, the court case that was launched in Manitoba 
by someone in the city of Winnipeg going after the Bronfman 
family and the wealthy people for the taxes they evade by moving 
their wealth offshore.  That is not fair.  When a person does 
that the ordinary person has to pick up the can and put more 
money into the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do is have a more progressive taxation system. 
Many years ago we had seven or eight tax brackets in Canada.  The 
Mulroney government reduced that to three.  In the last budget we 
had a fourth tax bracket added, which is a very minor step in the 
right direction.  Also, the tax rate for middle income people in 
the country is gradually going down from 26% to 23% so we will 
have a taxation system that is a bit more graduated, except that 
the highest tax bracket still remains at 29%, I think.  In the 
United States the highest tax bracket goes up to 45% or 50% for 
extremely wealthy people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the United States there is a more progressive taxation 
system than we have in this country, and the United States is the 
world's bastion of so-called capitalism, where they talk about 
making life as easy as possible for investors and people with a 
lot of money and a lot of wealth.  Even in the United States 
there is a more progressive taxation system on the individual 
income tax side.  We have to get back to that in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Alliance across the way.  The people of Canada should 
be aware that the Alliance Party is pushing a single flat tax 
system in the country.  It is a single rate, a flat tax.  That is 
the most regressive tax of all that we could have.  Even the 
Republicans in the United States have dropped the idea of a flat 
tax.  George Bush and the Republicans think it is too regressive 
for the Republicans in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  But not for the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  But not for the Alliance, not for the 
reformers.  They are advocating a flat tax whereby a wealthy 
person would pay the same tax rate as somebody who is teaching in 
an elementary school in Halifax or working on the assembly line 
in Oshawa or in a grocery store in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, if that is fair, if that is just.  That 
is what the Alliance Party in Canada is advocating, even 
flattening it more, giving the wealthier a bigger break, giving 
the rich a bigger break and putting a heavier load on the 
ordinary people.  Basically and fundamentally it wants to cut 
back on the role of government, just cut back and cut back on the 
role of government.  The Alliance says it wants to reduce the 
role of government in our society to the lowest common 
denominator.  I do not think that is the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a more progressive individual tax system and a gradual 
elimination of the GST, which is regressive because in a way it 
is a flat tax.  On the other side, we have to fill some of the 
loopholes in the current taxation system that are there for some 
of the wealthy and some of the big corporations in Canada. 
Finally, we have to readjust our corporate tax rate in Canada so 
that the large corporations pay more of their fair share.  A 
number of years ago the large corporations paid a lot more in 
taxes than they do today.  Today individuals are paying more and 
corporations are paying less.  It used to be the other way in the 
days of Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau and even in the first 
part of the Mulroney years when all this started to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad thing about it is that when the Liberal Party took over, 
instead of making a more progressive taxation system in terms of 
our society, it got spooked into a more reactionary and 
conservative taxation system because the Liberals feared the 
Reform Party.  The Liberals feared the agenda of the Reform 
Party, now the Alliance.  This Liberal Party made a sharp turn to 
the right.  It is the most right wing, conservative Liberal Party 
we have seen in the history of our country and that is why we 
have to make a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a fair taxation system we can give people the freedom to 
have more equality of condition.  With a fair taxation system we 
can still raise a lot of government revenues for social programs, 
for education, health, research and development, social housing 
and the farm crisis.  If we had a fair taxation system we could 
accomplish all these things for the common good.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to start is to make sure we gradually eliminate the GST. 
We could take the first steps in that direction by taking the GST 
off reading materials and some of the other basic necessities. 
That would help ordinary citizens of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with that and say that I hope to see Liberal 
colleagues getting up and telling me they are embarrassed that 
their party broke its promise in 1993, when the candidate from 
Peterborough, for example, was out there for the party that 
promised to get rid of the GST.  I would like to see him get up 
in the House of Commons now and explain why his party broke that 
promise and why he hangs his head in the House of Commons 
whenever this issue comes up.  His party has broken a basic and 
fundamental promise to the people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like medicare.  I am told that way back in 1919 the 
Liberal Party promised health care for Canada.  It promised 
medicare in 1919.  That did not happen until about 1966 and it 
only happened at that time because of the leadership of the CCF 
of Saskatchewan, where the first health care system in Canada 
became such a popular idea that in 1966 the Pearson government 
brought it in.  That took an awful long time.  It took 47 years 
to keep that promise.  How long will it be before the Liberal 
Party keeps its promise on the GST? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I end with that question and I hope some of those members have 
the courage to get up and tell us why they have broken faith and 
why they have broken this engagement with the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-24, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (organized crime and law enforcement) and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to lead off the 
debate on an issue of major concern to all Canadians: the problem 
of organized crime and the legislative tools available to our 
police, prosecutors and courts to address that problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne, our government promised to take 
aggressive steps to combat organized crime, including the 
creation of stronger anti-gang laws. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building upon the foundation that the government put in place 
over the past several years, including the 1997 anti-gang 
amendments to the criminal code, the proposed legislation would 
enable law enforcement to respond to the threat of organized 
crime in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24, an act to amend the criminal code regarding organized 
crime and law enforcement, responds to our commitment to law 
enforcement officials and to my provincial counterparts to 
provide additional legislative tools to assist them in the fight 
against the many manifestations of organized crime.  The 
legislative measures set out in Bill C-24 seek to assist Canadian 
law enforcement officials in the fight against organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These proposals fall into four categories: first, measures to 
improve the protection of people who play a role in the justice 
system from intimidation; second, the creation of an accountable 
process to protect law enforcement officers from criminal 
liability for certain otherwise illegal acts committed in the 
course of an investigation; third, legislation to broaden the 
powers of law enforcement to forfeit the proceeds of crime, and 
in particular the profits of criminal organizations, and to seize 
property that was used in a crime; and, fourth, the creation of a 
number of new offences targeting involvement with criminal 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few moments to acknowledge the valuable 
contributions made to its development by my provincial colleagues 
and their officials.  It has been a truly collaborative effort 
characterized by mutual respect, patience and a commitment to the 
development of a broad based response to the threats of organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These efforts resulted in the adoption last September of the 
national agenda to combat organized crime.  In Iqaluit, the 
solicitor general and I agreed with our provincial and 
territorial colleagues on an action plan.  That plan has several 
key elements, but expanded and strengthened legislative tools 
were at the forefront of this national response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that tougher and more effective laws are not the 
full answer to the problem of organized crime.  The enforcement 
program that we announced when the bill was introduced 
demonstrates our commitment to attacking the problem on all 
fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first aspect of Bill C-24 involves a range of steps to deal 
with the intimidation of persons involved in the criminal justice 
system.  There are those who ask why is it necessary to amend the 
law to deal with the intimidation of persons involved in the 
criminal justice system.  They point to a number of provisions in 
the criminal code that might be employed to address this issue. 
The simple answer is that the existing law needs to be 
strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal justice system depends for its proper functioning 
upon the participation of various members of our community. There 
are the professionals responsible for the investigation and 
prosecution of crime, the judges and those who deal with 
convicted offenders, and members of the public who participate as 
witnesses and jurors. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all stakeholders to be able to participate effectively, they 
and those with whom they are associated must be free to act 
without being subjected to threats, prejudice, intimidation or 
physical injury. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent times prosecutors, judges, witnesses, police and 
prison guards, as well as their families, have been subjected to 
intimidation intended to destabilize the criminal justice system. 
The purpose of intimidation is to interfere with the ability to 
hold trials in an environment conducive to proper deliberations 
where participants in the system feel free to play the role 
expected of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether acts of intimidation are subtle or explicit they are of 
particular concern with regard to the prosecution of organized 
crime.  Concern about organized crime was shared by members of 
parliament.  Last year the subcommittee on organized crime was 
struck to examine a myriad of issues related to organized crime. 
It brought forward recommendations which included two specific 
criminal code amendments intended to address concerns over 
intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to note that Bill C-24 implements both those 
recommendations.  One of those recommendations called for the 
enactment of measures beyond those now in place to more fully 
protect jurors serving in trials related to organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly the government proposes changes to the jury 
selection process set out in the criminal code to allow a judge 
to order that the names and addresses of prospective jurors not 
be read out in open court.  A judge would be empowered in 
appropriate cases to ban the publication of any information that 
could disclose the identity of a juror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally Bill C-24 not only increases the penalty associated 
with the existing offence of intimidation to five years 
imprisonment.  It introduces a new offence punishable by up to 14 
years imprisonment to deal with acts of intimidation that target 
justice system participants intended to impede the administration 
of criminal justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new section of the criminal code would make it an offence to 
engage in acts of violence against a justice system participant 
or a family member of that participant.  It would be an offence 
to harass, stalk or threaten these people with the intention of 
either provoking a state of fear in a group of persons or the 
general public in order to impede the administration of justice 
or a justice system participant in the performance of his or her 
duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn my attention now to the aspect of Bill C-24 that seeks to 
protect law enforcement officers from criminal liability when for 
legitimate law enforcement purposes they commit acts that would 
otherwise be illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada in its unanimous 1999 judgment in 
Regina v Campbell and Shirose stated that the police was not 
immune from criminal liability for criminal activities committed 
in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation.  However, 
while observing that “everybody is subject to the ordinary law 
of the land”, the supreme court explicitly recognized that “if 
some form of public interest immunity is to be extended to the 
police..., it should be left to parliament to delineate the 
nature and scope of the immunity and the circumstances in which 
it is available”.  Through Bill C-24 the government takes up the 
challenge offered to it by the Supreme Court of Canada and 
properly assumes its responsibility to provide guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After issuing a consultation paper last year and engaging in 
much consultation the government has put the proposals before the 
House.  The proposed scheme contemplates several means of 
ensuring accountability.  These involve a combination of new 
legislative measures contained in Bill C-24, police training, as 
well as reliance on existing judicial and disciplinary means to 
ensure compliance with rules governing their use of powers given 
under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation does not propose the granting of blanket 
immunity to all law enforcement officers for unlawful acts 
committed in the course of carrying out lawful law enforcement 
responsibilities.  However, the legislation does provide a form 
of very limited immunity.  Colleagues need to understand that for 
many years law enforcement authorities were working on the basis 
that they had common law immunity.  All the supreme court did was 
make it plain that there was not common law immunity but called 
upon parliament to put in place a legislative scheme if it saw 
fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is how the scheme would work.  When a public officer is 
engaged in the enforcement of any act of the Parliament of 
Canada, doing that which would otherwise constitute an offence 
may be permissible if the following elements exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, before the person can act he or she must be designated 
a competent authority.  The individual must also believe on 
reasonable grounds that committing the act or failing to act is 
the reasonable course of action and proportional in the 
circumstances and including whether there is any other available means of 
carrying out their duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the proposed scheme would provide immunity for the 
intentional or criminally negligent causing of death or bodily 
harm; the wilful attempt to obstruct, pervert or defeat the 
course of justice; or conduct that would violate the sexual 
integrity of an individual.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature of the legislative package before us today is a 
new approach to addressing participation in the activities of 
criminal organizations.  The bill contains a new definition of 
criminal organization and three new offences that effectively 
criminalize the full range of involvement with organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At its core, the danger of organized crime flows from the 
enhanced threat posed to society when people combine for the 
commission of serious crimes.  Historically criminal law has 
responded to this elevated harm by punishing individuals for 
engaging in conspiracy and for aiding or abetting the commission 
of specific offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 in Bill C-95 parliament went further and directly 
targeted organizations of such individuals for the very first 
time by providing a definition of criminal organization, 
increased investigative powers and increased penalties for those 
committing crimes in conjunction with criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Law enforcement officials and provincial attorneys general have 
called for a simplified definition of criminal organization and 
for offences that respond to all harmful forms of involvement in 
criminal organizations.  That is precisely what we have done in 
the legislation before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current definition only covers criminal organizations that 
have at least five members, at least two of whom have committed 
serious offences within the preceding five years.  As well, the 
organizations themselves must be shown to have been committing 
crimes punishable by a maximum sentence of five years or more in 
prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a signatory to the United Nations convention against 
organized crime which affirms that a group of three persons 
having the aim of committing serious crimes constitutes a 
sufficient threat to society to warrant special scrutiny from the 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canadians want our law enforcement officials to 
be able to target criminal groups of three or more individuals, 
one of whose main purposes or activities is either committing 
serious crimes or making it easier for others to commit serious 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conjunction with a more streamlined definition, the full 
range of involvement with criminal organizations is targeted in 
Bill C-24 by three new offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first offence targets participation in or contribution to 
the activities of criminal organizations.  Taking part in the 
activities of a criminal organization, even if such participation 
does not itself constitute an offence, will now be a crime where 
such actions are done for the purpose of enhancing the ability of 
the criminal organization to facilitate or commit indictable 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also addresses the concern expressed by law enforcement 
officials and provincial attorneys general that the current 
requirement of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused 
was a party to a specific crime shields from prosecution those in 
the upper echelons of criminal organizations who isolate 
themselves from its day to day activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that successful recruitment enhances the threat posed to 
society by criminal organizations.  It allows them to grow and to 
more effectively achieve their harmful criminal objectives. Those 
who act as recruiters for criminal organizations contribute to 
these ends both when they recruit for specific crimes and when 
they recruit simply to expand the organization's human capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the expressed provisions of the proposed participation 
offence make it clear that the crown does not in making its case 
need to link the impugned participation, in this case 
recruitment, to any particular offence.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have called for mere membership in a criminal organization 
to be an offence.  In my view such a proposal would be extremely 
difficult to apply and would be vulnerable to charter challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second new offence retains the core of section 467.1 of the 
criminal code which is the criminal organization offence 
introduced in Bill C-95.  The new offence targets those who aid, 
abet, counsel or commit any indictable offence in conjunction 
with a criminal organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the existing provision, it would not require the crown to 
prove both that the accused has participated in or substantially 
contributed to the activities of a criminal organization and that 
he or she has been a party to the commission of an indictable 
offence punishable by five or more years of imprisonment.  The 
participation-contribution requirement has been removed entirely 
and the range of offences targeted has been broadened to include 
all indictable offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third new offence deals specifically with leaders in 
criminal organizations.  Like the participation offence, it does 
so not by criminalizing status but by proscribing the harmful 
behaviour itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaders of criminal organizations pose a unique threat to 
society.  Operationally they threaten us through their enhanced 
experience and skills.  Motivationally they threaten us through 
their constant encouragement of potential and existing criminal 
organization members.  Accordingly in the bill we have moved 
aggressively to identify, target and punish those within criminal 
organizations, whether or not formally designated as leaders, who 
knowingly instruct others to commit any offence, indictable or 
otherwise, under any act of parliament for the benefit of, at the 
direction of, or in association with a criminal organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The penalty provisions for the three offences I have outlined 
confirm the government's resolve to provide a proportionate and 
graduated means of addressing all forms of involvement with 
criminal organizations and to ultimately break the back of 
organized crime in Canada.  The participation offence I 
previously described is punishable by a maximum of five years of 
imprisonment, the party liability offence by a maximum of 14 
years of imprisonment, and the leadership related offence is 
punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore each of these punishments has been fortified by an 
appropriately aggressive sentencing regime.  Its two critical 
components are mandatory imposition of consecutive sentences for 
the offences and a presumptive parole ineligibility period of 
one-half the imposed sentence.  When these measures are combined 
with our newly expanded and improved criminal forfeiture scheme 
our message to organized crime is clear:  crime does not, will 
not and must not pay in Canada, and we will take all necessary 
measures to ensure the continued safety of our homes, streets and 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all provisions of the bill specifically target organized 
crime groups.  Several elements in the proposed legislation are 
meant to improve criminal law generally.  These improvements to 
the law will nonetheless be extremely useful in combating 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offences initially listed as enterprise crimes were those 
considered most likely to be committed by organized crime groups. 
Over the years, as organized crime evolved and moved into new 
areas of criminal activity, new offences were added to the list 
of enterprise crimes.  Today the list of such crimes stands at 
over 40 with no indication that we will stop adding new offences 
to the list.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, by limiting the proceeds of crime provisions 
to certain listed offences, we have created two types of 
criminal:  the criminal whose proceeds are subject to the 
proceeds of crime provisions of the code and whose illicit 
profits can be ordered forfeited by the courts, and the criminal 
whose profits fall outside the reach of the proceeds provisions 
of the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, there is a proposal to eliminate the enterprise 
crime list approach and expand the application of the proceeds of 
crime provisions to designated offences, that is, to most 
indictable federal offences.  In this manner the profits from the 
commission of most serious crimes would be subject to forfeiture. 
All existing protections, such as notice provisions, applications 
to revoke or vary orders, appeals and remedies, will of course 
continue to be available to the accused and to third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must be in a position to offer the necessary assistance 
to foreign countries that have successfully investigated and 
prosecuted members of organized crime groups and whose courts 
have ordered the confiscation of tainted property located in 
Canada.  I would like to ensure that Canada is not singled out 
for its inability to provide the necessary assistance to help 
such jurisdictions obtain the confiscated property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the bill proposes a number of amendments to the 
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act that would allow 
Canada to enforce foreign confiscation orders.  That is 
important.  The provisions contained in the proposed legislation 
would allow Canada to respond on the basis of a treaty to 
requests from a foreign jurisdiction for assistance in enforcing 
a confiscation order issued by a court in that jurisdiction in 
relation to proceeds of crime derived from the commission of a 
criminal offence for which the accused was convicted.  In 
anticipation of a confiscation request, Canada would also be able 
to provide assistance in respect of a request to seize or 
restrain the targeted proceeds located in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments would also facilitate requests from 
Canada regarding the enforcement of restraint or forfeiture 
orders for proceeds of crime located in foreign jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last element that I want to stress deals with offence 
related property.  The bill contains amendments to make the 
offence related property forfeiture regime in the code apply to 
all indictable offences.  As well, the present exemption from 
forfeiture for most real property would be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the measures I have outlined today would ensure that 
we have the tools necessary to combat the increased threat of 
organized crime.  Let there be no mistake that the proposals 
before us would provide more effective laws and aggressive 
prosecution strategies to target organized crime at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank colleagues for their support of this initiative.  I look 
forward to their support because the initiative would ensure that 
our streets and communities are safe from a most pernicious 
element within our society, organized crime.

organized crime legislation, Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck by the almost desperate plea that the Minister of 
Justice made to the House to pass the legislation.   The matters 
I heard her raise, discuss and urge upon the House are things my 
party and its predecessor the Reform Party have been saying for 
years.  They have been desperately asking the House to bring 
forward legislation to address organized crime.  Over and over 
again Liberal members have simply stonewalled or refused to bring 
forward legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I am relieved to see after years of the 
opposition fighting for more effective laws to help combat gangs 
and other criminal organizations that the federal Liberals have 
finally woke up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election they realized that organized crime was an 
issue.  Suddenly the government said that it better do something 
because there was a danger to our country and to our 
institutions.  It said that police officers were having a 
difficult time coping and the courts were overwhelmed by the 
issue of organized crime.  I therefore note, with a bit of 
bewilderment, that the Liberals finally woke up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the minister for bringing the bill forward because there 
are some very good things in it.  I know the minister is also 
very open to ideas and prides herself in listening, discussing 
and accepting recommendations from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am relieved that the government is finally acknowledging that 
organized crime is a serious problem.  The rest of the country 
has been saying this for many years.  It is no secret, although 
to the Liberal caucus it was a bit of a secret, that the level of 
activity of criminal organizations has increased substantially in 
recent years, posing a severe risk to public safety and security. 
Not only has there been an increase in the level of activity. 
There has also been an increase in the intensity of violence 
including bombing, threats and intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extent of collaboration within and among criminal groups has 
broadened greatly.  The available technology has improved their 
ability to conduct organized crime by leaps and bounds.  Over the 
years Canada has become a very attractive place for these types 
of criminals.  According to the Criminal Intelligence Service of 
Canada, CISC, “virtually every major criminal group in the world 
is active in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Antonio Nicaso, a well known organized crime specialist and 
author, has said that Canada has become one of the world's most 
important centres for global crime syndicates in part because of 
federal regulations and laws.  He has stated that prior to Bill 
C-22 it was harder to import cheese into Canada due to the 
restriction of the minister of agriculture than it was to import 
a suitcase full of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP commissioner has said recently that for the first time 
there are signs of criminal organizations which are so 
sophisticated they are actually focusing on destabilizing certain 
aspects of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has long recognized these frightening indications and 
for years as the Reform Party and now the Alliance we have been 
calling for changes in the way the government should approach 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few years there have been a few halfhearted 
attempts by the government to adapt our laws to help fight these 
criminals.  Just before the 1997 election the Liberal government 
pushed through parliament amendments to the criminal code that 
were intended to fight organized crime.  However, because it was 
so last minute the opposition was not able to hear from witnesses 
to determine whether the proposed legislation would be effective.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association stated that Bill C-95 did not go 
far enough to provide police and prosecutors with the tools to 
fight organized crime.  There were a few, some estimate perhaps 
under five, ineffective prosecutions under the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the justice minister at the time said during the debate 
that he did not claim the bill represented everything needed to 
fight organized crime but that it was just the first step.  Under 
intense pressure from not only opposition politicians but also 
from police and other concerned members in the community, the 
government has finally introduced some of the long needed 
legislation for which we have been calling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party welcomes many of the proposals in the new bill, but a 
number of significant deficiencies in the legislation still 
require further amendment to adequately address the problem of 
gang participation and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most disturbing feature of the legislation is its failure to 
make it a criminal offence to be a member of a group already 
proven to be a criminal organization.  Contrary to the 
suggestions of the Minister of Justice, this provision does not 
make participation or membership in a criminal organization 
illegal unless it can be proven that the person had the intention 
to facilitate illegal transactions for that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that an organization is criminal would have to be 
proven in each particular case over and over again.  It would 
result in needless duplication of resources, expenses and the 
prolongation of criminal trials, which would again have an impact 
upon the court system and its resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members often think that all we have to do is pass a law in the 
House and things will change.  In the real world things are not 
that simple.  As a minister of justice of a provincial government 
I actually had to carry out the laws that parliamentarians 
passed.  The reality is not simply the law. The reality is the 
resources that must be provided to make even the best legislation 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall my colleagues in the Bloc put forward a supply motion 
that called for parliament to make it a crime to belong to a 
criminal organization.  The Liberal government argued that such a 
provision might be considered unconstitutional.  However, making 
illegal participation in a group that has been proven to be a 
criminal organization is a reasonable limit on freedom of 
association and other freedoms in the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the primary if not the sole purpose of such an association 
is to commit illegal acts, the safety and security of private 
citizens may reasonably supersede the individual rights of the 
persons conspiring to commit these acts or participating in these 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to bring the Bloc proposal forward as was 
suggested earlier.   What is the fear of bringing the proposal 
forward?  Is it that it might be unconstitutional?  If the courts 
do not believe that our citizens are deserving of this 
protection, let them tell us so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not settle for second best because the Liberal 
government is frightened to pass the legislation that it needs to 
pass.  The courts should tell us and we will respect the courts. 
If the courts believe citizens are not entitled to that 
protection then parliament must listen to what the courts say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain members think what I am saying is funny.  It is not 
funny.  A member across the way laughs about what I am doing.  I 
take the seriousness of the situation to heart and members have a 
responsibility for the safety and security of our citizens.  If 
members opposite want to joke about that, let them joke.  I can 
take that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another equally disturbing fact about the bill is the serious 
lack of funding and resources that has plagued and continues to 
plague the administrators of our justice system.  Frontline 
officers fighting to get these criminals prosecuted have been 
effectively handcuffed with a serious lack of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal organizations have the best possible tools.  They have 
state of the art technology.  They have access to millions of 
dollars derived from illegal activities to fund their activities. 
Meanwhile our frontline police officers struggle to maintain 
existing technology.  They are unable to adapt to new and 
emerging technologies because of insufficient funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding has become a vital issue in our continuing fight against 
the sophisticated and wealthy organized crime syndicates. 
Organized crime investigations are themselves resource intensive, 
costly, highly technical, lengthy and complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was first introduced over two weeks ago the 
justice minister announced a mere $200 million of funding.  To me 
and the average citizen $200 million is a lot of money.  The 
government continually includes an amount of money in a package 
announcement as though the money is immediately available.  That 
is not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount is spread over five years.  It does not come close to 
the amount that is needed for frontline law enforcement officials 
to do their jobs effectively.  When one looks at the $200 million 
over five years and where the money will go, it will not be to 
local police forces in Winnipeg, Calgary or Vancouver that 
actually do the investigations.  Some of it will go to the RCMP, 
and we applaud that.  What concerns me about the $200 million is 
that it will not go to the places it needs to go in terms of 
frontline investigation and help for the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from experience and knowledge having dealt with that 
matter when I was minister of justice for a provincial 
government.  The need to fight organized crime in whatever form 
we find it is a constant concern.  Another concern is the lack of 
resources available at the provincial level and the reluctance of 
the federal government to put its money where its mouth is. From 
time to time the government comes up with bills and makes 
impassioned speeches to the House to pass the legislation. 
We agree that the legislation should be passed but we need to 
make it effective legislation.  How do we actually carry it out? 
We cannot simply stand here in Ottawa and say that we have now 
given the tools when we pass the legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to financially support our front line police officers. 
If we are not prepared to do that then all our speeches, our 
legislation and the studies and the years that have gone into the 
legislation were all for naught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one considers the annual RCMP expenditures alone in one 
year, the $200 million extra to fight organized crime is a drop 
in the bucket.  If this was all going to front line RCMP officers 
it would be a good start, but everyone here in the House realizes 
that is not where it is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not even talking about the municipal police forces that 
carry out the mandate of parliament when we pass legislation. 
Who will help the Toronto police force or the maritime municipal 
police forces that have a very real interest in protecting their 
citizens against this pernicious criminal activity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the introduction of additional funding by the 
government gives the appearance of a substantive and immediate 
injection of funds, the funds allocated on a yearly basis will 
not significantly enhance police or prosecution resources when we 
consider that a relatively simply prosecution under this 
legislation can cost $10 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand from newspaper reports that a special courthouse is 
being built in Quebec for these types of crimes.  The courthouse 
alone is estimated to cost $10 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a justice minister in Manitoba we had to build a 
special courthouse at a cost of $3.5 million.  The money was well 
spent.  It was essential to not only have legislation in place 
but to put the resources in place to actually get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the ramifications to legal aid, to prosecutors, 
to police overtime and to clerks, $10 million for one trial is 
not an uncommon amount.  We see the courthouse being built for 
$10 million in Quebec and then we think of what it will cost to 
conduct a trial.  We cannot allow organized criminals to have 
even an inkling of an understanding that we are not prepared to 
support our police officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have actually convinced the Liberals that this is the 
right direction to move in, I am glad.  At least they have taken 
the first step, the legislative step, but now they have to take 
the second step.  The earlier legislation was only part of the 
first step.  This is getting close to completing the first step. 
The huge step, the financial issue, has to be addressed but, 
unfortunately, it is not being addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged that the Minister of Justice might find it in 
her heart to convince some of her colleagues over there who might 
be mean-spirited enough to deny our police officers these 
resources.  I recognize that she has a very difficult job trying 
to convince some of these people on the other side; not all of 
them, some of them are very good people. 
She needs to convince some of the Liberals who do not believe 
that this is really a problem.  If that is the basis of her 
leadership speech, as was just mentioned, let it be her 
leadership speech. I do not think it is a bad thing to do. I 
would encourage the Minister of Justice to move in that 
direction, if not in the leadership, at least in terms of finding 
that money for our police officers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am making those comments to her through you, Mr. Speaker.  I 
wanted that clear on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat heartening to see that the legislation proposes 
added protection from intimidation for people who work in the 
justice system, such as witnesses, jurors, police, prosecutors, 
prison guards, judges, members of parliament and senators. This 
is absolutely crucial.  It is one of the practical steps that 
needed to be taken and is being taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some shortcomings in that list.  I am not sure whether 
it adequately protects other key players in the fight against 
crime, especially when we look at the listing of federal MPs. 
Does it protect provincial MLAs or members of the national 
assembly in Quebec, in particular, provincial justice ministers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not say that because I was a provincial justice minister 
but I do think they are on the front line with the police and 
they deserve protection as well.  We do not want them, the deputy 
ministers nor anyone involved in provincial justice departments 
who are front line workers in the fight against crime to be 
intimidated.  They need the same level of protection as federal 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem mean-spirited of us if we granted the protection 
to ourselves when we do not even carry out the day to day 
activities and refuse to grant it to those who carry it out on a 
day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as recent cases demonstrate, journalists who 
demonstrate their service of the public interest by reporting on 
organized crime also need and deserve the enhanced protection 
under our criminal law.  It is absolutely essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media is a very important tool in the fight against 
organized crime.  One need only point out the well known case of 
Michel Auger, a Montreal crime reporter.  That case demonstrates 
the need for extra protection for journalists.  Last September he 
was shot five times as he arrived at the offices of his 
newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not the only incident in Canada where journalists had 
been the subject of attack, where they have had the courage to 
stand up and say the right things and write the right things. 
Jean-Pierre Charbonneau, who is now speaker of the Quebec 
legislature, was shot three times in the chest and the arm in the 
newsroom in 1973 while he was a reporter covering an inquiry into 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 a freelance reporter was shot after answering a knock on 
his front door.  He was shot in both legs and survived what 
police called a warning by bikers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know of the case of the editor of North America's largest 
Punjabi paper.  He was shot and killed in his suburban Vancouver 
garage in 1998 by an unidentified killer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the press who research and report on all items of 
interest to Canadians, in particular, matters pertaining to their 
safety, must be protected from these types of attacks on 
democracy and freedom of the press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to say that we have a general provision that 
covers attempted murder or murder. 
As a democracy and as passionate believers in free speech, we 
need to send out a specific, clear, legislated message that those 
journalists are entitled to that protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons should never allow attempts by criminal 
groups to intimidate any person or any democratic institution, 
and I include the press in those democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also addresses the issue of police immunity.  I think 
all right thinking people understand the need for police to have 
these powers.  We also understand the need for clear criteria 
governing those activities.  It was always the case that police 
had those clear criteria in place as policies that governed their 
activities.  The Supreme Court of Canada has come along and said 
that we need to put that in legislation.  I agree because I do 
not think it is necessary to fight on that issue.  Let us put 
clear criteria in place but let us not hamstring and handcuff our 
police officers at an undue cost to our security and the security 
of our citizens to enjoy democracy and their democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister needs to bear in mind that when we create immunity 
for police, we also have to address the possible adverse impacts 
on law-abiding citizens and the damage that might be done to 
their property by a police officer carrying out his or her duties 
under this protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a police officer has to steal and destroy a car, which would 
be permitted under the criteria, damage other property or commit 
some other crime that causes damage to a citizen's 
property, I do not believe the citizen should have to bear that 
responsibility personally.  This is a societal cost.  This is a 
cost that we as a society must bear because we have given this 
power to the police.

in the Americas.  The reality is that Quebec is a developed,

it would have been only natural for Quebec to be at the table in 
the same capacity as all sovereign nations and to negotiate 
itself the agreements which will change the lives of its people. 
The reality is that it is becoming increasingly evident that 
the Canadian federation is an obstacle to the development of a 
modern Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what a 
difference a weekend in Quebec City makes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before Quebec the government said that it would never sign 
another trade agreement with NAFTA chapter 11 provisions.  After 
the weekend in a Quebec hotel, the Prime Minister is in love.  He 
said that chapter 11 was working well and that there was no 
problem with corporations suing democratically elected 
governments for acting in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the trade minister please advise Canadians:  Has the 
government changed its position? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  No, Mr. Speaker, the government has not changed its 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada signed chapter 11 of NAFTA some years 
ago and we believe that it is absolutely imperative that 
investments be protected around trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been seeking as a government has been a 
clarification from panels that have made some decisions which we 
think do not really reflect the intentions of the countries when 
the agreement was signed.  There is a difference.  We are not 
reopening or renegotiating the chapter.  We want to clarify some 
elements for the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
sounds a bit like the difference between marital bliss and 
adultery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the trade minister what he told a parliamentary 
committee just over a year ago.  He said “We are not going to 
enter into those kinds of investor state dispute mechanisms in 
any other agreements and we're going to try to find a way to get 
this particular chapter out of NAFTA”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the Prime Minister huffing and puffing about a 
democracy clause, while he shackles this and future governments 
with the threat of being sued by foreign corporations for 
responding to citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of democracy is that?

obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The kind of democracy we support was 34 elected leaders of this 
hemisphere asking for access to markets and asking for 
development.  That is the kind of democracy we believe in: a 
better hemisphere, a lot more democratic than it was 25 years 
ago, based on solid development that trade can bring to all of 
them.  There were a lot of socialist leaders among them, but they 
have come to live in this century instead of the last one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A meeting was arranged.  As I said earlier there was a

talk to the secretary of agriculture with respect to P.E.I. 
potatoes and other issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand we heard very little from our Prime Minister

Prime Minister was more interested in being an amigo and hoping 
to get an invitation to the White House for dinner.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the commerce department will decide today.  I 
suspect that it will accept delegations of the industry and begin 
to investigate our practices, but I said over the weekend to 
every American I had the opportunity to meet that our Canadian 
softwood lumber industry trades fairly in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will defend and promote our industry very energetically.  I 
reiterated that all through the weekend.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Prime Minister made a statement to the effect that 
chapter 11 of NAFTA was no problem whatsoever.  This chapter 
enables a major transnational to sue a state for the loss of 
potential revenue specifically as a result of that state's 
adoption of legislation or regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister explain the contradiction between his 
statement on chapter 11 and the one recently made by his 
Minister for International Trade, who again indicated that he 
would not sign any FTAA containing such a mechanism? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to be sure that I am quoted correctly 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have always said is that protection of investments was 
absolutely necessary.  We have Canadian investors throughout the 
world and throughout the Americas, and their investments must be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have said, however, is that we wanted to clarify, not 
reopen, not renegotiate, chapter 11—which we have already signed 
off on—but that we want to clarify certain aspects of chapter 11 
because we believe there have been, or may have been, certain 
interpretations which, without any doubt, do not reflect the 
intentions of the three signatory countries at the time we 
signed it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us 
be clear.  The minister has often said he would not sign any 
FTAA if there were any provisions similar to chapter 11 of 
NAFTA.  Even on the federal Internet site, which we are 
constantly being invited to visit, we read that “Canada is not 
advocating the replication of NAFTA investor-state rules in the 
FTAA”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask him what explanation he can give today for 
the about-face by his government, the about-face by his Prime 
Minister last night in stating that there was no problem with 
chapter 11, that he was prepared to renew it within any future 
agreement between the three Americas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, our government has not yet tabled its position 
relating to investments with respect to the free trade area of 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have always said, however, is that we are going to take 
into account, within the free trade area of the Americas, of the 
experience we have acquired with NAFTA.  There are certain 
precautions we are going to take, because we are currently 
engaged in the process of clarifying certain potential 
interpretations of this chapter, and obviously cannot sign 
anything in the FTAA that would not reflect the improvements we 
want to make in light of present realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time we are still involved in consultations 
with Canadians and our position will be made public as soon as 
it has been established.

The <I>National Post</I> sent a copy of the documents to the PMO,

it was this government that brought all the premiers and

unanimous agreement on stabilizing the health care system, not 
only an additional injection of dollars but a coherent plan upon 
which all governments agreed to tackle the issues of shortages of 
doctors and nurses, modernizing equipment and making certain 
Canadians have access to frontline care.  That is leadership.

cuts it made to health care since 1995.  It is hardly leadership 
to put back the money that it took out of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of prompt, quality health care in the country. 
People are on waiting lists.  Our equipment is obsolete.  Even 
third world countries will not take it.  Something needs to be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have received notice of an emergency 
debate from the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
you will have received a letter from me earlier in the day in 
which I request an emergency debate on the subject of the summit 
of the Americas meeting that concluded yesterday in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the debate to be about that summit and the events 
surrounding it, in particular the security measures employed over 
the course of the three days of the summit, including the 
unprovoked use of measures of force such as water cannon, tear 
gas and rubber bullets by security personnel on peaceful 
protesters.  I want to emphasize peaceful because it is the use 
of these kinds of measures on peaceful protesters that is of such 
great concern and should be of great concern to all members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sons and daughters of many of our constituents were out 
there peacefully expressing their concern.  For the House or at 
least the government to hold them in contempt as they did during 
question period and call them hooligans and whatnot is very 
misplaced.  It made me glad that it was the police in charge of 
Quebec City and not the Liberal caucus because not even the 
police acted with such rhetorical contempt for the young people 
who faced them outside the wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be an appropriate matter for parliament to 
debate and I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to agree to such a debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise to speak to Bill C-24, since the Bloc 
Quebecois has argued for such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was one of the Bloc Quebecois' issues throughout the election 
campaign.  In truth, the Bloc Quebecois has been asking for 
years for a law with teeth to effectively fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before speaking about the bill specifically, I have an aside to 
make. 
I listened attentively to the speech by the Minister of Justice, 
and I must say I was rather disappointed by it, not because I 
was expecting congratulations from the minister for myself or 
the Bloc Quebecois on our tenacity in this matter, quite 
honestly I was not expecting that, but I think she left out 
big chunks of this story.  Today, she is gloating, she is proud 
of tabling a bill like this, but we have to look at what led the 
minister to table this bill.  I think it worthwhile to point out 
a few things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, she spoke of a certain justice committee 
that studied the question.  Indeed, the standing committee 
on justice did examine the whole question of organized crime. 
Why did the committee deliberate on this issue?  Simply because 
we took one of the Bloc Quebecois' opposition days to introduce 
a motion to convince the Liberal government opposite, the 
government the minister represents as the Minister of Justice, 
to convince this government it was time and important for the 
House to consider the problem of organized crime and to try to 
come up with solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a day of debate, a number of oral question periods and, 
following a unanimous vote by the House of Commons, the matter 
of organized crime was referred to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights so proposals could be made to the 
government.  The minister seems to have forgotten that part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also mentioned having questioned the minister on a number of 
occasions, which I did again during this session.  Barely three 
weeks before the minister decided to introduce antigang 
legislation, the bill before us today, she answered one of my 
questions here in this House to the effect that the criminal 
code contained all that was needed to fight organized crime. 
Three weeks before introduction of the bill, the minister was 
telling us that the criminal code and related legislation did 
not require amending in any way for there to be an effective 
campaign against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will understand that I am delighted to have 
convinced the minister to introduce such a bill, but they will 
agree with me that its maternity, or perhaps paternity, is open 
to question.  I have often said that the minister did not 
understand the matter in the least. 
She has demonstrated not only her total lack of understanding 
but also her lack of monitoring of the matter, by stating a 
scant three weeks before this bill was introduced that it was 
not necessary to change the rules relating to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us a highly complex bill.  I imagine the minister 
herself has not worked very hard on this bill, not to know of 
its existence three weeks ago.  A bill like this cannot be 
drafted overnight.  However, since we in the Bloc Quebecois are 
good sports, I congratulate the minister on having finally got 
the message.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this particular issue, the Bloc Quebecois has more than once 
extended a hand to the minister in the hope that she would decide 
to amend the rules having to do with the whole issue of organized 
crime in order to give the police and the justice system the 
tools they are demanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is aware that the Bloc Quebecois was pushing for 
changes.  People in the community, in the Quebec nation, in the 
rest of Canada as well, were also calling on the minister to make 
such changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to see the minister showing some thought for 
these people in her speech at second reading of Bill C-24 to 
amend the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked the minister to recognize that there were 
people, some of them in Quebec, who fought to have the law 
amended.  Some people in Quebec even lost their lives in this 
fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a part of the whole issue that the minister seems to 
have forgotten, because she did not thank or even congratulate or 
pay tribute to these people.  I will do so; it will be brief. 
However, I would like to say something about all the work and 
energy that people put into fighting, often quite resolutely, to 
convince the minister to make these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, in the 1990s, 1997 I think, in Montreal, an 11-year 
old called Daniel Desrochers lost his life in a bomb explosion 
connected to the biker gang wars that were going on at the time 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The torch was picked up by family and friends and by the Bloc 
Quebecois member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who worked to convince 
the Government of Canada to change the criminal code.  I must 
pay tribute to their efforts and tell them that they have 
contributed to the changes we have here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to salute and to thank Michel Auger, the 
reporter on a Quebec daily newspaper who used his pen to awaken 
the people of Quebec, the Quebec nation, and the people across 
the way here as well, to this scourge. He did not back down, and 
this needs to be recognized. 
Mr. Auger refused to back down and continued to say no to 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was a young man in the riding of Terrebonne.  The 
late Francis Laforêt stood up to organized crime and said “No”. 
He was a bar owner.  A gang wanted to take over control of his 
bar.  He said “No crooked dealings in my bar, there will be no 
drug dealing under my roof.  You are not gaining control here. 
No way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members know the rest.  He was beaten to death with 
baseball bats and goodness knows what else.  The young Francis 
Laforêt lost his life.  I have spoken with his family and 
friends and they too said no to violence, “No way are we going 
to let ourselves be pushed around by organized crime”. 
All these people, including Mr. Laforêt's parents, friends and 
brother, took action, prepared petitions, kept track of the 
issue and pressured municipal and federal governments and also 
members of parliament to get zoning regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, these people too made a contribution by saying “no” 
to violence and intimidation and “yes” to democracy. They helped 
convince the Minister of Justice or rather her department and 
those who drafted this bill. The determination shown by these 
people was such that officials decided to continue to work on 
this issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of history, part of that period. This is why Bloc 
Quebecois members have shown such an interest in this issue. One 
must realize the importance of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the government's own documents, we can see that 
organized crime is not a new phenomenon. It is not something 
that caught the government off guard because it was not aware of 
it. The government is well aware of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the RCMP did a study on organized crime and on the ins 
and outs of the war that has developed in Quebec in recent 
years. 
According to the documents I had this morning, the RCMP figured 
that, for the 1994-98 period alone, 79 murders were related to 
the bikers' war. This number does not apply to the whole of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period, 79 murders and 89 attempted murders were 
related to the drug trade and to the wars between Quebec biker 
gangs, in addition to 129 instances of arson and over 80 
bombings. These are figures that the minister knew or should 
have known. Both the Solicitor General of Canada and the 
Minister of Justice must have known about the situation, just as 
they must know that the drug trade is exceedingly lucrative for 
those who are involved in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec provincial police estimates that the Hell's Angels 
alone made profits of $100 million last year. 
The drug trade, from coast to coast in Canada, represents some $5 
billion.  The government opposite has known or should have known 
this for a very long time.  I was elected in October 1993 and 
have known about this since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the questions, motions, opposition interventions and all 
that has gone on, the government did not budge.  Finally the 
pressure reached such a pitch that the department decided to go 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the minister or the ministers who followed one another,— 
because since 1993-94 there has been more than one federal 
Minister of Justice—had the ministers acted more quickly, lives 
could certainly have been saved.  Fewer bombs would have exploded 
and fewer fires would have been lit.  But no, it took until 2001 
for such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime can be found everywhere. Naturally, it is to be 
found in the bars and in the world of prostitution.  On the 
fringes, organized crime can be found in the scourge of the 
illegal sale of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages and in illegal 
casinos, because there is a market for it.  There are similar 
places.  There are also high interest loans too. There is the 
whole question of drugs.  I hope the minister knows as well that 
they are not just found in the street now, but in almost all the 
schools.  Young people are regularly offered these drugs.  As 
well, there is the whole question of cornfields and farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take boy scouts to be able to plant entire fields of 
marijuana and to intimidate farmers.  Organized crime is behind 
that. 
A look at the map of Quebec makes it very clear—and this is what 
all Bloc Quebecois MPs from this region are also saying—that 
there are many such crops.  Many farmers are complaining about 
this situation.  Once again, I repeat, this is not a recent 
development.  The Minister of Justice has never seen fit to act. 
Fortunately, the opposition and the people of Quebec have stood 
firm and argued their case and today, finally, we have a bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it a real anti-gang bill?  Is it what the Bloc Quebecois 
members would have liked to see?  After looking it over, I would 
say that approximately 80% of the bill reflects the comments and 
answers given to questions put by Bloc Quebecois members to the 
minister in recent years.  This means that 80% of this bill is a 
victory for the Bloc Quebecois, and we are most pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean, however, that we are going to sit on our 
laurels and that we will not try to amend the bill further.  We 
are going to try to convince the minister on certain points, as 
the House will see a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for whether or not this is really an anti-gang law, that will 
depend on how it is enforced.  However, I think we are actually 
starting to have something more closely resembling such a law. 
With such legislation, we are starting to have tools which will 
make it possible to mount an effective campaign against 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People probably remember all the seizures made in Quebec under 
the existing provincial legislation, not the bill being debated 
today, but the existing Quebec legislation behind Opération 
Printemps 2001, which resulted in more than 160 arrests in 74 
municipalities in Quebec.  Millions of dollars were seized in 
the form of luxury vehicles, drugs and cash.  It was a very 
successful operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the operation per se, we can congratulate the 
police on a job well done. 
I would like to take this opportunity to commend them for their 
professionalism. However, we have to wait and see how many of 
the some 160 people arrested and charged with murder, attempted 
murder, corruption and other offences under the Food and Drugs 
Act will be found guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I think that, if the minister had acted sooner, 
Opération Printemps 2001 would have been conducted under new and 
much clearer and stricter provisions providing for harsher 
sentences, something we in the Bloc, as well as the police and 
the public have been asking for for some time now. Once again, 
the minister turned a deaf ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What provisions of this bill should we be thankful for? In 1997, 
when the then justice minister amended the criminal code to show 
that the government was doing something to fight organized 
crime, a definition of a criminal organization was provided and 
a criminal organization offence was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well that we had some concerns about those 
provisions, as we maintained that they would be hard to enforce 
because the onus was put first on the police, to carry out their 
investigations, and then on the crown prosecutors to convince 
the judge beyond any reasonable doubt that the people charged 
were guilty of being part of a criminal organization. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to talk about the three fives rule. In other words, to 
be able to indict somebody for an organized crime offence, we had 
to prove and still have to prove, because this is still in 
effect, that a group of five people had committed an indictable 
offence punishable by imprisonment for five years and that these 
five people had acted this way for five years. Of course, it had 
to be proven too that these five people knew that they were 
breaking the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a very heavy burden. The Bloc Quebecois asked the 
minister, among other things, whether she would change these 
rules. I remember distinctly that she stated in the House that it 
was not necessary, because it was easy to prove all of that, that 
crown prosecutors could prove it. At one point, she even asked us 
to present our suggestions to her if we had something in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 1, 1999 after several attempts to negotiate with her, I 
made up my mind that I had to put this on paper and send it to 
her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strangely enough, the definition on my document of June 1, 1999 
is almost identical to the one in Bill C-24. The minister finally 
understood that the three fives rule was difficult to enforce. 
Only three people, and not five, are now needed in order to have 
a criminal organization, just as I suggested on June 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally, we could have dropped it to two people, 
as we did for conspiracy.  But I compromised on June 1, 
1999 in order to try to speed things up.  I imagine that things 
were going along, but the minister was not necessarily working 
at the same speed, because that was not when we got the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-24, the whole matter of membership in a criminal 
organization and the definitions relating to that part of the 
bill have therefore been modified, simplified for the better in 
order to be in a position to make a case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, gang membership has been reduced to three 
people from five.  We now have the whole business of 
contribution to activities that assist a criminal organization 
to attain its criminal objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased with this definition, which is far more complex in 
the bill than the way I am stating it, and hon. members will 
agree with me.  I am just giving the main thrust for purposes of 
understanding.  It will be easier for us to be able to collar 
various people whom we are not able to touch at the present 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking for instance of all the people involved in 
recruiting new members to be taken into “gang school”.  Before, 
there was nothing we could do.  That was one of the things we 
pointed out.  Now with the new definitions and the way the bill 
is worded, we will be able to collar someone based merely on the 
fact that he is participating in a criminal organization or 
contributing to the advancement of a criminal organization, able 
to establish evidence of this and to see him do time for it.  We 
are going to be able to put him away where he can do no more 
harm to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the whole matter of participating in the 
perpetration of acts of gangsterism.  This is very important and 
merits particular attention, because this is now an offence with 
a 14-year prison sentence attached. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, when the department changed section 477 of the 
criminal code, one of our concerns was that such a definition 
would prevent us from ever arresting the leaders. These leaders 
do not commit the thefts, they do not kill, they do not sell 
drugs. So, we had no means to put them behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was “Will the minister change the criminal code to 
be able to arrest gang leaders?” At that time, she answered “We 
have all the necessary provisions in the criminal code to arrest 
gang leaders and to prosecute them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She will not admit it today, but she probably knew then that I 
was right and that there was still something missing in the 
criminal code, since Bill C-24 now defines clearly what a gang 
leader is. She even added a definition of criminal organization 
leader. That is to be able to arrest those leaders. To show the 
importance of these provisions, there is a life sentence 
attached to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I congratulate the minister for the change, since it is 
clearly something we requested and about which I asked questions 
in the House. I congratulate the minister, but we are in 
2001 and she should have done it in 1999, when I gave her 
written documents. When questioned, the minister should have given us a 
positive answer. It is not because something comes from the 
opposition that it is necessarily bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members on the other side were very surprised by my 
reaction to Bill C-24. They were quite surprised to hear me 
say that this was a good bill. Actually, 80% of its content 
corresponds to what we asked for. This is what we wanted. It is 
a good bill, but we will nevertheless try to improve it. 
However, when a good bill is introduced, I have always taken the 
time to say so in the House and to congratulate those who 
deserve it. But when a bill is not good, I have never refrained 
from saying so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say as an aside that the Young Offenders Act, 
for instance, is a bad bill for Quebec. I go right ahead and say 
so. However, this does not stop me from acknowledging good 
bills, like the one we have before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We definitely support the provisions on participation in a 
criminal organization and the definitions of a gang because the 
Bloc Quebecois has been asking for those provisions for a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also been asking for measures to protect people in the 
justice system against intimidation, which criminal groups have 
frequently used against them. Members of the Bloc Quebecois have 
personally been the targets of intimidation when they were 
working on this issue and pushing it. Members of juries in some 
proceedings were also victims of intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also witnessed intimidation of people who were 
interfering with the business dealings, like drug dealings and 
other similar activities, of criminal groups. We definitely 
support protection against intimidation for people connected 
with the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think the department has forgotten certain things. As 
the justice critic for the Canadian Alliance pointed out, and as 
I said in press conferences, I fail to understand why the Quebec 
minister of justice or the Quebec minister of public security 
would not be granted the same protection against intimidation by 
these groups when senators do have this legal protection. 
Intimidating a senator or a member of the House of Commons is an 
offence, but the same does not apply to MLAs. This is certainly 
an oversight on the part of the department, which we will try to 
correct in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What about journalists? We have the best example in Quebec with 
Michel Auger. I think he has done more on this issue than anyone 
else, with his writing. He tried to convince people that we 
needed anti-gang legislation. He reported the facts. This is very 
democratic. We saw the intimidation directed against Mr. Auger. 
But there is nothing with regard to that in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person accused and convicted of intimidating someone 
associated with the justice system is liable to 14 years 
imprisonment. 
I am sure there are members opposite who will say “Yes, but 
there is section 423, which provides that any attempt to 
intimidate an individual in the justice system, in a general 
way—”.  Indeed, journalists could perhaps be covered by this 
section, like MNAs or the members of another provincial 
legislature.  But it is a maximum of five years.  So it is 
clearly less serious when it involves these people.  I 
sincerely believe this too must be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is another group the department has forgotten, 
our elected municipal officials.  During the House of Commons' 
two week break, I worked on site, as they say.  I did not just 
meet the mayors in my riding but, on a related matter, I had 
discussions with mayors across Quebec. 
To name but one, since he was a pioneer in the whole issue of 
zoning bunkers in his own municipality, the mayor of Blainville. 
He said that there had been intimidation as well as threats and 
all sorts of things, and he has no protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think another segment of the population has been forgotten in 
this definition, the members of municipal councils.  There is 
surely a way to draft this article to include more people and 
for those trying to intimidate them to be liable to imprisonment 
for 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is protection as well for the members of a jury.  This is 
very important and something we in the Bloc Quebecois have long 
been asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole definition of criminal organization has been 
simplified.  In addition, there will be a special way to 
calculate sentences for persons found guilty of gangsterism. 
This is a step forward. 
It is no longer a requirement to prove that the individuals knew 
they had been committing indictable offences over the previous 
five years. This whole notion of the number of years has been 
completely eliminated, and so has the number of years in prison. 
This applies not only to crimes punishable by five years in 
prison but to all other crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to think about prostitution or drug trafficking in 
bars, for which there was no maximum punishment of five years or 
more and therefore were not covered by the current definition of 
criminal organization under the criminal code. Today with these 
amendments they will be covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again the Bloc Quebecois had been asking for a broadening 
of the definition in order to better target those who carry out a 
reign of terror against those individuals within the 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the whole issue of the seizure and forfeiture of 
the proceeds of crime. However, in this respect we believe the 
department could have introduced much more relevant and daring 
amendments. We believe the department did not go far enough in 
terms of the legislative tools it is giving the courts, the 
police and the penal system as a whole. There is still work to be 
done in this respect even though progress has been made.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are so far behind and we have so few tools to successfully 
fight organized crime that any change, no matter how small, must 
be welcomed and applauded. But while we are at it with the help 
of experts to draft something that is defendable and enforceable 
and is what the people want, we might as well do it right. We 
really have to look at the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one matter that scares several people, namely the 
amendments aimed at protecting the officers in charge of 
enforcing the anti-gang law. 
Now, a police officer investigating very specific crimes such as 
the trafficking of human beings, alcohol, tobacco or firearms 
smuggling, heinous crimes, international terrorism, crimes 
against the environment and everything related to drug offences, 
will at last be able to commit acts otherwise illegal were it 
not for that protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that members can really understand what I am talking about, I 
will give an example. Criminal groups, be it biker gangs, the 
Italian network, Chinese triads or the Russian mafia, which is 
also present in Canada, are well organized. 
They have made it very difficult for the police to infiltrate 
them. Very often, in those biker gangs whose methods we are more 
familiar with, to determine if a new member going up every step 
in the organization is trustworthy and is one of them, the 
leader will ask him to commit certain illegal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill says that an investigating officer could commit certain 
acts without fear of prosecution. This is not protection at 
large; murder, rape, acts of violence and so on are excluded. 
This is for very specific offences. For example, in a biker gang 
operating a large drug market, an undercover officer could be 
asked to sell drugs. That is an illegal act. Without protection, 
the police officer could be liable to prosecution for that. 
Yet he must do so to be accepted as a member of the biker gang, 
get to know more and possibly gather enough information to 
prosecute the guilty parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very much a societal issue. It is a complex matter and 
it could lead to abuse. We must be very careful in implementing 
the law. However, if we want to fight organized crime 
effectively, we must have such tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries go much further than that, but we should begin by 
looking at their experience and see how this is done, see how 
things work and what the results will be over time. This is a 
step in the right direction, albeit a very small one in terms of 
both the offences and the people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If memory serves, the Minister of Justice once tabled a white 
paper on the issue of granting immunity to any public official 
during the course of any 
investigation which is even more encompassing. At the time, 
my initial reaction was “They want a police state. This makes no 
sense. We must restrict that, we must establish a framework, we 
must set limits”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the minister seems to have listened. This is not a common 
occurrence, but we should mention it when she does so. Or else 
it is the department that listened to what I said, so that today 
such immunity is only granted to peace officers conducting 
investigations in very specific areas. It is very limited in 
scope. 
It is something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I have questions and am anxious to hear what the Solicitor 
General of Canada and the Minister of Justice, who will certainly 
be appearing before the committee, have to say about this 
issue—I say this up front so they can be ready—is when it comes 
to giving the political arm authority to make such actions legal. 
Under the proposed legislation, the solicitor general would 
authorize such actions.  Truly, if there is one thing that must 
not be mixed with politics, it is the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a kindness to the minister to tell her that she is on 
the wrong track, that this should be left up to the courts, as is 
now the case for wiretapping, for certain very specific seizures 
outside normal court hours. It could be a judge who, as part of 
an investigation and upon presentation of evidence, gives 
authorization.  It could be ex parte. It could be various ways of 
speeding up authorization. But it must be someone who is 
independent of the political arm. It must be a judge who gives 
authorization and who oversees the result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one amendment we are going to try to make when this bill 
comes before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, it is not what is in the bill that is 
causing a problem but much more what is not. With this in mind, I 
think that it will be easier to work with officials of the 
Department of Justice and try to convince them to make certain 
additions to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that one thing is certain and that is 
that those enforcing the legislation must also be given the 
necessary money.  It is all very fine and well to have a 
well-drafted bill, but the necessary money must be there for them 
to enforce it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have shown that when the police 
were given adequate financial support, they were able to do an 
effective job of combating organized crime, as they did in the 
Opération Printemps 2001, a major cleanup operation.  We should 
continue in this vein by passing this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my hon. colleague from the Bloc when he says that a 
great deal of credit should be given to the Bloc Quebecois for 
pressing the matter in the House over the previous years.  I 
understand the satisfaction it must be experiencing in seeing the 
government respond.  By the Bloc's own analysis, some 80% of the 
bill includes measures that it has requested.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers have experienced, to a completely excessive and 
unsatisfactory degree, the somewhat dubious benefits of the 
activities of gangs, as have other Canadians in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the bill before us and we are anxious that it not be 
debated at great length here in the House.  We would like to see 
it go to committee.  If we are serious about wanting the 
legislation implemented and used to curtail the activities of 
criminal gangs, we must get it through the House and into 
committee and look at some of its provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are things that can be improved and clarified, and I 
certainly think there are, then let us go about doing that and 
getting the legislation into force so that we can determine 
through experience whether the bill will actually work.  That is 
the only way we can find out what will work, both in terms of the 
ability of police to investigate and lay charges and the ability 
of the courts to obtain and uphold convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly not the intention of the NDP to delay passage of 
the bill.  I simply say to my colleagues in the Bloc who have, 
shall we say, a somewhat robust history of making the work of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights somewhat difficult 
because of their objections to Bill C-7, the bill on the youth 
criminal justice act, that I imagine they will face a bit of a 
dilemma if that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that is the case now, but if it turns out to be 
then we cannot get to this legislation until we have dealt with 
the youth criminal justice act.  That is another piece of 
legislation about which, despite its inadequacies, we will not be 
able to learn more until we have had an opportunity to see it in 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill introduces three new offences and tough sentences that 
target various degrees of involvement with criminal 
organizations.  That is all well and good.  It is appropriate 
that these new offences be introduced.  I look forward to hearing 
expert testimony on that in committee.  Certainly in principle it 
is a good idea and one that we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting people who work in the justice system from 
intimidation, either against them or their families, is certainly 
something we would support.  However we would go even further, as 
have other members who have spoken today.  We would like to see, 
or at least have it made clear and explicit in the legislation, 
that it is not just members of parliament who are protected by 
the legislation.  Provincial ministers of justice, provincial 
politicians and, as the member from the Bloc said only moments 
ago, simple politicians, because of various zoning or other 
questions, may also find themselves in conflict with the 
interests of criminal gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may therefore want to look in committee at ways to either 
broaden the list of those explicitly included or to clarify the 
definition so it does not just apply to members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simplifying the current definition of criminal organization in 
the criminal code is another aspect of the bill which seems to be 
merited.  We look forward to hearing more about it in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Broadening the powers of law enforcement to forfeit the proceeds 
of crime, and in particular the profits of criminal 
organizations, and to seize property used in a crime are things 
we may well need to put into legislation so that governments have 
the tools at their disposal to deal more forcefully with 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An accountable process must be established to protect law 
enforcement officers from criminal liability when they commit 
what would otherwise be considered illegal actions while 
investigating and infiltrating criminal organizations.  That is 
something I understand from my meetings with the Canadian Police 
Association earlier this year.  I certainly understand the 
concern of police officers who work undercover in difficult 
situations and need more freedom to act without worrying about 
criminal liability.  We cannot grant them absolute freedom, of 
course, so it is a fine line.  The minister has attempted in the 
legislation to define what that line is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something I look forward to discussing in committee 
because people have expressed concern about where the line is 
drawn.  I understand and appreciate those concerns and yet I am 
sympathetic to what police officers have requested.  We certainly 
accept the principle of protecting, to some degree, police 
officers who are engaged in this kind of activity and we look 
forward to hearing from people on both sides of the issue as to 
where the line should be drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased that this legislation has come forward 
because I myself, some time ago in a previous parliament, brought 
forward a private member's bill regarding anti-gang measures.  It 
is no secret to people who know something about Winnipeg that it 
has gang problems in its inner city, not just biker gangs but 
criminal gangs of various descriptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of interest on the part of many citizens 
of Winnipeg in giving the police and government the appropriate 
tools with which to deal with these gangs.  The Manitoba NDP 
government is also interested in seeing much tougher measures to 
deal with gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave it at that.  However I cannot resist saying that 
the government, when it announced in a press release that it was 
stepping up its fight against organized crime, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will also inject an additional $200 million over 
the next five years to implement legislation and related 
prosecution and law enforcement strategies to fight organized 
crime.  This funding will build on the $584 million that the RCMP 
received in the 2000 budget— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having had the weekend I have just had, I cannot help but 
reflect on the kinds of resources used this past weekend in 
Quebec City to deal with, by and large, peaceful protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about the anarchists and the Black Bloc, the 
people who tried to take down the fence.  I am talking about what 
I was going to call policing but which was, in many respects, 
gassing, rubber bulleting and water cannoning of people who were 
not trying to take down the fence or hurl stuff at the police on 
the other side.  Most of those people were simply acting on what 
they thought were the rules of the game at the summit; that is, 
as long as they were not trying to break the perimeter and were 
acting outside the perimeter in a peaceful way, they would be 
immune from police action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I consider the resources that went into the summit, I 
sometimes wonder, as must many ordinary Canadians, why it is that 
when one wants a police officer in a hurry one cannot be found 
but when there is a summit meeting there are 6,000 of them. Where 
did they all come from?

</I></B></P><P align=left>How many communities were left without police protection over 
the last several days so that students could have their first 
experience of tear gas while sitting around singing or standing 
innocently, or perhaps curiously, looking at the wall? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize for those remarks but I think some people, even some 
police, must feel that on occasion.  I have a great deal of 
sympathy for police officers in the RCMP, the Sûreté du Québec 
and others who must sometimes wonder why the government is 
willing to pay so much in overtime and put so many resources into 
something like that.  When police want resources to deal with 
criminal gangs or people who make life miserable for Canadians in 
various communities and contexts they cannot get an extra dime 
out of the government, but by God, just announce there is a 
protest coming and they get all the equipment and resources they 
ever wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something not quite right here, as far as I am 
concerned.  This legislation is a step in the right direction. We 
want to see certain things clarified in committee and we look 
forward to that process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate and to 
follow the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, a new member of 
our justice committee who brings a great deal of credibility to 
the debate and great oratorical skill to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party, as are I think all parties without exception, will be 
supporting Bill C-24.  It is somewhat of a reincarnation of 
legislation we saw in the last parliament.  It is very important 
and timely to the process of dealing with the ongoing plague of 
organized crime in Canada.  It will allow police officers and 
prosecutors, both through legislation and in some instances 
through increased resources, to combat and turn their undivided 
attention in some instances to the growing problem of organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neil Young sings of rust never sleeping.  Well, crime never 
sleeps.  Crime is unfortunately becoming more and more active in 
many communities and I am not talking only of the big cities. 
Crime is becoming prevalent in small towns and rural parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are particularly vulnerable in coastal communities, I hasten 
to add.  Sadly, since the disbandment of the ports police in the 
country that is even more the case.  We are seeing an obvious 
attempt by organized crime to profit from illicit acts of 
importation, in many instances of contraband materials.  I am 
talking about drugs, which are the chief trade, as well as guns, 
pornographic and contraband materials brought into the country 
under the radar of our current law enforcement capacity.  One 
would hope with the greatest optimism that this legislation will 
help address, at least in part, this very complex problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great need for this legislation.  The RCMP, who 
arguably is the most affected by the issue, is I think cautiously 
optimistic.  The new RCMP Commissioner Zaccardelli alluded to the 
fact that organized crime has plans to use bribes to destabilize 
the country's parliamentary system.  That came as a shocking 
revelation to many when they read it in the newspapers.  It 
raised eyebrows across the country.  It demonstrated the profound 
epidemic of organized crime and the lengths that organized crime 
will go to on occasion to exert influence, and I am obviously not 
talking about a positive influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That epidemic has for many years been virtually ignored by the 
current government.  It is therefore very encouraging to see it 
finally recognize the issue and give it a priority after seven 
years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, September 12, 2000, the Quebec public security 
minister, Serge Ménard, urged the federal government to use the 
notwithstanding clause to outlaw membership in gangs such as the 
Hells Angels and the Rock Machine.  Because such a move might be 
struck down by the courts as unconstitutional, he was urging the 
government to give at least an indication that it would not 
hesitate to use the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to organized crime, one thing everyone understands 
is that it does not play by the rules.  It does not abide by the 
laws, whereas of course law enforcement, prosecutorial services 
and the government not only have to put laws in place but stay 
within the boundaries and confines of those laws, and rightly so. 
Therefore we are sometimes talking about a distinct disadvantage 
on the part of our system of enforcement vis-à-vis outlaw 
gangs.  Extraordinary times sometimes call for extraordinary 
action.  That is why, I am sure, the suggestion was made that the 
notwithstanding clause might be invoked in those circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice clearly suffers from constitutional 
constipation at times, I think, from this fear that somehow if a 
law is made that might be deemed unconstitutional we should 
refrain from enacting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This law will be challenged in our courts, as many laws before 
it have been challenged.  That is part and parcel of the process. 
In particular, I can guarantee that the legislation that expands 
police powers will be the subject of numerous court challenges. 
We can bank on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply cannot hesitate in or refrain from introducing 
legislation in the fear that somewhere in the land, whether it be 
in the Supreme Court of Canada or in some other court, a judge 
may decide that this is not within the bounds of the 
constitution.  That is part of our judiciary.  That is part of 
the process.  I guarantee that this legislation will be 
challenged, like other legislation has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when dealing with organized crime and the repercussions 
of having organized crime go unchecked we sometimes have to make 
laws that expand the current envelope and go beyond the realm of 
what has been the normal practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Quebec minister was expressing these concerns, on the 
very next day, September 13, the day after the call from the 
security minister of Quebec, Mr. Michel Auger, a journalist in 
Montreal with the <I>Journal de Montréal</I>, was shot five times 
in the back.  This was most likely the action of and has been 
attributed widely to outlaw motorcycle gangs.  I am informed 
that it was likely the act of someone who wanted to join one of 
the gangs and was part of the movement to get in, to show somehow 
that this person had what it takes to be involved in this type of 
activity.  They are sometimes the most dangerous, these puppet 
groups, these individuals who are trying to ingratiate 
themselves, to earn their patch so to speak.  Mr. Auger's fate 
and the fate of many others who have expressed opposition to 
organized crime and have raised the spectacle of somehow trying 
to get this issue under control has been that they have sometimes 
faced the wrath of the gangs themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal gangs are far-reaching now.  They are branching out. As 
I said in my opening remarks, they are found in communities 
across the country, whether they be rural or urban.  Many 
Canadians are starting to feel particularly unsafe because of 
this audacious presence.  In the city of Halifax, there are many 
people who are very concerned.  Individuals such as Matt Jardine 
and others who live in Halifax are concerned about what is 
happening in their city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An outlaw motorcycle gang, the Hells Angels, now has its 
colours flying in radiant lights in front of its clubhouse in the 
city of Halifax.  This is the affront to democracy.  It is an 
affront to policing and the safe, secure feeling that people 
should have in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real need for this legislation.  Again, it is 
encouraging that it is being brought forward now.  The minister 
often uses the phrase in a timely fashion, and this has been 
timely for many years.  The time is here and we are encouraged by 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime also is becoming very prevalent in many circles 
where it was traditionally unseen, such as the Internet.  The 
Hells Angels, I am told, have one of the largest Internet sites 
available. 
It is information that is now transmitted through cyberspace, not 
only across this country but across the United States, North 
America and the world.  That is very disturbing.  Obviously the 
ability to transport information can be an extremely positive 
thing, but organized crime can use it for a very nefarious 
purpose, so there is certainly a need for legislation in that 
area at some future time.  It is not addressed by this 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has taken on a very broad background, if we will, in 
terms of what types of organized crime we are dealing with. 
Eastern bloc European gangs have emerged, such as the traditional 
Mafiosa-Italian connections, and there are the snakehead 
organizations, Chinese triads, Oriental groups that are forming 
gangs and the traditional so-called motorcycle gangs, which are, 
as I have said, becoming more prevalent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice gave repeated assurances to study 
options for strengthening our current legislation to break the 
back of organized crime.  Although some of those details were not 
discussed publicly, we do know that attempts were made to 
introduce legislation in 1997.  We see it coming back now in this 
form.  The minister reiterated this in her comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do applaud her.  I applaud the minister's initiative in 
bringing forward this legislation now.  It has finally received 
priority and would allow those administering it, mainly the 
provinces and the law enforcement community, to attack the issue 
and to attack the underbelly of these gangs.  In particular, this 
legislation allows for greater use of attacking the proceeds of 
crime, that is, going after the actual resources of organized 
crime and taking away the flow of money and the benefits received 
from illegal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also very clearly and specifically simplifies the definition 
and the composition of criminal organizations for purposes in a 
court.  The bill targets various degrees of involvement within 
organizations, that is, it attaches the type of activity that is 
deemed to be participation in a criminal organization.  Sometimes 
that is just watching.  Sometimes it could be the person working 
on a dock in Halifax who turns a blind eye to an importation or 
to a boxcar coming in with illicit contraband material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also would make it easier for police and 
prosecutors to arrest and jail those involved in organized crime 
and keep them in prison for longer periods of time.  There is a 
greater element of deterrence, both specific and general, at work 
in the bill for those who choose this path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would allow law enforcement officials to declare 
forfeit the proceeds of crime from organizations, to seize the 
property and to perhaps put that resource back into the community 
that has been harmed.  It allows law enforcement officers to 
seize things like houses, boats, cars and money and to allow the 
resource that has been pillaged and raped from a community to go 
back into it and perhaps benefit it and try to rehabilitate some 
of the harm that has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would also strengthen rules protecting against 
intimidation of witnesses, jurors and their families at organized 
crime trials.  It would strengthen the protection for federal 
ministers and members of parliament.  It would improve protection 
for law enforcement officers from criminal liability when they 
commit certain illicit acts while engaging in undercover 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing missing from the legislation and which has been 
pointed out by several members today is that it does not include 
provincial ministers.  I believe that was perhaps a legislative 
oversight.  I am certain it is something that can be corrected at 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the provisions in this bill send a very important 
signal that the Parliament of Canada is not going to sit back and 
rest on the laurels of the fine men and women who are currently 
working in our justice system, but that it is actually going to 
bolster support for them and enhance their ability to do their 
job and their ability to protect us, because it is that thin blue 
line, as it is sometimes called, that the police provide to the 
citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supportive of the amendments that deal with taking away 
the proceeds of the crime, taking away the lifeblood.  There are 
very positive amendments to this bill that could be tightened up. 
Again, hopefully we will have an opportunity to do that in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I mentioned the absence of protection for provincial 
ministers.  There is also perhaps some need to protect 
journalists in some instances, as we saw with Mr. Auger.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem with respect to the funding for the 
legislation.  That in and of itself is perhaps its greatest 
weakness.  The legislation has come about, typically, with great 
fanfare and with announcements made in the press gallery.  I 
think the minister has had her knuckles rapped a little in that 
regard.  The legislation announces $200 million to address this 
specific problem.  That comes as great news to those in law 
enforcement and was met with great enthusiasm by the commissioner 
of the RCMP and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the question, the next natural progression of that, is 
this:  when will the money come?  There were references in that 
very press conference to the earlier announcement of $584 million 
to the RCMP to upgrade CPIC, to allow for greater resources, to 
allow for more overtime, to allow for resources and for perhaps 
greater access to justices of the peace or greater access to 
informants.  They are all important elements of the police task 
in protecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the money arrive?  It would be very interesting to 
hear from the minister or members of the government how much of 
that $580 million, the earlier announcement, has actually been 
put into the coffers of the police.  I suspect that the same 
question will be asked of this $200 million in very short order, 
because they are crying out for those resources.  The police are 
desperately in need of the financial support.  It is fine to make 
the announcement, to give the moral support here, but they need 
the actual resources and they need them immediately.  That is a 
question that has yet to be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a positive starting point here.  There is certainly a 
determined commitment on the part of the government and on the 
part of all members of parliament.  This has affected individual 
members of parliament.  A member of the Bloc found himself in a 
very unsettling position, I am sure, when he was the subject of 
threatening actions on the part of an outlaw motorcycle gang. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The limitless resources of the organized criminal element 
highlight the fact that the police are often left feeling that 
they are not on a level playing field legislatively because of 
their limitations within the law.  However, they are also under 
the increased pressure because organized crime has unlimited 
resources and is essentially using more and better technology 
than is available to the police.  Members of organized crime are 
watching the watchers.  They are using videotape to tape the 
police to find out who is watching them.  They are transmitting 
information about judges, about prosecutors and about police. 
They are sharing information about undercover officers.  They are 
using the Internet to its maximum benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the brave new era.  This is an age wherein we should be 
giving the police the tools and the technology to fight organized 
crime on the same level that organized crime is using.  Typically 
we have seen the government try to fix a problem that in some 
instances it created.  I refer to the ports police.  There have 
also been severe cuts to the RCMP in the past number of years. 
Clearly the RCMP was suffering budgetary restraints when it had 
to close its training facility in Saskatoon.  Clearly when the 
Canadian Police Information Centre computer system was almost on 
the verge of collapse without an immediate influx of money, it 
was symptomatic of underfunding on the part of our national 
police force.  Bill C-24 would not provide this immediate 
injection of funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, as I indicated, elements and commitments that we are 
very supportive of.  What we want to see and what we want to 
diligently pursue is that the funding is actually going to be 
there.  There are clauses in the bill like, for example, clause 
27 at page 29, which talks about the definition of criminal 
organization.  It now needs to be composed of three or more 
persons and the crown now does not need to show that the offences 
were committed in the previous five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the legislation may seem technical and inconsequential 
to the untrained ear, but this is very important for the crown 
and for the police working in cohort to secure convictions.  We 
saw a very recent sting operation in the province of Quebec and 
parts of Ontario that resulted in individuals being rounded up 
and charged.  There are potentially charges there that will not 
be affected by the introduction of this legislation, but in the 
future certainly it will help in the successful prosecution of 
these types of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One problem that I have picked up on is that Bill C-24 fails to 
make it a criminal offence to be a member of a group already 
proven to be a criminal organization.  Whether or not an 
organization is criminal would have to be proven in each 
particular case, that is, it would create needless expense in 
some instances and a duplication of resources that would prolong 
many criminal trials.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a general consensus that the legislation is positive. 
Much of the technical examination of the issue came about as a 
result of the Shirose and Campbell case that dealt with immunity. 
It dealt with police officers having the ability to infiltrate 
crime through in some instances buying illicit substances like 
drugs and participating in questionable conduct themselves to 
prove allegiance and to prove that they were working with the 
gang to gain its trust so that they could break it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that raises concern among lawyers and privacy 
protectors.  There will be an examination by a court of law to 
see that it is in proportion, that it is reasonable in the 
circumstances.  These are the types of matters that we could try 
to fine tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will no doubt result in court challenges and that should be 
welcomed.  Members should embrace that reality.  It is our 
responsibility to make laws and it is the responsibility of the 
courts to examine and interpret those laws in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the intimidation factor, it is very important 
that there be as broad a definition as possible for who should be 
protected from intimidation.  Trials cannot function if jurists, 
lawyers, witnesses, and in some instances police, are feeling 
intimidated.  Intimidation and extortion are things that gangs 
deal in very much.  They put fear into the minds of people if 
they come forward to testify against gang members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hopeful the minister and the government will be open to 
certain amendments, further examination and strengthening of the 
legislation.  I trust all members would be supporting the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a few remarks in 
support of the legislation.  I would like to touch on an issue 
that my colleague from the Conservative Party raised during his 
remarks.  It has to do with that part of his speech that dealt 
with the exposure of journalists when they are involved in doing 
research and writing about biker gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a very special chord of relevance for me.  During the 
last election campaign I met a constituent, Yves Lavigne, who 
wrote the book <I>Hell's Angels at War</I>, the biker gang book. 
He has written three books actually.  <I>Hell's Angels: Taking 
Care of Business</I> is another one.  People like Yves Lavigne 
have tremendous experience and insight.  They think outside the 
box of normal police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be a good idea for the RCMP or other police forces to 
use people like Yves Lavigne, who have spent 15 or 20 years of 
their lives focused on a specific area of organized crime, as 
consultants to make sure that the police think outside the 
traditional box and bring these gangs to justice in a more 
expeditious manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raises a very 
important element which is missing from the legislation itself. 
I agree that the police should be outsourcing to individuals who 
have expertise in this area.  It is an incredibly overwhelming 
issue in terms of its complexity and the lengths that organized 
crime will go to infiltrate legitimate businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime will seek to undermine the credible people 
working in the system, whether working directly in justice or as 
legislators, and to undermine the media who have a role in 
reporting and making public the activities of organized crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that police officers should have within their mandate 
the ability to engage these individuals for information purposes 
and for their expertise.  The legislation does not provide for 
the protection of specifically journalists, authors and those who 
write and have obtained special information that is helpful and 
relevant to the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged that the issue is being fleshed out and that we 
will have an opportunity to correct it to make that additional 
protection available.  Hopefully the spirit of productive debate 
and study at the committee level will improve this important 
legislation which he and other members support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to stand today to speak in favour of Bill C-24. I 
was pleased to listen to the Minister of Justice and I heard the 
comments made by members of the opposition who seem to have a 
full understanding of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not understood in the Canadian public at large, it is 
well understood in the House by all parties and all speakers that 
the scale of organized crime in the country and internationally, 
the magnitude of the threat that it poses to our society, is 
something of real urgency.  The bill addresses it and needs to be 
passed quickly and put into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about the variety and complexity of the 
problem internationally as well as to individuals, communities, 
government and private enterprises in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally there is more than a trillion dollars a year in 
earned profits from criminal activity worldwide.  The figure is 
growing every year.  It has not been hampered and restricted by 
deficit cutting that governments around the world have had to 
undergo through the 1990s.  These profits have been soaring.  In 
terms of the critical nature of this threat, former President 
Clinton identified organized crime as the number one threat to 
national security in the post cold war world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of my constituency, Vancouver Quadra, understand 
the chilling nature of the threat.  It is much broader than just 
gang wars.  It involves the supply of drugs to our schools and 
children.  It involves property crime that is attendant on drug 
addiction which is fed by organized crime.  It involves home 
invasions and the security of our homes.  Ten years ago who in 
our society had heard the chilling terms of terror such as home 
invasion, carjacking or drive-by shooting?  These are new terms 
of terror which are directly connected to the scourge of organized 
crime in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of our economy, billions of dollars of laundered money 
are put into our society which is based on a market economy.  It 
is corrupted by them.  They debase the vigour of competition in 
our market economy and threaten our economic viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also threaten our economic institutions.  Corruption and 
organized criminal activity in scams with respect to banks, 
credit card fraud, telemarketing fraud, insurance fraud and stock 
market fraud are all part of the growing expanding scourge of 
organized criminal activity which is sapping the economic 
strength of the country as well as the safety of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of government agencies themselves, we have had 
troubling information about the infiltration and corruption of 
people working in government agencies at all levels in Canada and 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are major challenges for our society.  They require new 
tools, many of which the bill provides.  If we think about how we 
will apply those tools we have to think carefully about the new 
nature of criminal organizations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal organizations working in Canada and around the world 
are no longer monolithic crime families that are suspicious of 
each other or competitive with each other against criminal 
projects for turf.  Today criminal activity is conducted in a 
highly networked, complex, flexible and international fashion. 
Criminal gangs are no longer fighting for turf with each other 
although that happens, and we know too sadly of the horrors in 
Quebec of criminal gang wars.  However that is not the typical 
character of organized criminal activity today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized criminal activity works in networks, works in cells 
across criminal organizations and across borders to uniquely 
compose a criminal operation across boundaries, gangs and 
criminal products.  It requires a very special approach from law 
enforcement agencies which is not our traditional approach.  It 
requires those agencies to be more flexible and more resourced in 
their response.  I will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the new tools that are necessary and 
that are being applied by the bill.  Monetary resources are 
needed for police agencies.  Those have been provided for over 
the last two years with increased budgets and there are projected 
further injections of financial resources for the RCMP and other 
law enforcement agencies.  That is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill presents other tools.  There will be stiffer penalties 
for participation in criminal gang activity and broader 
definitions of what constitutes criminal gangs and criminal 
activity.  There are very important provisions to create the 
offence of intimidation of officials in the criminal justice 
system.  It is a critical point of protection that is necessary 
and overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expanded definitions and increased ability to seize the 
proceeds of crime are important in the bill.  There must be an 
ability to seize and forfeit property in a fashion that is 
efficient, quick and hits at the heart of the enterprise nature 
of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandatory reporting provisions for suspicious financial 
transactions are important.  Fifteen billion dollars was 
estimated as the amount of laundered funds from illegal 
activities in Canada last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by addressing specifically the unique and 
changed nature of organized crime in society.  It is flexible and 
networked.  It crosses boundaries and is cross organizational. It 
is necessary to have an integrated and co-ordinated approach 
across the collection of criminal intelligence, police operations 
and prosecution of crime.  These have to be working as a seamless 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information and intelligence gathering must not be in a 
secretive closed chest fashion among competing law enforcement 
agencies.  It must be shared in a mandatory fashion, but it must 
be secure and centrally analyzed.  It must be disseminated on a 
need to know basis and the success and experience of operations 
have to be fed back into that intelligence system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The operations themselves must be joint force operations, 
drawing across law enforcement agencies for the best and the most 
appropriate resources that can be uniquely composed and targeted 
on any particular criminal activity.  It should then be shut 
down, redistributed and refocused on other criminal activity if 
it is to mimic the flexibility and the networks of criminal 
organizations themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be an effective link to intensive prosecution which 
the bill and the organized criminal justice policy address. 
Dedicated legal advice must be present at the very earliest 
stages of an investigation to deal with the incredible complexity 
of criminal investigations and prosecutions, laws of disclosure, 
laws of search and seizure, laws of wiretapping, and laws of 
proceeds of crime.  The best legal advice must be used at the 
beginning of an investigation right through to an intensive 
prosecution to make sure those prosecutions are successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that organized crime is an immense threat to society. 
Its magnitude is overwhelming.  The bill needs to be passed as 
soon as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words 
with respect to the bill at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I want to say is that I applaud the government 
for its initiative in bringing forward the bill.  I believe it is 
very much needed and, as many of the other speakers have said, it 
is critical that we bring it forward as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my brief remarks I cannot possibly deal with all aspects of 
the bill which has 73 pages and many clauses, but I will say for 
those who are watching or listening that a piece of legislation 
like this one contains amendments to an already complex act, the 
Criminal Code of Canada.  It is very difficult when reading a 
bill like this for one to understand it without proper study because 
we have to flip from one section to another.  We have to read a 
section as it currently exists to understand why the amendments 
are being made and how they will benefit society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on two or three particular issues and offer some 
advice to the justice committee that will be studying the bill. I 
know the members of the justice committee and that members on all 
sides of the justice committee are interested and careful members 
who will give the legislation, as they do other legislation, the 
consideration it requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation requires consideration because, as some other 
speakers have said, there are a few fine lines here that we have 
to decide on which side of the line we will come down.  From my 
perspective we should come down on the side of the line that 
deals with the safety of society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that opening, allow me to remind everyone that the criminal 
code was developed many years ago, long before there were 
telephones, never mind cellphones; long before there were 
international drug cartels; long before there were automobiles; 
long before there were airplanes; and certainly long before there 
were motorcycles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a problem with law that it is often difficult for the law 
to catch up with the criminal.  The criminal mind is able to come 
up with solutions on how to beat the law faster than we can come 
up with how to avoid crossing the constitution but at the same 
time making sure we protect society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a valiant attempt to do that, but we must remember 
that the criminal element is always moving, is always working to 
try to beat us at our own game.  We cannot allow legislation like 
this to be stalled year after year in debate or stalled for other 
purposes because we need to combat this type of crime as quickly 
as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard that the government had announced the legislation I 
was having coffee and watching a morning news program. 
Immediately there was a person on the screen, a lawyer, who 
criticized some portion of the legislation.  In particular, she 
criticized the fact that it could be that three people would be 
deemed to be a criminal organization.  I said to myself yes, so 
what.  I could not understand the criticism.  If three people 
decide to conspire to commit a series of offences, that is a 
criminal organization.  What is the problem?  Why would the 
lawyer be upset about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went specifically to the legislation and on page 29 is the 
clause that deals with the definition of a criminal organization. 
As we must all remember in this place, we must never rely on the 
television.  We must never rely on newspaper reports.  We must 
rely on our own eyes examining what the legislation says.  This 
is what it says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“criminal organization” means a group, however organized, that 
is composed of three or more persons and that has as one of its 
main purposes or main activities the facilitation or commission 
of one or more serious offences— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, serious offence is deemed to be an offence for which 
a person can receive a punishment of five years in prison or 
more.  It is a fairly serious offence.  It continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that, if committed, would likely result in the direct or 
indirect receipt of a material benefit, including a financial 
benefit, by the group or by any of the persons who constitute the 
group.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not stop there.  It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not include a group of persons that forms randomly for 
the immediate commission of a single offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a criminal organization if three or four young people 
get together, decide they want some chocolate bars, knock over a 
local convenience store and grab a few boxes of chocolate bars. 
It is specifically exempted in fact from the section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A criminal organization is three or more people getting together 
and conspiring to commit serious offences for their own personal 
gain.  I cannot understand why anyone would criticize that 
section, and I want to put that on record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also commend the government on consecutive sentencing, which 
in some circumstances is a touchy issue.  Private members' bills 
have dealt with consecutive sentencing, which has caused some 
problems on the floor of the House among the parties and 
individual members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has specifically provided that the sentences 
received for certain offences committed by people who conspire in 
these organizations will be served consecutively to any other 
sentence they may receive for the particular offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  Five people decide to become bank 
robbers and commit a series of bank robberies.  Each of those 
bank robberies is an individual offence.  It is also a criminal 
organization because there are five of them.  They got together 
and decided to commit serious criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are caught and convicted they may very well be 
sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the bank robbery or bank 
robberies.  In addition, if they are convicted under the criminal 
conspiracy provisions in the bill of being an organized gang, 
they will receive the term in addition to and on top of the bank 
robbery convictions.  They would not be served at the same time 
but consecutively.  I think this is the correct approach.  It is 
the right approach and I commend the government for bringing it 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there are certain provisions of the criminal code which 
provide that for certain heinous offences prisoners must serve a 
minimum of one-half of their sentences before they become 
eligible for parole.  There is a list of those offences in the 
criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for ensuring that the commission of an 
offence under this act is one of those.  If people are convicted 
of certain offences, either helping to commit the offence or 
being part of the offence itself while it takes place, then a 
conviction and a sentence will require offenders to serve at 
least one-half the time they have been sentenced to before they 
become eligible for consideration for parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a good thing.  It is important.  It sends a 
message that society views these crimes as serious.  We intend to 
make sure that the time is served to the extent that at least 
half the sentence will be served before the prisoner becomes 
eligible for parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I want to talk about in the brief time I have is 
forfeiture of property.  We already have forfeiture of property. 
I draw to the attention of the justice committee subsection 
462.37(2) in which the judge is allowed to seize property which 
is not necessarily directly from the crime but can be inferred as 
being from the crime or crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is the judge must be satisfied beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  I believe that is entirely too high a burden to put on 
the crown and on the people of Canada.  I would ask that the 
justice committee consider amending it so that if the judge is 
satisfied on a balance of probabilities the property can be 
forfeited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to give my two cents worth prior to 
consideration of the bill by the justice committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of Surrey Central I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-24, an act to 
amend the criminal code respecting organized crime and law 
enforcement and to make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has two main purposes:  first, to provide new tools in 
the fight against organized crime; and, second, to respond to the 
1999 supreme court decision in R. v Campbell and Shirose, which 
put in doubt the ability of police and police informants to break 
the law as part of undercover operations aimed at penetrating 
criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After years of the Reform Party of Canada, now the Canadian 
Alliance, fighting for tougher laws to help combat gangs and 
other criminal organizations, the federal Liberals have finally 
introduced some of the legislation we have been calling for.  The 
fact is that the weak Liberal government lacks the political will 
to get tough on crime, particularly on organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has introduced this legislation because of intense pressure 
from the official opposition and other opposition parties and 
because of the pressure from police and the public in general. 
Combating organized crime was part of the detailed justice 
platform released during the election campaign by the Canadian 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The penetration of organized crime into Canadian society is a 
very serious matter.  Criminals move from jurisdictions with 
strong controls to jurisdictions with weak or no controls.  This 
criminal activity undermines Canada's financial and social 
systems and increases the power and influence of illegal 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A staggering variety of activities such as extortion, home 
invasion, murder, theft, drugs and arms trafficking, counterfeit 
currency and passports, migrant smuggling, prostitution, Mafia, 
casino and lottery frauds are additional costs to society at the 
expense of the taxpayer and at the expense of our future.  These 
activities make our streets unsafe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada are also concerned that the privacy of Canadian 
citizens could be unreasonably invaded.  There should be 
sufficient protection and the freedom of law-abiding citizens 
should be preserved.  The loopholes in the system and the law are 
not plugged in Canada.  That is the main problem.  Canada is a 
candy store for these criminals.  Unfortunately criminals have 
the motivation to come to Canada and commit crimes because they 
consider Canada to be a crime haven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blurred vision of the Liberals has caused the dismantling of 
Vancouver port police.  Everyone knows that.  This makes the port 
a gateway for the importation of drugs and narcotics.  It opens 
up the way for criminals and makes their jobs easier rather than 
tougher.  It is a shame that the Liberal government gives 
international organized criminals VIP treatment while those same 
criminals, according to the Immigration Act, are supposed to be 
inadmissible to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was on the immigration and citizenship 
committee that we introduced a motion to study fraud and criminal 
activities under the Immigration Act not for general immigrants 
but for illegitimate and criminal elements coming to the country. 
Liberal members refused that motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous legislative attempts to deal with the problem have been 
ineffective.  Bill C-95 did not go far enough in providing the 
tools needed for the law enforcement agencies to fight organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago, perhaps in the early 1980s, the government of the day 
not only ignored the recommendations of the law enforcement 
agencies but it even refused to acknowledge the existence of 
organized criminal activities in Canada.  Since that time 
organized crime has significantly increased.  Canada has now 
become a global centre and a haven for organized crime because of 
its laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the government does now it is too late and too little. 
The criminals are lightyears ahead of the law enforcement 
agencies.  They have more resources, more money and better state 
of the art technology while the agencies on the other side even 
lack the law with tooth and are struggling to maintain 
yesterday's technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal dominated subcommittee of the justice standing 
committee on organized crime held in camera hearings on the 
problem and issued its report just prior to the dissolution of 
the House.  I will talk about that report in a short while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention that I represented the official 
opposition as a member of the subcommittee on organized crime. 
Since the hearings were in camera I will not go into detail but 
will talk about some of the issues that are in the public domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that the recommendations of the subcommittee were not 
fully implemented through this bill.  Even though the committee 
was a Liberal dominated committee, the bill of course would 
enhance the fight against organized crime, though not enough, and 
should not be delayed unduly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about the main features of the bill.  There will 
be longer consecutive sentences for gang activity:  up to five 
years for participating in a criminal organization; 14 years for 
carrying out indictable offences for the benefit of a criminal 
organization; and life for being the leader of a criminal 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new definition of a criminal organization would be:  only 
three members required instead of the current five; there is no 
need to prove that members participated in indictable offences in 
the five years preceding prosecution and providing that, in 
addition to indictable offences punishable by five years or more, 
offences can be prescribed as serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is stated that the intention is to cover offences, such as 
prostitution and gambling, that are controlled by organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is the protection of justice system participants. 
Threatening a judge, prosecutor, juror, et cetera, or a member of 
their family would be punishable by up to 14 years and murdering 
a justice system participant would be first degree murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point concerns police immunity.  The solicitor general 
responsible for the RCMP or provincial ministers responsible for 
the police will be able to designate officers who may, in the 
course of an investigation, commit offences other than offences 
causing bodily harm, obstructing justice or sexual offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forfeiture of property would apply to all property used in 
committing a crime rather than just property especially built to 
carry out the crime.  Judges will have to determine whether the 
forfeiture is appropriate given the nature of the crime. 
Presumably a house may not be forfeited if five marijuana plants 
are found in it but it could be if 500 or 5,000 plants are found 
in it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still many significant deficiencies in the bill that 
require further address or amendments.  Even many recommendations 
of the subcommittee have not been addressed in the legislation. I 
was a member of that committee and it was a Liberal dominated 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are maybe 10 points I want to mention.  The relevant 
elements of existing legislation, resources, investigative and 
prosecutorial practices, should be deployed to their fullest 
potential and effective strategy to fill any gaps should have 
been developed and addressed in the legislation.  The committee 
was concerned about it and it made very clear recommendations 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code should have been amended so that all its 
provisions related to organized crime activities could have been 
brought together in a specific part to be entitled enterprise 
crime, designated drug offences, criminal organizations and money 
laundering.  This recommendation was not followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code should have been amended to allow for the 
designation of criminal organization offenders in a manner 
similar to that applicable of dangerous offenders and long term 
offenders provided for at section 752.  This would allow, at the 
sentencing stage, after a conviction has been obtained, for the 
imposition of imprisonment for an intermediate period or for long 
term supervision in the community after a sentence of up to 10 
years. The recommendation was not followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 184 and following the criminal code dealing with 
judicially authorized audio and video surveillance should have 
been amended to increase in non-criminal organization offences 
from 60 days to at least a 120 day period for which such 
activities could be authorized and renewed.  This particular 
recommendation is very important if the Liberals were to listen 
to Canadians, to the Canadian Police Association and to front 
line police officers who are dealing with organized criminals. 
When police officers need to obtain a particular warrant they 
have to write about a thousand pages.  A lot of work has to be 
done to obtain a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a warrant has been obtained it is valid for only 60 days, 
whereas the criminal activity continues for months and years 
probably.  They then have to go back and do all the paper work 
again in order to obtain a warrant for wiretapping or other 
things.  The recommendation is very important and I hope the 
justice minister will follow through with it.   Since we are 
debating the bill for the first time, the government has lots of 
opportunity if it is sincerely listening to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of part VI of the criminal code should have been 
reviewed and amended so as to streamline and simplify the 
requirements and practices involved in the judicial approval and 
renewal of audio and video surveillance as a law enforcement 
investigative strategy.  This recommendation was not followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 743.6(1.1) of the criminal code should have been amended 
to allow sentencing judges to order that offenders serve full 
sentences instead of half the sentences currently served, of 
incarceration without any form of conditional release in cases 
where there is evidence that a convicted person committed an 
offence to the benefit of, at the direction of or in association 
with a criminal organization.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code should have been amended so that there was a 
reverse onus placed on a person convicted of an enterprise crime, 
a designated substance offence, a criminal organization offence 
or money laundering whose assets have been seized, to prove that 
these assets have not been acquired or increased in value as the 
result of criminal activity. There should be a reverse onus on 
the criminal rather than on law enforcement agencies to prove 
that.  This is a very important recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the convicted person were unable to discharge the burden of 
proof, as I mentioned, to the satisfaction of the court, these 
assets should be declared to be forfeited.  This recommendation 
was not followed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Evidence Act should have been amended to codify and 
simplify the rules related to disclosure.  The disclosure rules 
are so vague that jurisdictions in foreign countries refuse to 
co-operate with Canadian law enforcement agencies because of our 
stupid and ineffective disclosure laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources expertise and technology levels should be 
sufficient to effectively combat organized crime. Unfortunately 
the funding announced by the justice minister today providing 
only $200 million over five years does not appear adequate and 
does not come close to the amount needed for frontline law 
enforcement officials to do their job effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds allocated on a yearly basis would not significantly 
enhance police or prosecution resources when we consider that a 
relatively simple prosecution could cost as much as $10 million. 
Those resources are inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national tactical co-ordinating committee should have been 
established to promote the exchange of information and sharing of 
experiences among field operators in order to fight organized 
crime.  This recommendation made by the subcommittee on organized 
crime was not followed through again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of lenient disclosure laws in Canada, as I mentioned 
earlier, law enforcement agencies from other countries refuse to 
share sensitive information with their Canadian counterparts on 
organized criminals operating in their country.  This jeopardizes 
our efforts to combat crime and demoralizes our frontline 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most disturbing features of the legislation is its 
failure to make it a criminal offence to be a member of a group 
already proven to be a criminal organization in Canada.  Contrary 
to the justice minister's suggestions, this provision does not 
make participation or membership in a criminal organization 
illegal unless it can be proven that the person had the intention 
to facilitate illegal transactions for that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that an organization is a criminal organization would 
have to be proven in each particular case that goes before the 
court resulting in needless duplication of resources, expertise 
and prolonged criminal trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill fails to adequately protect other key players in the 
fight against crime.  In particular, provincial justice 
ministers, MLAs, MNAs, MPPs are not granted the same level of 
protection as federal parliamentarians, despite the fact that 
they are directly responsible for the enforcement of these 
provisions.  They need to implement the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the case of Michel Auger who had the courage to 
stand up against crime and other journalists who were not given 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge the government to make the legislation 
tougher, to provide more resources to police and to encourage the 
aggressive use of the new tools.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the recommendations of the subcommittee, 
regarding forfeitures, wire tapping and serving full sentences, 
have not been addressed or have only been partially met. 
Therefore, I hope the justice minister will be open to 
considering amendments that would further streamline the Canadian 
justice system and would offer Canadians a greater measure of 
security through the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take the floor for the first time 
since we got back from parliamentary recess and to congratulate 
my colleague from the Canadian Alliance for his speech which may 
have contained more nuances and perhaps more rigour, more 
severity than the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Bloc, which has been fighting for this for a long time, 
the Canadian Alliance has long been calling for the federal 
government to develop some backbone in this matter and to turn 
out a bill that would, once and for all, make association with a 
biker gang or other organized criminal group an illegal act. This 
we have been calling for on a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two points I picked up on in my colleague's speech. 
First of all, he stated clearly that the bill we are examining 
today does not go far enough, particularly on the legislative 
level.  My colleague clearly stated that this bill, which will 
inevitably become law, did not provide the legislative means to 
really fight organized crime in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we have lack of legislative tools, and then my colleague 
went on to speak of an obvious lack of financial resources.  He 
would like to see this co-operation between the provinces and the 
federal government made possible and would like to see the police 
forces with sufficient financial resources to achieve the 
objectives set out in the bill, not only in principle but with 
the bottom line of really battling organized crime in Quebec and 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a certain extent, what my colleague says is that the 
principles, the provisions of the law and the financial resources 
do not allow it to achieve these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect is the right of association and the right to 
belong to a criminal organization, which would not be an offence, 
according to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague clarify these two aspects of his speech? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that all members 
in the House and the people who are watching this debate are 
concerned about organized crime in Canada.  Organized crime is a 
hidden crime.  Many times people do not know what is happening 
behind the scenes because organized crime is low profile. Illegal 
and criminal activities happen yet the public does not know about 
them because there are no means for the RCMP and other law 
enforcement agencies to follow them and they go unnoticed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was talking to a frontline police officer, I was 
surprised when she said that even if there were 10 clear leads on 
organized crime, they did not have enough resources to follow one 
of the leads.  It is very disturbing when law enforcement 
agencies say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the hon. members of the House are proud about 
this issue.  The progress we have made on organized crime is very 
little.  The reason is the lack of political will by our federal 
government and the lack of co-operation with the provincial 
governments.  The government believes in a confrontational 
approach with the provinces rather than a co-operational 
approach.  We should probably do everything we can within our 
limits to be effective in controlling organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, the recommendations which I put forward earlier 
are very serious recommendations.  This is not a partisan issue. 
We are not talking politics here.  We are not looking through the 
lens of politics.  We are looking through the lens of issues.  It 
is very important for the future of Canadians.  Our national 
security rests with the legislation we are passing to effectively 
control organized criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want Canada to be a haven for organized criminals to 
conduct their criminal activities.  Therefore, as legislators we 
have to form the legislation with those tools which are effective 
and which give the law enforcement agencies all the facilities, 
tools and resources they need to effectively control organized 
crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
my colleague's speech and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that, at last, this anti-gang bill, 
for which the Bloc Quebecois has been asking for a long time, will 
give more teeth to what is already in place. It is much more 
specific, but it could have been even more specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a society such as ours, besides police officers, there are 
several members of parliament here in the House who were 
threatened because they tried to give more teeth to the 
legislation. 
But how can legislation become effective? It is, of course, when 
we have the necessary funding to implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All legislation involves funding. But this one will involve 
major funding. It will not just be a facade where the government 
will say “We have said yes to the government. We have heard the 
requests and today we are introducing legislation”. The bill has 
teeth, but not enough. It is not specific enough to protect 
people such as members of parliament, public figures and even 
city councillors. This goes beyond the people mentioned in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member of the Alliance to indicate who, apart from 
members of parliament, these people might be, so that this can 
be clarified during the committee hearings and the bill can be 
amended accordingly, besides, of course, providing the necessary 
funding. I would like him to comment further on this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member for 
Provencher, the chief critic for justice for the Official 
Opposition of Canada, mentioned in his speech there was a private 
member's bill in the last parliament.  The bill was moved by the 
Bloc member.  It was a very good bill and would make it a crime 
to belong to a criminal organization 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government should look into that.  It is a very 
serious and effective preventive type of bill that would help to 
effectively control crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of the hon. member's question was about the 
resources.  The $200 million spread over five years is a drop in 
the bucket.  Imagine the money the organized criminals make. They 
use that money to buy sophisticated technology.  They have the 
art of technology which they use to evade the law enforcement 
agencies. 
Our law enforcement agencies should have better technology than 
those people.  Only then could they catch them.  The $200 million 
is a very minimal resource.

would be important.

colleague, the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest, on a most 
important issue: Bill C-24 on organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start, I also wish to recognize the work done by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, 
to inform and educate the caucus about the whole situation 
concerning this bill and the application of various pieces of 
legislation on organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to recognize the work of the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm who, for several years, has urged the House, 
effectively I must say, to raise awareness among elected 
representatives of the whole issue of organized crime, which, 
admittedly, has been highly and overly publicized in Quebec. Of 
course, the Bloc Quebecois has done an excellent job on this 
issue. During the election, it was the highlight of its platform. 
This did not translate into more seats, fortunately. But the 
issue is still important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a lawyer. Some will say this is good. However, when it 
comes to organized crime, not being a lawyer, I do not fully 
understand all the intricacies of this bill. Let us look at the 
issue in its broader context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first time I ever heard the term organized crime—and you 
will also remember this, Mr. Speaker, since we are about the same 
age—was during the hearings of the CIOC, the Commission of 
Inquiry on Organized Crime. It was in the early 1970s and, for 
one of the first times, the television stations were on the air 
for long periods of time broadcasting not the full hearings, but 
enough so that we could follow what was happening on a daily 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this commission, which generated a lot of changes, sat 
eminent lawyers, including two who later had political careers at 
the federal level and another one who left the provincial 
political arena not too long ago. That just goes to show that it 
was an important commission that raised awareness about what was 
called at the time the “mafia” or the “mob”. What we learned from 
these hearings was absolutely incredible and the governments 
reacted. The legislation was overhauled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, we were not necessarily talking about the Hell's 
Angels and the Rock Machines. We were talking about the Italian 
mafia, street gangs and American mobsters. The Russian and the 
Chinese mafia were more or less active, but still an important 
issue was addressed. A lot of people ended up in jail. Public 
awareness was raised and both the police and the government 
acted. A few more mafia figures and mobsters were thrown in jail. 
That created a vacuum, which was quickly filled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to realize is that legislation like Bill C-24 will 
not, by and of itself, solve the whole problem of organized 
crime. A mere $200 million over five years will not solve the 
issue. 
Organized crime is changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened at the time is that small biker gangs in Quebec 
began to get together and fill the vacuum. There was a biker gang 
in just about every town that had a population of a few thousand 
people. But these gangs moved on to bigger things. They learned 
the ropes and they got organized, to fill the vacuum and work 
with the various figures in the mafia and the mobs.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expression organized crime implies that criminals know how 
to get organized. This means that we must be smarter—when I say 
we, I am thinking of the legislators, but also of the law 
enforcement bodies, of the people involved in the enforcement of 
these laws and of the members of our justice system, including 
lawyers, attorneys and judges—and get organized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act was passed in 1997, but we quickly found out that it was 
flawed. During these months and years, organized crime got 
organized. But the federal government kept waiting, even though 
it knew there were problems with the 1997 act, which is the most 
recent one. Now, Bill C-24 will correct some of these flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House realized one thing: the government 
does not have any vision when it comes to fighting organized 
crime. The Prime Minister once said “Personally, I do not care 
about vision and programs. Bring me a problem and I will solve 
it”. He was recognizing the fact that he lacked vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Minister of Justice, the problem is glaring. 
People are shooting and killing each other, innocent victims are 
getting hurt, but she will not move. There is a consensus in the 
legal community and among police forces that the minister is not 
taking action. We had an election campaign but she still was not 
moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the minister woke up and, at last, she came up with a 
bill. Thank goodness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But again, let us not fool ourselves. This is not a perfect 
piece of legislation. 
We will give it our support because it is truly a step in the 
right direction to correct deficiencies. However, because crime 
gets organised, parliament must also get organized in the next 
five years to monitor decisions, the jurisprudence, and listen to 
those in charge of implementing the legislation, the difficulty 
of the proof, while complying with our Charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We opposed the use the notwithstanding clause, as requested by 
Quebec.  We thought it would be excessive, given the judicial and 
legislative process that the House could use. But we must get 
organized, and we are able to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great thing about this legislation is that it will simplify 
things. We will have to see what happens. Since a judge convicted 
a number of people under the 1997 legislation—there was a big 
gang of people indicted under that legislation awaiting 
trial—many have admitted their guilt. Why? Because they will get 
sentences which, without being reduced, will be in keeping with 
the spirit of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, since the judgement convicting people under the 1997 
legislation, dozens and dozens of accused people awaiting trial 
have recognized their guilt. We are happy with that, because this 
will save months in detention and loads of money. These people 
might get away with lighter sentences. Not making out a case 
restricts the amount of information made available, and there are 
fewer informers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is extremely important that Bill C-24 be passed 
properly and quickly. Hopefully, the government will listen to 
what opposition members—whether the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm or some other members of the NDP or the 
Alliance—have to say. Anything that comes from the opposition is 
not necessarily bad but, between you and me, things that come 
from the government are not necessarily good either. There is a 
middle ground, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the good work of members in support of the 
government—because members are legislators; we are not here to 
complain for the sake of complaining, but to legislate—will be 
taken into consideration and that the minister will listen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish that this bill will be effective. I am not sure that 
$200 million over five years will be enough. Where does this 
figure come from? How did the minister come up with $200 million? 
Was it just because it sounded nice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, if I may, look at the costs before, during, and after 
the Quebec summit. How much is $200 million? The security costs 
for two Quebec summits and perhaps one APEC meeting add up to 
about $200 million. Where did the minister pull out that figure? 
This budget should be revised annually. We cannot say “Here is 
$200 million. That is it; now forget about us”. The minister 
thinks that with $200 million over five years everything will be 
fine. Is that it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the House for its attention and reiterate the basic 
principle: if criminals get organized, we must keep one step 
ahead of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate the member. I think he has a very 
good understanding of the whole issue of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a comment as well as a question. My comment refers to the 
comment made by the member regarding the $200 million the 
minister plans to spend on implementing this legislation. We know 
how good the Liberal government is at estimating costs. Members 
will certainly remember that the government had estimated that 
firearms registration would cost some $125 million or $135 
million, and perhaps up to $150 million. These costs have now 
reached nearly $800 million, which is a conservative estimate, 
and only 75% of firearms have been registered in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said that the system would be self-funding after 
initial registration. Now we are talking about recurring annual 
costs of $150 to $200 million. So we have every reason to 
question the figures mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the minister threw this $200 million figure at us to try 
to impress us. However, the opposition, which does its homework, 
can very well see that $200 million to implement this type of 
legislation—when we know that each investigation may cost $5 
million, $6 million or $10 million if it is complicated—is 
clearly not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question deals with the idea that the mere fact of belonging 
to a criminal organization should be a criminal offence. Does the 
member believe, as does the Bloc Quebecois, that the bill should 
be amended in that regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm who, as has again been 
demonstrated, is very knowledgeable on this issue, much more so 
than I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions regarding mere memberships in a 
criminal organization raise the whole issue of proof. They raise 
the whole issue of the charter. A balance must be struck. 
Unfortunately, I will be unable to answer the member's question 
as clearly as he would like, as I am not really knowledgeable 
about the whole issue and the workings of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, mere membership only shows an 
intention and I would like to raise a few questions: proof, the 
charter, the presumption of innocence. It is a right. People are 
considered innocent until found guilty, with the exception of 
income tax and employment insurance. In the justice system, one 
is innocent until found guilty. In the case of income tax and 
employment insurance, people are first considered guilty and it 
is up to them to prove that they are innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as far as the provisions regarding mere membership 
are concerned, I would say that it is one where 
the whole case law would have to be considered, and the member 
for Berthier-Montcalm knows much better than I do the difficulty 
in proving and maybe the possibility to make mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then again, Bill C-24 solves many problems concerning 
definitions and numbers. But will maintaining provisions on the 
simple fact of being a member not bring back the whole problem of 
a clear and easily applicable definition? It is something we must 
keep working on and I certainly hope that all members, including 
my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, will keep on 
doing so in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a very simple 
question to ask. What is new in this bill is the whole issue of 
immunity granted to police officers in the course of very 
specific investigations and the power of the Solicitor General of 
Canada to break the law, to a certain extent. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple. Does the member think it is 
dangerous to have politicians interfere in legal matters like 
this? Would it not be better to let a court, like the superior 
court, or a judge authorize police officers, in specific cases, 
to take some steps stipulated in the legislation, if they have 
enough evidence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, when the solicitor general is 
asked to take action in some matters, he answers “I cannot 
interfere with the work carried out by police officers. I cannot 
interfere like that. It is only normal and fair that I respect 
this line between my role as a legislator and the work done by 
the police”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told there is a process to follow, that the minister is 
not involved, that he does not really know what is happening and 
that he cannot interfere. But now, he wants to stick his nose in, 
with this bill, one of our toughest pieces of legislation, which 
goes after organized crime. With all due respect, I am not sure 
he has the capacity to do so and, furthermore, generally 
speaking, politicians have no business getting involved in this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for the record our party generally supports Bill C-24. 
Our justice critic will put forth amendments as we go through the 
debate, but generally we support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the listening public to understand where we 
are in this debate and what prompted it.  The truth is Bill C-24 
would fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that prompted the government to take action on this 
was when RCMP Commissioner Zaccardelli stated that organized 
crime had drafted plans to use bribes to destabilize the 
country's parliamentary system.  This is pretty scary stuff when 
we think that the members of this House or any other provincial 
legislation, who draft the bills and the laws, could be subjected 
to a plan by organized crime to sabotage our democratic process. 
That would scare anyone.  That raised eyebrows across the country 
and gave a pretty clear indication of how much of an epidemic we 
were really facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we can go back to last September when the Quebec public 
security minister, Serge Ménard, urged the federal government to 
use the notwithstanding clause to outlaw gang memberships, which 
provoked a controversy in Quebec and across the country.  One of 
the victims of that, within just a day or so, was the <I>Journal 
de Montréal</I> reporter Michel Auger.  He was gunned down and 
shot five times by organized crime, sending out a message that 
the criminals were not going to stand for this.  He stood fast, 
as did many in that province, in an attempt to fight organized 
crime.  They are still working to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully this bill will do something because it is an epidemic 
not only in the urban areas but also the rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us focus on some of the things that the bill might do, 
should do and obviously would do if implemented properly with 
some attention given to the amendments which I am sure will come 
forward from the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 would simplify the definition and composition of the 
criminal organization.  This is very important.  It would target 
various degrees of involvement with these organizations.  It 
would make it easier for police and prosecutors to arrest and 
jail gangsters and keep them in prison for longer periods of 
time.  It would allow law enforcement to forfeit the proceeds of 
crime from these criminal organizations and to seize property 
that was used in a crime.  In other words, it would send out a 
message that crime did not pay.  It would strengthen rules 
protecting against the intimidation of witnesses, juries and 
their families in an organized crime trial.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last on my list is to strengthen protection for federal members 
of parliament and to improve protection for law enforcement 
officers from criminal liability when they commit certain illegal 
acts while engaged in undercover operations to infiltrate 
criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds good.  We are hoping the government does eventually 
come up with a bill, obviously with the help of the opposition 
and some of the fine amendments which I am sure will be coming 
from all of the parties on this side of the House because, Mr. 
Speaker, as you will remember, last September it was the 
opposition, particularly the Bloc Quebecois, that brought forward 
this emergency debate on organized crime in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the history of the government is any evidence of what it 
might do or what it should do, not much is going to happen.  The 
minister in her press release brags about the many bills that she 
brought into the House to fight crime.  She mentioned seven in 
particular.  That goes back to 1993 in the life of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House and the Canadian people of an 
example.  The youth justice bill has been introduced in the House 
three times and has never passed.  Obviously that in itself is 
not going to fight organized crime, but it is an example of the 
absurdity of the government's position on fighting crime.  We do 
not expect anything to happen in a hurry or at all if the 
government has its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the money the government is putting into this, again 
it brags about the $200 million in addition to the $584 million 
that is being provided to the RCMP every year by the Government 
of Canada, or in other words, the taxpayers of Canada.  At first 
glance the $200 million looks mighty good, but it is like the 
funding for health care.  It is spread over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of the government being honest with the Canadian public 
and telling us there will be another $40 million this year and 
again next year to fight crime, it comes up with the $200 million 
because it looks better on paper.  How this money starts to flow 
or will flow, nobody knows.  If the recent health accord is any 
example, I will not be holding my breath because not much is 
going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of that $200 million, the government mentions $50 million that 
is going into fighting smuggling, which I assume is smuggling of 
products and people.  As we well know, that is an epidemic in the 
country as well.  Another $150 million is going to the RCMP for 
hiring new officers and training and so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of inconsistency of the government is that in 1994 
there was the biggest capitulation in the history of Canada when 
it came to fighting organized crime.  Do hon. members remember 
when the government caved in to the cigarette smugglers?  That 
was a double-edged sword.  Not only did the government capitulate 
to the smugglers and turn a blind eye to smuggling, there was a 
reduction on the excise tax on cigarettes.  Instead of enforcing 
our laws and cracking down on smuggling, the government 
capitulated and reduced the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this obviously was not good.  It was not good 
simply because every year 45,000 Canadians—I am getting off 
topic a little bit—die from smoking cigarettes.  Instead of the 
government attacking smuggling in 1994 and putting the resources 
back in when it could have made a difference, it chose not to do 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has only taken seven years for the government to get the 
message on both of these areas, smuggling and health care.  There 
is a connection between the two of them.  If past history is any 
example of what the government can do, let us not hold our 
breath.  We will not expect much.  Of course the government 
always falls back on whether or not it will be charter proof. 
Basically the government makes it up as it goes along and hopes 
that it will work, but it does not do the research and the 
fundamentals before bringing in the legislation.  This issue is 
important to all Canadians, both rural and urban.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to make is in reference to the port police. 
If you remember correctly, Mr. Speaker, in the House the member 
for Saint John, the former mayor of that New Brunswick city, 
suggested that when the government did away with the port police 
it was a huge mistake.  Obviously ships come in from all parts of 
the world and there are no police to enforce Canadian law at the 
ports.  The government has recognized that it also made a mistake 
there, so it is going to put more money into this.  The 
government is going to put more money into securing our borders. 
Maybe it is time we take the examples of other jurisdictions, 
possibly the U.S.  The U.S. has a border patrol to protect the 
sanctity of its borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do support the bill.  We will bring in amendments.  However, 
as is the case with much of the legislation the government brings 
in, it is just a first start.  We are prepared to support that 
first start. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the bill introduced by the minister this morning contains almost 
80% of what the Bloc Quebecois has been asking for over the last 
five or so years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point, however, is missing from the bill on organized crime 
now before us and that is the whole issue of reversing the burden 
of proof and the proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is a very simple one.  Everyone knows 
that money is the sinews of war, whether politics or organized 
crime are involved. 
The comparison may be slightly imperfect, but it boils down to 
the same thing; there is organized crime because there is money 
to be made.  The more money they make, the stronger and more 
organized they will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is really nothing in the bill to facilitate the work of 
the police and crown prosecutors, to reverse even somewhat the 
burden of proof, so that it is not up to the crown to prove the 
illegality of an acquired asset, but rather up to organized crime 
to prove the legality of its origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is as follows.  Will he be able to 
support this, when he talks of amending the bill?  Is it in this 
sense of giving additional tools to the police and crown 
prosecutors to facilitate proof with respect to such things as 
money which is, as we know, the sinews of war? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this goes back to 
previous comments and to questions answered by my colleagues in 
the House.  There is always that balance between charter rights 
and the willingness or the desire to crack down on criminals. 
There is a balance to be struck.  Certainly that reverse onus is 
something worth looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the truth is that organized crime has the resources. 
The government brags about the money it is putting in, but there 
are some prosecutions that have been going on in the country 
against organized crime by the Government of Canada where the 
cost is in excess of $10 million.  The money being put in is a 
drop in the bucket.  Not to discount the fact that $200 million 
over five years is a lot of money, but in comparison to the 
proceeds of crime, which are reaching into the billions, the 
point has to be made that we have to fight back with the 
resources we have and often that means money to fight crime. 
Bringing in legislation that is tough yet honours the charter is 
the challenge for the government. 
We are hoping the bill will do that given some of the amendments 
we will put forward from this side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la-Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-24, an act to amend the Criminal Code. It deals more 
specifically with organized crime and law enforcement. As usual, 
when such a bill is presented, it also makes consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to say that the Bloc Quebecois will also 
support this bill. We feel somewhat involved in this bill, since 
the minister has included in it approximately 80% of what our 
party has repeatedly asked for since our arrival in the House. 
There is a small portion, about 20%, left that we would have 
liked to see included also. But we can talk about this later, 
when the bill is considered in committee and when the time comes 
for amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Berthier—Montcalm will certainly be happy to 
remind the minister that we would like to bring forward some 
amendments. We will also have our say at the third reading stage, 
but we hope that the minister will keep on thinking about it 
until the end of the third reading stage, so that she really can 
try to put it on the agenda for 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the people who are watching and who may read 
the proceedings, I would like to give a brief historical 
background. 
You surely remember, Mr. Speaker, when you were with us in the 
House at the time, that, in 1997, in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, a boy 
of only eleven, who was playing quietly on the sidewalk, became 
the unfortunate victim of organized crime because some gangs were 
fighting each other. Poor Daniel Desrochers was killed, a totally 
innocent victim of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, it was quite a shock. We felt as though everyone knew 
this dear Daniel. We thought that something had to be done to try 
to make the government react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, as my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party 
was reminding us, there was the unfortunate event where reporter 
Michel Auger was shot. However, he was luckier and received 
medical attention. He recovered and went back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another person who had no luck was Francis Laforêt, a young man 
from Terrebonne who was a bar owner and who thought he was able 
to live in our society. Unfortunately, organized crime also got 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three cases are very fresh in our memories and are 
painful. There was also, a little later, an event related to the 
bikers' war that traumatized the village of Saint-Nicholas, on 
the south shore, just outside Quebec City. There was a bunker, a 
hideout for criminals. When some bombs exploded, they damaged a 
youngster's room.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very glad to see that the minister has taken the issue of 
organized crime seriously. In Canada, it has become an industry. 
We are told that drug sales alone reached $5 billion. During the 
weekend, at the Summit of the Americas, it was the president of 
Columbia, I think, who expressed the hope that we could help him 
deal with the drug problem in his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1999, during a Commonwealth mission to Barbados, the 
justice minister told us that one of the biggest problems in his 
country was drug trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With $5 billion in sales only in Canada, it has become a 
thriving business that causes a lot of problems. If we consider 
only the Hells Angels who were arrested recently, their drug 
sales generated $100 million in profits. That is quite an amount 
of money, enough to realize that we need to deal with this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 data released by the RCMP are troubling: 79 murders, 89 
attempted murders, 129 cases of arson and 92 bombings, and that 
only includes offences committed during gang wars where bikers 
fight against each other. It does not include the people who were 
killed or forced to commit suicide, as is often now the case, 
because they could not pay back the money they owed. The RCMP's 
numbers for 1998 only cover the gang wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2001, “Printemps 2001”—spring is the time of year where 
everyone gets into a cleaning mode—allowed police forces to do 
some spring cleaning of their own: they arrested 160 criminals in 
74 municipalities in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the minister heeded what we have been telling her since we 
have been here, we would have had Bill C-24 long before 2001. 
Today, we would be reassured if the 160 people who were arrested 
could be judged under Bill C-24. We would be reassured about the 
end result of this spring cleaning exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the current act as it is—those who were arrested will have 
to be judged under the current act, not under the new one that is 
coming—how many of these 160 people will remain incarcerated? 
Out of 160, how many will be prosecuted with all the evidence and 
convicted? Two, three? Maybe ten if we are lucky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if these people were to be judged under this bill, 
about 120 or 130 out of the 160 could be proven to be criminals 
and remain incarcerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying at the beginning of my speech, this bill 
responds to about 80% of the Bloc's wishes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is extremely interesting, and I refer to clause 5 of 
the bill, which amends section 2 of the act. It says that anyone 
who directs threats against a member of the Senate or the House 
of Commons is guilty of a serious offence. It then goes on to 
list other persons, including: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>)  a person who plays a role in the administration of 
criminal justice, including 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i)  a prosecutor, a lawyer— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the list of persons mentioned here, we cannot 
help thinking that it would have been nice to include our 
colleagues from the provincial legislatures and the Quebec 
National Assembly. It would have been interesting to see 
paragraph (a) read as follows: “a Member of the Senate, a Member 
of the House of Commons, a Member of a provincial legislature or 
a Member of the Quebec National Assembly”.  We must think about 
our colleagues who occupy the same position as we do, but at 
other levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also have been a good thing if that list had mentioned 
the members of municipal councils, individuals who occupy 
elective positions, who represent the people, who serve the 
public in their community, their county or their riding.  These 
persons give their time for the collective good and are,  all of 
them from the first to the last, worthy of being protected by the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the necessary amendments will be implemented. I hope the 
minister will be sensitive to those comments and that she will 
also add a category which seems extremely important to me, that 
of journalists.  We know that Mr. Auger was the first victim and 
I hope he will be the last.  It might be appropriate to add a 
dissuasive measure specifically for journalists so that they are 
included in the category of threatened persons.  If they were in 
that category, then the criminals attacking them would receive 
appropriate sentences and those persons could continue to work in 
peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One significant plus of this bill is that the minister has 
finally accepted to define gangsterism. 
In the bill she had passed in 1999, which initially amended the 
Criminal Code and provided a few more teeth to deal with 
organized crime groups, there was what is known as the rule of 
three fives, which provided that conviction required a group of 
five persons.  That was the first five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the second five, the five individuals had to have had a 
police record during the last five years. They were to be 
arrested, and these five people with a police record in the 
previous five years had to have committed a crime serious enough 
for them to be charged under the Criminal Code and liable to five 
years or more of imprisonment, hence the rule of the three fives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, the minister is going further. For the benefit of all 
of us, I think it is extremely important to refer exactly to the 
text to see what clause 27, which amends section 467.1 of the 
Criminal Code provides. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1810

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“criminal organization” means a group, however organized, that 
is composed of three or more persons— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is progress.  From five to three.  I continue: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and that has as one of its main purposes or main activities 
the facilitation or commission— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one or other of the alternatives. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—of one or more serious offences that, if committed, would 
likely result in the direct or indirect receipt of a material 
benefit, including a financial benefit, by the group or by any of 
the persons who constitute the group. It does not include a group 
of persons that forms randomly for the immediate commission of a 
single offence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here they distinguish between the two. It does not mean three 
people, for example, who decide that to pay for their drugs, they 
will hold up the Caisse populaire at the corner.  They have never 
seen one another or met, but the three of them know that, by 
chance, they all owe money to the same gang.  They say “Tonight 
we will do a hold up”.  That is not it.  They have to be an 
organized gang. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if we continue reading this magnificent bill, we will see 
interesting things on prosecution.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>467.11(2) In a prosecution for an offence under subsection (1)— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the offence I have just read. I will read it slowly enough 
so you will remember it: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it is not necessary for the prosecutor to prove that— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting because, from the outset, it excludes 
certain things which do not have to be proved beyond a doubt. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the criminal organization actually facilitated or 
committed an indictable offence; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the participation or 
contribution of the accused actually enhanced the ability of the 
criminal organization to facilitate or commit an indictable 
offence; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) the accused knew the specific nature of any 
indictable offence that may have been facilitated or committed by 
the criminal organization; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have some extremely interesting elements that were 
introduced into the bill to facilitate the job of those who have 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is an interesting element.  As I said at the beginning 
of my speech, we were 80% satisfied with this bill and 20% 
dissatisfied.  Those might be considered good stats but there is 
still room for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Berthier<B>—</B>Montcalm has asked a question of 
the hon. member who spoke just before I did, in connection with 
merely be a member of a criminal organization.  Might steps not 
be taken to ensure that mere membership in a criminal 
organization is an offence in itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we stressed the need for this so heavily was that we 
wanted to be able to get the gang leaders.  They are the 
masterminds. They are the ones pulling the strings. They send out 
the new recruits to earn their colours by doing the dirty work 
for them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the clock is moving on and there are still a lot of things 
I could say.  This is an amendment we find extremely interesting. 
There is also the matter of reversal of the burden of proof in 
connection with the proceeds of crime, to which we shall return 
in committee and in subsequent debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short time I have left, I would like to say how important 
it is for the minister to proceed with this bill, to get it in 
force promptly, for the House not to be recessed before it 
is passed, and for her to ensure the funding is made available, 
the cash required to make it enforceable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate my colleague for 
Rimouski-Neigette-et-la-Mitis. She understands very well the 
problem with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She ended her remarks talking about “cash”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:  </B>L'argent comptant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur: </B>If I were the minister, I would 
mind my own business—free trade—instead of correcting me. 
I believe he has his hands full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, since he is a Quebec minister, I would like him to 
speak up for Quebec once in a while instead of coming to the 
rescue of his prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew: </B>I do day in and day out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> As I was saying, it is all very nice 
to introduce a bill, but we need cash to implement it.  We need 
to put money on the table so that enforcement officers will have 
what it takes to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is forecasting $200 million over five years. In my 
mind, it means $40 million a year. This is not enough to put in 
place such an act, when we know that one investigation alone, 
such as Opération Printemps 2001, the big cleanup operation my 
colleague referred to, will cost close to that in Quebec alone, 
that is to say around $20 million. If we add the cost of building 
a prison, a court and all the other measures, we will need $40 
million for this much needed operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree with me that the minister should invest at 
least five times this amount over five years, at least $200 
million a year, to successfully fight organized crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an very 
interesting and important issue. I thought I would have time to 
discuss it during my speech, but I am glad to be asked about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be realized that it takes money to conduct 
investigations and to be fully prepared to make arrests. This 
implies, among other things, electronic surveillance. We may also 
have to pay informants, something which is costly. The police may 
have to conduct investigations and shadow people. All sorts of 
very important things are necessary to conduct investigations 
effectively and the costs are in the millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, as will be the case in Montreal with the trial, a 
special courthouse must be built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also attorneys who are not very pleased. They feel 
that they are underpaid and if we want them to continue to do a 
good job, we will have to put more money into this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police is no longer present in Canada's ports and harbours, 
but containers full of goods keep entering the ports of Montreal 
and Quebec City. It seems that all sorts of things can be found 
in these containers. The same goes for Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to realize that the government must be 
logical and consistent. Canada is a very large country and we 
have the longest boundary. The St. Lawrence River, the gulf and 
the estuary are used to smuggle all sorts of things. The 
government talks about investing $200 million in this, but it 
also wants to eliminate jobs in the RCMP and so on. The government 
will have to sit down, be reasonable and consistent and allocate 
the necessary budgets. The amount of $200 million per year seems 
a minimum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for her speech in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important issue has been raised. The hon. member is 
saying that we must act quickly with this bill, so that it will 
be passed and become law. I agree with my colleague. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT88"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT88"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1820

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that 80% of the bill is the result of previous 
discussions or proposals generated by the Bloc Quebecois. There 
is 20% missing. Could that 20% be dealt with quickly, through 
amendments in committee? What would be a reasonable timeframe for 
this bill becoming law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the Bloc Quebecois 
is willing to do everything it can so this bill can be read the 
third time and passed in June. We are willing to put in the 
necessary time and effort. We have a few amendments to propose to 
the committee. We think it is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will have to be reasonable and to take into account 
the fact that the rules for proposing amendments have been 
considerably changed. That means that the work of the committee 
will have to be taken seriously, that the amendments proposed 
there will have to be looked at closely. It may not be possible. 
My colleague from Richmond—Arthabaska raised the charter issue. 
If there is a problem in that regard, we should take the time to 
examine it and to ensure that it can be overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I am certainly not forgetting, for example, that the 
government did not hesitate, during consideration of the bill on 
employment insurance—it is the current Minister for 
International Trade who was at human resources development when 
these amendments were passed—to impose special EI eligibility 
requirements for young people and for pregnant women, who have to 
work respectively 910 and 700 hours.  It is now down to 600 to 
qualify, compared to 420 hours for a regular worker who is not 
young or pregnant. Therefore, if the government can discriminate 
against women and young people, maybe it can forget about the 
charter and discriminate a little less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of criminals, we certainly have to be careful, but I 
think we must not allow people to invoke the charter too easily 
either. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have one final question for the member for 
Rimouski—Neigette-et-la Mitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said this morning, the minister did not have a lot to say 
in that because, barely three weeks before she introduced the 
bill at first reading, I asked her questions in the House and she 
said that the criminal code contained all the provisions 
necessary to wage an effective battle against organized crime, 
when we knew that the department was in the process of drafting a 
bill.  What departmental officials included in the bill concerns 
immunity for certain actions by the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is somewhat the same question I asked my colleague earlier. 
Under this bill, the police will be able to commit offences such 
as selling and buying drugs in order to win the acceptance of a 
criminalized group.  This is dangerous, and I think that everyone 
would agree. There is some protection, but it takes the form of 
an agreement, of authorization from the Solicitor General of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> —to the member.  She could very well 
be a minister, and she would probably be much more competent than 
those opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree with me that it is dangerous to leave 
this up to the solicitor general?  Should this not be the 
responsibility of an appointed judge, who enforces the law on a 
daily basis, who knows how things work in these cases, just as he 
has responsibility for authorizing wiretaps or certain seizures? 
Would she not agree that it would be preferable for a judge to 
authorize such actions, which would otherwise be illegal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is extremely 
important that this decision be left to a judge only because, to 
become a minister, whether it is the solicitor general or another 
minister of the crown, one does not need to produce a resume and 
to have studied in the area one will have to manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could end up with someone who is not quite familiar with the 
law. I believe it is extremely important that the solicitor 
general not be caught in such a situation. As the hon. member for 
Richmond—Arthabaska so rightly pointed out, every time we put 
questions to the solicitor general in this House, he was unable 
to provide us with answers. The same can be said of the revenue 
minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I wonder why these two people are ministers. They can 
never answer our questions because everything must be kept 
secret, everything is confidential, and they have nothing to say. 
They can never tell us anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be better for the decision to grant immunity to 
be handed down by a judge. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to take part in this debate, an important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it important?  Bill C-24 amends the Criminal Code and 
related laws, specifically to clarify a major social problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, long before this bill, wanted to do battle. 
My colleague from Berthier—Montcalm naturally headed this 
battle. He spearheaded this important bill, which he could have 
tabled, but which the government tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill could very easily have been tabled by a member of this 
party, the Bloc Quebecois, because for many years the Bloc 
Quebecois has called for a vigorous law, tighter legislation, to 
limit and reduce crime, and criminal gangs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Berthier—Montcalm was not the only one. I 
recall very clearly from an event in the Montreal riding of 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve that my colleague who represents that 
riding introduced a motion under private members' business and 
initiated this debate in this House to ensure that the government 
was taking the necessary steps to establish legislation to fight 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being tabled today concerns basically six elements, 
six legislative means to fight organized crime.  One concerns the 
question of participation in a criminal organization, which 
becomes an offence under the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another is the whole issue of protection given to persons 
participating in the legal system against certain acts of 
intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third aspect is the simplified definition of criminal 
organizations.  This is essential, essential because we wanted to 
see a clear definition of what a criminal organization, what a 
gang, is.  Right at the start of the bill, in clause 1, in the 
explanatory notes, the definition is clear: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—“gang”.  Group or association or other body consisting of 
five or more persons, whether formally or informally organized, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) having as one of its primary activities the commission of an 
indictable offence under this or any other Act of Parliament for 
which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for five years or 
more; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) any or all of the members of which engage in or have, within 
the preceding five years, engaged in the commission of a series 
of such offences; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides clarification of what a criminal organization 
is, because we feel that the current legislation—not the bill we 
are looking at today but the present legislation—is in my 
opinion complex and to some extent provides organized groups with 
loopholes about which we as parliamentarians have a duty to do 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect addressed by this bill is the whole matter of 
seizure and forfeiture of the proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the matter of protection for those mandated to 
monitor application of the legislation, what is termed immunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, there is the matter of non legislative measures, the 
budget in particular.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on this point.  It is not merely a matter of 
equipping ourselves with legislation.  We also need the financial 
means to be able to enforce it.  We are waiting for a budget that 
will allow us to meet the challenge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 5 of this year, I asked the new Minister of 
Industry a question regarding shipbuilding. Without rereading the 
text of the question, which anyone may consult in <I>Hansard</I>, I 
asked him when he intended to develop a shipbuilding policy, as 
promised two days before the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, given that my Bill C-213 on shipbuilding had been 
through all stages except one hour of debate, which was refused 
me in the very week before the election was called, I asked the 
minister if he intended to introduce a bill on shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although he was sympathetic to the spirit of my bill, he hid, as 
it were, behind a committee he had created on October 20, two 
days before the election was called, to study the issue of 
shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 30, the National Shipbuilding and Industrial Marine 
Partnership Project released a report in Halifax.  This report 
contained 30 or so recommendations having to do with some very 
important topics, such as financing and tax exemptions.  To a 
certain degree, it improved on my bill with respect to such 
issues as training and all aspects of technological innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that all this has been done and the report submitted, I 
would expect the minister's representative—the minister not 
being here today—to tell the House exactly when he will be 
following up on the committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was two years ago, on April 15, that I tabled a bill along 
these lines and everyone knows the procedures.  First of all, my 
name had to be drawn, and I got 100 MPs to sign so that the bill 
would be given priority.  This bill made it through all stages, 
including second reading and clause-by-clause study in committee 
of the whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months have elapsed since the election and nothing more has 
been done for the shipbuilding industry. When he was asked to 
comment on the report, the Minister of Industry said “Since the 
committee that I set up took six months to table its report, you 
will understand that I will take some months to review it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is a committee that was set up by the minister 
himself. This means that committee members met him at various 
stages. Two years after I tabled my bill, we should expect to 
have more details as to when the government will table a 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the tabling of my bill, an additional 2,000 workers have 
been laid off and two major shipyards, those of Saint John and 
Marinestown, have shut down. The situation is even more urgent 
and critical than before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister wait until every shipyard in Canada and in 
Quebec is closed before making a move? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight years after the promise made in 1993 to develop a 
shipbuilding policy, can the Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Industry tell us when the minister and the Liberal 
government will finally act?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on February 5, 2001, 
the hon. member asked the Minister of Industry whether he would 
make a commitment to table as soon as possible a bill providing 
the country with a true shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responded that he was pleased that colleagues on 
all sides of the House had discussed shipbuilding in Canada with 
a view to identifying ways to improve the situation of this 
sector.  Most important, the minister noted that he was waiting 
for the report of the national shipbuilding and industrial marine 
partnership project, which was recently released on April 5, 
2001.  This was a private sector task force which the minister 
established to provide views to the government on practical and 
workable approaches to improving the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report, which was tabled earlier this month, sets out a 
range of possible measures.  It identifies a wide variety of 
policy recommendations and options for the federal government as 
well as for provincial governments and other stakeholders, 
including industry and labour, to improve the quality and 
productivity of the shipbuilding industry.  The report is being 
carefully analyzed, and the minister is consulting with his 
federal colleagues and provincial counterparts so he can respond 
to the report's recommendations within the next few months.  I 
assure the hon. member that the minister will be giving the 
report very careful consideration in the coming months.
