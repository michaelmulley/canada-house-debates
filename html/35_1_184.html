	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Bard of 
Avon, William Shakespeare, whose birthday we commemorate 
on April 23.
<P>
	A weekend of special events including a silent auction, a cake 
decorating contest and a gala birthday dinner will take place in 
my riding to mark this occasion. The Lakeside Seniors, and 
Hamlet School which is putting on a play, and many hundreds of 
people are involved in this celebration. I congratulate everyone 
who is involved in this, particularly Ted Blowes and Debra 
Huggins.
<P>
	On the heels of this celebration, the Stratford Festival is 
opening its 43rd season which will take place on May 29. I 
encourage all members of the House and all Canadians to attend 
the productions this summer. I am confident it will be a 
theatrical experience to cherish.
<P>
	Members of volunteer organizations are the very heart and 
support of this Shakespearian festival. This year the festival will 
be missing one of the western world's leading classical actors 
with the death of Mr. Nicholas Pennell. He will be missed this 
summer.
<P>
	I wish the festival every success in the upcoming season as the 
Stratford adventure continues. I have put a playbill on each 
member's desk today.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Ogilvie Mills workers have, once again, demanded that the 
Minister of Labour table an antiscab bill aimed at businesses 
under federal jurisdiction. The minister responded like her 
predecessor, saying simply that she was reviewing the matter.
<P>
	The government has been studying the issue for nearly a year 
and a half and the only reason for this delay is a total lack of 
political will. The federal government is quite familiar with the 
type of provisions already in effect in Quebec, Ontario and 
British Columbia.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, for its part, recently tabled in this House 
a bill which would provide adequate protection for the workers 
currently hurt by their employers' disloyal practices. The 
minister is quick to trample workers' rights, as she did in the rail 
labour dispute, but she is unacceptably slow in responding to 
their legitimate demands.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, half a century ago 
North America's first medicare plan, Saskatchewan Health 
Region Number 1, was established in what is now my riding.
<P>
	It was an experiment, a prototype and it was a Godsend. It 
worked well and it cost little. This was partly because people 
accustomed to doing without medical care did not abuse or over 
use it and partly because it was run mostly at the local level by 
country doctors and municipal reeves.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the lessons of the experiment were quickly 
forgotten. A great system was eventually suffocated by the cold 
dead hands of political and federal bureaucracy.
<P>
	The Liberals say there is nothing wrong with our health care 
but Canadians know better. They know about the waiting lists 
and the lack of accessibility.
<P>
	It is time to be bold, as our Saskatchewan predecessors were, 
and using common sense rather than grand schemes, revise the 
Canada Health Act to allow the provinces to bring health care 
back to health.

<P>
	Partridge Island, a small island in the middle of Saint John 
harbour, is a piece of Canadian heritage. It was used as a 
quarantine station and welcomed over three million immigrants 
and mariners between 1785 and 1942. Two thousand 
quarantined immigrants died on the island and their graves are 
located there. Partridge Island was designated a national 
historic site in 1974.
<P>
	The year 1997 marks the official observance of the 150th 
anniversary of the great Irish famine. Saint John's Irish 
community will be marking the next three years on the island 
with special exhibits as well as an Irish homecoming and 
memorial service in 1997.
<P>
	I, as well as the people of the most Irish city in Canada, Saint 
John, and the province of New Brunswick, call on this 
government to revisit the decision to sell this national historic 
site of Partridge Island. We ask that it be transferred to the 
Department of Canadian Heritage for preservation.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to inform the House of the birth in my community of the 
Grand River Hospital on April 1, 1995. This dynamic new 
beginning in health care in the Waterloo region came together 
with the amalgamation of the Kitchener-Waterloo hospital and 
the Freeport hospital. The Kitchener-Waterloo hospital and the 
Freeport hospital represent 175 years of caring with their unique 
strengths and proud history of service.
<P>
	The new Grand River Hospital will be governed by one board 
of trustees and managed on two sites by one administration. It 
will continue to provide the high standard of quality, innovation 
and accomplishment to the residents of Waterloo region. What 
is unique about this event is that it was initiated by two former 
hospitals with the aim of delivering the best possible quality of 
service and maximizing existing resources.
<P>
	The people comprising the leadership of the two former 
hospitals are to be commended for their vision in pioneering this 
union under the aegis of the Grand River Hospital. Their efforts 
are to be applauded by all Canadians.

Mr. Speaker, the people of Guelph-Wellington know that 
leadership requires risk taking and real leaders do not back down 
from doing what is right. That is why they are proud of our Prime 
Minister, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister 
of Labour.
<P>
	These leaders have acted and succeeded where many others 
would have failed. One has worked hard to make the world 
aware of the impact of overfishing. The other, knowing how the 
country was suffering, put an end to the rail strike.
<P>
	These ministers could have listened to the usual negative 
remarks of the Reform Party and the destructive policies of the 
Bloc. Instead, they took risks and did what was best for Canada, 
because what they did was right.
<P>
	We are fortunate they are our leaders who are not afraid to act. 
We thank them for standing strong.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, April 17 
is International Haemophilia Day, and I would like to take this 
opportunity to pay tribute to the Canadian Haemophilia Society 
for its excellent work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Hemophilia Society was founded in 1953 by 
people with hemophilia as a self-help group. Today the range of 
people it helps and the ways in which the help is offered have 
broadened considerably.
<P>
	In the 1980s about 40 per cent of hemophiliacs and 1,200 
other Canadians became infected with HIV through 
contaminated blood. The primary goal of the Canadian 
Hemophilia Society is to ensure safe access to the Canadian 
blood supply.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Much progress has been made. Today, thanks to greater 
awareness and technical developments, the risks of 
contamination through blood transfusions are almost 
nonexistent.

<P>
	We can all help too by donating blood, time, or money. After

yesterday, referring to the current tensions in Burundi, I asked 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs whether he recognized that 
concrete action was urgently needed, by supporting the 
deployment of a monitoring force in that country among other 
things, as the Burundian ambassador to Canada requested on 
March 23 before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	In response, all the minister said was that no request had been 
received from the Government of Burundi along the lines of the 
moving plea made by the Burundian ambassador. The minister 
should know that the Government of Burundi has no leeway.
<P>

	This response from the minister confirmed our worst fears. 
This government is turning a blind eye to the tragedy waiting 
to happen in Burundi. The optimist front put up by the minister, 
who talks about an illusive will to reconcile, brings back sad 
memories of the tragedy in Rwanda, where the international 
community was confronted with a crisis it was unable to 
prevent.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, April marks 
the beginning of spring, a time for new growth and a time of 
hope. It is particularly fitting that April is Canadian Cancer 
Society month.
<P>
	The society works diligently to find a cure for cancer, to open 
the pathways of discovery and to change the lives of Canadians. 
Thousands upon thousands of Canadians benefit every year 
from the research the Canadian Cancer Society performs.
<P>
	Since 1948 the society's fundraising month of April has 
brought Canadians together to contribute to the fight against 
cancer. Last year more than $44.2 million was raised during the 
campaign. This year's goal is $47.6 million.
<P>
	I ask that my colleagues in the House join with me in 
supporting this society for even one of our own members in this 
House, the hon. member for Nepean, is now recovering from this 
scourge.

the Canadian people, cancer will be beaten.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal interest rate policy is killing the hopes and dreams of 
Canadians to own their own homes. As well it is severely hurting 
our Canadian economic recovery.
<P>
	Since the Liberal government jammed the interest rates 
upward last fall, the result has been that the last half of 1994 was 
the most brutal on record for house sales. The high 
unpredictable interest rate policy is also forcing residential 
construction into a nosedive which is costing thousands of jobs.
<P>
	This Liberal government has not learned its lesson from the 
last time it was in office when its high interest rate policy caused 
the 1980 recession.
<P>
	I am telling the Liberal government to listen. High interest 
rates mean fewer home sales, less consumer spending, smaller 
economic growth and fewer jobs. The Liberal high interest rates 
are wiping out any chance Canada has of seeing an economic 
recovery and it is hurting families desperately.
<P>
	Canadians are worried about their future, but this government 
is not interested in home buyers or Canadian consumers. It is 
only interested in keeping the banks and the moneychangers 
happy and wealthy.

the ages of 18 and 35 feel happy and are primarily concerned 
with the work world.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	It must be pointed out that separation is not one of their 
priorities. In fact, the separatist movement is in rough shape 
these days. A study conducted by McGill University confirms 
that support for separation among young Quebecers has 
drastically diminished since the 1980 referendum.
<P>
	The Liberal government is doing something about the 
concerns of that generation by creating jobs, while the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois are stuck with their outdated 
option.
<P>
	Young Quebecers are happy in Canada and they want to 
remain part of it because they know that it is the best country to 
live in. Again, we can clearly see that the separatists are totally 
disconnected from the real concerns of young people.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Michèle Fortin, Vice-President for

Montreal Board of Trade. Some of her remarks echoed concerns 
of the Bloc Quebecois about broad, varied and accessible 
television programming. In addition, she reiterated her warning 
about the cuts to Radio-Canada announced in the budget. She 
noted that the SRC is of vital importance to francophones in 
Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, having a much greater impact 
on its audiences than the CBC does on anglophone audiences.
<P>
	Now that Mr. Beatty is ready to implement the budget cuts, it 
is essential that he not lose sight, in making his decisions, of the 
performance of French television and of the success it enjoys 
with its audiences. Draconian cuts to the French network will

you cannot be a federalist and expect to keep the Bloc quebecois

that he has been an MP for 28 years, not 32.
<P>
	I guess the health minister was too busy trying to protect her

Reformers that the Liberals have such trouble with numbers. 
After all, this is the same party that gave us a massive deficit, a 
huge public debt and out of control government spending.

four days among friends and that there is not much difference 
between 28 and 32 years. Numbers are important and I have a 
few that this government should take note of.
<P>
	The national debt is $548 billion. The federal government

education and five times as much as on health. The national

Mr. Speaker, the government continues to claim that the

and Portugal have rejected the very terms of the agreement in 
principle.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans. Could the minister report on the status of negotiations 
between Canada and the European Union and tell us whether the 
problem is still the introduction of enforcement and 
conservation mechanisms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has spoken to the 
president of the EU commission. Negotiators are meeting again 
today, and conservation of the resource is a priority. Our main 
objective is to obtain an agreement with teeth on conservation 
and enforcement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada remains committed to an effective conservation 
regime. I can say to the Leader of the Opposition that we have 
negotiated in detail what we consider to be an effective 
enforcement and conservation regime. What we are waiting on 
now, as the opposition leader will know, is for the rather 
complex and difficult and may I say time-consuming workings 
and mechanics of the European Union to conclude the process at 
that end.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think we all support the efforts of the government 
and the minister, who by the way has done a very good job, to 
provide partners in the fisheries, the various countries that are 
part of this operation, with a vigourous enforcement mechanism 
to preserve the resource.
<P>
	However, that being said, what reason does the minister have 
to be optimistic that he will manage to get this kind of result, 
when two member countries of the European Union, Spain and 
Portugal, who happen to be the main parties concerned, have 
rejected the very terms of the draft agreement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has noted before and notes 
again today the clear support of the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Leader of the Opposition for the position the government has 
taken.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition gave advice to the government 
some time ago. He said it would take a mixture of firm resolve, 
firm action and diplomacy to bring about a successful 
conclusion to this dispute. That is precisely the manner in which 
the government is approaching this problem.
<P>
	I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that Canada is 
negotiating bilaterally with the European Union. The bilateral 
negotiation with the European Union has shown great progress. 
It is not yet complete but progress is made every day. A detailed 
text is now on the table. Frankly it is a matter for the European 
Union to ensure that each of the member states complies with all 
the clauses contained in the draft agreement.

and large have finished their work and have put forward a joint 
draft text. It is a text that meets the objectives of Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast. We expect the European Union to do as 
we shall do, embrace it with both arms.

problem arising from the fact that yesterday, the representative 
of the European Union made it quite clear that he could not 
conclude an agreement without the support of member countries 
Spain and Portugal?

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	By setting up the Canada social transfer as a block payment 
for health care, post-secondary education and social assistance, 
the federal government has given itself more power to impose 
national standards while continuing to reduce transfer payments 
for these programs.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that the Canada social 
transfer will allow him both to continue reducing transfer 
payments to the provinces and to tighten his grip on social 
programs under cover of the new standards being planned now 
for health care and eventually for social assistance and 
post-secondary education?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the last budget, 
we gave the federal and provincial governments a mechanism to 
tailor their deficits to their financial means. It was very clear 
that this was a joint effort, and we gave the provinces the 
requisite prior notice.
<P>
	The issue of national standards is very clear. We said in the 
budget that we were not going to abolish the Canada Health Act 
nor tamper with the issue of residency for social assistance. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development will negotiate all 
other issues with the provinces. He is going to sit down with 
them and discuss the issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, two 
things are clear. First, the Minister of Finance is cutting transfer 
payments, second, he is trying to get a stranglehold on 
provincial programs to serve his own purposes. Everybody 
agrees that this much is obvious.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Will the Minister of Finance admit that 
withdrawing his financial commitment and changing the rules 
go hand in hand? He is putting this in practice now with the 
Canada social transfer, in order to give himself the means to 
ensure compliance with current and future national standards, 
for example in the areas of health care, post-secondary 
education and social assistance.
<P>
	Will he at last reveal his intentions?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the one thing that 
is clear to me is that we have given the provinces what they 
asked for: flexibility to reduce their costs. We have given them 
the flexibility that they need to improve the management of their 
programs. Therefore, we have met the expectations of the 
provinces and of Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, three of my Reform colleagues have just returned from 
a fact finding tour of the indiscriminate logging that has taken 
place on the Stoney Reserve in Alberta.
<P>
	The member for North Island-Powell River, who has over 20 
years of forestry experience, said he has never witnessed as 
much timber cut in one place at one time.
<P>
	The minister of Indian affairs, through the Indian Act and the 
Indian timber regulations, has a legal obligation to ensure sound 
logging practices and prevent environmental disasters on 
reserves. The minister knew about the logging on this reserve 
yet did nothing to stop it.
<P>
	Why did the minister not act to prevent the destruction of the 
forest on the Stoney Reserve in Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the assertion of the Reform 
leader is incorrect. We did act. We do have someone on site. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11527"> 11527 </A></B>
<P>
have a forester there. We have  fly-overs. I went out personally 
and told the chief what I thought of what he was doing.
<P>
	We are meeting with the chiefs. I do not think what they did 
was correct. We told them so very forthrightly. If they do the 
right thing, as they do in northern Saskatchewan or at the 
National Forestry Institute that the aboriginal people have, then 
we will support them. However, when they do it incorrectly we 
are there to tell them so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I asked why the minister did not act I meant why 
does he not enforce his department's own forestry management 
plans?
<P>
	The department issued permits for 600 truckloads of logs per 
year. Since last spring, however, at least 14,000 truckloads of 
old growth forest has been harvested. Department officials knew 
of the flagrant violations of the management plan but refused to 
stop it.
<P>
	Why did the minister's officials not discharge their 
responsibilities to ensure sound logging practices on the Stoney 
Reserve in Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an under-assertion 
that these were totally aboriginal people. White cutters came to 
the native people and said: ``Here is the money, let us take your 
trees''.
<P>
	Let us talk about who these people are. They are not 
specifically aboriginal people. If you do not want to listen, fine. 
However, if you want to hear the answer I will give it to you.
<P>
	The RCMP are on the reserve investigating. I cannot get 
involved with the RCMP investigation in any way, shape or 
form. Charges may or may not be laid. However, we went in 
there with force and we do not think what was done was right.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Ever so gently, I remind members to please 
address your answers and the questions to the chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are not blaming the people on the Stoney Reserve. 
We are not blaming anyone. We are asking how come the 
department itself did not enforce its own rules.
<P>
	Through the inactions of the minister and his department, he 
has permitted the destruction of an old growth forest on the 
Stoney Reserve. Because of the federal government's apparent 
unwillingness to treat all Canadians equally with respect to 
environmental regulations, Canadians have lost trees that stood 
for centuries. This cannot be allowed to happen again.
<P>
	How does the minister intend to ensure that the forest 
management plans endorsed by his department are not only 
sound but strictly enforced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the leader of the 
Reform is talking out of both sides of his mouth.
<P>
	At his press conference when he tried to explain his policy, 
which no one understood, he said that my department has to be 
dismantled and decentralized in its function of funding transfers 
to local aboriginal agencies and governments.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> More, more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Having said that, he sent his Greek chorus 
throughout B.C. This is what the church said about what they 
have done.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	``The Anglican bishop for northern B.C. has accused the 
region's Reform MPs of breeding unnecessary fear about the 
Nishga land claim negotiations. A series of public meetings 
sponsored by Skeena MP, Mike Scott, is spreading half truths 
and anxieties among whites about the Nishga land claims''.
<P>
	``The Bishop of Caledonia, Don Hannen said that that is 
exactly what is being done here today''. It is always the Indians' 
fault, nobody else's. These are half truths.
<P>
	The Reform leader should talk to his minions and have them 
go out there and tell the truth to the people of Canada.

are interested in the truth. We speak the truth in this House.

stop funding organizations involved in public awareness of

<P>

funds provided to these organizations amount to only half of one 
per cent of the official development assistance budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):

to be made and it was decided to focus on poorer countries. In

<B><A NAME="11529"> 11529 </A></B>

that context, CIDA was right of course in deciding to stop

job.

	What we are saying is that we will not only continue to

That potential was there for what has happened on the Stoney

comparisons. We have a problem on the Stoney Reserve. I have 
been there, the police have been there and my ministry has been 
there. That problem has existed for one year.
<P>
	The member stands up in the House, with all his truckloads 
going out last week for the first time from a First Nation in his 
riding; he has probably discovered the problem.
<P>
	In B.C., where my critic sits-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> We are talking about Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> It is the same philosophy no matter where the 
Reform sits or where the Nishga sit, who have been trying to 
settle their claim on forestry for at least two decades. The 
Reform sits quietly while it represents the Nishga while a load of 
lumber leaves their territory every four minutes. Yet my critic 
and the Reform remain silent. I have been there and I am doing 
something about it. Maybe the Reform should do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after a year of this happening and the minister having 
had lots of time to look into it, could he assure us this is not 
happening anywhere else?

	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	All Canadians want to ensure their tax dollars are used in a 
responsible way. Many complained that last minute shopping 
spree by departments at the end of the fiscal year should be 
monitored and controlled.
<P>
	Can the minister outline what Treasury Board has done to put 
an end to the March madness spending binge?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I share the hon. member's concern about year end 
spending and so did the Auditor General of Canada in his two 
reports in the 1980s in which that issue was raised.
<P>
	The Auditor General did not raise the issue in the sense that he 
criticized what the money was being spent on, as he said the 
purposes were well defined, but that there was a lot of spending 
toward the end of the year and we needed better cash 
management practices.
<P>
	I am pleased to say we have instituted a 5 per cent operating 
budget carry forward for departments so they do not get into that 
year end spending spree. Furthermore, I have written my 
colleagues in the ministry and my deputy minister has written 
his counterparts to help ensure the procedure to cut out the year 
end spending rush is followed.
<P>
	We have asked for audits of each of the departments and have 
asked that they be submitted by June 30 of this year so we can 
get better control of the cash management of taxpayers money.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	This morning, Immigration officials were to deport another 
family of Romanian refugees, the family of Carmen and 
Alexandru Dima. This family, well integrated into Quebec 
society, had appealed, as a last resort, to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration to intervene.
<P>
	How can the minister justify his refusal to intervene on behalf 
of the Dima family, which had adjusted very well to life in 
Quebec, when he has intervened in other cases of families that 
could remain in Canada and have become well integrated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member needs to 
become familiar with the immigration system and with the 
Canada-Quebec accord, because we determined that these 
individuals were not refugees. They had access to the best 
system in the world.
<P>
	Mr. Dima appealed and applied on compassionate and 
humanitarian grounds to the department. We said there were no 
special circumstances precluding their return to Romania.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is up to the Province of Quebec to establish 
independent immigration. I had declared that the individuals 
were not refugees. We cannot allow everyone denied refugee 
status to be accepted as immigrants. Last year, 3,000 Romanians 
immigrated to Canada under the usual immigration process.

<P>
	They have a moral responsibility, but this minister has a legal

suggest that the minister's department has shown gross

question is directed to the Minister of Health, who will know by 
media reports this morning that the Conservative government in 
Alberta has indicated that it is going to be asking for 
amendments to the Canada Health Act to allow for private 
hospitals and that the premier of Alberta is supporting a two-tier 
health care system.
<P>
	She will also know that his supporters voted on the weekend 
to free abandoned hospitals for the private sector.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Health has cut back so severely in terms 
of health care payments to the provinces, how on earth could she 
do anything to stop this erosion of medicare and health care in 
Canada that we have known over the last number of decades?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have repeated and repeated that we are going to 
ensure a healthy health care system by maintaining the 
principles of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	There is not one commission that has been called for across 
this country that has said that more money is needed. The B.C. 
Royal Commission on Health Care and Costs said it is more 
management that is needed, not more money.
<P>
	We know that the premier of Alberta is advancing different 
propositions, and we will respond as we get these propositions.
<P>
	Let me remind absolutely everyone here that the health care 
system does not become more affordable just by moving 
budgets, dollars and costs from the public sector to the private 
sector. It certainly does not and we will not allow that to happen.

Act (registration of political parties).
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a private 
member's bill entitled an act to amend the Canada Elections 
Act.
<P>
	The intention of the bill is threefold. First, this bill amends the 
Canada Elections Act to allow registration of a political party by 
the Chief Electoral Officer when the party nominates candidates 
in at least 12 electoral districts throughout the country. This is 
down from a present requirement of 50 electoral districts.
<P>
	Under the present act, the Chief Electoral Officer must 
de-register a party that does not meet the conditions set out in 
subsection 28(2) of the act. Formerly, it was at the discretion of 
the Chief Electoral Officer to de-register a party that failed to 
meet these conditions.
<P>
	Second, the bill removes the obligation placed on the chief 
agent of a political party to liquidate the assets of that party 
when it is deleted from the registry of political parties by the 
Chief Electoral Officer of Canada.
<P>
	Finally, the bill lowers the amount required for deposit with 
the returning officer at the same time the nomination papers are 
filed.
<P>
	This bill has received widespread support throughout Canada. 
I would invite all members of this House to support this 
important democratic initiative.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FIREARMSACT">FIREARMS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 28 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other 
weapons, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> When Bill C-68 was last before the House, the 
hon. member for Medicine Hat had seven minutes remaining for 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
unfortunate that I cannot give the speech I wanted to give today 
because the government has just invoked a form of closure, 
something that its members spoke out against very strongly in 
the last Parliament. I am going to speak out against that very 
thing right now.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Canadians feel very strongly about the whole issue of gun 
control. In particular, many people across the country are 
opposed to the whole idea of registration.
<P>
	In my judgment, this is an extremely cynical and political 
move. Just before a break when MPs are going back to their 
ridings to consult with their constituents, the government 
invokes a form of closure. This prevents Canadians from having 
the full input and type of discussion they should have on an issue 
which is so important to them. The government is playing 
politics with this issue and I want to speak about that in a larger 
context right now.
<P>
	As I mentioned, people feel very strongly about this issue. 
The country in many respects is split along rural and urban lines. 
I can see this whole issue being extremely divisive down the 
road if it is not handled properly.
<P>
	That is why Reform has offered a very good reasoned 
amendment to split the bill in two. It would give people a chance 
to vote on the proposals that would bring in tougher sentences 
for crimes committed with the illegal use of firearms. That is 
something many Canadians agree with.
<P>
	Where people differ from the government is on the whole idea 
of registration. If the government was going to be absolutely fair 
about this, it would recognize that there are two separate issues 
here and Canadians should have a right to vote on them 
separately.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about the whole process leading up 
to where we are today. As a starting point, before the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11540"> 11540 </A></B>
<P>
ment brings forward a piece of legislation which is so 
controversial and about which people care very deeply, I believe 
it is reasonable that the onus be put on the government to explain 
where the  evidence is that points to registration being an 
effective way to curb crime.
<P>
	We have asked many questions in this House on that issue. We 
have asked the justice minister on several occasions for the 
evidence. All he could do, as people would say when talking in a 
logic class, was make an appeal to authority, a false argument, 
that the police chiefs say it is a good thing to do, but there is no 
evidence. We have made that point over and over again. That is a 
very cynical move.
<P>
	It is also very cynical how the whole consultation process was 
carried out. The minister did have some meetings with some 
groups over the course of the summer, which is great. However, 
when these meetings occur certainly there has to be some room 
for compromise. We cannot go in there with the attitude that we 
are not going to bend at all.
<P>
	It got worse than that. After a while the meetings were by 
invitation. That is very cynical. People wanted to have a say but 
the minister said: ``No, some people cannot come into these 
meetings because we want to make sure that things go our way''. 
After that there is this omnibus legislation where the 
government tries to sell the good with the bad. Again, that is 
very cynical and very political and we absolutely disagree with 
that.
<P>
	The final straw is time allocation right before a break. In this 
place, of all places, we should be talking about very important 
issues and MPs should be free to go back and talk about these 
things before they are set in stone. Unfortunately, members have 
been denied that opportunity because the government has 
invoked a form of closure.
<P>
	We have spoken out time and time again on this issue. We 
have asked the government to produce the evidence that this will 
have an effect on crime. We have said that if it could produce the 
evidence it would have our support. However, the government 
cannot so we will not support it. That concludes my remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to support this bill today.
<P>
	This bill represents the culmination of one of the points in the 
red book. I want to quote from the red book in this connection: 
``In order to combat crime, a Liberal government will work in a 
broad range of areas. To strengthen gun control, a Liberal 
government will, among other measures, counter the illegal 
importation of banned and restricted firearms into Canada and 
prohibit anyone convicted of an indictable drug related offence, 
stalking offence or any violent crime from owning or possessing 
a gun''. That promise was included in the red book. That 
promise is being kept by this legislation today.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	It is that legislation the Reform Party is trying to destroy with 
this phoney amendment which it put before the House today. 
Reform members have run across the country misleading 
Canadians, telling Canadians that the amendment splits the bill. 
That assertion is totally and completely false.
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River has been away. However, 
she will have heard these false statements which are being made 
by her colleagues as to the effect of this amendment across the 
country. I know if she gets to speak later this afternoon, she will 
want to dissociate herself from those comments.
<P>
	With respect to the bill, first I would like to deal with the 
allegations made by the hon. member for Medicine Hat about 
the use of time allocation in the debate this afternoon.
<P>
	We have asked repeatedly for assistance in dealing with the 
bill. We have offered to sit late in the evenings in order to 
accommodate members who wish to participate in the debate. 
Those offers were declined, politely but emphatically, by the 
members of the Reform Party. So we need not concern ourselves 
about their genuine desire to debate the bill.
<P>
	They are shedding crocodile tears this afternoon, alleging that 
they are having their debate cut off, but let me review the record. 
The bill was debated in the House on February 16 and February 
27, March 13, March 27 and March 28 for a total debating time 
according to the official record of 17 hours and 46 minutes. 
Eighty-four persons participated in the debate before today. I 
am number 85.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That shows how much interest there is in it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says that shows how much 
interest there is in it. It shows that a filibuster has been mounted 
by the Reform Party.
<P>
	If we look at the number of speakers, 35 Liberals, 12 Bloc 
members, 34 Reformers, two New Democrats and one 
Progressive Conservative have participated in the debate so far. 
In other words, the Reformers have had almost every member 
speak, while on the Liberal side, despite the significant 
differences of view on this side, only 35 have managed to 
participate in the debate. This is nothing but a filibuster. The 
Reform Party is engaging in filibuster tactics and the 
government is taking a very sensible approach in bringing the 
debate to an end. The government is putting the Reform Party 
out of its misery.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11541"> 11541 </A></B>
<P>
	So much for the argument about unfairness. The Reform 
Party has been offered an extra opportunity to debate this bill 
and it has consistently turned it down. The reason is that it 
wants the government to use closure. The Reform Party wants 
the government to bring an end to the debate so that it can get 
off the hook with respect to its rather ridiculous opposition to 
the bill.
<P>
	The hon. member for Medicine Hat and dozens of other 
members from that party in particular have gone after the bill 
saying that there is no evidence that the proposals which the 
government has put forward will do anything to stop crime. I 
have some evidence and I would like to quote the evidence for 
hon. members, particularly those in the Reform Party and some 
doubting Thomases elsewhere in the House.
<P>
	The proposal that the Minister of Justice has so courageously 
put forward, in spite of consistent and persistent opposition 
from Reformers and other people in the country, is based in part 
on our promise in the red book. It is supported very amply by the 
Canadian Police Association, whose members, after all, are 
experts in law enforcement. These are the people who enforce 
the Criminal Code across our country, yet members of the 
Reform Party trumpet themselves as experts on law 
enforcement. Most of them do not know a fig about law 
enforcement. They do not know anything about the subject, yet 
they rant and rave in the House all day that they want evidence.
<P>
	I invite them to listen to the evidence of the president of the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. This gentleman, Mr. 
Vincent MacDonald, made certain statements after his 
association at its annual conference last August called for the 
following: stiffer penalties for firearms misuse; a ban on 
military assault rifles and replica firearms; registration of all 
firearms; controls on the sale of ammunition; and full cost 
recovery. Those were the five items called for by the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police at its convention in August 
1994. These are the principal frontline law enforcers in Canada 
and that is what they called for.
<P>
	The hon. members in the Reform Party ignore these 
suggestions and all of them are found in the bill of the Minister 
of Justice which is before the House today. If they supported law 
enforcement in Canada, they would be supporting this bill. They 
are frauds in that connection.
<P>
	The president of the association said: ``We must emphasize 
that while it is, perhaps, controversial, we view registration of 
all firearms as pivotal to the entire package, critical to 
controlling the illegal gun trade, to supporting preventative 
action and to enforcing the law''. There is evidence that this will 
work.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	On February 24, 1995 Chief MacDonald said: ``Registration 
of firearms will help control smuggling, gun theft and the 
misuse of legal firearms in a number of important ways''. This is 
from an expert in the law  enforcement field. Surely, members of 
the Reform Party would bow to the ability and competence of 
the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police 
and the collective wisdom of that body all of whom support this 
bill and believe that this bill is the right way to go.
<P>
	I want to quote another statement from Chief MacDonald. He 
said: ``As the U.S. example has shown all too well, arming for 
self-protection does not work but in fact escalates violence. For 
this reason, we believe Canada has a historic opportunity to 
chart a course that is different from the U.S. This legislation not 
only goes a long way to address current problems, but is an 
investment in our future''. That is what the chief said; I submit 
that he was right.
<P>
	If that is not enough to convince members of this House that 
this is the right way to go, one has only to look at the polls that 
have been conducted on this subject. I turn to the Environics poll 
of October 1994. Ninety per cent of Canadians supported a law 
requiring all firearms to be registered. In Quebec the figure was 
95 per cent; Ontario, 92 per cent; British Columbia, 88 per cent; 
Alberta, 83 per cent.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party are forever boasting that they 
represent the wishes of their constituents. That is a false 
assertion. These members have no more interest in the wishes of 
their constituents than the man in the moon has.
<P>
	The Reform member for Edmonton stood in this House and 
admitted that his own constituents in his own poll were 69 per 
cent in favour of the government bill. Yet he said: ``I do not care 
what they say, I could not care less what they say. I am voting 
against it because, by George, I know better''. Every member of 
the Reform Party is spouting the same stuff and nonsense. They 
may not use the same words. They cloak themselves in 
righteousness and say: ``Oh, no. We are opposing this for good 
reason''. But they know that their constituents support this bill. 
They know they would support it in overwhelming numbers.
<P>
	If Reform members were doing what they say they always do, 
supporting and representing their constituents' interests, they 
would stand up and vote for this bill in droves. They would all 
show up. They would not pull that six and seven out of a total of 
50 in the House which they pulled a weekend ago. They would 
all be here voting for this bill. Instead, all we hear is their 
ranting and raving and complaining about this government 
action on the bill and the very sensible proposals the Minister of 
Justice has put forward in this case.
<P>
	I recognize there are deeply held views on this bill which 
represent significant differences of opinion on this subject. I can 
only say that the government has acted in the very best interests 
of Canadians in bringing this bill forward. It has brought 
forward a bill that is supported by the vast majority of the 
population in every region of the country. It has brought forward 
a bill that has been  called for by the law enforcement experts, 
who more than any other in Canada know what is required to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11542"> 11542 </A></B>
<P>
deal with smuggling and illegal arms dealings and all manner of 
problems with guns.
<P>
	This is a sensible bill. I realize there are going to be some 
changes made in committee. The minister has already 
acknowledged that he is willing to agree to certain changes to 
the bill in committee which will improve the bill.
<P>
	The hon. member yaks about confiscation. He knows that 
when talking about confiscation he is only trying to stir up 
support for his party. He knows that at gun rallies he has been out 
selling Reform memberships in an effort to boost the sagging 
fortunes of the Reform Party. It is a shocking way to carry on.
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River has missed some of the 
antics which have taken place in this House. I am sorry she did. 
She would have been ashamed of the conduct of most of her 
colleagues had she been here to watch the debate. I am glad she 
is back and I hope she will talk some sense to her colleagues 
because honestly, they need a good deal of it.
<P>
	The fact is this is a good bill. It has garnered widespread 
support in the country. The Minister of Justice has proven time 
and again that he is willing to talk and be reasonable and flexible 
in respect of this bill. No minister has spent more time travelling 
the country seeking the views of Canadians than has the 
Minister of Justice. He has brought forward a bill-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> He is not listening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says he is not listening. He is 
not listening to them, that is for sure, because they do not 
represent anybody. They represent a small minority of people.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	The vast majority of people support what the minister is 
doing. If the members of the Reform Party would look at the 
polls that their own member conducted and look at the national 
polls that have been conducted on this scheme, they would agree 
with everything I am saying, because they know I am right.
<P>
	As I said, the Minister of Justice has indicated his willingness 
to make changes in this legislation. He has indicated that in 
committee he will listen to reasoned arguments. The committee 
is set up and ready to deal with this matter. It is prepared to hear 
a large number of witnesses. Indeed, the budget for the 
committee for the hearing of a substantial number of witnesses 
has already gone forward and is being considered by the budget 
subcommittee of the liaison committee.
<P>
	I think this bill will be dealt with fairly. The owners of guns 
who have not yet had an opportunity to make their views known 
to the minister and to the Canadian public will have that 
opportunity before the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Every one of them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> There will be ample opportunity there. There 
will be another debate in this House on third reading.
<P>
	Of course, now we have the NDP getting into the act. This is 
the party that for decades has supported gun control and now all 
their members but one have shifted gears and gone backwards. 
They have all decided that this bill is not really what they 
wanted, even though it was in their party platform. They used to 
say they were bound by party conventions. Now they say they 
are not bound by party conventions; they are not bound by the 
obligations laid down at party conventions that have been set on 
their caucus.
<P>
	Only the member for Beaver River will remember this. We 
used to listen in this House to the pontificating from the NDP 
about how they were so democratic; they did everything their 
party dictated. Now, today, we see them abandoning party 
principles; they have gone out the window. I do not think the 
NDP knows what a party principle is any more.
<P>
	It is a most shameful abnegation of its responsibility to its 
members, because the members of the NDP in my constituency 
are strongly supporting the Minister of Justice in this gun 
control bill. They think their members of Parliament have gone 
wingy. I think they may be right. Things have really gone wrong 
over there. Only the member for Burnaby-Kingsway seems to 
have kept his head straight on his shoulders.
<P>
	The hon. members of the Reform Party, who are supposed to 
represent their constituents, should be with the NDP on this one. 
It is unbelievable. I cannot understand how it is that two 
supposedly responsible political parties in this country could 
take such an irresponsible attitude in respect of such a 
significant matter of public debate.
<P>
	We have had ample opportunity for debate on this subject for 
the last year. It has been debated in Parliament longer than any 
other bill in this Parliament already. The time for decision-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> It has only been here for two 
months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> We have been here for well over a year. The 
hon. member for Calgary West is saying it has only been a few 
months. He knows perfectly well that is not true.
<P>
	We have been sitting here since February 1994. That is well 
over a year. That is a good long time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11543"> 11543 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> When did you table the bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> January.
<P>
	The hon. member has had ample opportunity to discuss this 
matter. They have had opposition days when they could raise 
this issue if they wanted to; yet we have not seen it then.
<P>
	We have offered to sit at night. The hon. member does not 
want to do that either. Why? Because he wants to have days and 
days of filibuster and hold this bill up until next year or the year 
after.
<P>
	The government is decisive. The government made promises 
in the red book. The government made promises to the people of 
Canada when it introduced this bill. The government knows how 
to govern. It will show leadership to Canadians and it will 
proceed with this bill. It will do a great job in enacting 
legislation that will help reduce crime in Canada and help to 
solve the problems confronting this country in a way that is 
meaningful and sensible, instead of the ranting, pillaging and 
raving the Reform Party is engaging in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to participate in the debate on the 
government's gun control legislation, in particular to support 
the Reform amendment that the bill be split into two parts, each 
to be voted on separately.
<P>
	In doing so I wish to vehemently protest the restrictions the 
government has placed on this debate in order to rush the bill 
through Parliament. It strikes me as supremely ironic that a 
government that seems incapable of imposing any kind of 
discipline on the criminal elements in society has no hesitancy 
about imposing a strict discipline on its own caucus and on the 
debates of this House.
<P>
	For more than five years Reformers have been criss-crossing 
this country asking the question, what do Canadians want and, in 
particular, what kind of country do Canadians want for 
themselves and for their children as we approach the 21st 
century. One of the most frequent answers we get to that 
question is that Canadians want safe streets, safe homes and safe 
communities.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	This was expressed to me very eloquently several years ago at 
a meeting in Toronto when in response to my questions, what do 
Canadians want, a man in the audience got up and said the 
following. He said: ``Do you know what I want? I want my wife 
to be able to leave this hotel at 10 p.m. and go to our car in the 
parkade a block away without running the risk of being mugged, 
robbed or assaulted. I want the state to discharge the most 
elemental of its responsibilities, namely, its responsibility to 
protect the life and property of its citizens. I want to live in a 
country where the rights and security of law-abiding citizens 
and innocent victims of  crime take precedence in criminal law 
and the Constitution over the rights and security of criminals.''
<P>
	There are not many MPs in this House who would disagree 
that increasing public safety must be a priority of this 
Parliament. The disagreements among us arise over what is the 
best way to achieve that result.
<P>
	With respect to Bill C-68 and the motion to split it, the key 
question is this. What role does gun control have to play in 
making Canada a safer place? Two different answers to this 
question are being given in the 35th Parliament: the Reform 
position and the Liberal position. Canadians must decide which 
position maximizes public safety.
<P>
	The Reform position, which has been stated eloquently by my 
colleagues, is that gun control will only contribute to public 
safety if its primary focus is on the criminal use of firearms. The 
diversion of police attention and financial resources into 
excessive regulation of the non-criminal use of firearms will 
not enhance public safety. Canadian voters are telling 
Reformers and pollsters that their number one priority for 
justice is strong action directed toward persons who commit 
violent criminal acts. Based on this position, Reform MPs have 
taken the lead in proposing measures to tighten up the regulation 
of the criminal use of firearms.
<P>
	These measures include the following: implement a zero 
tolerance policy for criminal offences involving firearms; 
ensure that charges are laid in all firearms crimes and that plea 
bargains are not permitted; impose mandatory one-year 
minimum jail sentences for using any weapon in the commission 
of a violent crime; provide for progressively more severe 
penalties for repeat violent and firearms offenders; ensure that 
all sentences for violent crime and firearms convictions are 
served consecutively; provide for lifetime prohibitions from 
ownership of firearms for all persons convicted of violent 
crimes; impose the same penalty for the use of a replica firearm 
as for using a real gun in a violent offence; create a new offence 
of theft of a firearm sentence three to fourteen years; impose 
sentences of three to fourteen years for unlawful importation or 
illegal sale of a firearm for a criminal use; deem the seller of a 
firearm to a criminal as having aided in any future crime 
committed; and transfer young offenders to adult court for using 
firearms in the commission of an offence.
<P>
	In short, the Reform Party is opposed to gun controls that are 
not cost effective in reducing violent crime, improving public 
safety and saving lives, and would repeal any gun control 
provisions that are not cost effective in reducing violent crime, 
improving public safety and saving lives.
<P>
	The position that the Liberal government has taken on gun 
control is utterly predictable and typical of Liberals. If one 
comes to a hard choice between two options, in this case 
focusing scarce resources on regulating the criminal or non--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11544"> 11544 </A></B>
<P>
criminal use of firearms, the Liberals invariably say: ``Do both, 
even if doing one hurts the  other''. They are following the 
advice of that great American philosopher Yogi Berra, who said: 
``If you come to a fork in the road, take it''.
<P>
	So the justice minister has brought forward this Bill C-68-<I>C</I> 
stands for compromise-20 per cent of it, under pressure from 
Reformers, contains partial measures for tightening up the 
criminal use of firearms, but 80 per cent of it focuses on 
increased regulation of the non-criminal use of firearms for 
hunting, recreational and collection purposes, including the 
establishment of a universal, national firearms registry reputed 
to cost anywhere from $85 million to $500 million. One reason 
for this wild variance in the cost estimates is because the Liberal 
government underestimates the number of firearms in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	In 1976 a Department of Justice document estimated the 
number of firearms in Canada at 10 million, with about a quarter 
of a million guns being added to the stock each year. Using this 
estimate there should now be over 15 million firearms in 
Canada, but the justice minister says there are now only 6 
million or 7 million guns in Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-68 cannot be effectively evaluated or costed out unless 
and until the justice minister can explain where the other 8 
million or 9 million guns went.
<P>
	Reformers oppose the major portion of this bill for three 
reasons. First, the registry will not be universal. The criminals 
in whose hands firearms are a huge threat to public safety will 
unfortunately decline to register. The minister cannot 
understand why not. He will send polite letters to the Mafia and 
ads will be placed in the smuggler and gun runners digests, 
saying ``Please, fill out these forms in triplicate in either official 
language and take them to the police''. In the end the registry 
will omit the one group in whose hands firearms are most 
dangerous.
<P>
	Second, the cost of implementing this bill will be far greater 
than what the minister says. Liberal cabinet ministers are 
notoriously inept at estimating cost. That is why the federal debt 
is almost $550 billion and the government will spend $35 billion 
more this year than it takes in.
<P>
	The Reform caucus has developed a table of multipliers to 
help determine the real cost of any new proposal put forward by 
a Liberal cabinet minister. The more soft-headed the minister, 
the higher the multiplier.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development, for 
example, is a 10. If he says something might cost $100 million, 
we multiply it by 10 because the real cost will be closer to $1 
billion. The justice minister is not far behind. He is a 7. When he 
says his registry will cost $85 million, we multiply it by 7 and 
the true cost will be over $500 million, which is $500 million 
that we do not have.
<P>
	The third and most important reason for opposing Bill C-68 
as it is now is that the proposed national registry of firearms for 
hunting, recreational and collection purposes will not improve 
public safety. The present handgun registry, which has been in 
place for 60 years, has not improved public safety. The 
Washington, D.C. handgun ban and registry has not prevented 
murder and rape in that city from going out of sight. The police 
in both New Zealand and Australia have recommended 
abandoning their costly and ineffective gun registries for 
precisely this reason.
<P>
	Despite repeated invitations to do so, the minister has put 
forward no evidence that his proposed registry will improve 
public safety, nor has he even proposed public safety measuring 
sticks against which the performance of the registry can be 
measured.
<P>
	In conclusion, if what Canadians want are safer streets, safer 
homes and safer communities, if public safety is really our aim, 
then Bill C-68 should be split, as the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville has proposed. The ineffective national 
registration part should be defeated. The sections tightening up 
the criminal use of firearms should be strengthened and passed 
forthwith. This is the course of action that will truly make 
Canada a safer place to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak on second reading of Bill 
C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons. In 
particular, I welcome the opportunity to speak to some of the 
points raised a moment ago by the leader of the third party. I will 
come to that in a moment.
<P>
	This is an extremely important discussion, and strong feelings 
are being expressed by all sides in the House and by many 
Canadians.
<P>
	Approval of second reading will in fact send this bill to 
committee for discussion and amendment, and then the bill will 
come back to the House for a final decision and we will all know 
what the facts are surrounding the bill.
<P>
	What happens at committee will be extremely important in 
relation to concerns that Canadians are raising and the concerns 
that I have expressed with regard to this bill.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Constituents have raised their concerns with me with respect 
to their views on Bill C-68 and I have expressed them to 
members of my party. They also point out that they support 
certain measures in the bill to control crime, promote public 
health and safety and to impose stiff mandatory minimum jail 
sentences for a range of gun offences. There is strong support for 
that among my constituents.
<P>
	My constituents also agree that the government should enact 
measures to strengthen border controls and amend the Criminal 
Code to address the problems of smuggling and the illegal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11545"> 11545 </A></B>
<P>
importation of firearms. Let me relate two  of the four principles 
of the Firearms Act they strongly support.
<P>
	I will come to splitting the bill in a moment. The splitting of 
the bill that the Reform Party talks about is nothing but 
misleading the public on the real intent of their amendment. The 
leader of the Reform Party stood up a moment ago and talked 
about moving toward safety measures. He had some good 
suggestions, I will admit, but the real intent of the amendment 
put forward by the Reform Party is not to split the bill but to 
destroy it. The good suggestions that the Reform Party leader 
talked about will not be put in the bill because the bill would be 
gone if we went ahead with the amendment.
<P>
	Let me come back for a moment to the principles that have 
strong support in this bill. The criminal misuse of firearms will 
be dealt with through amendments to offence and sentencing 
provisions of the Criminal Code, including mandatory 
four-year minimum sentences for 10 specific violent offences 
committed while in the possession of a firearm. That is a good 
point.
<P>
	The 10 offences are attempted murder, manslaughter, 
criminal negligence causing death, robbery, kidnapping, 
hostage taking, sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual 
assault, extortion and the discharging of a firearm with intent to 
cause harm. Upon conviction, the offender will receive a 
lifetime prohibition against possession of a restricted or a 
prohibited firearm.
<P>
	The second major important principle that there is strong 
agreement on is smuggling and illegal importation. Smuggling 
and illegal importations will be dealt with through legislative 
amendments and the development of programs for controlling 
the import-export and domestic transit of firearms, including 
border registration and new Criminal Code offences for illegally 
importing and trafficking in firearms. Those are good principles 
and I and many others in the House support them.
<P>
	I will admit other aspects of the bill are much more 
controversial. They relate to the impact on legitimate gun 
owners, hunters, collectors and sports people using firearms. I 
have previously presented a petition on behalf of my 
constituents opposing the bill as currently drafted.
<P>
	Let me go back to the points I raised then. The petition called 
on Parliament to ``desist from passing additional restrictive 
legislation with respect to firearms or ammunition and to direct 
its attention to the apprehension and adequate punishment of 
those who criminally misuse firearms or other deadly 
weapons''.
<P>
	My constituents feel very strongly that the bill would not 
accomplish what the minister intended as currently drafted. 
They are concerned that law-abiding Canadians are already 
overburdened by unnecessary and ineffective gun legislation. 
They believe that the new proposals as currently drafted with the 
introduction of mandatory gun registration would punish the 
wrong people. Many of my constituents and other Islanders have 
concerns with this legislation.
<P>
	I tabled that position and raised those concerns. Now I want to 
see that my constituents have the opportunity to go before a 
committee in the proper forum to express those concerns 
themselves or through their national organizations. I do not want 
it to be the same as what we have been seeing in the past where 
the Reform Party is using misleading amendments and holding 
meetings across the country for political reasons.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	The party talks about crime. Every day its members stand in 
the House and say they are concerned about crime. The effect of 
their amendment would, in fact, destroy the opportunity of the 
bill going to committee and seeing that crime is controlled, 
including the misuse of firearms.
<P>
	This is how misunderstood the Reform Party amendment is. 
Some of my constituents have suggested to me that I should 
support splitting the bill, believing that the Reform Party 
amendment will do that. It will not.
<P>
	I listened closely to the leader of the third party. In his speech 
he went through a litany of suggestions to improve public safety. 
The amendment destroys that opportunity. I would suggest that 
the leader of the Reform Party re-read the amendment. Allow 
me to take a moment to emphasize to the leader of the third party 
what the amendment states: ``this House declines to give second 
reading to Bill C-68''. That would have the effect of destroying 
the bill. They know it. They are misleading the Canadian public. 
For the party that talks about crime control, it would have the 
opposite effect.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to see changes to the bill. Those changes 
can be made in committee. I suggest that the process is not all 
that it could have been; however, we have a bill before us that 
must be improved.
<P>
	In discussions I have had with fellow MPs and the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, I feel I have 
been given assurance that the bill will be decriminalized with 
respect to legitimate gun owners, collectors, sports people and 
hunters, at least on their first offence. With that assurance, I am 
willing to support the bill going to committee to be improved so 
that it meets the needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	I am really disgusted that the Reform Party has tried to turn 
this, by its amendment, into a political game. However I guess 
that is life in the world of politics. Reformers are misleading 
Canadians as to where they really want to go.
<P>
	By this bill going to committee it will give Canadians the 
chance to voice their concerns in a public forum, before a 
legitimate committee, so that the bill can be improved to meet 
the needs of all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11546"> 11546 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be recognized but not very happy 
to be speaking at second reading stage of Bill C-68, the federal 
government's ill-conceived firearms control legislation.
<P>
	I am especially not happy to be here speaking today now that 
the government has invoked closure on the bill. It has cut off 
debate in the House so the parliamentarians who have been 
talking to their constituents about the bill will not now have a 
chance to share all they have heard in their constituencies with 
other members of Parliament and, more important, with the 
Minister of Justice and his cabinet colleagues. Shutting off 
debate on the bill at this point is quite a shameful act. First, the 
government restricted access to the bill and now it is restricting 
debate.
<P>
	I have listened carefully to much of the debate since the 
legislation was introduced. As emotional as it has been at times, 
there has been much said that is worthy of note. I hope the 
minister has been listening with a mind which will accept 
change. Unfortunately I find that the minister, like many 
Canadians, simply accepts the idea of firearms control as an end 
in itself.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	The legislation addresses firearms control. Therefore the 
minister seems to be saying, for that reason alone it is worthy of 
support. It does not matter if this is a good bill, a bad bill or an 
inadequate bill. It should be worthy of support simply because it 
deals with gun control. We are all supposed to stand up and 
support it because of the premise. Whether it addresses all the 
problems facing Canadians and their personal insecurities does 
not seem to be relevant in the debate.
<P>
	I believe these matters are relevant and I want to look at some 
of them today. I have heard many stories told in this Chamber 
over the past weeks, personal stories and quoted newspaper 
accounts of stories affecting people in various communities 
throughout North America. Each of these stories is told to gain 
support for the legislation. The stories are about individual 
tragedies of friends, relatives or people whose names appear in 
the paper because of some firearms accident or wilful event.
<P>
	If one listens closely and reads between the lines, these stories 
are telling us that if we want to prevent the personal tragedies 
outlined, we must get rid of firearms and not register them.
<P>
	The people who raised those stories in Parliament and the 
minister know that getting rid of firearms is not an option in the 
legislation before us today. For all intents and purposes the 
illustrative stories that have been brought to the debate, as 
important as they are to the individuals affected, are diverting 
attention from the real debate in front of us. The tragedies that 
they represent-and tragedies they are-can occur just as easily 
with a registered firearm as an unregistered one.
<P>
	There is not enough time for me today, in 10 minutes, to 
outline everything that the legislation does. I will support the 
amendment before us which splits the bill into two parts because 
a good argument can be made for debating the two issues 
separately. My complaint with the legislation is the registration 
and the way in which it is being presented to the Canadian public 
by the government.
<P>
	The universal registration of firearms is being presented for 
something that it is not. Persons with legitimate and legal uses 
for their firearms are being asked to pay for this misadvertised 
purpose.
<P>
	The government is telling Canadians that if all firearms are 
registered they can feel safer and have more security in their 
homes. They can feel safer and more secure on the streets. This 
is simply not true. Peddling false hope while doing absolutely 
nothing else to alleviate the fears of the Canadian public or to 
attack the root causes of crime and violence in our society is 
practically dishonest.
<P>
	As members know, I believe in gun safety. Just because I do 
not support the legislation of the Minister of Justice, I have been 
criticized for not supporting firearm safety. Members will 
remember that this was one of the reasons why I supported the 
previous government's legislation on firearms. I supported that 
legislation against the wishes of many of my vocal constituents 
because it dealt with firearm safety. Today many of those who 
criticized me in the past have agreed that the safety course being 
offered is a good one, that the safe storage, handling and 
transportation regulations contained in that legislation were 
reasonable.
<P>
	Bill C-68, the registration provisions in the legislation in 
front of us today do nothing to enhance or improve on the 
existing safety provisions already in place. The new legislation 
should not be promoted as if it does. Also, we must reduce the 
amount of violent death and injury. We as a nation must confront 
this issue from all sides, including its social and economic roots.
<P>
	Bill C-68 and its registration provisions by themselves will 
do nothing to reduce violent injury, death or suicide for that 
matter. If as a nation we are serious about suicide, spousal 
violence or criminal street violence we have to do much more 
than talk about creating a registry.
<P>
	We have to do all that we can to reduce suicides and homicides 
but as everyone in this Chamber knows, these suicides and 
homicides will occur with registered legal firearms as well 
unless other social and economic issues are dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Members of the Chamber will recall, because it was released a 
few weeks ago, that the royal commission on aboriginal peoples 
released a report on suicide among aboriginal people, particu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11547"> 11547 </A></B>
<P>
larly among aboriginal youth. To date the federal government 
has done virtually nothing to respond to the recommendations in 
this important and crucial report. The report indicated this  issue 
has been before the government for more than 10 years.
<P>
	If the federal government were truly interested in dealing with 
the issue of youth suicide it would respond in the affirmative to 
the recommendation of the royal commission report 
immediately.
<P>
	It is a bit surprising the government says firearms registration 
is critical to the reduction of suicide and violence and yet at the 
same time is proposing a delay in the full registration process 
until the year 2003. Surely if the government were serious about 
this false contention and about the issue, if registration were 
actually important to the reduction of suicide and violence, 
would it not make compulsory registration immediate?
<P>
	Why wait eight years if this is so important? The answer is 
simple. There is no evidence to support the government's 
claims. Registration is not important to the reduction of suicide 
and violence, and the government knows it.
<P>
	I also support the police dealing with real criminals in our 
society. I have no trouble accepting the argument that those who 
commit crimes against the rest of society must be sought out, 
convicted and punished. However, I must remind the House and 
the minister that every police officer from northwest 
Saskatchewan I have spoken to and all the police officers I deal 
with on a regular basis in my own constituency tell me 
registration is not the answer for them.
<P>
	When they are called to a domestic dispute or a location where 
they are uncertain what they might find when they arrive, they 
already assume every home they visit has a firearm. They 
already take no chances when they visit a scene. The bill gives 
them no additional security in this regard.
<P>
	The police tell me that anyone who will shoot them is as likely 
to use an illegal weapon as a registered firearm. The police in 
northwest Saskatchewan tell me they need more time in the 
field, better support services and more sustained opportunity to 
work on preventative community strategies. There is a need to 
work on programs that will help them prevent violence rather 
than programs that respond only once violence has been 
committed. The bill and government comments to that effect 
offer no hope that this is being contemplated by the government.
<P>
	If I had more time today I would happily put more concerns on 
the record. Fortunately a few members in the House have 
already begun to do so. Rather, I stress I remain critical of this 
legislation. I am critical because the Liberals have set out an 
agenda that they say will deal with safety and security and they 
are asking the residents of my constituency who happen to own 
legal and useful firearms to pay for them through the 
registration system.
<P>
	The government is doing this without offering any evidence 
that any part of its plan will work any better than existing rules 
which have not yet been fully evaluated. I find this wrong and to 
a certain extent shameful politics.
<P>
	I have already demonstrated that I do support firearms control 
measures that have a real and meaningful impact on our nation 
and its citizens. As I said earlier, while there is a role for 
legitimate critique of Bill C-68 and the critique of the false hope 
the Liberals are setting up with its passage, I trust the nation, the 
House and especially the minister will not only allow room for 
that critique to be articulated but also will take it to heart.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the bill today. It is very 
significant that we are in the House talking about this subject at 
a time which I see as one of the last few periods when we can 
make this kind of significant change to our gun control laws.
<P>
	We are looking at the type of society in which we want to live.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has brought forward legislation on 
young offenders and sentencing. He has made a commitment to 
make changes to the dangerous offender laws and we have 
before us today the bill on gun control.
<P>
	I do not want to criticize because I am a very big supporter and 
fan of our neighbours to the south. However, we have seen a 
situation there in which citizens who want to change the law 
cannot. We have seen a situation in which the number of deaths 
by firearms has escalated to totally catastrophic levels.
<P>
	In 1992 in the United States, 35,000 people died as a result of 
firearms; 150,000 people wounded by firearms in the same year. 
That is alarming. Those who were wounded might have been 
killed at that time if infrared spotting devices were available. 
They are now available in the United States, giving greater 
accuracy in dark areas, at night and to those who really do not 
have proficiency in the use of firearms to have good aim.
<P>
	We have been told the United States is different. We have been 
told this because of the second amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States. We have been told there is a constitutional 
right to bear arms in the United States. That is not correct in the 
sense the National Rifle Association in the United States would 
have us believe.
<P>
	The right to bear arms as defined by the Supreme Court of the 
United States applies to the militias and the constabularies of 
the states to be able to arm themselves to defend against a 
national army. That is the basis as interpreted by the Supreme 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11548"> 11548 </A></B>
<P>
Court of the United States of the right to bear arms. It is not for 
citizens of the United States to have unlimited permission and 
lawfully be able to have arms.
<P>
	I want to give one example of how that applies with the case of 
one small community in Illinois, Morton Grove, in the early 
1980s, I think in 1982. It decided it wanted to do something 
about the proliferation of firearms. It decided to ban firearms. 
There was a municipal bylaw which banned firearms in that 
community.
<P>
	The National Rifle Association became very alarmed at this 
and a great deal of lobbying ensued. As a result, the state of 
Illinois passed a law that stated municipal laws could not be 
more prohibitive with respect to firearms than state laws. That 
destroyed any opportunity for any further municipality in the 
state of Illinois to do what Morton Grove did.
<P>
	There are other states with the same law. It was never 
challenged. The right of the community of Morton Grove to do 
that was not challenged on the basis of the second amendment. It 
was the lobbying by the National Rifle Association to make sure 
state governments moved in to prohibit that sort of thing 
happening anywhere else in that state and to its determination, 
any other state in the union.
<P>
	The National Rifle Association is quite a prominent lobbying 
group in Washington. It employs approximately 50 people, has 
an annual budget of approximately $100 million and in the 
Congressional elections in 1992 spent $1.7 million on 
candidates favourable to its position.
<P>
	There is no way the Americans will be able to strengthen their 
gun control laws significantly in light of that kind of lobbying 
and force opposed to them.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	We just have to look at the Brady bill. Mr. Brady was shot at 
the same time as President Reagan, a very valued and admired 
public servant in the United States on the staff of the President 
of the United States. He was impaired for life. He and his wife 
worked tirelessly to bring forward a bill for stronger gun 
control. The bill he wanted was one stronger than the one 
eventually passed, but it was only through the force of 
personality and the type of people Brady and his wife were that 
they were able to get that bill at all.
<P>
	Congress in the United States now wants to roll back some of 
the advantages and some of the things obtained in the Brady bill. 
I credit President Clinton when he says that under no 
circumstances would he allow that to happen and he would veto 
any such measures. That is not democracy. That is not allowing 
the people of the United States to choose.
<P>
	We in Canada do not have that kind of force opposed to the 
free will and to the ability of Canadians to make their decision. 
It is getting more difficult. The structured opposition is 
becoming stronger. If Canadians want stronger gun control it 
has to be now.
<P>
	We want Canadians to decide. We want to have the bill go to 
committee. We want to have an intense study of the bill in 
committee. We are prepared to listen to witnesses, to members 
of Parliament and to make some changes to the bill.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice said he wants to have the areas of 
black powder shooting, certified competitions and antiques 
looked at and perhaps defined a little more clearly; perhaps 
changes made in these areas. He has also given an assurance to 
the Canadian Police Association with respect to penalties and 
the criminalization of non-registration. He wants that looked at. 
Those are very significant directions. I presume he will be 
giving further instructions to the committee when he appears.
<P>
	He has also stated that when he appears before the committee 
he will give the breakdown and the background information on 
why he has stated the registration system will cost 
approximately $85 million. For those who are saying it will be 
$500 million, I am sure they will want to hear the minister's 
information. That is fair.
<P>
	The previous speaker from the New Democratic Party said it 
has not worked before so why are we trying again. We are trying 
again because it has not worked before. We are trying to put in a 
registration system that can work. It is not because it is a 
registration system. The registration system will work because 
of advances in technology, a registration that will be-
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> The criminals can break in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> No, they cannot break in. That is nonsense. 
That is pure fabrication, absolute rubbish.
<P>
	The possession licences and the firearms registration 
certificates will be cards similar to credit cards with magnetic 
tape which will have the information and when it is run through 
a machine similar to a machine that checks a Visa card, the 
firearm will automatically be registered. It could be registered 
in a place of purchase similar to Canadian Tire. It will feed into 
the main computer system at which there will be fire doors to 
prohibit the information coming back out.
<P>
	It will be a safe system. That is one of the reasons we want to 
wait until January 1998 to start registration. We want to have the 
people of Canada realize this is a safe system, a beneficial 
system and it will not cost what they have been told it will cost 
them.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Will it fight crime?
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> It is going to fight crime too.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I only have ten minutes. If the hon. member 
comes to the committee and listens, he will hear that, if he has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11549"> 11549 </A></B>
<P>
not understood it already. This is going to be a cost factor where 
those who register, starting in January of 1996, will not pay 
anything for their possession certificate initially and the cost 
will increase in a moderate fashion throughout the five-year 
period. When the five-year renewal period comes around, there  
will be a cost of approximately $60 per person for the renewal.
<P>
	The registration cost will not be $100 per firearm, as has been 
stated by many members in the House. It will be $10 per firearm, 
and for that $10 the person will be able to register 10 firearms. 
That is a significant difference from what we have been told by 
members opposite.
<P>
	I also want to say that this bill will fight crime. If members 
opposite do not know that now, they should make a point of 
looking at the statistics to realize that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I can just imagine all the criminals in Canada 
waiting to run down to the nearest registration office to say, ``I 
own this gun. Put my name on that list, by golly, because I want 
to get on that computer.'' They just cannot wait for that.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this is a tragic thought, but I can also imagine 
how much better future victims of firearms crimes are going to 
feel when an offence is committed against them with a 
registered firearm. I say that facetiously, but still very seriously.
<P>
	The motion put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Yorkton-Melville will split Bill C-68 into two portions. I 
believe it is imperative to be able to discuss separately, in a 
substantial fashion, the so-called merits of universal 
registration, as the Liberals would like to have Canadians 
believe that there actually is some merit to it, and also to discuss 
the improvements to the Criminal Code that would deal with 
people who commit firearms offences. It is important that this 
bill be split. Canadian people must have a chance to have input 
on both sides of the bill. To create a bill that deals with these two 
issues in one simply leaves the Canadian people and this House 
with no opportunity to stop the bad side of the bill and, at the 
same time, vote for some of the good points.
<P>
	I believe there are members in the Liberal Party who would, if 
given the opportunity, instantly vote against universal 
registration and at the same time instantly support stricter 
penalties and tougher laws for people who commit firearms 
offences. We enthusiastically implore the Liberal Party to 
support the splitting of Bill C-68.
<P>
	I believe members should be concerned when changes to the 
Criminal Code are tied to other measures that seek to impose on 
the right of law-abiding Canadians to own and enjoy property. 
This imposition is exactly what Bill C-68, when taken in its 
entirety, seeks to accomplish: to impose red tape, more 
regulation and more penalties on law-abiding firearms owners 
in this country. At the same time, the bill does little to impose 
stricter penalties, harsher penalties, rightful penalties on the 
people who commit firearms offences. We should be looking at 
deterring firearms crime while not imposing on the rights of 
law-abiding firearms owners.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The motion of the member for Yorkton-Melville to split the 
bill is in accordance with a policy that the Canadian people 
want. If this bill was split, this party can support enthusiastically 
the part that deals with imposing stricter penalties on firearms 
offences, while at the same time enthusiastically opposing it, 
along with a lot of Liberal backbenchers who would love to do it. 
Unfortunately, because of party discipline in the Liberal party, 
they are not going to be able to oppose the registration.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice, the Liberal members, with all their 
rhetoric and all their talk about this new bill, Bill C-68, have 
offered not one shred of substantive proof that universal 
registration will prevent firearms crime in Canada. Not one 
single shred have any of these Liberal members offered of proof 
that firearms registration is going to cut crime in this country.
<P>
	The onus is on the Minister of Justice and this government to 
demonstrate clearly to law-abiding citizens affected by these 
new registration laws that they will indeed produce a desirable 
effect. That is what good legislation should be all about. This 
bill cannot demonstrate that in any way; therefore, it cannot be 
considered good legislation.
<P>
	The onus was placed on the Minister of Justice to clearly 
demonstrate how registration is going to cut crime. He has not 
done it. The minister continues to state that registration will 
improve public safety. Again, he has not presented one single 
shred of evidence that it is going to do exactly that.
<P>
	He says the association of police chiefs support him. I may get 
a few of these chiefs mad at me, but I would like to remind this 
House that the association of police chiefs has received about 
$150,000 in grants for their organization from this government. 
One can conjure up all sorts of thoughts of why there is this great 
support for Bill C-68 and the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	However, the facts simply do not support his claim. In New 
Zealand the practice of registration was discontinued. They 
tried it. In 1983 their police force discovered-I have to assume 
that the New Zealand police are a fairly intelligent lot-that a 
gun registry did nothing to combat crime. In Canada police 
officers in Saskatchewan-I have to believe that police officers 
in Saskatchewan are as intelligent as police officers in any other 
part of Canada-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Maybe more so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Maybe more so, yes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11550"> 11550 </A></B>
<P>
	The police officers in Saskatchewan have demonstrated that 
they have absolutely no faith in Bill C-68 and its ability to 
affect crime rates.
<P>
	As time goes on we will see the police forces in some of the 
other provinces come forward with the same conclusion.
<P>
	We have had a handgun registry in this country for about 60 
years. It was revamped in 1977 by Bill C-51, which was 
introduced again by a Liberal government to, as they say-and 
this is wonderful-enhance public safety. This sort of sounds 
familiar. We have heard this same phrase from this government 
and the Minister of Justice himself over the last several weeks. It 
is to ``enhance public safety''. Since 1977, studies by Sproule 
and Kennett, Robert Mundt, and Mauser and Holmes all showed 
that the changes enacted in 1977 had no effect on firearms 
homicide rates in Canada.
<P>
	That is what we call substantive evidence, not the rhetoric and 
the words that the Liberals use with nothing to back them 
up-statistics.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	It is very clear that while Bill C-68 does contain some 
measures to deal more harshly with criminals and people who 
commit firearms offences, which we can support, we would 
have liked to have seen the government and the minister 
introduce a whole lot stiffer penalties than what they have done. 
While it contains some legislation that is good and that we can 
support, I challenge the part that deals with firearms 
registration.
<P>
	I have been on talk show after talk show with anti-gun 
advocates. When I gave them the specific opportunity to bring 
forward substantive evidence that gun registration would cut 
crime, not one single time were they able to give a substantive 
piece of evidence. The most common answer was: ``Well, we 
register cars; what is wrong with registering guns?'' That is the 
standard answer from these people and this government here.
<P>
	Let us go with that. Mr. Speaker, you tell me and any member 
over here whether the registration of automobiles cuts down on 
stolen cars, on traffic accidents or on the carnage that is on our 
highway. How does car registration cut down on people who 
steal cars and commit crimes with cars? Not one single bit.
<P>
	I ask this government and any member over there to show me 
clearly, please, how they substantiate their claim that universal 
registration is going to in fact cut crime. I give that challenge to 
them and so do millions of firearms owners in this country who 
can see no justification for universal firearms registration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, it is my duty to 
inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Brant-justice; the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake-the environment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in the second reading debate on Bill 
C-68 today.
<P>
	I have a distinct advantage over many of the members of this 
House because I am a member of the justice committee. As a 
member of the justice committee, when this bill is referred to the 
justice committee I will have many days and hours, many 
opportunities, to ask witnesses very pointed questions. I will 
have an opportunity not only to examine witnesses but to 
cross-examine witnesses and inquire about certain facts that my 
friends in the Reform Party, for example, have suggested are not 
facts and to ask certain questions that they want to ask.
<P>
	My intervention today will not be to answer or attempt to 
answer the questions that my friends in the Reform Party have 
brought up, generally speaking. My purpose in standing today 
and speaking is to examine and to try to help Canadians 
understand precisely what it is that is going to happen today. 
What I object to, quite frankly, is the misinformation that my 
friends in the Reform Party are attempting to spread across 
Canada with respect to what would happen if we were to support 
their motion today.
<P>
	What I want to talk about is the actual legalities of what would 
occur if one were to support the Reform Party motion, and then 
let us let Canadians decide what the Reform Party has been 
saying and let us let them decide whether it is in fact what would 
occur.
<P>
	We are being asked to consider the government's motion. It is 
a very simple motion. We may not agree with the bill or the 
principles, but the motion is very simple. It states ``that the bill 
be now read a second time and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs''. The government is 
simply saying, all right, let us refer this to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs so that they can hear 
witnesses and hear all of these people who wish to either support 
or object to the bill.
<P>
	My friends in the Reform Party have put forward a very 
specific amendment. They are trying to tell people that their 
amendment splits the bill. That is not the case. The motion is 
very specific. All words after the word ``that'' are to be 
removed. Remember that the original motion says that the bill 
be read a second time and referred to committee. Reform 
members want that passage to be removed. What do they want to 
substitute it with? Do they want to substitute a motion that says 
that the bill be split into two separate sections? No. This is what 
they want to do:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11551"> 11551 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons, because the principle of establishing a system for 
licensing and registration of all firearms and the principle of creating a variety of 
offences are two unrelated issues that should be addressed separately.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Maybe they should be addressed separately, but if this motion 
were passed it would not allow the House to address those two 
questions separately. If we passed this motion, we would not be 
dealing with Bill C-68, period. The House would not read Bill 
C-68 a second time. The House would not refer Bill C-68 to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. 
Consequently, there would be no Bill C-68 and therefore, there 
would be nothing to split and nothing to discuss.
<P>
	In my respectful view, it is improper for members of the 
Reform Party to suggest that their motion would split this bill. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Their motion would 
have the effect of killing this bill, not splitting it. So let us talk 
facts.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party have made a point of saying 
that they are talking straight to the people. Then be straight with 
the people. If they are going to bring a motion that says to kill 
Bill C-68, then tell people that is the kind of motion they are 
bringing forward, not that it is a motion to split the bill. That is 
utter parliamentary nonsense.
<P>
	Anyone who votes in favour of the amendment thinking that 
the bill will be split is sadly misinformed. The actual effect of 
voting for the amendment will be to kill Bill C-68.
<P>
	If we were to kill Bill C-68 the justice committee would have 
absolutely no opportunity whatsoever to consider the merits of 
the bill. It would have no opportunity whatsoever to consider 
any amendments that could be put forward. It would have no 
opportunity whatsoever to try to excise some portions of the bill.
<P>
	Let us be honest with Canadians. If members do not like the 
bill, then say so. If you do not like the bill, tell Canadians that 
the amendment would throw the bill out. Do not tell Canadians 
the bill would be split because that is not the fact.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Is that the end?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> No, that is not the end.
<P>
	Let us talk about what will happen if common sense prevails 
and we send this bill to committee. The bill is not perfect. 
Nothing that is written in this House is perfect. There are 
problems with the bill. The Minister of Justice acknowledged in 
a press release that he would like the committee to consider at 
least three amendments.
<P>
	One deals with relics and whether they can be passed on from 
generation to generation. The second one is how we deal with 
prohibited classes of weapons that are used for competition. 
That is a legitimate thing. We can deal with prohibited weapons 
that might be used for competition. We can put an amendment to 
the bill that would permit such a use. There is nothing wrong or  
impossible about that. The minister has also asked us to look at 
black powder historical re-enactments.
<P>
	There are a couple of problems I would like to look at before I 
have an opportunity to put forward my amendments. I 
acknowledge that I have an opportunity which is not available to 
most members. I am a member of the justice committee and I 
can put forward all kinds of amendments at committee. Then I 
can put forward more amendments in the House at report stage. I 
really have two cracks at it, unlike most members, and I 
acknowledge that.
<P>
	One problem I have with the bill as it currently stands is the 
possibility of confiscation without compensation. This is 
anathema, unliberal. We have to deal with it. We have to look at 
what the bill actually says and make some hard decisions. In my 
view, there should be compensation for property that is legally 
acquired and is subsequently confiscated for the greater public 
good, if that is what this House decides. We do it with real estate. 
There is no reason that we cannot do it in this situation.
<P>
	I would like to hear some evidence on that. I would like to 
hear the pros and cons. I would like to hear all those people who 
wish to come to the justice committee to tell us what is wrong or 
right with it.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I have some problem with the mandatory sentencing. Let us 
pick a section arbitrarily. Let us pick proposed section 244, 
which is found in clause 138 of the bill which reads in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>244. Every person who, with intent</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) to wound, maim or disfigure any person,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) to endanger the life of any person, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) to prevent the arrest or detention of any person,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>discharges a firearm at any person-is liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding fourteen years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a 
term of four years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What does that mean from a legal point of view? Does that 
mean if they wound somebody, they will get a sentence for the 
wounding, then an additional four year consecutive sentence? 
Or does it mean that if they wound someone and they are found 
to have wounded someone under that section they will get a 
sentence of a minimum of four years? There is a huge difference. 
We have to hear from the justice department officials and other 
people in the legal field as to exactly what that means.
<P>
	The perception may be among some in the community that a 
mandatory four year sentence means four years on top of any 
sentence for the crime. Others might think it is four years in 
total. That is called the totality principle. These are legitimate 
concerns and questions.
<P>
	There is another legitimate concern. That is the one expressed 
by members of the Reform Party as to the actual purposes 
registration would serve. Would registration serve the purpose 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11552"> 11552 </A></B>
<P>
of reducing firearm related crimes? How can we know unless we 
hear from the experts?
<P>
	We can sit in committee and listen to people on both sides, the 
Ontario Handgun Association, the National Rifle Association or 
the firearms people. We can listen to the Canadian chiefs of 
police. Our friends from the Reform Party can ask them about 
the grants that have been going on for one or two decades. Never 
mind their innuendoes about the chiefs of police. They are not 
appointed by the federal government but by their own 
municipalities. These innuendoes are insulting to the chiefs of 
police.
<P>
	In any event, these questions can be put directly. We can ask if 
there is any correlation between registration and the curtailment 
of handgun or firearm related crimes. If not, then it may be 
necessary to consider other reasons that we might want the 
registration circumstances.
<P>
	It is inconceivable to me that a reasonable person would not 
want this matter studied in depth at the justice committee. All 
groups and people across Canada who want to provide input on 
this legislation would have the opportunity to do so. For the 
Reform Party to say anything but the fact that its motion would 
kill this bill is utter nonsense.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say something to the people of my 
own riding of Scarborough West. I have discussed this issue 
with them on numerous occasions. I have put out a householder 
which contains a survey. It will be in their mailboxes within two 
weeks. I ask for their direct input and answers to the questions I 
have asked on gun control.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
look forward to this debate as well. I am glad to be back in the 
House. I am particularly pleased to be able to address a subject I 
have heard about only in the last 24 hours. This is pretty handy.
<P>
	It has to do with a debate that went on years ago. It seems like 
40 years, but it was really only four, in 1991. My colleague from 
Burnaby-Kingsway had said something about the member for 
Beaver River supporting universal firearm registration. I 
thought: ``This certainly is news to me. I have never spoken in 
favour of that. Boy, I had better check this out''.
<P>
	I had to chuckle when I saw it in a copy of <I>Hansard</I>, November 
6, 1991. My friend from Kingston and the Islands brought it to 
my attention this afternoon-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. parliamentary 
secretary would refrain from heckling while the member is 
giving her remarks.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that from the Speaker 
and from the member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	It said that I was in favour of gun registration. Let me get one 
thing straight. I would like to quote from <I>Hansard</I>, November 6, 
1991, page 4687. I had already given my entire speech and was 
on questions and comments. Remember that I was sitting way 
back there all by myself and put up with any amount of heckling 
from members.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary, a dino-Tory, said to me, could I 
please make some comments on this, that and the next thing. I 
said to him at page 4687:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would draw the member's attention to the Canadian Police Association and 
some of the recommendations they brought forward. They said that ``over 90 per 
cent of our respondents believe that guns of all kinds should be registered''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian Police Association said that 90 per cent of its 
respondents believed that all guns should be registered. I then 
said right after that that I agreed with that and I think every 
Canadian would agree with that. If those are its numbers, that is 
the survey it did among its members, how can I disagree with 
that? I am not going to dispute those numbers. If I were in favour 
of universal gun registration, and here comes the English 
teacher, I would have said I agree with them. I would agree with 
them if I were in favour of gun registration. It makes sense.
<P>
	Looking at this yesterday I thought that if this was such a loud 
situation that I was in favour of gun registration, why in 
heaven's name did I not hear about it on November 7, 1991 from 
such groups in my constituency as the wonderful people who 
belong to Lac La Biche Shooting Association, responsible 
firearms owners, and Grand Centre's Cold Lake District 
Sportsman Fish and Game Association? Do you think that if I 
had supported gun registration these people would have even let 
me off the aeroplane to come back home? This is bunk.
<P>
	If the member for Burnaby-Kingsway is so concerned about 
the fact that I support universal gun registration, he should have 
found it in my speech and in my thesis. He did not find it there; 
he did not find it now. He is in big trouble with his own small, 
minute caucus here.
<P>
	If we are going to talk about flip-flops, Mr. Speaker, let us 
talk about when you and I listened in the last Parliament to Ian 
Waddell, Margaret Mitchell, and I could list all 43 of them. I am 
sure I can remember who they were. Audrey as well. They were 
going on and on talking about how terrible this was. All of a 
sudden in 1995 it is just amazing how things change. The NDP 
caucus is not going to be supporting this legislation. I have to 
admire them for that. The member for Burnaby-Kingsway is 
not going to be able to. If he can justify that back home that is 
fine. Things were different in 1991 of course. I did not agree 
with universal gun registration then, nor do I now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11553"> 11553 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look at the Canadian Police Association's latest 
viewpoint on gun registration: ``The Canadian Police 
Association recognizes the clear value of information 
availability to police officers, which registration of all firearms 
provides, and supports a full firearms registration system, but 
cannot support the registration system articulated in Bill C-68 
unless there is a guarantee from the federal government that 
any implementation or administration costs for such a system 
will not come from existing operational police budgets''. I 
agree with that too.
<P>
	I do not agree with gun registration, but I have to agree with 
what the Canadian Police Association says. Whether the police 
will be able to enforce it on the frontlines or whether that money 
will actually have to come from some of the operating budgets, 
if there are fewer policemen in our cities, in our small towns and 
on our country highways when people are hauling around 
firearms committing crimes with them, that is where the money 
should go.
<P>
	The proposed national firearms registration system will 
contain data for six million to 20 million guns, which is a lot of 
guns, and three million to seven million gun owners. We just 
heard our friend from the maritimes, the parliamentary 
secretary for justice, saying that we are going to get something 
like a Visa card and we will just run it through the magnetic 
strip.
<P>
	Has anyone here ever had their Visa card stolen? Is it going to 
be guaranteed that that is safe, that they are not going to be able 
to break on to the Internet and have absolute access and a shop at 
home catalogue? Can we have any guarantee that someone is not 
going to be able to get into the Internet? He promised us it would 
be safer than safe.
<P>
	When we talk safe, I want to talk about the fact that someone 
who is a victim of a crime with a firearm does not give two hoots 
about whether that gun was registered or not and whether 
somebody in a criminal gang in downtown cities anywhere 
across this country is going to be able to break into that system. 
We hear about it all the time. Why should the gun registration be 
any safer than anything else?
<P>
	It is frightening to me that they would be able to know who has 
guns, where they are, how many they have and have absolute 
access to them. Those people are not going to register their 
firearms. We have to be absolutely dreaming if we think such a 
thing is going to happen.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Do you think that someone coming across the border is going 
to give up a gun? Who is going to seize these guns?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The police.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> The police are going to seize the guns. This thing 
is going full circle because the Canadian Police Association just 
said in its most recent document: ``Who is going to do the 
seizing? Who is going to do the policing?'' How much time are 
the police going to have for that? How much time does any 
policeman in any constituency have for more bookwork and 
paperwork? They should be out in their cruisers stopping crime.
<P>
	A universal registration system will be a very large 
undertaking with huge costs. People joked earlier when my 
leader was speaking about us not having any idea of what the 
costs are. We would like to know,or at least have an idea of what 
the costs are. The Minister of Justice may talk about costs but we 
have absolutely no proof of that.
<P>
	The finance minister in his budget, somewhat recently, gave 
us an idea of what to expect for deficits. We are going to be 
spending $9 billion on interest payments for every dollar that is 
cut. It goes on and on. One hundred billion dollars will be added 
to the deficit. Give us an idea of the costs, it is a lot of money.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers are going to be paying for this. We hear 
the government saying that it will be user pay, not just 
taxpayers' money. What is user pay? It is nothing more than me 
taking $10 out of my pocket to pay for registering my .22. It is 
nothing more than giving my money to the government or to 
someone to register my gun. It is user pay. Is it still costing me 
money? Yes, of course it is. I would sooner pay that $10 to a 
health care system that is going to be more efficient than 
knowing that someone is just paying to have his gun registered.
<P>
	The recreational firearms communities of two provincial 
governments have huge doubts about the legislation and the 
minister knows it. I participated in the rally in September and I 
was proud of all the responsible firearms owners. Nobody acted 
crazy or irresponsible that day.
<P>
	I must say I admire the minister for going out and facing them. 
The people in my constituency said they thought that was pretty 
brave. There was no one to be ashamed of there. It is not the 
responsible firearms owners who we should be attacking in this 
legislation. It is the criminal misuse of firearms and a 
registration system will do nothing to eliminate or even 
alleviate crime.
<P>
	This new scheme will represent a massive attack by the state 
and its police on property rights and the privacy of millions of 
law-abiding citizens. I frankly do not think I need to say 
anything more about this. I never did support universal gun 
registration regardless of what my friend from Burnaby says. I 
do not agree with the police association's estimate. I agree with 
the fact that they say those are their numbers, but I do not agree 
with them. There would not be people in my constituency, and 
many policemen as well, who could support that.
<P>

<P>
	Crime is what we should be attacking here, not registration. 
Registration is not the answer. Therefore, let us split this bill 
in two and make sure that we deal with crime. As the bill is 
now responsible firearms owners are going to be labelled and 
become criminals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise to speak on the motion. I have been 
spending the last few days listening to the debate on it.
<P>
	I must say that some good ideas came from across the floor. 
Some good ideas also came from this side of the House of 
changes we could make to really reflect the concerns of some of 
my constituents.
<P>
	Over the past few months I have been talking to a number of 
my constituents who have been hearing a lot of misinformation 
concerning this bill. It has been very difficult to really debate 
the bill in an open and meaningful way. I end up spending half of 
my time trying to explain to constituents parts of the bill that 
they believe are there but actually are not. I find that a very 
difficult way to deal with the legislation.
<P>
	I have a number of concerns with the legislation but before I 
get into that I want to talk about those areas which I think 
everyone in the House supports. When Bill C-17 came into the 
House under the former Conservative government I could not 
support and voted against the sections on the increased criminal 
sanctions for the illegal use of firearms. One of the reasons I 
voted against the bill was that I did not believe it dealt with the 
criminal use of guns. My constituents did not feel these issues 
were properly dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I brought those points forward and I want to thank the minister 
for at least listening to Canadians who felt there was not enough 
being done to sanction people who use guns in the commission 
of crimes. I appreciate that he and the Prime Minister are taking 
our ideas and moving forward with them.
<P>
	As members know, the average sanction across the board is 
about 16 months. The minister has increased it to four years. I 
would rather have seen it go higher but I see that as a positive 
step and a good way forward.
<P>
	I also agree with what the minister is doing with the whole 
question of smuggling. I have talked with the Minister of 
National Revenue and he has indicated to me that he, along with 
the Solicitor General and the Minister of Justice, have a task 
force together. They are going to focus on smuggling.
<P>
	This will not work unless smugglers are stopped at the border. 
There is one major place at the border where the majority of 
these guns are coming across. I call on the Minister of Justice 
and the Solicitor General to deal with that situation and to get 
the guns off the street. I also agree with the seizure of the assets 
of those people who smuggle. If assets are seized and smuggling 
is stopped it will go a long way in dealing with some of the 
problems.
<P>
	I have not heard anybody on the other side thank the minister 
for dealing with the whole situation of young offenders with 
regard to handguns. I see that as a positive step forward and 
something we could support.
<P>
	I want to get into those areas that I feel are not very well 
represented. Specifically, there is the whole area of registration. 
It is probably the area that concerns most of my constituents. 
When I was putting forward proposals on that, I always said that 
registration would have to be proven to me to be effective, 
efficient and affordable. When I look at some of the proposals 
put forward by the minister, I am concerned whether they 
actually meet that criteria.
<P>
	I hope the members of the committee on justice will tear the 
bill apart, get the minister before them and get the proof whether 
these sorts of criteria are met. I see that as an important role of 
the committee and I hope it will take that challenge on.
<P>
	I also wanted to split the bill. A lot of members wanted to split 
the bill but I have to say to my colleagues across the way that 
their motion does not split the bill.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Make a motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> I will make a motion. I wonder if I can have 
unanimous consent to move this motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That section 80 on page 36 through to section 112 on page 51 could be 
removed from this bill and brought back as another bill under the name of the 
Canadian firearms registration system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the member have unanimous 
consent to move the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent. The 
member has the floor on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> A Liberal said no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, a number of members on all sides 
of the House would support a motion like that. I hope that maybe 
we can work as this bill goes through its other stages to convince 
the minister to do something like that.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I notice that you gave our hon. 
colleague a going over for heckling before.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has a good point. As the 
member for Beaver River will agree, I asked the member not to 
heckle her. I wonder if members on the Reform side would not 
heckle the member.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="11555"> 11555 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I return to the Criminal Code 
provisions and registration. A number of members have raised 
concerns about people who do not properly register their guns 
and therefore get a criminal record. I hope the committee will 
look at the issue. I know the minister has indicated to the 
Canadian Police Association that he would be willing to look at 
it. I know that members of the Liberal caucus will be working 
with the minister over the next little while to make sure that is a 
fact.
<P>
	I would like to see a sunset clause on registration. We have 
found that there are difficulties with the handgun registration 
system. Frankly, I am not sure how this one is going to work. For 
instance if it is not working in 10 years, let's hoist it and get rid 
of it. If the minister can prove it is working, then leave it alone. 
However, something like a sunset clause may not be a bad idea.
<P>
	Handguns are prohibited, however certain handguns are used 
now in gun clubs. I know the minister has indicated his 
willingness to work with national associations concerning 
handguns they say they should be able to use. I also hope that the 
minister and perhaps the committee will listen to other clubs 
whose members use handguns, but which may not always follow 
national association criteria.
<P>
	I also have a real concern with how this bill deals with 
regulations and how it will look at an area that is not normally 
considered, that of long arms. An example is the Ruger Mini-14. 
I know it is not considered in this bill. However, there will be a 
provision created under which the minister can deal with the 
Ruger Mini-14 and prohibit it from being used.
<P>
	In my area a number of farmers use it to shoot coyotes. It is the 
gun of preference to get rid of the coyotes. A number of people 
will be concerned with that area. Should these guns still be used 
to hunt or at gun clubs? I hope the minister will allow us time to 
deal with that issue.
<P>
	I have listened to members of the Reform Party over the last 
while talking about the bill and how their constituents are 
against it. As members of Parliament we must deal with that. It 
is the Reform Party that says it has to represent the wishes of its 
constituents. I agree with that. That is why I talk with my 
constituents and try to get to as many areas as I can.
<P>
	All members have to look at the results of national polls. I 
refer to a poll that was done by the minister of justice of Alberta. 
I want to quote from that poll. Obviously, everyone knows that 
the polls taken showed that Albertans were against this. It did 
not show that in the rural areas, which is of a concern to me 
because a lot of areas of Alberta are somewhat like southwestern 
Ontario. We have a lot in common.
<P>
	If we look at the question: ``Do you strongly agree or strongly 
disagree with registration of rifles?'' The numbers were 50 per 
cent said they agreed and 48 per cent somewhat agreed or 
disagreed.
<P>
	However, in some rural centres the numbers were: strongly 
agree, 58 per cent; strongly disagree, 43 per cent. It clearly 
shows that even in rural Alberta they support the minister in the 
registration of long arms.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we not only have to consider our 
constituents but we also must take into account the importance 
of the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.15 p.m., pursuant to the 
order made earlier today, in accordance with the provisions of 
Standing Order 78(3), it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings 
and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of second 
reading stage of the bill now before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The first vote is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried. Accordingly, the 
bill stands referred to the standing committee on justice and 
legal affairs.
<P>
	My colleagues, your Speaker finds himself in somewhat of a 
quandary. I have been approached by hon. members of 
Parliament who wish to be recorded as abstaining from the 
votes.
<P>
	I have two choices. I can have them stand, put it on the record 
and declare them out of order or I can simply ask those who want 
to abstain from the vote to rise and I can declare them all out of 
order at the same time.
<P>
	I surely do not want to make light of this. Because we do not 
have a mechanism for abstention I would ask the committee on 
voting procedures to take this into account at some future time

<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the record to show that I 
stood in my seat and that I would support neither the motion to 
kill the bill nor the bill in its present form. I would like a 
clarification of that from the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to have it recorded that I 
was present during the vote but abstained.

	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, in this House, traditions have a 
significance that cannot be overlooked. I think we have an 
obligation to conform to what is customary in this respect.
<P>
	It is assumed that if a member is present, he will make his 
opinion known as his constituents have asked him to do, whether 
he is for or against a bill. To abstain is not an option, as we see it, 
and we therefore object.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I want to thank the hon. member for Roberval

dilemma. It was simply for your information. I thank all 
members for their attention.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should transfer the 
responsibility for cultural preservation to individuals by discontinuing federal 
multiculturalism programs, relinquishing control of multiculturalism thereby 
allowing multiculturalism to flourish by giving individuals the freedom to 
pursue their own cultural ideals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to move this motion this 
today. Canadians from all across this country have become 
involved in a debate that explores the merits of the federal 
government's policy on multiculturalism. The issue has its 
defenders and its detractors. But most significantly, people no 
longer are blindly accepting the status quo that multiculturalism 
funding should be beyond reproach or even be beyond 
questioning.
<P>
	The position of the Reform Party is given expression in my 
motion as just read. By relinquishing control at the federal level 
for funding multicultural projects, we will also be giving to 
individuals the chance to choose for themselves what cultural 
endeavours they wish to support.
<P>
	As a government we have diminishing resources and as 
individual taxpayers we too have less and less disposable 
income. It is in light of this that we as legislators should be 
making efforts to maximize the freedom of individuals to 
distribute their disposable income where they choose.
<P>
	In contemporary Canada does it not seem a little arrogant 
when the government decides which programs, which groups 
and which individuals should be funded? Are these decisions not 
better left in the hands of Canadians and not government? Why 
is it that this Liberal government avoids all the difficult 
decisions that concern Canadians the most?
<P>
	I have sponsored two motions, both of which have been 
deemed to be non-votable. Last June I sponsored a motion for 
debate that related to the CBC. I recommended that the CBC be 
partially privatized. In that debate I suggested that we make 
some substantial changes to the CBC and that would include 
funding reductions.
<P>
	I received a very poor reception from the other side of the 
House. In fact there was laughter and derision as I recall. 
However, here we are in budget 1995 and surprise, surprise, 
some of my recommendations have been acknowledged, 
particularly the recommendations for reduced funding and 
potential restructuring.
<P>
	Another Reform proposition which the Liberals have recently 
borrowed was the recommendation to amalgamate all of the 
women's organizations into Status of Women Canada. I have 
suggested that further to that we dismantle the organization 
altogether.
<P>
	Further to the debate on this motion, let me share with the 
House some sentiments from an average Canadian. I recently 
spoke to a group in Kingston, Ontario about my vision for 
Canada. A woman who heard me that day sent me some of her 
thoughts which echo mine. I would like to share them with the 
House today. She wrote on something she called ``Acceptable 
Behaviour in a Global Village''. She wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The world of human beings has grown smaller and populations all over the 
world have become so mixed that we have to learn to get along peacefully with 
each other. The global village is no longer somewhere else. It is here and all of us 
are mixed in with it. It does not matter whether someone of a different race or 
nation lives next door or down the street or in a different part of town or halfway 
around the world, we have to learn to live peacefully with all of those peoples 
whose racial or national origins are different from our own. To do otherwise is to 
bring about an end to our world. The intolerance, conflicts, fighting and wars 
between peoples will bring an end to our civilization and the earth as a planet 
much quicker than any pollution or natural disaster.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All peoples have some members who are great people, who have 
accomplished things which are beneficial for all humankind. All peoples have 
some members who are difficult people who make life miserable for those 
around them. No one is perfect. Most people of all races are a mixture of good 
and bad. It is necessary to recognize the best and the positive in others 
regardless of what they look like, what language they speak or where they come 
from. The positive values of honesty, integrity, the ability to do the job required 
of them, the ability to care for family and other people and the ability to live 
peacefully together with others; all provide the basis for a good and worthwhile 
society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every race and nation of people has those individuals whose performance is 
excellent in all of those values. Every race and nation has many who fail to 
uphold those positive values. We need to change our attitudes to become more 
objective and non-judgmental. We need to become more accepting of all 
people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The woman concludes her letter with the thought that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is not an easy thing to do but if enough of us who feel this necessity start 
to put these attitudes into our own lives and encourage others to also do so, we 
will have a better world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are the sentiments of an ordinary Canadian. The writer 
has no Ph.D. in peace issues. She has no certificates proclaiming 
her to be an expert on eliminating racial discrimination. But she 
clearly is an expert on old-fashioned Canadian common sense. 
If we could only bottle these common sense attitudes and ship  
them throughout Canada and around the world what a better 
place this would be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11559"> 11559 </A></B>
<P>
	I was mentioning earlier that the issue of multiculturalism is 
of high profile in the media of late. I was reading a recent edition 
of <I>India Abroad</I> in which Professor Milton Israel wrote about 
the issue of identity as it pertains to multiculturalism. He wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For some the emphasis on ethnicity facilitates division; for others, it provides a 
means to cope and a possibility of unity on better terms. Still others insist that 
national boundaries and the limited and distinctive identities they produce are 
eroding and the future lies with the ``transnationals'', people who are at home in 
more than one society. The loss of old home through migration or the substantial 
immigration of others is not to be lamented but a new kind of cosmopolitan 
nationalism is to be embraced.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I share this view. We do not need a special dispensation from 
the government to foster this belief. Members of ethnic 
communities also espouse these views. I experienced this when I 
spoke to the Human Rights and Race Relations Centre in 
Toronto, a privately funded organization that works to end 
discrimination in Canada. I went there on March 21 which was a 
day that acknowledged a race-free society. In fact it was called 
``the day to eliminate racism in the world''.
<P>
	I was so impressed that day with the individuals I met. They 
were all volunteers, leaders from the ethnic communities in 
Toronto. They had strived free of federal government funding to 
bring together other community leaders to discuss the issue of 
racial discrimination in the hope that it could be eliminated in 
this century.
<P>
	There was a wonderful letter in the conference package that 
had been written by the hon. Paul Martin. He said he wished to 
acknowledge the work and contribution of the Human Rights 
and Race Relations Centre toward ending racial discrimination 
in this country. He acknowledged the dedication and 
commitment demonstrated by the staff and the 
volunteers-indeed all of them in this centre are 
volunteers-and that their efforts had been exemplary. He said 
that they all deserved to be commended for their efforts.
<P>
	This is an excellent example of a group of Canadians who are 
working together without government funding to support and to 
further the process to eliminate discrimination.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wonder, only because I take a special interest 
in what the hon. member is saying, would she clarify if that was 
the hon. Paul Martin Sr. or Jr.?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, this was 
from the hon. Paul Martin, Jr. It was a letter he had written dated 
March 13, 1995. It was to help give support to this group in 
Toronto. I wanted to share that with the House because he had 
written such a wonderful letter to them.
<P>
	The Reform Party opposes the current concept of 
multiculturalism and hyphenated Canadianism pursued  by the 
Government of Canada. We would end funding of the 
multiculturalism program and support the abolition of the 
department and the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance sincerely wants ideas on how to cut 
the deficit he will get rid of this aspect of special interest 
funding. He would immediately save the taxpayers of Canada 
some $38.8 million a year. This also sends a powerful message 
to all concerned that beliefs in self-reliance, the indomitable 
spirit of the self in search of autonomy and independence is 
encouraged and championed in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Multiculturalism was introduced in the House of Commons 
on October 8, 1971. In the 23 years that have followed, it has 
been politically incorrect for anyone to criticize it. I will repeat 
that. It has been politically incorrect for anyone to criticize it, 
especially in the House of Commons. I do not know the number 
of times I have had to bear the label of being bigoted because I 
speak from a different point of view. I have no patience for that 
any longer when all I want to do is bring reasoned and rational 
debate to this issue.
<P>
	In fact, members of Parliament from the Tories, the Grits and 
the NDP have all used the multiculturalism policy in a way that I 
believe is insincere, superficial and shallow in order to garner 
political support from ethnic communities.
<P>
	We all want the right to retain our roots, but what we have is 
Trudeau's enforced multicultural scam and the costs have been 
excessive. Ethnic group is pitted against ethnic group and the 
country is fragmented into a thousand consciousnesses. 
Trudeau's ideas about multiculturalism continue to contribute 
as a primary factor in the erosion of federalism and Canada's 
unity. Catering to special interest groups a la Trudeau and 
company smashes the spine of federalism. This destructive 
outcome is almost inevitable so long as we officially encourage 
large groups to remain apart from the mainstream.
<P>
	The multiculturalism policy of Canada was designed to 
``recognize and promote the understanding that 
multiculturalism reflects the cultural and racial diversity of 
Canadian society and acknowledges the freedom of all members 
of Canadian society to preserve, enhance and share their cultural 
heritage''. It is intended to ``promote full and equitable 
participation of individuals and communities of all origins'' in 
all aspects of Canadian life, including ``equal treatment and 
equal protection under the law, while respecting and valuing 
their diversity''. The language of the policy is fairly innocuous 
and well meaning, but in practice it endorses special interest 
groups' agendas at the expense of the taxpayer.
<P>
	Canadians remain unsure of what multiculturalism is, what it 
is trying to do and why and what it can accomplish in a free and 
democratic society such as ours.  Multiculturalism can 
encompass folk songs, dance, food, festivals, arts and crafts, 
museums, heritage languages, ethnic studies, ethnic presses, 
race relations, culture sharing and human rights. Much of the 
opposition 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11560"> 11560 </A></B>
<P>
to multiculturalism results from the indiscriminate application 
of the term to a wide range of situations, practices, expectations 
and goals as well as its institutionalization as state policy, an 
expensive one at that.
<P>
	Public support for multiculturalism has been difficult to 
ascertain. In the early 1970s when the Royal Commission on 
Bilingualism and Biculturalism recommended the government 
introduce some ethnocultural policy, public support for 
multiculturalism was at around 76 per cent.
<P>
	An Angus Reid poll in 1991 showed that figure has not 
changed much. It remains at 78 per cent. But what can we make 
of this level of support? Little to nothing, I suggest. At the same 
time that poll was being done, the Citizens' Forum on Canada's 
Future reported some uneasiness about the Canadian public's 
attitude toward multiculturalism policies. It stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Overwhelmingly, participants told us that reminding us of our different 
origins is less useful in binding a unified country than emphasizing the things we 
have in common. While Canadians accept and value Canada's cultural diversity, 
they do not value many of the activities of the multicultural program of the 
federal government. These are seen as expensive and divisive in that they remind 
Canadians of their different origins rather than their shared symbols, society and 
future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Further to this, a Decima survey was commissioned by the 
Canadian Council of Christians and Jews and was carried out in 
October 1993. The survey found that three out of four Canadians 
expressed a preference for an American style melting pot 
approach to immigration over the multicultural mosaic that has 
been officially promoted in Canada since the 1970s.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	The survey also disclosed that Canadians generally are 
increasingly intolerant of interest group demands and that there 
is a relatively strong view that particularly ethnic, racial or 
religious minorities must make more efforts to adapt to Canada 
rather than insisting upon a maintenance of difference, 
especially at federal expense. Roughly similar proportions of 
visible minorities expressed the same sentiments.
<P>
	This poll would suggest that it is the prevalent opinion 
amongst the groups targeted to receive multiculturalism grants 
that such grants are divisive. These are not my words; they come 
from others.
<P>
	As I mentioned, criticism of the status quo has been 
increasing from the policy's supposed beneficiaries. For 
example, a fellow by the name of Jimmy who emigrated from 
Vietnam in 1980 and is now a technician at a photo processing 
lab commented: ``The government spends too much money on 
something that's not necessary. Canada has freedom and work 
for anyone who wants it,  and that is all newcomers need''. In 
Richmond, a magazine editor by the name of Anthony agreed 
that government-sanctioned segregation is no good for Canada.
<P>
	What seems to be clear is that there is an erosion of support 
for multiculturalism by the citizens of Canada. This erosion of 
support for the multicultural approach, particularly given that 
minorities themselves concur, does nothing to promote harmony 
and unity in Canada because it does not recognize that all 
Canadians are equal.
<P>
	Our vision of Canada should be committed to the goal of 
social and personal well-being that values individuality while 
emphasizing themes like family and community assumption of 
responsibility, problem-solving and communicating these 
value-sets as a means to better group life. However, at no time 
should the rights of a group supersede the rights of individuals, 
unless the group happens to consist of a majority within Canada.
<P>
	I have tried to show why the federal government's 
interpretations of multicultural support must come to an end. 
We can no longer spend money we do not have on financing such 
a notion. The Angus Reid study from 1991 clearly shows that not 
only has the multicultural program failed, but Canadians oppose 
it. One of the main reasons that Canadians oppose this policy is 
that it is divisive.
<P>
	I would like to refer to Arthur Slessinger, Jr. Mr. Slessinger is 
not a conservative thinker whom I trot out to support my 
position. He is a well-known liberal, an American Democrat. He 
is the quintessential Liberal's liberal. Slessinger believes that 
by its very nature multiculturalism is dangerously divisive. It 
encourages government to segregate citizens along racial, 
ethnic and linguistic fault-lines. Then it compels them to dole 
out rights and money according to the labels people wear. Far 
better to focus on unifying forces, he advises, emphasising the 
characteristics, desires and beliefs that citizens hold in 
common. Otherwise, tribal hostilities will drive them apart.
<P>
	Preservation of diverse cultural heritages can be left to 
individuals, families and private self-financing organizations.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to acknowledge that my own personal 
circumstances are those that encompass a multicultural family. I 
have a daughter who has dual citizenship with Australia and 
Canada. I have another daughter who is married to a young man 
from Mexico; his name is Fernando Rodríguez. I have European 
roots myself, Croatian and Norwegian. My husband also has a 
European background. Our family is multicultural. It reflects 
very much the diversity and richness of those various cultures.
<P>

<P>
	I speak as a Reformer in this House. I believe there is no 
place in our society for the federal government to continue to 
fund multiculturalism. However, I do believe that there is a 
price to be paid for forging a new nationality out of diverse 
elements. Simply put, there is a fair degree of tolerance and 
goodwill all around. I have learned that through my personal 
experience.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to take part in this debate and to set the record straight 
and tell things the way they are. In Canada, multiculturalism is 
not an ideal; it is a reality.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	Some people prefer to call this reality diversity or pluralism, 
or refer to the programs, policies and issues as intercultural, 
cross-cultural or ethnocultural. They can play the semantic 
game if they wish, but a rose by any other name is still a rose.
<P>
	The hon. member who proposed this debate just said that we 
should never support group rights unless they are a majority. 
From my perspective and where I grew up, democracies are 
judged by how they treat their minorities.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is not just a matter of the right of choice, 
which we all enjoy in our democracy in the maintaining of one's 
cultural roots. It is about respecting the right and ensuring it for 
all Canadians, whatever their race, religion, language or country 
of origin. It is about fostering a climate of mutual respect in a 
country where everyone is equal, where everyone has rights and, 
yes, responsibilities too. It is about equality. As our Prime 
Minister has said: ``Equality is not about special interests or 
special rights. It is about social and economic justice.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has a rich democratic tradition. The principles of 
justice, personal freedom, mutual respect, open mindedness, 
freedom, integration and the shared notions of justice have 
guided and shaped our social structures, our laws, our 
institutions and our way of life.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are basic community and fundamental Canadian 
values. I would remind my hon. colleague-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-that the Prime Minister of Canada has often said our country's 
unity depends on its diversity, which is also our strength. It is in 
fact the essence of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would say that we know that peace, prosperity and social 
harmony do not come from wishful thinking or letting the 
marketplace dictate or letting personal feelings prevail. They 
are partners in that undertaking, perhaps. They can only come 
about, in my perspective and in the  perspective of this party, 
from good public policy, collaboration with the private sector, 
commitment and determination, and community goodwill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The aim of the federal multicultural programs is to promote 
understanding among the various cultural communities. Who 
would quarrel with this objective? These programs are intended 
to help newcomers integrate into the country, to eliminate the 
obstacles to participation by all Canadians and to break down 
borders and put a stop to racial discrimination.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	From a business and trade perspective, we find these policies 
have great economic benefits. The more we know about global 
markets, the more we can use the cultural and linguistic 
knowledge of Canadians in competing in those very markets 
where we now do global business and the more we will all 
benefit.
<P>
	These are some of the things that multiculturalism is all 
about. It is far more than a case of enhancing and preserving 
culture. The hon. member surely realizes that we do not live in a 
perfect society.
<P>
	There is discrimination, and although we may be number one 
on the UN list, we have not reached nirvana or utopia, to my 
knowledge, as yet. There are still talented people out there, 
citizens denied full access to the economic mainstream. There 
are still people out there sitting on the margins who have a vital 
contribution to make but are not able to make it because of 
discrimination, because of lack of understanding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Linguistic, racial and religious tensions lead to 
misunderstanding. We sometimes take advantage of the public 
good. We often want to do things our way and we find it hard to 
put ourselves in others' shoes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Good public policy and programs help all of us to stand tall 
and walk in confidence and pride as if we were in the other 
person's shoes.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe that Canada's multicultural policies and programs 
have helped ensure peace and stability over our great land. 
Certainly the rest of the world seems to think so.
<P>
	By weaving together all the diverse cultures that people our 
land, we have created a magnificent Canadian tapestry, 
reflecting our Canadian culture, which is more than the sum of 
all its dynamic parts. At a cost that is not extraordinary, less than 
$1 per Canadian per year, this policy works at breaking down 
barriers and promoting institutional advances, thus providing 
individuals, as the member puts it, the freedom to pursue their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11562"> 11562 </A></B>
<P>
own cultural ideals in a society that can accommodate 
differences, build bridges, and profit from its pluralism.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is not about living separately side by side; it 
is about living together. It is not about building walls; it is about 
tearing them down. It is about inclusion, not exclusion. It is 
about the fact that we are all Canadians. It is about respecting 
each other.
<P>
	This government demonstrates leadership by tapping into the 
current and potential benefits of diversity. The multicultural 
program and policy, as I have said before, are good government 
policies. Its practices have evolved and are complemented by 
partnerships with individuals, corporations, organizations and 
other levels of government, whom I thank, as well as those 
individuals who serve them in a voluntary capacity.
<P>
	Just for the member's information, we do not do song and 
dance or festivals, as she points out.
<P>
	I am happy to share with the hon. member the initiatives we 
have taken with the Canadian Advertising Council and its study 
called ``Colour Your Money'', which shows that with 
sensitivity, good hiring practices and with the kind of publicity 
one would like to put out in our advertising milieu, diversity can 
be a very profitable business because one feels at home and 
welcome in the environment. I would be more than happy to 
share the successful partnerships we have had with the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police, the Conference Board of 
Canada, the Asia-Pacific Foundation, the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities, the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters, Cineplex-Odeon, and many others too numerous 
to name.
<P>
	We look to the future by working together with Canada's 
youth, with teachers, school boards and school trustees, by 
assisting in the development of films and books and then making 
them available to the children in our schools and in our public 
libraries. We build an environment that helps shape their lives. 
By encouraging understanding and co-operation among our 
youth, we help shape the future of Canada, a future of mutual 
respect, understanding and co-operation.
<P>
	I would advise the hon. member-she spoke on the day to 
eliminate racism-to look at that group. It is a fine group that we 
help fund. We are very pleased with the work that many of these 
groups do, both in their voluntary and professional roles.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must affirm and reaffirm the Canadian values expressed in 
our constitution and in the charter of rights and freedoms-the 
freedoms we take for granted-the right and the duty of each 
Canadian to protect and promote this exceptional democracy 
and to participate in it fully and equally.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Recently the Governor General said during his moving 
swearing-in speech: ``I believe we still learn as much from our 
differences as from our similarities. When we only talk among 
ourselves, all we get back are echoes. We only grow if we take 
the time to quietly and carefully listen to each other.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He added that, in Canada, we recognize one fact in life. People 
here are true to their origins, and they bring their origins here 
with them. An infinite variety of traditions and cultures make up 
Canada's unique mosaic, providing a fine example for the 
world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would say to my hon. colleague, who has put what I consider 
to be an unenlightened approach before this House, that there 
are no hyphenated Canadians and there is no segregation in our 
policy. If someone chooses to segregate or hyphenate 
themselves, they have the freedom and the right to do so. It is too 
bad they feel they must separate themselves from the glorious 
undertakings that we have as a country and a nation that is the 
envy of the world in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	I would say to her in my closing remarks that the bottom line 
to my hon. colleague is that national values can cut across racial, 
religious and cultural lines in Canada, allowing 
multiculturalism to flourish in the best interests of all of us. It 
would ensure ``old-fashioned Canadian common sense'' to be 
the inheritance of all of our children's tomorrows.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
intend to speak as the official opposition critic for 
multiculturalism, and I want to thank the hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast for giving me this opportunity to repeat the 
position of the Bloc quebecois on the federal government's 
multiculturalism policy. We believe there are several reasons 
why this policy should be abolished.
<P>
	To put this debate into perspective, it would be useful to 
consider the official definition of this multiculturalism policy as 
read in a news bulletin from the Library of Parliament. We read 
that the term multiculturalism in Canada evokes the presence 
and survival of various racial and ethnic minorities that identify 
themselves as being different and wish to stay that way.
<P>
	We should now look at the sequence of events that led up to 
the adoption of the policy on multiculturalism. It is 1971, under 
the Trudeau government, and the report of the Royal 
Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism has just been 
published. Always according to the library's news bulletin, the 
fourth volume of the report dealt with the contribution of ethnic 
groups 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11563"> 11563 </A></B>
<P>
to the enrichment of Canadian culture and recommended the 
integration (and not assimilation) into Canadian society of 
non-founding ethnic groups, recognizing their rights  and 
privileges as citizens and making them equal participants in 
Canada's institutions.
<P>
	We should also remember that a new political party was 
founded in Quebec with the sovereignty of Quebec as its stated 
objective, and that in the election held the previous year, it 
obtained 22 per cent of the popular vote.
<P>
	How ironic. Feeling the pressure from this new expression of 
Quebec's desire for independence, coming as it did shortly after 
the October crisis, the Trudeau team, including the present 
Prime Minister, decided to make some adjustments to the 
report's recommendation. As a result, the concept of integration 
that would recognize the rights of members of ethnic groups and 
their equal participation in society was abandoned in favour of 
the concept of promoting cultural differences. In so doing, the 
whole dialectic of two founding peoples with their own 
language and culture was submerged and diluted in this ocean of 
other languages and cultures.
<P>
	It was a fine sleight of hand, and most Canadians did not 
notice, except, of course, Quebecers. Through then Premier 
Robert Bourassa, Quebecers resolutely dissociated themselves 
from this concept.
<P>
	In an open letter to Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Bourassa first reminded 
his federal counterpart that his proposal was a betrayal of the 
work done by the commission, whose focus had been 
bilingualism and biculturalism, and thus the equal status of the 
two peoples. He regretted Mr. Trudeau's decision to dissociate 
culture and language. He went on to reject out of hand a policy 
whose objective would be to promote languages other than 
French in Quebec. Finally, he reminded the federal leader that in 
this case, the jurisdictions were purely provincial.
<P>
	Quebec never changed its position, although leaders and 
political options changed regularly over the years. In fact, 
Quebec developed its own policy for integrating cultural 
communities, a policy similar to the one proposed by the 
Laurendeau-Dunton Royal Commission.
<P>
	In Quebec, the emphasis is on integration. Not assimilation 
but integration. The official definition of integration is as 
follows: integration is long term multi-dimensional process of 
adaptation, distinct from assimilation. In this process, the 
knowledge and use of the common language of Quebec society 
is a fundamental driving force. The process is consolidated in a 
society, where participation by all Quebecers is guaranteed and 
where immigrants and members of cultural communities find 
their place and are recognized as full members of the communal, 
social and political life of a pluralistic francophone society.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	This policy has received unanimous approval in Quebec; it is 
never an issue, unlike the Canadian policy.
<P>
	We cannot help but notice that multiculturalism enjoys 
anything but unanimous approval. The Decima and Gallup polls 
published in 1993 showed that 75 per cent of Canadians rejected 
the policy of multiculturalism and favoured a style of 
integration similar to Quebec's.
<P>
	Given the government's investment in multiculturalism, it is 
a sad thing to see it fail. For the year 1993-94 alone, the 
government invested $38,846 million. The program has existed 
for 20 years. How many billions of dollars have been invested to 
date in a flawed policy which the country does not want?
<P>
	The policy is not working and even its target public, members 
of ethnic communities, are criticizing it. I cite as an example the 
overwhelming support for Neil Bissoondath's first book. His 
supporters were unanimous in saying that the government 
should only concern itself with helping immigrants to integrate 
into our society and fighting racism-end of story. He noted that 
the federal government's policy tended to create ethnic ghettos, 
which in no way foster integration and full participation in 
political, economic and social life.
<P>
	We also cannot leave unmentioned the absurdities made 
possible by the multiculturalism policy. Barely six months ago, 
a consultation paper from the Minister of Justice proposed that 
culture or religion be permitted as a defence against criminal 
charges. Because of the ensueing uproar, the minister had to 
recant and withdraw the proposal. That is one example of how 
far some people will go to promote different cultures.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to stress that a sovereign Quebec 
would continue to favour integration and respect. The current 
Minister of International Affairs, Cultural Communities and 
Immigration, Bernard Landry, confirmed that position just a 
month ago.
<P>
	Please allow me to quote him: ``Quebec will not use the public 
purse to subsidize cultural differences. Our government is 
against multiculturalism. Although the Quebec government 
acknowledges the fact that Quebec is multi-ethnic, it favours a 
policy of cultural convergence in one common culture, fortified 
by foreign sources''. That sums up well Quebec's position on 
multiculturalisml and deals with the issue effectively.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to address this House regarding Bill 
M-364, a motion advocating the transfer of responsibility for 
cultural preservation to individuals by discontinuing federal 
multicultural programs, proposed by the hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast. Today I would like to take the opportunity to 
address some of the arguments utilized by opponents of 
Canada's multicultural program.
<P>
	Unfortunately, over the past few years the spread of 
misinformation regarding our federal multicultural policy has 
been prevalent. The popular misconception of multiculturalism 
is of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11564"> 11564 </A></B>
<P>
a government-funded program that pays people to, first, keep 
their native cultures and  languages, and, second, that serves to 
divide the country. These myths have, to an extent, been further 
propagated following the release of Mr. Neil Bissoondath's 
recent book, entitled ``Selling Illusions: The Cult of 
Multiculturalism''. Although I certainly welcome this 
interesting publication as a means of stimulating debate in this 
area, I must also state my reservation about the unsubstantiated 
assertions made therein.
<P>
	Mr. Bissoondath has misread the effects of multiculturalism 
by insinuating that money spent on multicultural events will 
reinforce stereotypes and lead to a break-up of the country 
socially.
<P>
	I find perplexing the assumption that, for example, the 
display of a community's traditional dance could lead to 
divisiveness and negative stereotyping. This conclusion clearly 
is not credible. We know that multiculturalism does not promote 
or reinforce negative stereotypes.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	In reference to the dance, I and my family, as individuals and 
collectively, felt that we must preserve certain customs, 
traditions and beliefs. Based on those needs, because of our 
ethnic background, we preserved what we wanted, what we felt 
was honourable and desirable to preserve and pass on from 
generation to generation. One of those activities was Ukrainian 
dance. Everyone in my family learned how to do the Kolemyka, 
the Hopokola, and other dances, which we all immensely 
enjoyed, not only with our members of the family but with other 
people in the community.
<P>
	In these dances, there were not only those who were of 
Ukrainian ethnic background but of a multitude of ethnic 
backgrounds. That was the composition of the community in 
which I was raised. We all lived in perfect harmony with each 
other. No one decided that there should be a barrier between the 
Italians, the Germans, the Japanese, the Ukrainians or the 
Slovaks. We all had basically the same needs.
<P>
	Moreover, Mr. Bissoondath draws a link between 
multiculturalism and the marginalization of immigrants. He 
relates the story of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who, in a 
24-hour period, was transformed in media sports from ``the 
Canadian who had won Olympic gold through effort to the 
Jamaican immigrant who had lost it through use of drugs''. It 
was from the positive to the negative, from the Canadian to the 
Jamaican immigrant. In my mind it is very clear that this type of 
media report is a result of ignorance and unconscious prejudice. 
It is certainly not a result of multiculturalism's assumed 
marginalizing effects.
<P>
	The reality is that multiculturalism brings strength to this 
country. It is, however, a human characteristic to react in a 
reflex-like and emotional manner when confronted with 
unsubstantiated stories about certain communities. We should 
not allow rumours and hearsay to determine our policies. 
Unfounded stories are not based upon educated opinion and 
most certainly are not based upon facts.
<P>
	I expect that the Reform Party's position is the result of 
sloppy and inaccurate research because I certainly do not want 
to believe that they are intentionally misguiding the Canadian 
public. Not for one moment do I believe that they would do such 
a thing.
<P>
	However, Mr. Neil Bissoondath in his book, when referring to 
the Reform Party's opposition to multiculturalism, indicates:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>my attitude is at best suspicious. Reform strikes me as a party that suffers from 
an astounding lack of social generosity and counts among its membership too 
many who are either racially minded or, to coin a phrase, 
knowledge-challenged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Multiculturalism was officially introduced into Parliament on 
October 8, 1971. It was expected to be a vehicle through which 
we would achieve a cultural mosaic, as opposed to the U.S. 
melting pot. Today, 42 per cent of Canadians have origins that 
are other than British or French. While people with European 
origins still make up the largest number of Canadians, more and 
more immigrants are coming to Canada from Asia, Africa, the 
Middle East, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.
<P>
	This is changing the face of the Canadian population. In the 
1986 census, visible minorities accounted for 6.3 per cent of the 
Canadian population. By 1991 this figure was almost 10 per 
cent. The visible minority population of major cities is greater. 
For instance, in Toronto it is 26 per cent; Vancouver, 24 per cent; 
and in Montreal, 11 per cent.
<P>
	Canada's multiculturalism policy is one expression of 
leadership. The multiculturalism policy is rooted in Canadian 
values. It is consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, which establishes the fundamental freedoms and 
democratic rights of all individual Canadians, irrespective of 
national or ethnic origin. It is also consistent with the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, the Official Languages Act and the 
Citizenship Act.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Multiculturalism, as described under federal policy, is 
concerned with helping people become full participants in the 
life of Canada. It is certainly not concerned with the mandatory 
retention of culture and does not encourage cultural isolation, as 
some critics erroneously charge. There are the so-called ghettos 
of our communities where we my find, as we find in Thunder 
Bay, a large gathering of a certain group of people with a 
specific ethnic background. We find this happening because 
they choose to be neighbours. They choose based on their every 
day needs to be in constant contact with each other, to help each 
other, until they reach the point where they can communicate 
with anyone in their neighbourhood in the common language of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11565"> 11565 </A></B>
<P>
the area. In our case it could be English or, as in Quebec, it could 
be French.
<P>
	In 1993-94, $25.5 million was spent on the federal 
multicultural program, which is less than Brian Mulroney spent 
on his prime ministerial aircraft. The notion that $25.5 million 
per year, which is less than a dollar per citizen, could ensure the 
isolation of Canadians into cultural-ethnic cliques is hardly 
believable. Moreover, one must keep in mind that an important 
component of the original policy was founded on the assumption 
that encouraging people to be confident in their own cultures 
would allow them to be accepting of the cultures of other 
groups. The official policy encourages Canadians of all ethnic 
origins to participate fully in the economic and social life of 
Canada, sharing their cultures and histories with each other.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that members in the opposition benches are 
insinuating that multiculturalism and cultural diversity 
somehow preclude national unity and inhibit our ability to be 
part of the whole. This could not be further from the truth. 
Canadians of all origins do maintain a sense of their own 
cultural identity and at the same time adhere to the Canadian 
values of democracy and tolerance. There is no reason to believe 
that the two are mutually exclusive. That is a notion that has 
somehow been propagated by opponents of multiculturalism 
and it is extremely misleading and irresponsible. The proof for 
this is in the Canada of today. We are culturally diverse, and yet 
if we ask the majority of immigrants they will tell you that they 
are first and foremost Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to conclude with a quote from a Toronto <I>Star</I> 
article dated June 21, 1991. It refers to the experience of an 
author. Her name is Myrna Kostash, grand-daughter of 
Ukrainian immigrants that settled in Alberta. She stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Multiculturalism policy and its institutions allowed me to take part in 
Canadian life. It allowed me to get out of the ghetto. During my own childhood, 
ethnic cultures were private, taking place in Ukrainian churches and in youth 
groups. I was aware that I was dropping out of my peer group in order to be 
Ukrainian. But with the advent of multiculturalism, I felt that when I spoke as a 
Canadian-Ukrainian writer, I was doing it within the mainstream institutions of 
Canadian literary life. I became a Canadian through this sense of entitlement. I 
didn't have to choose between public and private cells. Both came together 
through multiculturalism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise in the House to speak in favour of my 
colleague's motion, private member's motion No. 364. The 
motion provides for the transfer of the control of 
multiculturalism away from the federal government to 
individuals. Essentially, the motion put forward by my 
colleague from Calgary Southeast calls for the withdrawal of 
federal funding to multicultural groups.
<P>
	I concur with that objective. However, just because I think the 
state should not be funding various cultural groups does not 
mean that I dislike these groups. Just because I disagree with 
government imposed multicultural policies it should not be 
construed to suggest that I dislike other linguistic or ethnic 
groups. I  am arguing against government policy, not against 
cultural groups.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	After all my roots are different from the roots of many other 
people. Together those generations of various ancestral heritage 
came to this country to settle and build what became by far the 
best country in the world. This country was opened up, settled 
and built without a multicultural policy. In fact I doubt if the 
term multiculturalism was even coined when my parents came 
to this country back in the twenties.
<P>
	My roots are a mixture, a real hodge-podge so to speak. My 
linguistic heritage is Prussian German but my ancestral 
affiliation and connection include not only central European 
heritage but east European heritage, Slavic heritage, including 
Ukrainian, Polish and Russian. My parents understood and 
spoke these languages, plus what they called Yiddish. I am led to 
believe that Yiddish is a kind of Germanic way of speaking 
Hebrew. If that makes any linguistic sense I really do not know. 
In a land, in a country, that encompasses much of the earth's land 
mass with over 150 cultural groups, who am I to question what 
makes sense in that part of the world. Come to think of it, 
perhaps there are lessons to be learned given the turmoil that 
existed for centuries in tsarist imperial Russia, then in the 
former Soviet Union and presently in the newly created state of 
Russia.
<P>
	My parents left their homelands, along with hundreds of 
thousands of other people from that area, having lived in those 
lands for almost 200 years. They left to escape the tyranny that 
was to enslave the people for over 70 years. They came to 
Canada, where everything was new and very unfamiliar. They 
had nothing when they came halfway around the world.
<P>
	However they had freedom. They had liberty. They had liberty 
and freedom that the people back in the land from whence my 
parents came could not even imagine or dream about. My 
parents embraced their newly adopted country with energy and a 
zeal that was typical of newcomers during that time. Like those 
who came from places other than Britain, they soon learned 
English like everyone else. Some youngsters did not learn 
English until they started school.
<P>
	For years, for generations, like thousands of families not only 
from eastern Europe but from all over the world they held on to 
some aspects of the culture that they had lived with before they 
came to this country.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you want to know something? These people 
all came usually with little or no money and they received not 
one thin dime from government. Not only did they not ask for 
money, they did not expect any government money. They came 
to this country for freedom and for the tremendous opportunities 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11566"> 11566 </A></B>
<P>
that this great and beautiful land afforded them. They settled and 
built communities that helped to build this country.
<P>
	I suggest to the multicultural minister that what transpired 
during those pioneering decades was real, genuine, unvarnished 
multiculturalism. All these people, these families from varied 
backgrounds, from different parts of the world worked together 
and co-operated to build churches, schools and communities. 
Together they worked to build the country.
<P>
	That was multiculturalism at its finest with no government 
dollars. They were all proud of the fact that they had become and 
were Canadian.
<P>
	Since government funding for all types of programs began, 
many communities have divided. Friction and animosity has 
developed. Dependency on the state, on government handouts 
has been created. Apparently the multicultural minister thinks 
so too because she has recently mused that Canada has no 
culture.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest the minister leave the confines of Montreal 
and Ottawa and visit rural Canada, the west and Atlantic 
Canada. She might be pleasantly surprised, if she stays for 
awhile, of the flourishing culture that she might not only see but 
also feel. I suspect culture in this country would flourish even 
more and probably bring Canadians closer together from all 
parts of the country if the state would only get its nasty little 
nose out of culture, along with its close sister multiculturalism.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know I have a very short time so I will try to be brief. 
It is very difficult to be brief.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is about a participatory democracy. The 
members opposite have consistently used the myths out there in 
society to defend a position instead of using that which they 
know to be the truth and the facts from the department itself.
<P>
	My colleague and I were talking about experiences when we 
were growing up, experiences that are still happening today, 
where the teachers would stream whole classrooms of kids into 
vocational schools because they were Italian, Portuguese, 
Ukrainian, Polish or what have you. That happened then and it is 
happening now in Toronto with the Portuguese kids. It is 
happening with the black children. It is happening everywhere.
<P>
	Multiculturalism tries to break down those kinds of barriers 
so that those children have equal access by providing race 
relations programs and holding discussions in schools to 
understand the differences, that these children are not inferior in 
any way. We were not. My whole generation was streamed into 
vocational schools when we came to this country. 
Multiculturalism empowered my whole generation and a lot of 
other Canadians who were of different backgrounds and did not 
have the ability.
<P>
	I will tell another story. Earlier today we were talking about 
Harbourfront. Not long ago, in the late 1980s, a group was 
putting on a poetry reading. They were choosing the names of 
poets who were published but not yet well known across Canada. 
One of the staffers who happened to be of Ukrainian background 
said: ``Oh, there is a really good poet I know in Toronto who is 
published in his community but not across the country. His name 
is Pier Giorgio DeCicco''. They said: ``This is for Canadians, 
not for foreigners''.
<P>
	The multiculturalism policy is intended to create 
participatory democracy, to give access, to give equality, to 
allow Canada to evolve into a strong nation.
<P>
	We talk about the fact that we are Canadians and we have all 
these common symbols but it is a bunch of garbage and words 
because it means bloody nothing when it comes down to the 
facts and the lives of every Canadian, when it comes to the 
systemic discrimination that exists in all institutions.
<P>
	I spent 20 years of my life working in Toronto with 
multicultural and immigrant groups. Most of that time I spent 
fighting the invisible discrimination and systemic barriers in the 
school systems and in social services that people could not 
access because they were not of Anglo background. To this day 
in metropolitan Toronto, one still cannot access the majority of 
the dollars for social programs unless one is from the Anglo 
community.
<P>
	This is about participatory democracy, rights, equality and 
being a Canadian. The members opposite should inform 
themselves before they speak about myths.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of things I would like to say. First, I have very much 
appreciated having the opportunity to debate this matter today 
with other members of the House. I note their passion and their 
sense of wanting to debate this further. To that end I would seek 
unanimous consent of the House that this become a votable item 
and move it to committee as quickly as possible for further 
discussion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent. The time

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to follow up on a question I asked the Minister of Justice on 
February 15. It regards the disturbing trend whereby defence 
lawyers subpoena private and confidential files and records 
from counsellors at sexual assault centres, from psychiatrists, 
doctors and other personal counsellors for use in the defence of 
their clients.
<P>
	I thank the minister for his attention to this issue and for his 
informed response. However, I would like to share with the 
House the angst and concern that exists among constituents in 
my riding when they think of these personal documents being 
brought into the courtroom.
<P>
	I like to share with the House some words from a constituent 
who wrote to me: ``For many of us, the only safe place to talk 
about our injuries is in therapy. Therapy is a place where victims 
can learn to re-establish their own self-worth without being 
abused again. The counsellor offers the support that is 
desperately needed in order to learn how to set safe boundaries, 
learn about self-worth, the right to privacy, that it is okay to say 
no, it is okay to validate our own needs, it is okay to be angry and 
how to express that anger in a safe and constructive manner.
<P>
	``In therapy, we learn that we are not powerless to our 
perpetrators and that it was not okay to be violated in the manner 
in which we were. We are given a place to safely express our 
emotions and validate our own feelings, even if we are the only 
ones that do. For many of us this is the only safe support that we 
have.
<P>
	``This is a very sad day because now the defence lawyers want 
to take away what little privacy we as victims have and violate 
us all over again. My therapy is very personal to me. I can talk 
about my pain and my goals, my hopes and my fears. I pay good 
money for the right for that support to allow me to create my 
own boundaries. I urge you as a representative of my 
government to stop this injustice''.
<P>
	Those words are poignant and they are instructive. They tell 
us that victims of violence do not want these very private and 
therapeutic conversations to be part of the courtroom 
proceedings.
<P>
	In 1992 the House passed very good legislation with the rape 
shield law. We know recently that in Nova Scotia the law was 
challenged and fortunately, the Minister of Justice intervened 
and the integrity of that law was maintained. With this right to 
subpoena we see a back door approach to get confidential 
information into  the courtrooms where it should not be and 
where it creates difficulties for people like my constituent.
<P>
	I know the minister is working very hard on this. I know he 
has intervened in the Supreme Court case that is reviewing the 
result of a B.C. appeal that would require strict controls over the 
use of this information in court. I thank the minister for that 
intervention. I hope the Supreme Court will judge in favour and 
allow the result of the appeal in the B.C. judgment to be 
available to all of us in Canada.
<P>
	I ask the minister to continue his diligent review in this 
regard. I realize the issues are complex, but I ask him to find a 
balance between providing a fair trial for the accused and for the 
victim a right to privacy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member for Brant has said, this is a 
troubling and complex issue which places in conflict two 
compelling sets of interests.
<P>
	On the one hand, victims need to be able to seek counselling 
and medical assistance in confidence and with full respect for 
their privacy and personal integrity, both at the time of their 
counselling and later on in any court proceedings. On the other 
hand, people accused of serious offences need to be able to bring 
forth relevant evidence that may establish their innocence. 
Courts across the country are grappling in individual cases with 
the very difficult balance of victims' and accused persons' 
interests.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada heard argument on this issue in 
the case of O'Connor v. the Queen on February 1. The federal 
government intervened in that case to urge the court to endorse a 
strengthened version of the guidelines developed by the British 
Columbia Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court has reserved its 
decision.
<P>
	The O'Connor guidelines developed by the B.C. Court of 
Appeal are designed to prevent fishing expeditions into the 
complainant's past. They place the onus on the person seeking 
access to the records to establish that they are relevant. This is 
done through a two part procedure which may be done in camera 
with a ban on publication and at which the complainant and the 
holder of the records are not compellable witnesses.
<P>
	At present and subject to the decision of the Supreme Court, 
the O'Connor procedure is binding only in British Columbia. At 
a January federal-provincial-territorial meeting of ministers 
responsible for justice, it was agreed to review the B.C. Court of 
Appeal guidelines with a view to having them adopted in each 
jurisdiction. This would govern the situation pending the 
decision of the Supreme Court in O'Connor and pending any 
new legislation in that area.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11568"> 11568 </A></B>
<P>
	It was further agreed that the issue requires urgent attention. 
Consequently, officials were directed to work on it and report 
to the deputy ministers at their next meeting in the spring.
<P>
	The Department of Justice is consulting with interested 
groups and individuals to determine how personal records are in 
fact used, to fully explore all perspectives and concerns, and to 
develop ways of balancing the complainant's interests with 
those of the accused.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on March 29 I rose in the Chamber to put a question 
to the Minister of the Environment. At that time world leaders 
were just beginning talks in Berlin aimed at stabilizing levels of 
greenhouse gases now threatening earth's climate.
<P>
	The talks are the result of the June 1992 meetings of 106 of the 
world's nations. Those talks were held in Rio de Janeiro with the 
purpose to sign the framework convention on climate change.
<P>
	Since that meeting in Rio, more than 100 nations have ratified 
the Rio treaty. Now in Berlin the world's leaders are meeting to 
assess our progress since 1992 and consider proposals to 
strengthen the agreement.
<P>
	Sadly, as important and indeed as critical as this is, there is 
not much to assess. Canada, like so many other countries that 
made commitments to the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions, has failed miserably to live up to those 
commitments. As we speak tonight, the Minister of the 
Environment is likely in Berlin. Just as likely, she is 
embarrassed by the position Canada is in with regard to the 
commitments we made in Rio.
<P>
	When we look at what has happened since Rio, we do not have 
to look far to see that nearly nine billion more tonnes of carbon 
have accumulated in the atmosphere and the evidence of climate 
change is mounting. In fact, in response to the crisis the Minister 
of the Environment acknowledged the crisis and even went so 
far as to say that if Canada and the other nations which are 
emitting greenhouse gases do not do something about this, 
climate change and global warming will create a situation where 
floods will occur off the east coast of Canada and tiny but 
beautiful Prince Edward Island will be all but submerged.
<P>
	It is hard for me to imagine that the Minister of the 
Environment knows about the possibility of this catastrophic 
event and she is not prepared to take immediate and dramatic 
steps to combat it. I hope we do not have to wait for the day when 
my good friends in Prince Edward Island are looking for new 
homes in Ontario or Saskatchewan before we begin to take this 
issue seriously.
<P>
	Carbon emissions are increasing. This represents a trend that 
is moving dangerously in the wrong direction.
<P>
	According to the latest <I>Worldwatch</I> magazine, in order to stop 
the accumulation of greenhouse gases and allow the earth to 
return to equilibrium over a period of centuries-yes, you heard 
me correctly, Mr. Speaker, I said centuries-scientists say that 
carbon emissions will have to be reduced to the rate at which the 
oceans can absorb them, or 60 to 80 per cent below today's rate.
<P>
	Yet on the current path, emissions are projected to increase by 
60 per cent within the next two decades. Obviously the earth's 
atmosphere will require sharp cuts in industrial country 
emissions and a rapid slowdown in emissions growth in 
developing countries. This means that all the nations of the 
world need to have action plans in place to guide the progress of 
this critical issue. No nation can afford to sit on the sidelines.
<P>
	It is clear the world is facing an issue with uniquely large and 
irreversible consequences. The delegates in Berlin cannot afford 
to waste the opportunity to begin turning the ship around. Given 
that, I ask the minister why Canada's wimpy actions on climate 
change are not as forceful as our resolve to preserve the fish 
stocks off the Atlantic coast.
<P>
	I hope the government today is prepared to say we have to do 
better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the federal government in partnership with the 
provinces and territories has reached a national consensus on the 
directions Canada will take to address the challenge of climate 
change.
<P>
	In a meeting in Toronto on February 20, energy and 
environment ministers from the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments agreed to Canada's national action 
program on climate change. The Deputy Prime Minister tabled 
the action plan today at the first conference of the parties to the 
framework convention on climate change in Berlin.
<P>
	The action program sets out the strategic directions Canada 
will follow to meet its commitment to stabilize greenhouse gas 
emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The action program is 
based on the principle of sustainable development as advocated 
by the Brundtland commission, an approach in which 
environmental, social and economic policies are fully 
integrated.
<P>
	Consequently, the action program provides the opportunity 
for each jurisdiction in Canada to undertake actions appropriate 
to their circumstances. The program is a living document. The 
federal, provincial and territorial governments are committed to 
reviewing the program regularly to ensure that Canada's 
stabilization commitment is met.
<P>
	Toward that end all ministers committed to review progress 
by late 1990 and agreed to continue developing options to close 
the 13 per cent stabilization gap that currently exists. The 
release today of Quebec's action plan on climate change is a 
noteworthy example of the action being taken by other 
jurisdictions in Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11569"> 11569 </A></B>
<P>
	The aim of this government as stated in the red book is to 
co-operatively work with provincial and urban governments to 
improve energy efficiency and increase the use of renewable 
energies.
<P>
	Responding to the challenge of climate change represents a 
tremendous opportunity for Canadians to use their 
entrepreneurial spirit to forge ahead with creative and credible 
solutions, solutions that work for the environment and for our 
economy.
