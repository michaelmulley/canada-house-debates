</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
feel bound to address the ongoing impact of the Harris 
reformatory government's decisions on health care and hospital 
closures in Ontario.  Certain falsehoods must be dispelled about 
this issue.  The reduction in transfer payments to the Ontario 
government represents, at most, 2.5% of Ontario's revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Harris reformatories come clean on this issue? 
When will they admit to Ontarians that the cuts in health and 
hospital services were made to finance the Harris government's 
income tax cuts?  Why do they not acknowledge that the federal 
Liberals reinstated $1.5 billion in cash payments in the last 
budget, bringing the cash total to $12.5 billion per year?  Why 
do the Harris reformatories never mention the big increases to 
the provinces in tax points under the federal Liberals?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier this month when former 
professional wrestler Jesse “The Body” Ventura was elected 
Governor of Minnesota there were some comparisons between the 
first member of the American Reform Party elected to office and 
the election of our first Reformer, the hon. member for Edmonton 
North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is true that the two have something in common, namely 
that either of them could whup any member on the government 
benches with one arm tied behind their back, there are actually a 
number of similarities between Jesse Ventura and the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Ventura and the Prime Minister are adept at applying the 
choke hold.  Ventura perfected the manoeuvre known as the “pile 
driver” and the Minister of Finance has mastered the art of 
driving piles of dollars out of the country with his tax 
policies.  And how could we overlook Ventura's experience as a 
trained navy SEAL when the Liberal backbenches are filled with 
trained seals?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, pork 
producers are being devastated by low prices.  Hogs are selling 
for half the cost of producing them.  Last Friday I met with over 
70 hog farmers in my constituency office in Smithville.  These 
are efficient, hardworking producers who know their business, but 
they have been caught in circumstances beyond their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hog farmers recognize that their industry is cyclical and they 
prepare for the normal ups and downs, but the situation they find 
themselves in is not normal.  Pork producers and other farmers 
who export their product are suffering from the fallout of the 
Asian economic crisis and its spinoffs.  Canadian exporters have 
lost their markets and oversupply has depressed prices globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm income situation is urgent.  The Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food has been working with farm leaders and 
his provincial counterparts to find a solution to the problem.  I 
encourage him to create a national disaster program that will 
kick in when the safety net system proves insufficient.

Mr. Speaker, the trotters were at the post and the crowd held its 
breath in great anticipation.  And then they were off, in the 
1998 Breeder's Crown championship which featured the best horses 
in the world.  After the dust had settled the winner was the 
magnificent trotting machine, Muscles Yankee, who raced to 
victory for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The horse, of course, is Canadian owned by Irving Liverman of 
Montreal and Canadian driven by John Campbell.  The much 
respected and highly regarded Mr. Liverman cheered as the Hall of 
Famer, the world's greatest driver, John Campbell, masterfully 
manoeuvred Muscles to victory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a fellow owner and driver, I truly appreciate and applaud the 
dedication, drive and determination needed to excel in the sport 
of harness racing.  Congratulations to the Canadian connection of 
Messieurs Liverman and Campbell.  They are a true credit to 
maintaining this country's proud tradition of excellence in the 
field of harness horse racing.

while Canadian farmers face an income crisis, as provinces 
deliver health care with as little as 11% funding from the health 
minister and as workers continue to overpay employment insurance 
premiums it comes as an absolute shock for taxpayers to learn 
that the federal government is still blowing tens of thousands of 
dollars on perks and feel-good retreats for Canada's civil 
servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In two retreats put on by PA Douglas & Associates last year the 
federal government forked out $112,000 so that bureaucrats from 
government departments could be put up in the Banff Springs Hotel

continues to show a preference for extravagant perks.  Instead of 
choosing to put money back into the pockets of hardworking 
Canadians through tax cuts, the Liberals choose to put 
bureaucrats into expensive resort hotels.

One of their many battles remains current and is being followed 
by the Bloc Quebecois.  I refer to the cuts to employment 
insurance, which have resulted in the exclusion of six out of 
ten unemployed individuals from the plan, a reduction in 
benefits and social assistance for hundreds of thousands of

voice, free from political interference, she has only one option. 
End the delays in processing NAC's application for funding, 
restore core funding for women's groups and reverse the cuts the 
government has made.

rise today to recognize Mr. Bill Mathews, a constituent of mine. 
I was recently informed that Bill volunteered his time and 
business expertise to assist in developing the business skills of 
a firm in one of the world's most volatile and disadvantaged 
economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill was a CESO volunteer in Russia at a corporation that 
processes soybean products.  During his tenure at this Russian 
business Bill was able to share his knowledge in areas such as 
how to expand operations into a franchising system and in 
construction methods for growth of the company's existing 
infrastructure.  He provided a plan to develop the basement of 
the company's headquarters which included cost estimates and 
design work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Bill made a substantial difference in the way this 
firm conducted its day to day operations.  Because of Bill's 
efforts the efficiency and future prospects of this company were 
improved, which in turn will result in more economic output and 
growth.  This will result in an improvement in areas such as 
employee wages and their standard of living, while at the same 
time helping to enhance the labour standards of the country as a 
whole.  I applaud Bill's efforts because I feel that they 
represent a concrete example of how a hand up is often more 
beneficial than a handout.

got himself into trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, he started off by saying that the report to be 
submitted by the RCMP complaints commission might not be made 
public, but he later backpedaled, under pressure from the Prime 
Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not more confirmation that the real decision maker in 
the whole APEC issue is the Prime Minister, and that the

and his office? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the solicitor general clarified the situation yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said the commission's report would be made public. This is 
crystal clear. When he answered the question, he had a doubt. He 
made inquiries, as any cautious person would do, and in the

clear reply that the report would be made public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

commission cannot get to the bottom of the whole APEC scandal.

who had seen me giving orders there.  I was talking to my staff. 
The eye witness did not understand a word.  I was giving orders 
in French to my staff.  She never retracted that. She said to 
this House that we had called the president of the university. 
It was totally false because it was the president of the 
university who called Mr. Goldenberg who in turn made sure 
through Mr. Pelletier that the university was satisfied.

apparently there is no apology from the Prime Minister who 
accused the member for Palliser of being a reporter for the 
<I>National Enquirer</I>, a reporter accused by the then solicitor 
general of fabricating his story.  The story has been proven 
true. The former solicitor general did prejudice the inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister does not have the humility to apologize to 
Canadians, will he undo the damage by launching a full, 
independent judicial inquiry to get at the truth about Spray-PEC?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is not very complicated.  The commission is looking 
at all the arguments.  The commission has not ruled on the 
affirmation she made.  Again, she should wait to have the facts. 
If there is a ruling by the commission that the commission has 
been prejudiced, we will recognize that.  But there is no 
decision, so she should wait a bit and check her facts.  She is 
not very good on that.

company in Burnaby to shred 22,000 boxes of confidential

Golden West Document Shredding did not shred the documents.  In

their private files sold to the highest bidder? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is

</I></B></P><P align=left>The shredding of documents is a very simple issue.  We would 
think the Liberals have had a lot of experience with this, with

for the Minister of Industry. 
Yesterday, the Minister of Industry again contradicted himself 
by confirming that Bill C-54 would indeed apply to Quebec.  Since 
1994, however, Quebec has had privacy legislation that is a 
model for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's bill represents a clear step backwards for 
Quebeckers. 
What will it take for the minister to recognize the value of 
Quebec's experience and to offer Canadians federal legislation 
that is as complete and effective as what Quebec already has? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
answer is quite simple.  We have a bill that could complement 
the very good legislation passed by the Johnson government in 
Quebec to protect the interests of Quebeckers in provincially 
regulated areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will make it possible to protect the interests of all 
Quebeckers in federally regulated areas, as well in other 
provinces that perhaps prefer to leave this up to the federal 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>

minister does not understand his own bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers Boisclair and Beaudoin wrote the minister that the 
proposed federal legislation seriously undermined privacy in 
Quebec.  Yet the minister could have built on Quebec's

Statistics Canada reported yesterday that the number of full time

</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the jobs that were created were either part time jobs

<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we were in opposition we repeatedly pointed out to 
the government the principal defects in its economic policy which 
led to the very situation that has been described by Statistics 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why when we came into office in 1993 we immediately 
began to remedy the situation.  I am delighted to say that since

blah, blah, blah.  That is not the right answer.  That is not the 
answer at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada has the answer.  It says that at least part of 
the problem is high payroll taxes in Canada.  The minister takes 
credit for interest rates that are set in the United States. 
When is he going to start to take the blame for high payroll 
taxes that he has direct responsibility for?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is we have reduced payroll taxes every year 
since we have come into office.  Payroll taxes are such a clear

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of his and the government's rhetoric about job creation 
Statistics Canada, the government's own agency, paints an 
entirely different picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The jobless rate in Canada is almost 50% higher than the in U.S. 
Among older men it is 140% higher and almost twice as high among 
older women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy behind these numbers is manifested in every 
community across the country.  The government has this don't 
worry, be happy attitude.  That is an insult to all Canadians who 
cannot find work and feed their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Finance dispute Statistics Canada's 
analysis of this crisis situation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in fact what Statistics Canada has pointed out are the 
very problems we raised when we were in opposition, the problems 
with the then government's administration of the economy.  That 
is why we brought in the changes we did.  That is why today we 
have low interest rates, we have eliminated the deficit and it is 
why we have one of the best job creation records of any of the 
G-7 countries.  As I mentioned, it is paying off.  Since 1996 
over 800,000 new jobs have been created, better than any other 
G-7 country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this must be why our offices are inundated by people 
on EI, trying to get EI, trying to find work.  The government's 
policies are simply not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My supplementary is to the Prime Minister.  When the Prime

established the national forum on health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the record of the government on job creation is pretty 
impressive. Since we took office, more than 1.3 million new jobs 
have been created.  When we took over the unemployment level was 
11.4%.  It is down to 8.1%.  I think we have done very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course our unemployment level is not as low as that of the 
United States.  In Canada we have a much better safety net for 
protecting people.  We have minimum wage and a lot of social 
programs not available in many parts of the U.S.

confiscated and sold, the 1984 Liberal government steadfastly 
refused to apologize or even compensate these individuals for 
that shameful injustice.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PROTECTION OF PRIVACY (SOCIAL INSURANCE NUMBERS) ACT

<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-456, an act to protect personal privacy by 
restricting the use of social insurance numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, nowadays every time a person applies to 
rent an apartment, to open a bank account or just about anything, 
the first question they are asked is “What is your social 
insurance number?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are millions and millions of unused social insurance 
numbers that are floating around the country.  In fact, the 
auditor general reported recently about the alarming number of 
social insurance numbers that are floating around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is it immoral, but it is unfair for anyone to request 
the social insurance number of another person, unless they are 
required by law to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure it becomes illegal.  To that extent, this 
bill would make it illegal for anyone to ask for a social 
insurance number unless it is required by law to ask for that 
number.  As a result, we will be able to solve the problem.  One 
person should not be able to require another person to give their 
social insurance number unless the request is specifically 
required by law or unless the person making the request advises 
the other person in writing that it is not necessary to comply 
with the request and that there will not be a penalty for failing 
to do so.

another step in the government's efforts to put Canada squarely 
at the international forefront of tobacco control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members will recall, in the spring of 1997 the House 
passed Bill C-71, the Tobacco Act, which instituted a number of 
stringent restrictions on the marketing of tobacco products.  It 
was a strong law then and it went a long way toward protecting 
the Canadian public from the ravages of smoking.  It was a 
necessary law, because smoking is a public health crisis and it 
is of extraordinary proportions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments contained in the legislation before us today 
would make that strong law even stronger.  By phasing out over 
five years all tobacco company sponsorship promotions of 
entertainment and sporting events, Bill C-42 reinforces this 
government's commitment to protecting Canadians and in 
particular, impressionable young people from the noxious 
influence of cigarette marketing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we will be sending a powerful and historic 
message to Canadians and in particular to cigarette 
manufacturers.  We will be saying in no uncertain terms that 
tobacco smoke is public health enemy number one.  We will be 
saying that we will not tolerate the multinational tobacco 
industry targeting our young people in any attempt to convince 
them to pick up the habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to briefly outline the contents of Bill C-42.  As hon. 
members will recall, one section of the Tobacco Act includes 
restrictions on the way tobacco companies could advertise and 
promote their financial sponsorship of events such as automobile 
racing, show jumping, musical events and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence they could only display their brand names and logos 
on the bottom 10% on the face of ads, signs, billboards and so 
on.  This restriction raised concerns.  The motor sport industry, 
for instance, feared that the sudden loss of corporate 
sponsorship would jeopardize Canada's capacity to host 
international racing events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 addresses these concerns.  It proposes a phased 
approach which would delay the enforcement of the Tobacco Act 
promotional restrictions for two years.  For the subsequent three 
years cigarette companies would be allowed to continue sponsoring 
events.  However, their promotional activities outside the actual 
site, off site, will be restricted to the 10% size restrictions 
specified in the Tobacco Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of five years, by 2003, promotional sponsorship by 
cigarette makers will be banned altogether.  That is why I say 
that Bill C-42 strengthens the Tobacco Act.  Instead of merely 
restricting promotional activity, the bill will prohibit them 
entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These legislative changes will put Canada ahead of other nations 
that hold the health of their citizens in high regard.  Indeed we 
are moving faster than Australia and the European Union, which 
are both implementing a similar sponsorship ban in the year 2006, 
three years after ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that some of the cultural and sporting groups 
may feel the financial pinch when the cigarette manufacturing 
giants are forced to withdraw their millions of dollars in 
sponsorship promotion.   However, the fact is arts organizations 
and sports promoters told us over and over again that what they 
really needed was time to find alternative sources of funding 
support.  That, in a nutshell, is the purpose of Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups told us that they also needed fairness.  Thus under 
the proposed amendments every group from the Newfoundland 
Symphony Orchestra to the Victoria International Jazz Festival 
will be treated the same.  One group will not be entitled to 
cigarette money that is denied to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to point out that with Bill C-71, as with 
Bill C-42 before us today, the government has sought to protect 
public health while at the same time respecting legitimate 
concerns of cultural and sports organizations.  As such Bill C-42 
represents a careful compromise, a delicate balance between those 
who would desire a complete ban, preferably yesterday, and those 
who feel it is equally necessary to accommodate sponsored sports, 
cultural and entertainment events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Striking that balance has necessitated extensive consultations 
both with health groups and with representatives of the arts and 
entertainment industry.  In that context I wish to acknowledge 
the important contribution of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee of Health in carrying forward the consultation process 
and refining the bill before us today.  As a result of the 
committee hearings, the government listened and further 
strengthened Bill C-42 as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the start of the phase-in period of the bill is clearly 
identified as October 1, 1998.  This means that if the 
legislation passes, the five year clock will have already begun 
ticking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the grandfathering clause in Bill C-42 would only apply 
to events that had been held in Canada.  In other words, 
promoters would not be able to move an event here from the United 
States or elsewhere merely to benefit from the phase-in 
provisions of the ban on cigarette sponsorship advertising.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the new amendments would permit the grandfathering only 
of events that have been held in Canada in the 15 months prior to 
April 25, 1997.  That would prevent promoters from resurrecting 
long dead festivals solely for their value as tobacco marketing 
vehicles.  These changes to Bill C-42 were proposed by the health 
community, were adopted by the government and are consistent with 
our public health approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we have all heard the alarming facts.  Smoking is 
far and away the major preventable cause of death and disease in 
Canada.  It is estimated that nearly one in five deaths in Canada 
can be attributed to smoking and that is more than suicides, 
vehicle crashes, AIDS and murder combined.  Every year 45,000 
Canadians die of cancer, heart disease and lung disease as a 
result of tobacco use.  Many more Canadians have their quality of 
life compromised by emphysema and other respiratory ailments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that many people get hooked on smoking during their teen 
years and that young people are particularly vulnerable to peer 
pressure and messages, sometimes subliminal, encouraging them to 
smoke.  Obviously as a caring society we have a moral obligation 
to act.  We have a responsibility toward future generations and a 
duty to help our impressionable young people resist the lure of 
this deadly habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health groups across the country urged us to lead the fight 
against smoking.  We have not failed them.  The Tobacco Act, as 
we propose to amend it, would give the government some meaningful 
ammunition in the battle against cigarette use.  The legislation 
gives us as a society the power to look a gift horse in the 
mouth.  We will have the wherewithal to say to tobacco 
manufacturers “Thanks, but no thanks.  We value the health of 
our children too much to accept your money for event 
sponsorship”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore urge all parties to support the bill so that 
step by step we can win the battle against tobacco use and 
achieve our goal of a smoke free society and a healthier Canada. 
I would like to share my remaining time with the member for Oak 
Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give unanimous consent 
to allow the hon. member to share her time with the hon. member 
for Oak Ridges? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There are 30 minutes remaining in the 
hon. member's time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of the amendment to the Tobacco Act 
placed before the House by the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment's proposal for a complete ban on the promotion of 
tobacco sponsorship is a step to be applauded and supported by 
all members of the House.  It is a significant protective measure 
that will help reduce youth smoking and ultimately save young 
lives.  It says no once and for all to tobacco companies using 
sponsorship to link their deadly products to popular youth 
oriented events and lifestyles.  It says no to the consistent 
barrage of images that encourage young people to take up smoking 
and stay addicted to cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is the result of extensive consultation with many 
concerned parties across the country.  As a result of this 
consultation we have proposed legislation that takes us further 
than ever before in protecting children and youth from harmful 
effects of tobacco.  The latest consultations carried out this 
month by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health 
confirmed the need for firm legislation to reduce tobacco use 
among youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee listened carefully to the views of a number of 
groups before approving three new recommendations from the 
Canadian Cancer Society and other health NGOs.  The 
recommendations presented today as amendments to the legislation 
make the bill a stronger, more precise instrument for reducing 
tobacco use among Canadian youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As past president of the Canadian Parks and Recreation 
Association I worked a few years ago with the then minister of 
health on a program called a break free all stars program aimed 
at making sure that young people between seven and and twelve 
years of age did not smoke or take up smoking. 
I know these kinds of programs can be and are effective.  I 
applaud the government for the type of legislation that it is 
bringing to the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question the bill specifically identifies October 1, 
1998 as the start date for the transition.  In effect this means 
that the five year clock has already begun to tick down on 
sponsorship promotion if the amendment and bill pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill mandates that the only events which can be 
grandfathered would be those that have been held in Canada, 
although it was never the government's intent to allow otherwise. 
The change will make it clear that an event cannot be moved from 
elsewhere into Canada and treated as if it has always been here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill mandates that only events which have been held in 
Canada between January 25, 1996 and April 25, 1997 can be 
grandfathered.  Once again it was never the government's intent 
to allow events to be resurrected solely for their value as 
marketing tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All three of these changes are important clarifications that are 
completely consistent with strengthening the government's health 
objectives.  I thank members of the Standing Committee on Health 
for supporting the inclusion of three amendments in the bill.  No 
doubt critics of the legislation will claim that the government 
is going too far.  Given the alarming statistics on youth and 
smoking in Canada today, the amendment is appropriate and 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former educator having worked with young people for 20 
years, I can tell the House of the devastating effects on young 
people who take up smoking and who get addicted.  I will point 
out some statistics which will illustrate what the government is 
trying to prevent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smoking among Canadian teens between 15 and 19 years of age has 
increased 25% since 1991.  Currently one in three young Canadians 
smoke and half of them will die prematurely of tobacco related 
disease.  It is for that important reason the Minister of Health 
has called tobacco use by Canada's youth an urgent public issue. 
The amendment before the House today is a firm response to the 
issue on the part of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response is clearly in line with the attitude 
of Canadians toward smoking.  Canadians recognize that smoking is 
our number one health problem.  They are also all too aware of 
the devastation tobacco has wreaked upon the health of our 
current generation.  They implore the government to make every 
effort to ensure that such devastation will not be inflicted on 
future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to youth and smoking the statistics show that we 
have our work cut out for us: 29% of 15 to 19 year olds and 7% of 
10 to 14 year old are current smokers.  According to the 1994 
youth smoking survey, 260,000 kids in Canada between the ages of 
10 and 19 were beginner smokers that year.  Figures like these 
are very disturbing.  They are being replicated in other 
countries and have prompted other governments and the World 
Health Organization to classify smoking as a global pediatric 
epidemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assumption patterns reveal that the number of young female 
smokers has been rising significantly.  Again I can speak from 
personal experience having taught for many years.  Girls in 
particular smoke early, continue to smoke and are less likely to 
break the habit.  As all youth smokers get older, they smoke 
more.  Smokers 10 to 14 years of age on average smoke seven 
cigarettes a day.  Of those 15 to 19 years of age smoke on 
average 11 cigarettes a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is striking as evidence of youth smoking is the knowledge 
among youth about the effects of tobacco use. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 90% of people between the ages of 10 and 19 believe 
that tobacco is addictive.  A similar percentage believes that 
environmental tobacco smoke can be harmful to the health of 
people who do not smoke themselves.  About 85% of all smokers 
surveyed say they began smoking before they were 16 years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own father, who passed away six years ago, started smoking 
when he was 13.  He died of lung cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The critical time for smoking decisions appears to be between 
the ages of 12 and 14.  Therefore, it is hardly surprising that 
tobacco sponsorship targets events like music festivals, tennis 
tournaments and motor racing, which are popular with this age 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For young people, taking up smoking is a gradual process.  It 
begins with forming a predisposition to smoke; that is, a 
perception that smoking is normal behaviour and acceptable in 
society among one's peer group.  The perception of normalcy and 
acceptability that cigarettes are an integral part of a happy and 
fulfilling life is exactly the perception that tobacco 
sponsorship promotion encourages among children and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trying smoking can lead to the experimental stage when smoking 
happens repeatedly but irregularly.  Regular use and addiction 
follow.  The transition from trying to daily use takes an average 
of two to three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About two-thirds of teens will try smoking and about one-half of 
this group will become regular daily smokers.  About 90% of 
smokers start well before the age of 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In surveys, youth have told us that they never expected to 
become addicted, believing instead that they would be able to 
quit whenever they wanted to do so.  Just as addiction to 
cigarettes is a gradual process, so is quitting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many young people contemplate quitting, prepare to quit and then 
try to quit.  But quitting is not an easy proposition.  That is 
because nicotine is highly addictive.  It is as addictive as 
heroin or cocaine.  It is not surprising then that about 
three-quarters of smokers over the age of 15 have tried to quit 
but failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that my own father quit smoking three years before 
he died.  It was an arduous task for him to quit smoking after 
having smoked for more than 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the evidence of the health threats of tobacco, based on 
the thousands of deaths from tobacco related diseases and the 
terrible toll that tobacco addiction takes on individuals in 
society, it is very difficult to imagine any reason for not 
supporting the bill and its important amendments to the Tobacco 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has often been said that young people are the future of this 
country.  It only makes sense, therefore, that we invest in them 
by protecting them and by ensuring the safest and healthiest 
environment for their growth and development.  That is what this 
amendment is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to support the amendment.  A 
vote in favour of a ban on the promotion of tobacco sponsorship 
in this country is a vote for a safer, healthier and more 
productive future for Canada's youth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to speak today to Bill C-42, a 
bill that we have been working on for a long time to try to 
address what members from across the way have said is the single 
greatest threat to public health in this country.  They are quite 
correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am absolutely dismayed by the comments which have 
come from the other side.  The government claims to be the great 
upholder of smoking prevention in this country.  It was this 
government that had the single greatest negative impact on the 
health of Canadians when it rolled back tobacco taxes in 1994. 
This undid 15 years of good work in the prevention and decrease 
of tobacco consumption in this country, particularly for our 
youth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a solution to the smuggling problem of the time that 
did not involve rolling back taxes, but the single act of rolling 
back taxes has led a quarter of a million children in Canada to 
take up smoking.  Two hundred and fifty thousand children are now 
smoking when they would not have done so before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This message was given to the Minister of Health by the ministry 
itself.  The Ministry of Health told the Minister of Health that 
if he rolled back the taxes a quarter of a million young people 
would pick up smoking, that it would have a devastating effect on 
the country with respect to health care costs, not to mention the 
humanitarian effects on those people, and that it would affect 
those most affected by tobacco consumption and cost, the youth of 
Canada.  Yet the government went ahead and did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the circumstances.  A great deal of smuggling was 
taking place, particularly in certain areas of Quebec and 
Ontario.  But there was another solution, a solution which we 
presented many times to the minister.  It was a solution that had 
worked before:  an export tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the same situation in 1991-92.  The government of the day 
introduced an $8 export tax on each carton of cigarettes.  Each 
carton that went to the United States would be stamped and an $8 
fee would be paid by the tobacco company.  That completely cut 
the legs out from bringing that tobacco back into Canada with the 
benefit of the price differential between the United States and 
Canada.  Six weeks after it was introduced that measure caused a 
70% decline in tobacco smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the prime minister of the day, Mr. Mulroney, caved in 
under pressure from the tobacco companies.  The tobacco companies 
told Prime Minister Mulroney that they would leave the country if 
he brought in a tobacco export tax.  He removed the export tax 
and smuggling resumed.  If we look back in history we will see 
that the solution was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we presented in 1994 was a solution.  Do not roll back the 
taxes; implement an export tax.  The smuggling that took place at 
that time not only involved cigarettes, it also involved guns, 
people, alcohol and other contraband.  Tobacco was a conduit for 
the smuggling that was unfortunately taking place on such 
reserves as Kanasatake and Kahnawake, to name two.  It was run by 
thugs attached to organized crime, particularly from the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one talks about the aboriginal people on those reserves and 
how some of those people were held hostage to criminals within 
their midst, many who came from the United States.  Police 
officers were apparently told that they could not touch the 
smugglers going back and forth across the border because the 
government was afraid of an Oka crisis.  This had nothing to do 
with Oka.  It everything to do with thugs taking advantage of a 
political problem within our country, thugs who were by and large 
American.  We buckled under and to this day that smuggling is 
still taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my message for the government.  If it truly wants to 
deal with the tobacco epidemic, and it is an epidemic within our 
midst, then there are solutions.  The solutions are:  raising the 
taxes to the level they were at before February 1994, applying an 
export tax to cut the legs out from underneath smuggling, 
enforcing the law where smuggling is taking place, and dealing 
with appropriate education, which the government, to its credit, 
has begun to introduce.  However, although it promised a large 
sum of money for that purpose, a large chunk of money has 
unfortunately not yet been seen by the appropriate organizations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at the scope of this problem we can look at what 
happened before 1994 and since 1994.  As I said before, there are 
250,000 more children smoking.  In 1961 there were about 13,000 
smokers who died.  Twelve thousand were men and 1,000 were women. 
In 1996-97 that figure climbed to a whopping 48,000.  There are 
48,000 people every year who die of tobacco related illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers have changed.  Tobacco consumption deaths among 
women have climbed dramatically.  Tobacco deaths among women have 
now surpassed all other causes of cancer related deaths, 
including breast cancer.  That is a profound tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it in perspective, 48,000 people die every year from 
smoking related deaths.  Forty-two thousand people died in World 
War II.  That means that every year more people die from tobacco 
related illnesses in Canada than those who died in World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solutions are there.  What we can do, as I said before, is 
raise the taxes to what they were, increase the export tax, 
enforce the law and address the education issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not start talking to individuals when they are 17, 18, 
20 or 22 years old about quitting smoking.  As the member across 
the way quite correctly mentioned, people start smoking when they 
are 10, 11 or 12 years old.  They do not start when they are 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, our efforts must be addressed to younger 
individuals.  I would submit that we have to start at ages 6 and 
7.  If we start at that age then perhaps we can have an effect. 
We should not hit them with the fact that their mortality will 
change.  Teenagers and young children do not understand that.  If 
we tell them they are going to die young, they know that.  In 
fact, statistical evidence shows very clearly that young people 
know they are going to die young.  They know the effects of 
tobacco.  Interestingly enough, many teenagers feel they are not 
going to be smoking two years after they leave high school. 
However, 80% of them will still be smoking eight years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to address their sense of narcissism.  We have to 
address the fact that their skin is going to look older sooner, 
that their breath is going to smell foul, and that their hair and 
skin is going to smell foul.  We have to address young girls in 
particular.  I hate to address that group, but it is the group 
that has increasing consumption.  We have to tell them that 
although it keeps them slimmer, which is one of the primary 
reasons for them to smoke, it also makes them grow older faster 
and it is not sexy, despite what they may claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although that is a brutal thing to say, if we address it at 
their level, in a way that they understand, then we will get into 
their psyche and have a profound effect.  We must address their 
narcissism, not their mortality.  We must tell them about what it 
will do to them physically, how it will age them and how they 
will smell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there is some movement in that direction I think the 
government can certainly play a very constructive role in 
convincing health care groups to deal with it in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this bill, I would suggest that there are a 
number of amendments that could have and should have been made. 
The fact that the government is going to extend tobacco 
sponsorships for two more years is ridiculous.  That will put it 
at five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the other side claim that this is somehow going to 
address the issue of sponsorship and it is going to protect 
companies.  All they need to do is look at the experience in 
Europe.  Europe did the same thing.  They introduced laws very 
quickly.  Sporting events and such got other sponsors, including 
car racing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is continually brought forth that car racing, tennis matches 
and such would somehow not occur in this country if we did not 
have tobacco groups to sponsor them. 
That is completely untrue.  Again, the government only needs to 
look at the experience in the United States.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that could have happened was to put a ceiling on 
tobacco company sponsorship promotion expenditures during the 
delay period.  The government could have put a ceiling on that 
but did not. It could have taken a leaf from Quebec's book. 
Quebec has implemented a similar measure with good effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sponsorship promotions should not be permitted on the inside and 
outside of stores where tobacco is sold.  That could be done now 
but it is not being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that tobacco companies can be trusted. 
This is complete nonsense. Tobacco companies have been asked to 
do things voluntarily.  They have weakened their own so-called 
voluntary restraint by introducing tobacco advertisements within 
school zones.  This happened in 1996, after the government had 
implored them to adhere to fair-minded rules and regulations so 
that children would not be subjected to tobacco advertising 
within and around schools.  Tobacco companies surreptitiously did 
it anyway.  They thumbed their noses at the government and the 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have introduced other things. It could have 
ensured that cabinet would determine the exact starting date of 
the ban.  Right now it is an open book.  It could start December 
1 this year, December 1 next year, or the year after.  That 
needed to be in this bill and it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have had a delay period for tobacco 
sponsorship promotions.  It could have specified that sponsorship 
promotions for foreign events could not occur in Canada during 
the transition period.  It could have banned the use of famous 
individuals in advertising and prevent misleading advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From looking at the good analysis by the Ministry of Health on 
advertising, we know that those advertisements are geared to 
children no matter what the companies say.  I sat on the health 
committee four years ago.  I was shocked when people who had been 
bought and paid for by the tobacco companies appeared as 
witnesses in front of the health committee, big guns from the 
United States who were obviously paid a lot of money. They had 
been in high positions in the U.S. government.  When asked 
pointedly if they thought tobacco had a negative effect on the 
health of people, their response was “we are not doctors; we do 
not know”.  Those kinds of blatant and obviously misleading 
comments by witnesses should never be tolerated.  They give 
insight into the actions and beliefs of the tobacco companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need not look any further.  Tobacco companies have been 
caught putting added nicotine into tobacco.  They up the nicotine 
content which ups the potential for addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at their actions in other countries.  What they 
do in China is appalling.  China has an enormous health care 
problem with cancer, emphysema, bronchitis and other related 
illnesses related to tobacco because tobacco consumption is going 
up. In some countries the tobacco companies sponsor parties and 
dances which are geared to children.  They give out free 
cigarettes for no other purpose than to ensure that the children 
become addicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned in the House many times that tobacco, as 
with cocaine, is the leading most potent addictive substance we 
know of today. We know very clearly that despite what they say, 
tobacco companies gear their advertising, their work, their 
efforts not to adults but to youth. 
A good chunk of their efforts are designed to hit that vulnerable 
group.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically the government fell into the trap by lowering taxes 
and rolling them back.  This is despite repeated warnings by the 
Ministry of Health that this is going to affect children 
deleteriously.  This is despite the fact that this is going to 
cost the Canadian taxpayer billions of dollars, not only in 
health care costs, but also in the loss of revenue from taxes and 
losses in the gross domestic product. It is not just a matter of 
death.  Smokers have greater chances of becoming sick than 
non-smokers do.  Smokers stay away from work longer.  The cost to 
the gross domestic product is enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are obvious effective solutions, particularly with respect 
to the cost.  Studies show that the price elasticity on demand 
for tobacco is very high, especially with respect to children. 
The higher the cost, the less they smoke; the lower the cost, the 
more they smoke.  It is not rocket science. This is perhaps the 
most important message the government needs to listen to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can twiddle all it wants around the edges of this 
issue.  It can talk about plain packaging.  It can talk about 
sponsorship.  It can talk about education.  But when it comes 
down to the cold hard facts, the single most important 
determinant in consumption is price, particularly for the youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the members across the way to look at the information 
that has been put out by the health ministry.  It is unfortunate 
that the Minister of Health has chosen not to speak to this bill 
yet.  It does not look like he is going to speak to it and I 
wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the minister truly is ashamed of this bill.  Perhaps 
he is ashamed that the government has not taken a more proactive 
approach, a more effective approach particularly in view of the 
fact that he has been caught holding the bag for what his 
predecessors have done. The minister has been left holding the 
bag for an implementation strategy which, rather than lowering 
tobacco consumption, has increased it and not in any small 
amount.  It is a huge amount, a quarter of a million children, 
and every month that we fail to change the situation, 10,000 more 
children will take up the tobacco habit.  I cannot believe that 
despite the clear evidence this government continues to pursue 
the course and tack it is taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government submits that it is the great upholder of the 
health of Canadians.  A former Minister of Health said during her 
tenure “I would do anything, anything, to prevent one child from 
picking up smoking”.  That minister and this government has 
failed, failed, failed in that promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would find a great deal of co-operation across 
party lines in pursuing an effective tobacco strategy. Please do 
not buckle under the threats of the tobacco industry that it 
would pull out of Canada.  Do not buckle under the submissions 
the companies make that this is not addressed to children.  Do 
not believe that this is going to prevent race car driving, 
tennis tournaments and other such events from taking place in 
this country.  The facts do not support those allegations.  In 
fact the tobacco industry has very little credibility anywhere in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see what is happening in the United States today.  The 
companies are paying hundreds of billions of dollars to state 
governments because of the cost they have incurred to those 
governments.  They are willing to pay large sums of money, which 
they have, to get out.

work, and no one is advocating that, there are effective measures

was a world leader in dealing with the tobacco issue through its 
education strategies and by increasing the taxes on tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a lesson from what we have done historically, if we 
do not buckle under the tobacco companies and if we work together 
on this issue, as the hon. NDP member mentioned in the health 
committee, we would be addressing the most important health care 
issue affecting Canadians today.  Tobacco is the greatest public 
health care issue affecting Canadians today.  This has been 
echoed by the member from the NDP and the member from the Liberal 
Party.  It has been echoed many times by my colleague from 
Alberta and our health care critic, and members from other 
parties.

parties to come up with an effective strategy to deal with 
tobacco consumption.  This bill simply does not cut the mustard.

able to find a way to ensure that there is unanimous consent for 
dealing with this correction in the printing of the bill. 
Certainly we are prepared to give unanimous consent. However, we 
also want to acknowledge the Conservative member's concern about 
the haste with which this bill was pushed through committee, 
which would obviously lead to errors as we have now before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things have been said.  My colleagues from the other 
parties have pointed out the great harm that smoking has done in 
Canada and in every province.  As legislators, the members of 
this House must be able to promote and adopt laws against the 
use of tobacco, particularly among the young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The data given us by anti-smoking organizations are frightening. 
These statistics have made us aware of this scourge.  We are 
often tempted to think there are fewer smokers. 
Perhaps there is a reduction in the number of smokers in certain 
categories of people, for example among adults, but young people 
are starting to smoke earlier and earlier.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been pointed out, Bill C-42 delays the 
implementation of certain sections of the Tobacco Act.  Members 
will recall Bill C-71 passed by this House.  Bill C-42 has mainly 
to do with tobacco sponsorships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments provide for a two-year moratorium on the 
restrictions governing sponsorships by tobacco companies until 
October 2000.  From the third to the fifth year, the 
restrictions will apply as initially provided in Bill C-71, that 
is to say, the name of the company may appear on only 10% of 
advertising space. 
It is very important that the public be told that the ban on 
sponsorships will be total as of October 1, 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary purpose of Bill C-42 is to amend the existing Tobacco 
Act so as to extend the transition deadline before the 
enforcement of the restrictions already imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first phase of the bill, which runs for two years after the 
amendment comes into effect, extends the status quo for promotion 
both on and off the sites of events and activities that were 
sponsored by tobacco companies before April 25, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second phase, lasting three years after the two years of 
transition, will again extend the status quo for promotions 
throughout the site of sponsored events and activities, by 
permitting the display of product-related brand elements in 
promotional material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also permit sponsorship promotions on the site of an 
event as it unfolds or according to other regulatory provisions; 
and apply the existing 90/10 restriction in the Tobacco Act to 
sponsorship promotions off site. These promotions will also be 
permitted in mailings sent directly to adults, in publications 
whose readership is essentially adult and in bars and taverns 
where minors are denied access by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third aspect of the amendment is the considerable toughening 
up of the Tobacco Act in relation to the bill passed in April. 
Where some might have interpreted the 10% rule as a breach, 
there is no longer any doubt. We are talking zero tolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This total prohibition will take effect immediately following 
the five year transition period. At that point, the Tobacco Act 
will prohibit all promotional sponsorship by tobacco companies. 
It will also prohibit the appearance of brand elements on 
permanent facilities or in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such measures, Canada is following the worldwide trend to 
set more and more restrictions on the sponsorship and 
promotional activities of tobacco companies. The European Union 
intends to prohibit all industry sponsorship by 2006. A number 
of signatory countries have already prohibited all tobacco 
advertising and sponsorship within their borders. 
New Zealand, Australia and the United States have—or are heading 
toward—a total ban.  The total ban after October 1, 2003 is 
therefore ahead of a number of countries, but the extended 
deadline makes it possible to take a sensible approach which 
will avoid numerous problems at the international level, for 
Formula I racing in particular, as well as on the economic 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the Bloc Quebecois has always been in favour of the 
key principles relating to health, and the campaign against 
smoking, particularly among young people, is close to our hearts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of any measure to reduce 
smoking.  We are in favour of measures to raise awareness and to 
educate people, as well as any measure to help eliminate this 
scourge that is costing so many lives and creating so many 
health problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must not be forgotten, however, that health still comes under 
provincial jurisdiction.  It is primarily at this level that 
health protection measures should be developed and administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to Quebec's existing anti-smoking legislation, 
which was sponsored by the present health minister.  It was 
passed on June 17, 1998. 
The proposed legislation was received favourably by the media, 
health organizations, organizers of sports and cultural events, 
and the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's Minister of Health avoided the errors made by the 
federal government by introducing much more realistic standards 
to combat smoking.  His legislation is tougher but more 
flexible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the ban on sponsorships, the provincial 
legislation offers event organizers a choice. The first option 
is to drop all tobacco-related sponsorships by October 1, 2000 
and benefit from a financial assistance program for the period 
up to October 1, 2003, which is the government's solution. The 
second option is to accept a five-year transition period with 
restrictions after October 1, 2000 and no financial assistance, 
as provided for in the federal bill now before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, sponsorship contracts already concluded with 
tobacco companies may stand or be renewed until October 1, 2000. 
Quebec's legislation provides, however, that the value of such 
contracts may not exceed their maximum value as at June 11, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizers will have until October 1, 2000 to decide which form 
of transition they prefer. 
For those who choose the second transition option, the 
amendment states that sponsorship promotion may continue on the 
site where an activity is held and during this activity for 
three more years after October 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being able to choose between two options, each having its 
advantages and drawbacks, is another example of a balance 
between flexibility and rigidity.  Naturally, most of the Quebec 
organizations and even the Canadian anti-smoking associations 
told us in committee and on other occasions that they would 
prefer that Bill C-42 or the existing federal anti-smoking 
legislation be harmonized with the legislation passed by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the application is much stricter, but 
the adjustment for these sports and cultural events 
organizations which enjoyed tobacco sponsorships is more 
flexible because after two years they are prevented from 
advertising. However, until they can find other sponsors, they 
can draw on the compensatory fund for support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should also have established a 
compensatory fund.  In Quebec, the money in this fund comes from 
taxes on cigarettes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco causes health care problems, it causes loss of life and 
it is a drain on the economy and on tax revenues, forcing 
taxpayers to pay for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec legislation 
provides for a tax on tobacco.  It levies a charge on tobacco 
companies and users, which goes into the compensatory fund, 
which, at the moment, helps the organizers of sports and 
cultural events.  These people are very appreciative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home, we have the du Maurier international tennis 
championships, which are known worldwide.  Sponsorship is by a 
tobacco company, and that is not necessarily a good image for 
the championships.  In two years' time, they will have to find 
another sponsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain companies agreed to sponsor these sports and cultural 
events, which generated considerable revenue—$30 million for 
Quebec—as well as very substantial indirect revenues for the 
communities hosting them.  This measure will make it possible to 
keep these events in the communities and to generate important 
revenues for the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois asked the federal government to pass this 
measure and it would not have been necessary to give people 
another five years to make the transition.  Although 10% is not 
very much, it is still advertising and it is still excessive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind members that the Bloc Quebecois is in 
favour of Bill C-42 because, in our opinion, it is more balanced 
than the previous legislation, Bill C-71. 
As I mentioned, we find it deplorable that the government has 
taken over a year to understand what we have been saying since 
the beginning of the debate on Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not recall how this bill was rushed through committee 
stage.  We were expected to approve the bill without even 
hearing from important witnesses who wished to voice their 
objections to Bill C-71.  There were many complications.  In any 
event, that bill was replaced by Bill C-42.  One year later, we 
are therefore no further ahead.  All these measures have been 
delayed by one year, when this could have been wrapped up last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the fight against smoking is one that 
all of society must wage.  It is not easy to change a habit that 
goes back several generations. 
But, through these bills, authorities will now have better tools 
with which to tackle the serious public health problem that 
smoking represents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate this last opportunity to speak on a 
major health bill before the Chamber and to explain why the NDP 
caucus remains firmly opposed to Bill C-42, an act to amend the 
Tobacco Act. 
In order for us to effectively debate this issue and to get at 
the essence of the bill, I believe it is important for us to 
understand how the origins and the purpose of the bill have been 
camouflaged by the Liberal government and have been covered with 
rhetoric and with pretence that does not allow the public to 
understand what is really at the heart of this matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are dealing with is smoke and mirrors, to borrow the 
title of a very important book for this debate by Rob Cunningham 
of the Cancer Society of Canada. There is no question abut it. 
Only Liberals in the House would think they can get away with 
calling a negative a positive.  Only Liberals in the House would 
think about trying to portray reality in fanciful terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the most recent issue of health care transfer payment 
cuts.  What did the Liberals do?  They would have us and the 
public believe they reinvested a new amount of $1.5 billion in 
transfer payments to the provinces for health care. What they do 
not say is what they are really doing, cutting back what had not 
yet been taken out of the system and calling it new money, 
totally disregarding that the base, the minimal amount in terms 
of health spending, has been reduced down to $12.5 billion, a $6 
billion or $7 billion drop since the time when the Liberals took 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of deception we are dealing with with respect 
to this government, not only when it comes to health transfer 
cash payments and the whole question of the future of medicare, 
but specifically when it comes to Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the child who said the emperor has no clothes, we say to 
the Liberal government, it can spin tales, it can disguise the 
facts but it cannot, to use another fitting analogy, deny the 
fact that smoke rises. When smoke rises the air is cleared, the 
truth is revealed and we are able to ensure we can go forward 
building a case for good, sound public policy when it comes to 
tobacco consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is we first have to do that in the House for 
this debate.  We cannot for one minute longer go any further in 
allowing the Liberal government to suggest the bill has its 
origins in a most positive agenda about curbing tobacco 
sponsorship advertising, controlling tobacco consumption and 
dealing effectively with addiction problems in terms of 
cigarettes among young people.  The bill does not have its 
origins in those good intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question we are dealing with a bill that is a step 
backwards.  We are dealing with a bill that waters down and 
weakens the provisions of the tobacco sponsorship advertising 
restrictions enshrined in Bill C-71, provisions that were watered 
down even before those provisions in Bill C-71 were allowed to 
come into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised a point of privilege about the government's bypassing 
the authority of the House on the implementation of Bill C-71 
versus the overriding effect of the provisions in Bill C-42.  To 
clarify, even though Bill C-42 has not yet been passed, and it 
will go through all the stages and receive final royal assent, 
the government is operating as if Bill C-42 were passed as of 
October 1.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my question of privilege, this is an abuse of the 
House.  This is an abuse of the legislative process and it was 
entirely avoidable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The origins of this bill go back to the 1997 federal election 
when the Liberals signalled to the public that they were prepared 
to water down the restrictions inherent in Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The origins of Bill C-42 are really the pressure tactics, the 
heavy handed lobbying tactics of both the tobacco industry and 
the car racing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote from an article that appeared in one of our major 
newspapers, it is clear that the health minister blames the 
situation on a letter written by former health minister David 
Dingwall just before the federal election last April in which Mr. 
Dingwall finally surrendered to the tobacco companies' threat to 
cancel their sponsorship of Montreal's Grand Prix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are dealing with.  We are dealing with a bill 
that waters down a previous act of parliament because of the 
pressure of the tobacco industry and the car racing industry.  We 
are dealing with organized attempts to reduce, to minimize 
restrictions on sponsorship advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are dealing with is a cave-in.  Let us be clear about 
it.  This is an absolute cave-in, a buckling to those huge lobby 
forces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the present Minister of Health be any different from 
his predecessors?  Why should we have higher expectations from 
this government and the present Minister of Health than we have 
had in the past, especially given the history on this issue?  The 
then minister of health who is now the minister of international 
development was forced, because of pressure again, to lower 
cigarette taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her successor, also a former minister of health, David Dingwall, 
was forced to move away from a total ban on cigarette 
advertising.  Today we have the Minister of Health who was forced 
to further weaken the sponsorship provisions in Bill C-71, the 
Tobacco Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is standing up for health care?  Who is setting health 
policy for Canadians?  Is it the Minister of Health or is it the 
masters behind the tobacco industry?  Is it the Minister of 
Health or is it the Montreal Grand Prix? Is it the Minister of 
Health or is it the Marlboro man? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a critical situation pertaining to smoking addiction, 
particularly among young people.  Yet we have a government 
prepared to sacrifice the interests of those young Canadians in 
order for the tobacco industry and the entertainment business to 
line their pockets with more and more profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the bill before us today has been 
treated in a hasty way, has been pushed through the stages of the 
legislative process on a rapid basis and has not allowed for full 
debate to occur in this place, nor has it allowed for Canadians 
to become fully aware of just how regressive this bill is and how 
many steps backward the government has taken on this important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would have us believe this is not a step backward 
at all, that this is a step forward toward a complete ban on 
tobacco sponsorship advertising.  We applaud this attempt to move 
public policy toward a complete ban on tobacco sponsorship 
advertising.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder why it had to happen this way.  Why, in order to move 
forward tomorrow, do we have to take a step backward today?  This 
is probably the first time in this parliament and in previous 
parliaments, perhaps all parliaments, that a bill actually 
weakens the provisions established by law to protect children. 
That is exactly what is happening.  We are weakening an act that 
protects children.  We are allowing for bad public policy to 
proceed.  We are failing young people because of the stranglehold 
the tobacco industry has over the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit of a stretch for the government to suggest that in 
the long run the bill actually strengthens public policy in 
relation to tobacco advertising.  As many said in committee and 
elsewhere, in the long run we are going to be dead and in the 
long run, by virtue statistics, some of us will be dead because 
of tobacco addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we commend the government on moving forward toward a 
complete ban on tobacco sponsorship advertising, we must ask over 
and over again why it had to weaken the restrictions along the 
way.  Why does the bill allow for free and open sponsorship 
advertising without restriction at these events? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of the public have been led to believe that the 
restrictions will happen in two year's time.  It is true that 
some restrictions on tobacco sponsorship advertising will come 
about in two years, but I remind Liberal members that Bill C-42 
lifts all restrictions for on site advertising for the next five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the government has been totally adverse to any 
attempt by opposition members to propose meaningful amendments to 
ensure we at least honour the principles inherent in Bill C-71 
and take some steps forward.  We in the House tried to get 
restrictions on off site advertising, for example in retail 
stores where kids hang out, in places near schools and 
playgrounds, in places where children congregate, where young 
people gather, where they are exposed to and influenced by 
tobacco advertising, but the government refused to listen to 
those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried very hard in committee to convince the government, if 
it has to go down this path, at least to place limits on 
sponsorship advertising expenditures by tobacco companies.  We 
made this suggestion so organizations counting on tobacco money 
would not become more dependent as a result of the provisions in 
Bill C-42.  The government would not listen.  It would not 
acknowledge the importance of those amendments and voted en masse 
to stop all efforts by the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did the government refuse to consider any substantive 
amendments presented by the opposition before the committee.  It 
also snuck in an amendment that represents a significant change 
and opens the doors even wider in terms of tobacco sponsorship 
advertising.  The government snuck in a change that allows 
tobacco companies to newly sponsor permanent facilities 
previously restricted at first reading.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original intention of the bill was to ensure that as many 
restrictions as possible were in place to deal with any new 
sponsorships.  The government will try to suggest that has 
happened with the bill, that it has tightened the provisions and 
put deadlines and limitations in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By sneaking in the change with respect to the permanent 
facilities it has allowed for tobacco companies to sponsor 
permanent buildings, for example to put up the money to renovate 
buildings and then be able to have big signs without any 
restrictions or limitations on the front of the buildings 
advertising the tobacco companies.  Why was it necessary to do 
that?  Why was it necessary to include another loophole in the 
bill as opposed to trying to tighten it up and trying to move in 
the right direction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health critic of the Conservative Party has raised in the 
House today the speed and haste with which the government moved 
to pass Bill C-42.  It is absolutely the case that the government 
has not allowed for adequate debate.  It gave witnesses and 
organizations a 24 hour period to find the time, energy and 
resources to appear before the health committee.  They were given 
very short notice.  They were given very little time to prepare. 
We were forced as a committee to deal with all the witnesses, the 
presentations and the clause by clause analysis of the bill in a 
very tight timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We dealt with the witnesses and the clause by clause analysis in 
two short sittings of the committee.  That is not adequate debate 
based on the seriousness of the issue.  That is not at all in 
line with the speeches made by the parliamentary secretary and 
others in the House today, suggesting that the government has 
been generous in terms of time allotted before the health 
committee and that we had thorough discussion in the committee. 
We did not.  It was rammed through committee.  We were forced to 
deal with the bill in a very short period of time and 
organizations that would have liked to appear before the 
committee were not given that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Liberal members across the way would hear these concerns 
and in future would agree to allow for adequate time for proper 
public input on such a major bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from many today about the importance of acting in 
a proactive way around smoking addictions among young people.  I 
do not need to repeat the statistics about 250,000 young people 
every year getting hooked on cigarettes.  I do not need to repeat 
the 40,000 deaths a year because of smoking.  Suffice it to say, 
those statistics clearly indicate the seriousness of the issue as 
a major health problem.  It requires and demands proactive and 
creative initiatives on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the shortness of time that we were able to deal with the 
bill, I acknowledge that many groups were able to participate in 
a very meaningful way and were able to do what they could to 
ensure that all facts were presented to us.  I acknowledge the 
Canadian Cancer Society, the Non-Smokers Rights Association, the 
CMA, the Federation of Nurses' Unions, Info-Tabac, Physicians for 
a Smoke Free Canada and many other organizations that appeared 
before the committee. They worked with us and lobbied very hard 
for progressive changes in this area.  I acknowledge their 
contributions to this whole area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to acknowledge the seriousness of the 
issue, to consider a much more comprehensive approach dealing 
with prevention and the expenditure of moneys it promised in the 
last election but refused to do, and the value of Bill S-13 and a 
levy in terms of tobacco industry responsibility.  I urge the 
government to deal with a whole range of tools before it to 
ensure that we as a parliament and as elected representatives do 
whatever we can to ensure the good health of young people, 
children and all Canadians in society today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt, Taxation; the hon. member for Churchill, 
Solicitor General of Canada; the hon. member for Winnipeg North 
Centre, Health Protection Branch. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-42 is not just about tobacco advertising or the 
government's vain attempt to limit advertising.  It is basically 
about the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that every year in Canada 40,000 Canadians 
die from smoking.  That fact is supported by every major medical 
group in the country.  It is a statistic that even Health Canada 
supports.  It is a big problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an idea of how big of a problem it is I will use some 
figures that I have used before.  Sometimes we have to implant a 
visual picture so that people remember the numbers.  The number 
of Canadians who die every year from smoking equals the number of 
Canadians who died in World War II in total.  In other words from 
1939 to 1945 approximately 42,000 to 45,000 Canadians died.  That 
is a very disturbing statistic.  When we compare that to how many 
Canadians die on a yearly basis, year in an year out, it is time 
for second thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another way to put it in terms of those 40,000 deaths. 
If we had a major airline crash every day in Canada causing the 
death of 100 Canadians, day in and day out for one solid year, 
the total would not equal the number of Canadians who die in one 
year because of smoking.  The member from Newfoundland used the 
word scandalous.  It is scandalous.  If it happened in any other 
jurisdiction the government would do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could question how long the Minister of Transport would last 
or how long the government would sustain the pressure that would 
be put on it by Canadians from coast to coast if 100 Canadians a 
day were dying in airline crashes?  They would not last long. 
Somehow the government is able to get away with passing weak 
legislation like the legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another interesting statistic is that tobacco usage in Canada 
costs us every year $3 billion in direct costs and $7 billion in 
indirect costs for a total of $10 billion.  The government could 
argue that it is making money on tobacco and it is.  In one year, 
365 days from now, the government will have made approximately $2 
billion in revenue from taxes on cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Is that all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  That is all but that is enough. Why 
will it not do something about it?  That is the part that is so 
bizarre.  We are spending $10 billion in health costs as a direct 
result of smoking and bringing in $2 billion in revenue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have power over the government that goes beyond our 
wildest dreams.  I would identify those people as being the 
cigarette manufacturers of Canada.  They are giants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give the House an example of who some of those giants 
are. There is the Imperial Tobacco company, which I am sure most 
of us have heard about.  It is a Montreal based company.  It is 
the dominant player in Canada, with a 67% share of the market. 
It is owned by a British company called B.A.T Industries, which 
again is a big multinational conglomerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think hon. members will be surprised when they hear what 
Imperial Tobacco owns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imperial Tobacco Limited is Canada's largest tobacco company. 
Its operations include leaf tobacco buying and processing, and 
the manufacture and distribution of a wide range of tobacco 
products.  Its major brands include Players, DuMaurier and 
Matinée.  The company is also the largest seller of cigars in 
Canada, with brands such as House of Lords, White Owl and Old 
Port.  I guess we have heard those names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really interesting to find out that this same conglomerate 
owns a drugstore chain called Shoppers Drug Mart.  That is pretty 
powerful, but it does not end there.  It also owns some trust 
companies.  Some of its holdings include the Canada Trust 
Company, Canada Trust Realty Inc. and Coldwell Banker Affiliates 
of Canada Inc.  It is pretty big. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would have to believe that these people have some 
influence on the government when it comes to legislation and what 
they want to see the government do.  Basically they do not want 
to see the government do anything.  If the government really did 
want to do something concrete about smoking it would adopt 
Senator Kenny's bill, Bill S-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting, because last week Senator Kenny's bill was 
introduced in the House of Commons and immediately the government 
House leader jumped to his feet and used every measure he could 
to keep this bill out of the House.  In other words, government 
members were using procedural arguments to keep Senator Kenny's 
bill out of the House of Commons because they are afraid of it. 
They are afraid of it because this bill would do something about 
smoking in Canada, particularly among young people.  In Canada 
there are a quarter of a million new smokers coming on line each 
and every year.  Something has to be done about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Kenny's bill would do something about that.  But the 
government, if it has anything to say about it, is not going to 
allow this bill to survive the test on the floor of the House of 
Commons.  The government brought in all of its legal minds to 
launch challenges against this bill, even though it was 
introduced by the member for St. Paul's, one of its own members. 
Government members are going to use every means they can to keep 
it off the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a strategy on the part of the government.  The battle is 
not coming from the health minister, because the health minister 
is on record as saying that Bill S-13 has merit and that it is a 
good bill.  Unfortunately, he is out-voted in cabinet.  There is 
one person in cabinet who has more clout than the health 
minister, which I think is recognized by just about everyone in 
the House, and that would be the finance minister.  The finance 
minister rules the day in the government and he does not want 
this bill to come in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill would do is put a 50 cent levy on every carton of 
cigarettes manufactured in Canada.  This levy would be applied at 
the manufacturer's level.  This is not a tax, but a levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of precedents which indicate that this levy 
is no different than any other levy imposed from time to time on 
certain industries.  We would use the argument of intellectual 
rights and the 5 cent levy imposed on blank cassettes which was 
passed in this House a number of years ago.  That is just one 
argument that we would use to say that a levy is indeed 
appropriate and that there is a difference between a levy and a 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight is coming from the finance minister.  Taxation is 
sacred to the finance department.  In other words, it wants full 
control of every dollar that it is capable of extracting from our 
back pockets.  It does not want to give up any revenue or any tax 
points.  It does not want to give up its future ability to tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 50 cents a carton is being opposed by the finance minister. 
I want to compare this to the EI account.  We have heard the 
argument in the House that the finance minister is sitting on a 
$20 billion EI surplus which goes into the consolidated revenue 
fund.  That is why the finance minister likes it and does not 
want to give up control of it.  It allows him to manipulate the 
books, balance the budget, declare a deficit free accounting 
procedure, etcetera.  The government loves it.  I guess we 
cannot blame the finance minister for loving it because it allows 
him to do a little bit of manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want to see the same thing happening 
with this levy at the manufacturing level.  This 50 cents per 
carton would be used to educate young Canadians, but it would not 
go into the consolidated revenue fund.  Therefore, the finance 
minister would lose control.  One might ask “What would be wrong 
with that?”  The government gives and the government can take 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone in this House remember David Dodge?  Is it not 
correct that David Dodge was the deputy minister in the finance 
department in the days of Don Mazankowski and Michael Wilson?  He 
was certainly a senior official in finance during those years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Dodge is now the health minister's deputy minister.  Talk 
about the system perpetuating itself.  We have someone who in the 
past gave Michael Wilson and Don Mazankowski, former finance 
ministers, advice, who is now giving advice to the health 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my conversation with Mr. Dodge he said “I would be worried 
about this because it means that parliament is giving up its 
ability to tax”.  I said “Listen, I hate to disagree with you, 
sir, but if parliament places that 50 cent levy on the 
manufacturers it is also saying that we can take it away if it 
does not work”, which we could do.  There is no argument about 
that.  In fact, Mr. Dodge really did not comment on my suggestion 
that if we impose it we could take it away if it did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes back to that fundamental argument that the finance 
department does not want to give up control, as it does not want 
to give up control of the EI fund.  It is a surplus that it loves 
to play around with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister promised to put $100 million into education 
over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Peanuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Absolutely.  It is peanuts. 
Incidentally this would break down to about $20 million a year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten million dollars would be going toward education and the other $10 
million would be going toward enforcement.  In other words, I 
guess we would have cigarette police out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Kenny's bill would raise $120 million a year at the 
manufacturing level which would be about 5 cents a pack.  This is 
so illogical I cannot believe it.  But the finance department 
argues that it could not do that because that would break its 
agreement with the provinces not to raise taxes or prices on 
cigarettes from coast to coast.  In other words, there has to be 
federal-provincial agreement to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in itself is a fallacious argument because what the 
government is basically arguing is that if we indiscriminately 
raise the price of cigarettes across the country we are going to 
get into another smuggling problem like we had in the early 
nineties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The smuggling problem was addressed by the government in 1994 
when it capitulated again to the cigarette giants, the cigarette 
manufacturers, the tobacco people.  It was the single largest 
reduction in taxes in the history of Canada.  It cut the price of 
cigarettes almost in half by taking away a big chunk of the tax 
component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government caved in to the smugglers at the expense of young 
Canadians.  Because of that capitulation we have seen the single 
largest increase in the number of new smokers in the history of 
Canada ever since, year after year.  It is just like a rocket 
taking off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that the time is right to enforce that 50 
cent levy per carton at the manufacturing level.  Why is the time 
right?  Because if we look to the border states of the United 
States we will find that we are pretty well on par with where 
they are in terms of price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The smuggling issue is not going to be as big an issue as it was 
in the past.  Although, I think what we should have done then was 
to enforce our own laws and get tough on the smugglers.  I do not 
think we should have capitulated to the Mafia kings or the 
smugglers, but this government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at my home province of New Brunswick.  In New 
Brunswick people are paying $3.74 a pack.  That was as of 
September 30, 1998.  If we bought a pack of cigarettes in the 
state of Maine today we would pay $4.10 Canadian, given the fact 
that our dollar is much weaker than theirs.  That is another 
story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, in Canada we would pay $3.74 and in Maine we 
would pay $4.10.  There would be a 36 cent difference in our 
favour.  We have room to increase the cost to help educate young 
Canadians about smoking.  I think the government should do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that I have to put on the record.  The tobacco 
manufacturers have absolutely no credibility when it comes to 
arguing their case.  The manufactures at one time argued that 
there is a death benefit to smoking.  They actually commissioned 
a study to prove this.  The manufacturers said that there is a 
net gain in Canada if we all smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their reasoning went like this.  If we smoke we are going to die 
younger.  Therefore, we are not going to be collecting as much 
old age pension because obviously we will be dying younger.  We 
are not going to be collecting as much Canada pension because we 
will die younger.  We are not going to be receiving any health 
care benefits because we will be dead. 
Cigarette manufacturers actually commissioned that study and 
expected Canadians to believe it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my basic argument.  The attack on cigarette smoking 
can only be done in three ways.  It has to hit the price, that is 
the tax on cigarettes, because the government can control prices 
through taxes.  There is a direct correlation between price and 
consumption.  Economists call that fundamental pricing theory. In 
other words, if the price is high enough fewer people will smoke 
the product because they will put their money some place else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second way is advertising and the third is education.  In 
other words before we could support any tobacco legislation in 
the House, all three of those components have to be in the bill. 
Unfortunately they are not in the bill.  It has been weakened and 
weakened badly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr Speaker, I want to make a comment.  I 
listened very carefully to what the member had to say.  I am not 
questioning his motives, but I am questioning the theory and the 
thesis he has put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell him, members of the House and anyone else who is 
watching, that he is wrong.  He should be as proud as we are that 
Canada has a Tobacco Act and now a tobacco amendment act in Bill 
C-42 that will make us among world leaders in legislation.  We 
also have in place a commitment to education policies which 
hopefully will respond to our desire to educate young people, to 
give them the information they need and to encourage them not to 
start smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been a world leader in smoking cessation policies. 
Canada is a world leader in our legislative initiatives.  I know 
that is really hard for the member opposite to take.  I 
understand that.  I actually think he is quite a nice guy.  When 
I heard him speaking I just had to say to him, notwithstanding 
all that, that he is absolutely and completely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, now that I know I am a 
nice guy I feel a lot better.  We have to talk about reality in 
this place.  We have Bill S-13 before the House that will be 
ruled on by the Speaker as to its legitimacy.  It will do 
something about smoking in Canada, particularly for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to put her money or her vote where her mouth 
is.  She should support Bill S-13 which incidentally was 
introduced by one of her own backbenchers who happens to be a 
medical doctor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Kenny went around the country from coast to coast.  I 
have here documentation from the Canadian Cancer Society telling 
us in study after study of the harmful effects of smoking on 
young people.  I have a box of letters.  I will not touch it and 
then it is not a prop.  I had to use two soldiers and a pack 
horse to get the letters here from my office to show the Canadian 
people how important the issue is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was first elected in 1988.  I have never had as many letters 
on a topic as I have had on the smoking issue.  I have received 
thousands of letters.  They are going to other members in the 
opposition parties and to members of the government. That type of 
evidence suggests Canadians want something done about smoking.  I 
will entertain other questions from the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have also received a lot of letters. 
However there was one topic I received many more letters on, and 
it was the GST brought in by that member's party.  Did he not 
receive more letters on the GST?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the problem with 
the institutional memory around here.  The member who just asked 
that question used to sit in this very seat.  I hope I am not 
contaminated by that type of thing.  All I can say is that I 
received a lot of letters on the GST.  In 1993 I paid a huge 
political price on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian people will pay a huge price in terms of deaths and in 
terms of addiction if we do not do something about this very 
serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to the same point made by the veteran member from 
Regina, Saskatchewan, it is funny we were so wrong in the GST 
that the government just wrapped its arms around it.  We do not 
even hear you saying anything about it, Mr. Speaker, nor any 
other member over there.  Probably it goes back to that same 
person I talked about in the finance department, David Dodge, 
giving Michael Wilson and Don Mazankowski advice.  Now he is 
advising the government.  I wish he would go back to finance and 
stay away from the health minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question of the member for New Brunswick 
Southwest who is doing an excellent job critiquing the very good 
piece of legislation we are talking about, Senator Colin Kenny's 
Bill S-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  How about Bill C-42? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  We were talking about it and the member was 
talking about it.  I want to ask the member relating— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe Bill C-42 is before the House and I would ask 
you to remind the member that is the bill we are addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member for St. 
John's West is a very diligent member.  He would certainly turn 
his question to something that was relevant to the speech given 
by his colleague, the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest, 
which after all was strictly relevant, as I recall, to Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will happily rephrase 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we take in $2 billion worth of revenue for taxes on 
tobacco in Canada.  It costs Canadians $10 billion.  I am 
wondering why there is so much opposition to another bill that 
was discussed as well.  We are trying to raise a miserly $100 
million to assist young people to stay off tobacco, to be able to 
lead normal healthy lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that in the U.S. tobacco companies are willing to pay 
$202 billion to show that the products they sell are so 
unbelievably harmful to citizens of the United States of America? 
I also want to say how profitable tobacco companies must be to be 
able to offer $202 billion to settle some lawsuits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it so difficult to raise a small levy in Canada to help 
our young people stay off tobacco? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the question I 
cannot answer.  That is what makes this whole exercise so 
bizarre.  The numbers are obviously against doing what the 
government is doing, to try to phrase it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some letters sitting on the desk of the member who 
happens to be the finance critic for my party.  He sent me a 
little note.  I think he is over in his office and one of the 
pages just brought it.  He wants me to tell Canadians that the 
tobacco tax reduction is the only tax cut the present government 
has given the Canadian people since taking office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to the question, I am perplexed as to why the 
government would go down a road which is such a sorry road.  It 
has an opportunity to do something and it is not doing it.  All I 
can say is it has to be caving in to big business, to the big 
tobacco manufacturers.  I do not think there is an answer other 
than that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the member for New Brunswick Southwest 
could redirect a question to the member for St. John's East who a 
few moments ago spoke in high praise about the policies of 
Canada.  Of course we will recall that the member's party voted 
against Canada.  I wonder if he could now inform the House 
whether he really thinks it is a good deal to be in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am not quite sure how the member 
for New Brunswick Southwest will redirect any question to one of 
his colleagues.  Maybe he could answer this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the heritage 
minister has had too much caffeine today.  I cannot fathom that 
question.  With due respect to the minister of heritage, I think 
she has this confused with her flip-flop position on the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It seems to me maybe there has been a 
lot of caffeine on every side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could perhaps resume debate at this point, but given the time 
do members want to see it as 5.30 p.m.?  Or, do they want to have 
five minutes of debate and have the speech interrupted?  I am in 
the hands of the House.  Does the hon. member wish to start his 
remarks? 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker. On Bill C-42 
I thought I might go over the Liberal record on tobacco.  This is 
a summary of all the things that have happened since I have been 
in the House, since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government reduced prices to combat smuggling. 
Second, it caved in on plain packaging.  Third, it passed Bill 
C-71.  It weakened Bill C-71 by giving in to Grand Prix racing, 
and with the ongoing weakening from other sponsorship groups the 
result is Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very instructive to look at what has been the result of 
these measures.  It is not that tough to do.  One can actually go 
and look at statistics on tobacco consumption in Canada as I have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics I will be presenting today will be very specific 
for Canada since 1991.  The reduction of tobacco smoking in 1991 
was 6.16%.  This trend had been going on for many years. In 1993 
it dropped to 3.49%.  In 1994 for the first time in 30 years it 
went up to 9.20%.  I want this to be plain.  This is total market 
for tobacco.  That includes tobacco smuggled and tobacco used in 
Canada.  Some would look at statistics and say we do anything we 
want with them.  If the U.S. statistics are compared with the 
Canadian statistics they have been in lock step for those 30 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Canadian statistics took a dramatic jump.  The jump 
was directed, and Statistics Canada shows this plainly, at our 
youth.  The bill is weakening a pretty good bill, Bill C-71, 
which Reformers supported.  I am proud to say Reformers were able 
to actually prevent procedural wrangling on that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71 was directed at youth.  It allowed advertising to 
still go toward adults who had already made the decision to 
smoke.  In adult only publications and in bars it was quite 
legitimate for tobacco companies to advertise.  That took away 
from the tobacco companies a tremendous lever, the lever of court 
challenge that would make Bill C-71 no longer legal.  We now have 
a bill which groups involved in health are saying is a weakening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end my speech now so that we can carry on and vote on 
Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is it the intention of the House to 
proceed with putting the question?  Is the House ready for the 
question?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP)</B> 
moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, members of the House of 
Commons and senators should be treated equally before the law and 
therefore the parliamentary privilege that allows members of the 
House of Commons and senators to refuse to give evidence in a 
Canadian courts of law should be abolished. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, for seconding this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak on this motion today, particularly since I 
drafted it two years ago as a result of some unfortunate 
circumstances in my home province of Saskatchewan but which could 
continue to have some importance as efforts to discover the 
extent of government's involvement in the APEC issue unfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs and senators do not have to obey a subpoena to testify in 
court, ever.  I think that is wrong, as do many other Canadians. 
So I moved Motion No. 53 to remove that absolute privilege.  I 
would like to explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 53 seeks to eliminate the privilege of members of the 
House of Commons and senators to evade an obligation to testify 
before a court or civil proceeding.  It is a privilege I am not 
sure many new MPs realize they have.  The principle behind the 
privilege not to attend a court of law and give evidence is that 
attendance at the House of Commons or the Senate is the first 
call on a member's or senator's time.  There are practical 
reasons for this principle and historic reasons for the rule 
being written in such an absolute fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a competing principle that parliamentarians should 
not be above the law.  We need to reconsider how we reconcile 
these two principles and allow for some time in MPs' schedules to 
show up in court if they are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1996 when I drafted this motion we were in the middle 
of a series of trials in Saskatchewan regarding allegations of 
fraud, theft of public funds and breach of public trust.  The 
charges dated back to the period from 1986 to 1991 and involved 
members of a previous provincial government, both cabinet members 
and members of the legislative assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1995, 11 current and former MLAs, including former 
deputy premier and now Saskatchewan Senator Eric Berntson, were 
trying to evade testifying in a preliminary inquiry into charges 
against former PC caucus communications director John Scraba. The 
Court of Queen's Bench ruled that they had to testify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By October 1996 one staffer and twelve former Conservative MLAs 
had been charged.  By then five had been convicted, three were 
acquitted and one committed suicide.  At that time former 
Lloydminister MLA Michael Hopfner was on trial.  He called 
Senator Berntson as a witness.  A subpoena was issued but police 
could not serve it on the senator on the Parliament Hill 
precincts because of his parliamentary privilege.  The senator in 
any event was not required as a matter of parliamentary privilege 
to answer or to even acknowledge the subpoena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Berntson would not discuss his reasons for this action 
with the media, but the Senate's legal counsel, in a letter to 
the senator's personal lawyer Clyne Harradance, apparently 
confirmed that Senator Berntson was entitled to refuse the 
subpoena all together as part of his parliamentary privileges and 
immunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go into the specifics of the privilege issue shortly.  To 
continue the story, the issue was raised at that time by several 
members of parliament, myself included.  It was the subject of 
media stories and several columns and editorials. 
There was a public outcry against the way the senator seemed to 
be hiding behind his parliamentary privilege.  There was even a 
suggestion in some quarters that by appointing him to the senate, 
the former prime minister was deliberately availing Senator 
Berntson of this potential cover.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three weeks later the senator wrote an open letter claiming he 
was not trying to evade testifying by invoking his Senate 
privileges and he eventually took the stand.  Mr. Hopfner was 
convicted and sentenced to 18 months in jail. Three months later, 
on January 24, 1997, Senator Berntson was charged with breach of 
trust and two counts of fraud.  Five other individuals were also 
charged that day, bringing the total number of individuals 
charged to some 20 people. Senator Berntson resigned the next day 
as deputy leader of the opposition in the Senate and also from 
the Tory caucus pending both the preliminary hearing held this 
time last year and his trial before a judge which it was recently 
announced will commence January 11, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators and members of parliament do not have the privilege to 
avoid arrest or even to escape criminal charges but they may not 
be compelled to appear in court as witnesses or to serve on a 
jury, according to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citations 89 and 
90. Citation 89 refers to the privilege I would like to abolish, 
namely that no member may be compelled to appear in court as a 
witness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's sixth edition was published in 1989.  Citation 91 
states:  “Neither the House nor its members have ever made any 
specific claims to freedom from service of process within the 
precincts”.   No sooner was it published than the situation 
changed.  In March 1989 Edmonton MP David Kilgour, now a Liberal 
cabinet minister, was served with a subpoena in his constituency 
office to testify— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member knows he 
cannot refer to the hon. member by name but by secretary of 
state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I stand corrected. I 
apologize and withdraw that.  The secretary of state was served 
with a subpoena in his constituency office to testify in court 
about a meeting he had with constituents a few years before. 
Speaker Fraser ruled: “The service of a subpoena within 
the precincts of the House of Commons is improper without the 
permission of the Speaker”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member at the time and now secretary of state was asking 
Speaker Fraser to extend the definition of privilege to encompass 
something akin to a solicitor-client privilege between an MP and 
his or her constituents. Speaker Fraser declined to do so. The 
current secretary of state may have a point in wanting to extend 
our privileges on that score but I am seeking to limit the 
blanket waiver against MPs or senators having to testify in 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe MPs or senators should have an unfettered 
privilege to refuse to testify in court as witnesses.  The 
primary claim of parliament to members' attendance no longer 
demands this blanket waiver.  I make reference to the practice 
created in Britain in the 1600s to safeguard MPs from King 
Charles I who often imprisoned outspoken politicians.  It also 
prevented poorly paid MPs from being thrown into debtors prison 
for non-payment of debts.  Enshrined in the Canadian Constitution 
Act of 1867, the privilege grants members the right to speak in 
parliament without fear of harassment for what he or she says. I 
still support that privilege without which we would be handcuffed 
as spokespersons for our constituents and others outside our 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs and senators are exempted from jury duty because of their 
obligation to serve the nation's highest court, parliament. 
Parliamentary privilege exists to ensure the people's 
representatives are free to work in the public interest.  I 
maintain and support that point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's and Maingot assert that the two houses of 
parliament have the first call on the attendance of their 
members.  Fair enough, but that principle was elaborated in the 
specific rules of privilege before the invention of the airplane. 
At that time parliament was called for a session that lasted 
some months and then prorogued at the end.  MPs and senators had 
to travel for up to a week and maybe more sometimes to attend the 
session.  They travelled by train or horse and buggy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a parliamentary session is never prorogued until just 
before a new session is announced, usually the day before or the 
day of the new session.  However, the House and the Senate 
adjourn regularly and even predictably because of our calendar. 
MPs and senators can fly anywhere in Canada in under a day if 
they really need to.  Therefore I believe it is not necessary to 
assert the primary claim of parliament to members' attendance by 
giving members an unfettered right to avoid testifying as 
witnesses in court. 
MPs or Senators who have information relevant to non-frivolous 
criminal or civil proceedings should be required to testify like 
any other Canadian so long as the Chamber is adjourned or 
prorogued.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course as whip of the NDP, I would not want to see a 
situation where one political party could subpoena MPs from 
another political party to defeat a government with respect to a 
vote or ensure that a close vote was passed, for example.  But 
the current blanket privilege makes Canadians believe 
parliamentarians are above the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people in Saskatchewan two years ago told me they thought 
Senator Berntson was exercising his privileges not out of a sense 
of the importance of his work in the Senate but to avoid giving 
testimony at one trial that might later lead to his own criminal 
charges.  Although I do not want to comment on a matter that is 
currently before the courts, I can say that it was not so 
impossible to see how they might come to that conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen if the RCMP public complaints commission should 
subpoena the former solicitor general or the Prime Minister?  A 
subpoena cannot be served on Parliament Hill without the 
permission of the Speaker.  The public complaints commission has 
the powers of a board of inquiry, but the Prime Minister is 
saying there is no precedent for him to testify if called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe we should give prime ministers or cabinet 
ministers or MPs any shields to hide behind anymore, in 
particular as they appear as witnesses.  My motion is intended to 
modernize the rules of parliament and the rules for 
parliamentarians to maintain public confidence in their elected 
representatives as well as to ensure an equitable justice system 
and to make sure that politicians are not above the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope hon. members will find the motion worthy of support.  I 
look forward to addressing their comments at the end of the hour. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to debate the motion of the hon. 
member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 53 proposes to abolish a parliamentary privilege that 
permits members of the House and the other place to be exempted 
from appearing in a court of law as witnesses, and the member 
rightly stressed that.  It is appearance as witnesses that we are 
discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this motion should not be supported.  The concept of 
privilege has a long history in our system of parliamentary 
government.  It was developed during the 14th and 15th centuries, 
as the member mentioned, to ensure that the authority and 
liberties of the British House of Commons should not be 
challenged by the monarch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that Canada is one of several countries that have 
developed parliamentary privileges.  They are also available in 
parliaments in jurisdictions abroad.  Both the United Kingdom and 
Australia recognize the priority of the attendance of members in 
their houses of parliament over their appearance before a court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exempting members from appearing in court as witnesses is 
closely related to the privileges that exempt members from jury 
duty and the freedom from arrest and molestation.  I suggest to 
my hon. colleagues that it continues to be needed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this basic principle for the good functioning of the 
government in Canada is recognized in the Constitution Act of 
1867, but also in section 4 of the Parliament of Canada Act. The 
Constitution Act provides that: “The privileges, immunities and 
powers to be held, enjoyed and exercised by the Senate and by the 
House of Commons and by the members thereof respectively shall be 
such as are from time to time defined by the Act of Parliament of 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament of Canada Act recognizes these privileges as: 
“Part of the general and public law of Canada and they shall, in 
all courts in Canada and by and before all judges, be taken 
notice of judicially”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privilege is based on the pre-eminent claim of the House to the 
attendance and service of its members.  That means members 
themselves do not have privilege.  Only the House of Commons has 
privilege.  Members are covered by this privilege insofar as they 
are serving as members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While privilege is intended to ensure that members are not 
obstructed in the performance of their duties, it does have 
limitations on its use. 
It is not intended to be used to impede the course of justice. It 
does not protect members from criminal prosecution.  For example, 
it does not stop members of parliament from being sued.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, privilege ensures that this House will function 
effectively.  Members must be able to carry out their 
responsibilities and duties as legislators of public policy and 
in the service of all Canadians. As noted by Maingot, 
“parliament has the paramount right to the attendance and 
service of its members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of this House depends on the input of all members from 
all regions of this country.  I would suggest that their 
participation is even more important given the fact that we now 
have five official parties comprising the legislature in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, parliamentary privilege supports the House by protecting 
individual members from frivolous or vexatious attacks which 
would keep them from their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member may know, a former leader of his party used 
this protection while serving as a member of this House.  The 
motion before us, in other words, is inconsistent with the action 
of a former leader of the member's party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be vigilant in preserving parliamentary privilege 
against frivolous attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the member's motion responds to a problem that does not 
exist.  I am not aware of any public criticism in this area, nor 
am I aware of any significant abuses that need to be addressed. 
In other words, I do not understand what the point of this motion 
really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I believe Canadians would agree that this privilege is 
required so that members may carry on their legislative and House 
duties.  It is a necessary privilege that members not be impeded 
in their work in the service of their electors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While members may claim this privilege, they must also be guided 
by their consciences.  Given these considerations in the modern 
context, members rarely invoke their privilege to be exempt from 
appearing as a witness. However, as noted in Bourinot's 
<I>Parliamentary Procedure and Practice</I>, the Commons generally 
gives leave of absence to members to attend elsewhere as 
witnesses when it is shown that the public interest would not 
suffer by their absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is for these reasons that Motion No. 53 as 
proposed by the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre 
should not be supported.  If there are specific matters of 
privilege that the member wishes to examine, I would suggest that 
this is a matter that might more properly be considered by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs of which my 
hon. colleague is a member and of which I am the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that he and I can continue to work together on that 
committee to further strengthen this parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an interesting debate and I am glad to be involved in it. I 
have a deep interest in the issue having been served with several 
documents to go to court.  It kind of comes home when one does 
these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read the motion because I am actually that close to 
where the hon. member is from with just a minor deviation from 
it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, Members of the House of 
Commons and Senators should be treated equally before the law and 
therefore the parliamentary privilege that allows Members of the 
House of Commons and Senators to refuse to give evidence in a 
Canadian court of law should be abolished. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent <I>Sun</I> column of November 6, 1998 titled 
“Lawmakers above the law”, Robert Fife comments on this motion 
and points to two cases that prompted the sponsor to introduce 
this motion.  He cited the case when in 1989 NDP MP Dave Barrett 
claimed parliamentary immunity to avoid a summons in a case 
involving non-payment of his leadership debts and when 
Conservative Senator Eric Bernston used the privilege to excuse 
himself from answering a subpoena in a trial involving a fraud 
ring that operated in the Tory caucus of former Saskatchewan 
Premier Grant Devine.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Motion No. 53 only addresses one privilege, there are 
actually three privileges dealing with the attendance of members 
and the potentiality for a conflict between duty to parliament 
and duty to obey a court order. These three privileges are 
freedom from arrest, freedom from giving evidence and freedom 
from serving on a jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that these privileges do not involve cases of 
criminal matters or breaches of provincial statutes that involve 
the summary jurisdiction of the Criminal Code.  They only apply 
to civil cases as was earlier said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, and according to Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary 
Privilege in Canada</I> “the first privilege accorded to 
parliamentarians in England was an assurance that the barons and 
other lords were not impeded on their way to the council with the 
monarch because of civil process”.  We have run out of barons 
and lords in this House of Commons to a large extent, except for 
an odd few in the cabinet over there. “The concern was to secure 
the attendance of members, and it remains to this day the 
principal reason for the privilege of freedom from arrest, from 
attending as a witness in a court or elsewhere than parliament, 
and from serving on a jury. This is because the most important 
body in the country, the Parliament of Canada, has first call on 
the services of its members and parliament will not tolerate 
impediments to members who are on their way to attend the 
sittings”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems reasonable that a member could ignore an order to 
appear before court if called to attend a vote in the House if 
that vote was considered important.  If a member was to be 
charged with contempt of court in such a case, it seems 
reasonable that the House should protect that member. In such a 
conflict, the duty to parliament clearly outweighs the duty to 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential for the abuse of these privileges seems to arise 
out of the automatic nature of the immunity and when a member 
uses the privilege for personal advantage.  This automatic 
immunity should be abolished.  At the same time, the House should 
maintain first call on the services of its members and should be 
able to exercise authority in extraordinary cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about freedom from arrest.  Joseph 
Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> sums up the 
privilege of freedom from arrest as a protection from arrest for 
any civil process, such as failing to obey an order or judgment 
of the court in a civil matter, including civil contempt. A 
member of parliament does not have immunity from arrest in 
criminal matters and may be imprisoned for a criminal or 
quasi-criminal offence, including criminal contempt of court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, page 158 suggests that the House has the 
authority to intervene if it felt the circumstances were 
extraordinary.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While neither House of Parliament has waived or would likely 
waive its right to intervene if and when Members are convicted 
and committed for contempt (of court), and thus could in theory 
consider each case on its merits, it is unlikely that either 
House of Parliament would take any matter into consideration 
relating to the civil process unless the circumstances were 
extraordinary.  It is also unlikely that Parliament would 
actually interfere in a criminal arrest of a Member, including 
criminal contempt of court.  While cases may arise, the position 
of the House of Commons is that the House will at least 
investigate every such matter brought to its attention in order 
to be assured that the privileges of Parliament are not affected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore if the House has the authority to intervene in 
extraordinary cases to protect its privileges, then members do 
not need an automatic privilege of freedom from arrest.  This 
would be consistent with most other cases involving members' 
privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members feel that their privileges have been breached, they 
first raise it with the Speaker who determines whether or not 
there is a prima facie case of privilege.  If a member's question 
of privilege is prima facie, then the House considers the case 
and makes a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the privilege of not being required to attend as a 
witness?  Here we get into the specific privilege referred to in 
Motion No. 53.  Once again the problem is not with the idea that 
the House has first call on the services of its members, but the 
automatic immunity granted to a member. 
As it stands now, the House would likely uphold a member's 
privilege of freedom from giving evidence without question.  The 
House should instead consider the circumstances and decide based 
on the merits of the case.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we abolish a member's individual privilege of freedom from 
giving evidence, to be consistent we should probably ensure that 
the House maintains the authority to intervene in extraordinary 
cases.  That should prevent individual members from abusing the 
privilege but at the same time preserve the right of the House to 
first call on the services of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about privilege of exemption from jury service? Freedom of 
jury duty is in keeping with the principle of the House having 
first call on the services of its members.  While this exemption 
from the law is less offensive than the others, it still puts 
members above the law compared to other citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be consistent, we could apply the same standards to this 
freedom as the other freedoms mentioned beforehand. The right of 
immunity should be taken away from individual members and placed 
in the hands of the House itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are things the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs should probably look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privilege of freedom of speech is another issue.  The 
privilege of freedom of speech is in a totally different category 
and is probably one of the most essential freedoms enjoyed by 
members.  According to Maingot the privilege of freedom of speech 
is not so much intended to protect the members against 
prosecution for their own individual advantages, but to support 
the rights of the people by enabling their representatives to 
execute functions of their office without fear of either civil or 
criminal prosecutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Bourinot, freedom of speech is one of the first and 
greatest of a member's privileges.  He says that one of the 
advantages of legislative bodies is the right of exposing and 
denouncing abuses by means of free speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often in debate and question period cabinet ministers, including 
the Prime Minister, will accuse the opposition of abusing their 
freedom of speech.  It happens here once in a while.  These 
comments are not only misguided and inappropriate but they strike 
at the centre of the problems facing this government. The 
government tolerates free speech as long as it is not being 
criticized by it.  Freedom exercised in this way is viewed by the 
government as an abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 25 of Joseph Maingot's book on parliamentary privilege 
he talks about the origins of freedom of speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the 19th century, in the U.K. reporting what was said in 
parliament was treated as contempt; until then, members required 
this privilege only for the purpose of avoiding prosecution by 
the king. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members were once afraid of the wrath of the king, today 
backbench members of parliament bear the wrath of the Prime 
Minister who sometimes thinks he is a king.  The Prime Minister 
cannot prosecute members but he does have ways of punishing and 
controlling them.  It is unfortunate that we do not have a 
privilege protecting us from the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, in regard to privileges relating to the services 
of members to the House, members for the most part should be 
treated like any other citizen before the law.  At the same time 
parliament should maintain its right to first call on the 
services of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, any privilege applied should not be automatic, with 
the exception of freedom of speech, but should be subject to the 
judgment and decision of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this modification, members would not be above the law 
unless the majority of lawmakers felt it necessary to resolve a 
legitimate conflict regarding the public demand on the services 
of members of parliament.

I am pleased to speak on Motion M-53, introduced by our colleague 
for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, on abolition of the parliamentary 
privilege that allows members of the House of Commons to refuse 
to give evidence in a Canadian court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out first of all that the motion being 
addressed by this debate raises several fundamental principles 
of parliamentary practice: the separation of powers and the 
primacy of parliament over legal institutions, as well as the 
matter of parliamentary privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of those who feel that the workings of parliament and 
the work of legislating are, and must remain, the principal duty 
and foremost obligation of a member of parliament.  Moreover, 
the primacy of parliament over the judiciary has been 
guaranteed, since the earliest days of parliamentarism, in order 
to ensure that the business of the House runs smoothly. 
The sovereign did not tolerate that members could be prevented 
from assembling in parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A summons to testify in court did not constitute for the crown a 
valid reason for preventing a parliamentarian from taking part 
in a sitting. This underlying principle and the ensuing 
parliamentary privilege have down come through the centuries and 
are still valid today. 
I will quote from Joseph Maingot, in his <I>Parliamentary Privilege 
in Canada</I>, at page 161: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Parliament has the paramount right to the attendance and 
service of its Members, any call for the Member to attend 
elsewhere while the House is in session is not in law a call 
that need be answered. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this privilege is to enable us parliamentarians not 
to arbitrarily escape the administration of justice, but to 
properly acquit ourselves of our duties, with no outside 
obstruction or interference of any sort. 
To put an end to this would mean that we recognize the primacy 
of the judiciary over the legislative, whereas the judiciary 
arises from the legislative power, which precedes it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Standing Order 15 on member attendance, provides, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Member, being cognizant of the provisions of the 
<I>Parliament of Canada Act</I>, is bound to attend the sittings of the 
House, unless otherwise occupied with parliamentary activities 
and functions or on public or official business. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, our presence in Parliament is not only desirable but 
required.  Moreover, the obligation of testifying at a trial is 
not specifically included in the list of valid reasons for not 
attending sessions of the House. 
This parliamentary privilege, based on a long tradition, and on 
totally defensible principles and arguments, is embodied in the 
letter of our Standing Orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no intention here of discrediting or minimizing the 
importance of the role of Canadian courts.  Our legal 
institutions are cited as examples worldwide.  They ensure 
compliance with the laws passed by Parliament.  Those who have 
committed offences or crimes must be brought before the courts 
and punished, as appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should members by chance witness illegal acts, it is appropriate 
for them to participate in the operation of the judicial system 
by appearing, as required and when circumstances permit, as 
witnesses.  But we must not for all that forget that our prime 
obligation is to perform the functions for which we were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appearing as a witness when summoned is part of everyone's civic 
duty.  The parliamentary privilege the member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre is proposing to abolish does not, 
however,  exempt us as parliamentarians from this civic duty. 
Privilege simply means that, in the event of conflict between 
our civic duty to appear as a witness and our parliamentary 
duties, the latter should take precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I wish to raise concerns parliamentary 
privilege specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the protections that we enjoy in this House and that we 
inherited in 1868 when the Parliament of Canada declared that it 
was adopting the privileges of the House of Commons in London 
come to us through the long and rich parliamentary tradition of 
Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time, there has been a slow but inexorable erosion of 
parliamentary privileges.  This phenomenon can certainly be 
attributed in part to the increasing concentration of powers in 
the executive branch to the detriment of the legislative branch. 
But we have also seen parliament become increasingly reluctant 
or unable to defend its privileges effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions in recent years has been particularly telling.  I need 
only point to the way the infamous flag affair was dealt with by 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.  It would 
therefore be improper for this House to knowingly and willingly 
help to undermine the privileges it enjoys.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go further, I believe it is appropriate to agree on the 
meaning of parliamentary privilege.  I will cite the 6th edition 
of Beauchesne's <I>Parliamentary Rules and Forms</I>, which defines it 
as follows at page 11, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House 
collectively as a constituent art of the High Court of 
Parliament, and by Members of each House individually, without 
which they could not discharge their functions— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. M-53, in suggesting equality between members and 
senators and our fellow citizens in the obligation to respond to 
a summons to appear as a witness, indicates to me the 
subordination of the legislative to the judiciary.  Let me 
explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we are first charged with introducing 
bills, amending other laws and voting on laws.  We form what is 
called the legislative power.  Under such a motion, a member of 
Parliament could at any time and in any place be summoned to 
appear before a Canadian court without regard to his role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the judiciary could, with a summons to appear, govern our 
activities and interfere in the functioning of this House, 
something that cannot be allowed to happen under the principle 
of the separation of powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the motion under consideration at the present time would 
prevent parliamentarians from carrying out their duties 
effectively, and would mean that henceforth the judiciary would 
take precedence over the legislative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our presence in Parliament, as Joseph Maingot said, is a vital 
one.  Our fellow citizens have made us their legitimate 
representatives so we can express their concerns here in this 
House.  This status confers upon us inalienable privileges that 
are necessary to the performance of our duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the eyes of the law, we are not superior to our fellow 
citizens.  We merely enjoy certain rights and protections which 
enable us to be more effective in representing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned at the erosion of parliamentary privileges. 
In this connection, even if Motion M-53 is non-votable, the mere 
fact that it was introduced is indication of what is, at the 
very least, a lessening of the respect for parliamentary 
heritage to which I referred earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All our parliamentary practices, as outlined in the Standing 
Orders and in other pertinent documents of jurisprudence, have 
demonstrated what parliamentary precedence is all about, what 
parliamentary privileges are, and why they exist.  I know very 
well that we are familiar with those great principles, but it is 
a good idea to go over them from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do, however, view with alarm the fact that we have reached the 
point of believing that the roles can in fact be reversed, and 
that the legislative can, on occasion, be subordinated to the 
judiciary, as this motion implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I deplore the lack of respect being shown at times for 
our parliamentary system. 
On the one hand, this motion reduces our parliamentary 
privileges.  On the other hand, it is converting our committees 
from quasi-judicial parliamentary bodies into entities under the 
control of the executive, which makes government members toe the 
party line, thus taking away the committees' independence to 
make decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time we turned more to the rich British parliamentary 
tradition for our inspiration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased as well to take part in the debate 
pertaining to Motion No. 53 presented by the hon. member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre. The motion calls on the House to 
declare that all members of the House and the Senate be treated 
equally before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no difficulty with that whatsoever, particularly in view 
of the fact that all Canadians are certainly equal under the law. 
Every Canadian, parliamentarians included, must enjoy equality 
under the law.  Protection and prosecution apply by virtue of the 
Canadian charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asserted that parliamentary privilege somehow creates 
inequality before the law for members of the House.  He calls on 
the House to therefore renounce what he contends is an 
inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a noble motion by all means but there are some misnomers 
that have to be dispelled.  Members of parliament and senators 
are not free from arrest.  Let us get that straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privilege on the Hill, were it to be exercised in such a way 
that a member of the House or the Senate were attempting to avoid 
prosecution by remaining on the Hill 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week, would perhaps be a worse fate than criminal prosecution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This would leave a wrong impression if we were to suggest this 
were the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate as well that the word privilege carries so 
much baggage.  It is not unusual for people who encounter the 
term to be offended by the notion that parliamentary privilege 
might somehow denote a special status for members.  The 
vocabulary itself often offends the senses and sensibilities of 
those whose world is not so close to the study of law and 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many specialities, parliamentary law has its own particular 
vocabulary.  Sometimes the vocabulary can be confusing.  The 
expression parliamentary privilege sounds somewhat like a perk or 
a class system that exists here, or even an economic advantage. 
We say that he is a rich man and leads a life of privilege. That 
is not the context of privilege as it has come to be understood 
on Parliament Hill.  This has nothing to do with parliamentary 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary privilege is immunity under the Constitution that 
is necessary to allow members of this legislature to perform 
duties without interference.  The crown recognizes and reiterates 
that parliament's claim to privilege at the beginning of each 
parliament is vital to the operation of this place.  It is 
claimed by the Speakers on behalf of the members of the House and 
the Senate as they addresses the governor general.  It is not an 
exercise in pageantry.  It is not ritualism.  It is a basic 
assertion of freedoms that enable the members of the House to 
discharge their duties without hindrance by persons who may seek 
to impede parliament through agents of the crown or through 
agents of the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should recall that courts are the crown's courts.  It is also 
forgotten that this is the Queen's parliament.  Keeping this in 
mind, we can delve into the argument a little clearer.  It was 
certainly heart warming to hear the previous speaker from the 
Bloc acknowledge there is a great deal of importance attached to 
those particular laws we have adopted in this country.  Like are 
parliamentary history, there is rich importance to all Canadians 
that the matter of parliamentary privilege be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the initial appearance before the governor general the 
Speaker of this House on the very first day will appear.  The 
Speaker will on behalf of all members of this House proceed to 
the Senate chamber.  He will make a representation on behalf of 
this place.  Let us look at those words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons has elected me their Speaker, though I am 
but little able to fulfill the important duties thus assigned to 
me.  If, in the performance of those duties, I should at any time 
fall into error, I pray that the fault may be imputed to me, and 
not to the Commons, whose servant I am, and who, through me, the 
better to enable them to discharge their duties to the Queen and 
country, humbly claim all their undoubted rights and privileges, 
especially that they may have freedom of speech in their debates, 
access to Your Excellency's person at all seasonable times, and 
that their proceedings may be received from Your Excellency the 
most favourable construction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sets out the request of this parliament through the Speaker 
for privilege of freedom of speech in this Chamber and privilege 
that allows these members present to do their jobs effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we return to this Chamber there are certain privileges that 
attach the ability to question the government, to ask probing, 
important questions, questions that might in some instances lead 
to a legal action were they to occur outside of these hallowed 
halls.  I suggest it is one of the most important duties that 
members of the Chamber can engage in, particularly from the 
opposition side of the House.  I think all members will be quick 
to agree that is a useful exercise to engage in a process where 
the government is required to at times defend its actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privilege is a particular immunity under the law.  There are 
types of privileges that the crown recognizes in law.  These 
include the privacy of a confession and limited conversations 
between a person and their lawyer or physician at times.  I doubt 
there are any members present who would want to see these 
privileges abandoned.  Similarly, parliamentary protections or 
immunities exist for a single purpose.  They were not just 
dreamed up by parliamentarians of a superior class.  These 
immunities are in place to protect parliamentarians from 
intimidation and threat.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constituents need to feel a sense of confidence that their 
parliamentarians, their representatives, will respect and 
represent them with a certain level of decorum and competence. 
Privileges should be exercised with discretion and common sense 
that is of benefit to all Canadians.  Service on the Hill should 
meet that same standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are practical reasons that need to be respected in order 
for these exercises to be fulfilled.  Parliamentarians are not 
above the law.  I do not think that suggestion should be left in 
the minds of any Canadians.  They are certainly not immune from 
prosecution when those unfortunate circumstances might arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians in free elections send members of parliament to the 
House to probe, to pry, to admonish and to advocate.  We are 
armed with the right to speak freely within these rules.  We 
cannot be questioned in the crown's courts for anything that we 
might say in the House.  Other citizens may be subject to the 
actions of the courts but we are only subject to our own limits. 
not those of the crown's courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Americanization is a fear we might have with respect to the 
abolition of privilege.  It might turn us into a circus-like 
atmosphere that we have seen in the United States in recent 
months.  Perhaps that is not egalitarian in the eyes of the hon. 
member, and I say this with respect.  I think this is the root 
concern of his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, members must be free to engage in this process that is 
so important to the protection of democratic rights.  The 
abolition of our immunity would result in the egalitarianism of 
an oppressed society.  There would be no freedom of speech in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think of some of the issues that we could not have debated 
had the rules of privilege been abandoned.  Would the member for 
Palliser in the hon. member's own party been permitted to ask the 
questions that he did ask with respect to the former solicitor 
general in pursuit of justice?  Would I in my party have been 
able to ask questions with respect to illegal campaign 
fundraising that was happening in the province of Quebec and be 
free from prosecution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The literary community has recently raised the danger of what is 
called libel chill.  The abolition of parliamentary privilege 
would make it open season on every elected representative, 
particularly those who expressed unpopular views.  Libel chill 
would become a parliamentary petrification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immunity, privilege, whichever is preferred, is a necessary 
protection from a malevolent ruler.  In ancient days it was a 
malevolent king who opposed parliament.  Now there are very 
powerful forces that would be only too pleased to silence probing 
and prying.  If we were to abolish immunity, we would invite 
those who disagree with any member to sue or engage us in the 
courts to bring about potential financial ruin if we have the 
courage to vigorously pursue the rights of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the issue of jury duty has been raised.  Lawyers at 
the bar, prosecution lawyers, are also excused when it comes to 
jury duty.  It has been touched on in a very practical way as to 
why parliamentarians should be permitted to be exempt from jury 
duty.  All sorts of exemptions apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize I am at the end of my time limit.  I am sure the 
member who advocates turning back the clock on this element of 
parliamentary privilege is well intentioned.  However, this sort 
of privilege is something I do not feel is abused presently in 
this place.  I am afraid it has been used in this context to 
revisit what was perhaps a personal vendetta that may have 
existed between him and a member from his own province, a member 
from the Senate.  This is not an abuse that occurs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, this has been a valuable debate.  We are indebted to the 
hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre for reminding us 
that when section 18 was inserted into the Constitution Act, 
1867, it received in a legal sense British parliamentary 
privileges but it did not jell them once and for all in space and 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These privileges are subject to creative reinterpretation 
according to new facts.  In the spirit of what Lord Chancellor 
Sankey, the real person who gave us women in the Senate, the 
judge who decided the persons case, said that the Constitution 
was a living tree.  This is true of parliamentary privileges. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense we have had in the debate in the House two different 
possibilities presented.  I was consulted several years ago by a 
member of the Senate in relation to whether the privilege 
extended to freedom from being served with legal processes in the 
House.  It seems to me where a legal process serving is designed 
to humiliate or embarrass a member of parliament, or where it can 
certainly be served outside the House with convenience, that is 
an abuse of members' privileges.  The member has power not merely 
to refuse it but the House has power to punish for contempt.  I 
hope it would use that from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, as we have noted today the judgment of 
judicial committee of the House of Lords has made a striking 
change in the law of immunities of heads of government.  I have 
not been able to get the judgement as yet, the actual text, but 
it is saying basically that what one thought was unlimited in 
time is limited to the duration of the office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it may exclude certain types of acts that in an 
international law sense offend jus cogens.  You could never get 
immunity, for example, for crimes against humanity.  That is a 
rather astonishing breakthrough in international law, the more so 
because it was not perhaps generally anticipated as it should 
have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British judges are now going in for progressive generic 
interpretation.  In a similar way the immunities of diplomats, 
which have been considered absolute in the past, are usually by 
practice waived voluntarily by the ambassador or the head of the 
mission in the country concerned.  That makes sense.  It could be 
argued that either House has the ability collectively to waive a 
privilege if it felt that it was used abusively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the constructive suggestion from this debate has been 
that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs might 
examine the question of updating the privileges.  That was the 
suggestion of the member for Peterborough, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Government House Leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a fruitful suggestion and it would be in the 
spirit of the proposal of the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake 
Centre to have that adopted.  He is right in saying these 
privileges were not frozen in the 17th century.  They reflect 
their particular space and time dimension.  New facts demand a 
re-examination.  Let us have the re-examination but have it in an 
all party sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great confidence in Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs.  I served on it in a sense; I cut my parliamentary 
teeth there.  I think it would be a very fruitful suggestion 
which I hope the hon. member would accept. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for Vancouver—Quadra for his 
remarks.  I think he raised some good points in his speech.  I 
would like to start from the member for Vancouver Quadra and then 
work my way back, last to first, in terms of responding to my 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting to the Progressive Conservative House leader, we see an 
example of somebody who has given a speech full of information 
which has basically little relevance to the motion we just 
debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to rise on a point of order to point out to him that 
I can see why the Conservative Party is where it is at. I can see 
why Mr. Mulroney's government was tossed out on its ear.  They 
listened to three previous speakers and did not get what the 
motion was about, either did not listen or did not understand 
what the motion was about.  That is an example of Mr. Mulroney's 
government that we had in the country for eight or nine years. He 
did and said things and his members did and said things without 
regard for any of the responses or concerns of ordinary 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no personal vendetta.  The Conservative House leader 
thinks that I do.  Everything he talked about in terms of freedom 
of speech and all the other freedoms, I support and embrace 
wholeheartedly.  I remind the member that what we were debating, 
to which he did not make reference whatsoever, is the privilege 
that allows members of the House of Commons and senators to 
refuse to give evidence in a court of law.  We are looking at 
abolishing that particular reference.  It has nothing to do with 
other privileges which I believe are very important in conducting 
our business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc whip, the Bloc member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes, 
talked about imperfect respect for parliament, lack of respect 
for parliament, and the rich parliamentary tradition.  All of us 
embrace all these things we have talked about.  I find this quite 
bewildering coming from a Bloc member, somebody who is paid by 
taxpayers, who comes to the House of Commons and wants to break 
up our country.  He talks about the imperfect respect that I have 
for parliament.  I think people in my constituency and in other 
parts of Canada will look at that comment and laugh because it is 
so unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Bloc members stand in the House time after time, person 
after person, being paid for by the taxpayers of Canada and 
talking about breaking up parliament and breaking up the country. 
I do not think that is perfect respect for parliament.  I do not 
think we want the kind of respect for parliament that comes from 
that Bloc member.  He has misinterpreted the motion and should 
perhaps review it one more time to see where he stands on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to the Reform House leader, the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford.  He had some very good suggestions which I 
think many members of the House of Commons might even embrace. He 
talked about how we perhaps need to have the House decide, as 
opposed to individual members being given these freedoms, on the 
individual merits of each case when it comes to subpoenas of 
members or subpoenas issued on members to appear as witnesses.  I 
kind of like that idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had the parliamentary secretary to the House leader who 
suggested that we should perhaps raise the issue in the 
procedures and House affairs committee.  I think that is a very 
good suggestion.  I think it is something we should look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess members do not understand what I have been doing in the 
House the last four or five years.  This is one example in about 
five or six.   I have been attempting to implement some 
democratic reform and to modernize parliament. When I introduced 
a bill to change members of parliament's pensions from a defined 
benefit to a defined contribution, that was an attempt to 
modernize what was happening with MPs.  When I introduced a bill 
to make the Board of Internal Economy more public like other 
jurisdictions in the world and in this country, that was an 
attempt to make some reform of our democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is another attempt to modernize our parliament, to 
modernize the way we do business in this country so that 
Canadians who do not have a lot of respect for us as a collective 
group of members of parliament will perhaps have a little more 
respect because we are undertaking democratic reforms in a very 
broad based way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised a number of issues in the House.  This is yet one 
more.  I find that all members are coming around to the point 
where they are enjoying this type of debate.  They are finding 
some of these ideas perhaps a little too progressive for them. 
Some of them really think they are progressive and that we should 
look closer at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would seek unanimous consent, upon the recommendation of the 
parliamentary secretary to the House leader, to refer this matter 
to the procedures and House affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member is 
seeking unanimous consent to refer the motion to committee.  Is 
there consent?

Speaker, I rise with regard to a question I asked of the finance 
minister during question period on October 27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I brought to his attention the predicament of 
constituent Preston Tkatch who, along with millions of other 
Canadians, is being squeezed into poverty by the government's tax 
policies.  As I pointed out to the minister, Mr. Tkatch's family 
is being squeezed so hard that he feels he would be better off on 
welfare.  Indeed, with a monthly difference of approximately $200 
between his take home pay and that of someone receiving welfare, 
he has a point. 
But all across the country there are millions of Canadians in 
the same boat.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the government these are the same people on whose backs 
the government balanced the budget, some of whom find themselves 
on hospital waiting lists only to find that federal health cuts 
make the wait longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, it was with this in mind that I asked the finance 
minister when could these families expect meaningful tax relief 
so that a wager earner like Mr. Tkatch would have an incentive to 
keep working instead of thinking about going on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response was nothing short of abysmal.  I got 
nothing but a canned response which said in effect no tax relief, 
no employment insurance reduction.  Basically just keep sending 
it and the finance minister will keep spending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, Mr. Tkatch was not impressed either. I sent him 
a copy of the finance minister's answers and he took the time to 
share his thoughts with me: “It is very obvious that the 
Canadian government doesn't care about the average working class 
family”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Tkatch is quite right in pointing out that the child tax 
benefit helps families in the lowest income bracket but it does 
nothing to help those in the low to middle income groups.  He is 
the sole breadwinner in his family and his yearly income is 
$32,000.  As a result of the sliding scale by which the child tax 
benefit is applied its effect on his situation is negligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read more of what my constituent wrote to me: “Families of 
three or more dependants should not pay any taxes on income up to 
$30,000”.  Think about that for a moment. The finance minister 
might think that is a lot to ask but I sure do not.  That is the 
kind of tax relief I would like to see and there is no good 
reason why the finance minister cannot deliver this in the next 
budget. Unfortunately Canadians should not bother holding their 
breath waiting for it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put the plight of this constituent into very personal 
terms for the parliamentary secretary.  In his letter he states: 
“I get up at 6 a.m. every morning to leave for an 8 a.m. job and 
get home at 6 p.m, a 12 hour day for which the government takes 
over $8,000 per year in taxes.  Maybe it is time I sleep in and 
hang around my yard waiting for a cheque”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of this, my question now is the same as it was on 
October 27.  What incentive is there for Mr. Tkatch to continue 
working instead of going on welfare or, to paraphrase him, why 
should he even bother to get out of bed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, when the government first took 
office in 1993 it was faced with a $42 billion deficit and 
certainly the overwhelming Canadian priority was to balance the 
books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even in that climate all four of this government's previous 
budgets undertook targeted tax reductions to achieve social and 
economic objectives by providing assistance to education, 
children, charities and the disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the fiscal situation has improved we have begun a 
process of tax relief and our first priority has been to provide 
tax relief to those who can least afford to pay, low and middle 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member cites the example of a $32,000 single wage 
earner family.  In the 1998 budget we increased the basic 
exemption that essentially put more money in low income 
Canadians' hands, that is money they can receive on a tax free 
basis.  We eliminated the general federal surtax for Canadians 
earning up to about $50,000.  We have also taken important 
measures to assist low income families with children.  In 
particular, we realize the challenge we face is certainly one 
that requires the assistance and the partnership of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member does not feel that there is any benefit or any 
worth to the national child benefit program that was put in 
place.  I tend to disagree and I am sure that there are thousands 
of Canadians who also disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that the initial phase of our program 
was to balance the budget.  The second phase is to continue to 
build on the 1998 budget which targeted tax relief to those 
Canadians who can least afford to pay and who have the least 
amount of earnings. We have begun the process. We are committed 
to continue that tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have provided $7 billion in tax relief over three years in 
the last budget.  The Prime Minister, the finance minister and 
this government are certainly committed to putting more money 
into those individuals' hands.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SOLICITOR GENERAL OF CANADA 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, on 
October 9, I quoted a number of grade 11 history students from 
Hamnot Collegiate in Flin Flon, Manitoba.  These students are 
constituents of mine who had faxed me that day with their views 
on whether the solicitor general should resign.  The overwhelming 
majority of them said he should resign.  Prior to question period 
that day I asked the class if I quote them in my question.  They 
were ecstatic that their views were going to be heard.  I was 
very disturbed by the Deputy Prime Minister's response.  He 
called the students' comments unwarranted and unjustified and 
accused me of abusing the process of this House. I will address 
each of these allegations in turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the students were very insulted that the Deputy Prime 
Minister dismissed their opinions as out of hand.  In a democracy 
is the government not supposed to respect the views of its 
citizens?  The Deputy Prime Minister had no right to call their 
opinions unwarranted and unjustified.  His doing so goes right to 
the heart of what is wrong with this Liberal government.  it is 
arrogant.  The Deputy Prime Minister clearly does not care about 
the views of Canadians.  No wonder the things the government says 
and does are increasingly out of touch with what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same attitude can be seen in his accusation that I was 
abusing the process of this House by informing the students of my 
question so they could watch it on television and give their 
opinions.  Does the Deputy Prime Minister actually think it is an 
abuse for Canadians to watch their own government on television? 
Would he prefer that the proceedings go on behind closed doors so 
they do not have to be accountable?  It is not an abuse for 
Canadians to watch the proceedings of parliament.  It is a 
democratic right. But this Liberal government does not seem to 
care much about democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker, my colleague from Regina—Lumsden—Lake 
Centre, indicated his efforts to try to bring some modern changes 
and some democracy into the House.  Once again there is no 
attempt by this government to see that change go through, not 
even to the point of taking that suggestion to committee where it 
could be discussed and heard and so we could finally see some 
kind of change to the type of democracy this government is bent 
on pursuing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to protest is another crucial right in a democracy. 
This is part of freedom of speech.  If Canada is to be a 
democracy, Canadians must be free to voice their opposition to 
what the government does.  When the RCMP pepper sprayed those 
APEC protesters in Vancouver they were suppressing the 
fundamental democratic rights of those protesters.  This is a 
very serious matter and Canadians deserve to get to the bottom of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than openly answer these allegations, the government has 
been acting as if it has something to hide.  First, as his 
comments on the plane to Fredericton showed, the former solicitor 
general prejudged the RCMP public complaints commission.  The 
sworn affidavits confirm this to be so.  He has now resigned for 
this indiscretion, proving the students I quoted were right all 
along, but the matter is far from closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to insist the RCMP commission will get 
to the bottom of the pepper spray incident which is absolute 
nonsense.  The commission is only mandated to review the actions 
of the RCMP officers, not the political masters.  Since the 
commission cannot look into the actions of the Prime Minister, it 
cannot determine whether he or his staff was involved in the 
suppression of democratic rights. The commission has been 
hopelessly tainted by the former solicitor general's comments and 
by the fact that the students have not received any legal funding 
while the government is represented by a team of high priced 
lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way Canadians can get an accurate picture of what truly 
happened during the APEC conference is to appoint a judicial 
inquiry to investigate.  If the government truly has nothing to 
hide, it should appoint a judicial inquiry to exonerate itself.

deserve to go to the bottom of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fully agree, but what is the approach of opposition members? It is 
preventing the commission set up for this purpose from doing its 
job.

laughter leads to tears.” He is referring to jokes that make us

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to pursue a question I raised in this 
House on October 22 pertaining to the particular issue of bovine 
growth hormone and more generally the state of affairs in the 
health protection branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have repeatedly asked the Minister of Health and other 
members of the Liberal government for clarification about a 
number of serious allegations being raised about the way in which 
business is being conducted in the health protection branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have raised the matter of the need for a public investigation 
into the health protection branch on numerous occasions.  We 
continue to call for such an investigation based on the very long 
and growing list of concerns being raised about the way in which 
drugs, food and medical devices are being handled in this branch 
of government, a branch of government that is there purposely for 
the need to ensure the safety of all such products for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the particular issue of bovine growth hormone, 
we know from public testimony before the Senate committee that 
scientists with the bureau of veterinary drugs have indicated 
that they have felt pressures on them to approve a drug.  They 
have talked about gag orders.  They have talked about files being 
stolen.  They have talked about intimidation.  They have talked 
about the inability to do their jobs as scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has taken up this issue.  I commend senators Spivak 
and Whelan for initiating this hearing, but I believe this issue 
needs to be dealt with by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 2, 1998 I presented a motion before the health 
committee asking for such an investigation.  Liberal members on 
that committee ensured that that motion was defeated.  I 
subsequently wrote to the auditor general after that committee 
meeting asking for an audit based on these allegations.  I am 
looking forward to a response from that office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote to the Minister of Health many months ago asking him to 
initiate an investigation into the allegations of the 
veterinarians and other scientists in the health protection 
branch. My concerns have been dismissed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised on numerous occasions since then the need for a 
full scale public inquiry into the health protection branch to 
address concerns that are far reaching and serious pertaining to 
the health and safety of products, goods, food and drugs that 
Canadians need and must have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am simply elaborating today on this issue and trying once more 
to get this government to acknowledge the serious allegations 
being made and to encourage an investigation into this matter.  I 
look forward to a response from the parliamentary secretary who 
is fully aware, I am sure, of these issues and I hope will take 
these concerns very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a matter that can be dismissed quickly and easily. 
It is a matter that impacts very much on serious issues before 
the Canadian public today.  I hope the government will take this 
as a serious concern and a very constructive suggestion and 
pursue as quickly as possible an independent investigation into 
the health protection branch.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, first let me be very clear on 
the issue of rBST.  It is being reviewed and evaluated 
internationally.  Some countries have approved rBST and some have 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it absolutely clear to all members of this House and 
anyone watching this debate, rBST has not been approved in Canada 
and it will not be approved unless the evidence proves it is 
safe.  It is as clear and straightforward as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 29 the Senate committee on agriculture and forestry 
held hearings and the deputy minister of health stated that 
internally and externally good science must have an atmosphere of 
free discussion and free debate in order to survive.  It does not 
matter whether it is in veterinary science, human science or 
economic science.  What is critical is that we have freedom 
within Health Canada and across government agencies to engage in 
that debate and discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some scientists at Health Canada have expressed concerns and 
have taken their case to the Public Service Staff Relations Board 
which has held hearings and will rule on their case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been no gag orders.  This should be obvious from the 
very fact that scientists provided hours of testimony to the 
Senate committee and in fact were advised very clearly by the 
department and by the Minister of Health that it was their 
obligation to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When issues were raised regarding the approval process of rBST 
and the concern about potential gaps in research, I want to be 
absolutely clear that it was a senior scientist at Health Canada 
who ordered a review called the gaps analysis because there were 
outstanding questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
