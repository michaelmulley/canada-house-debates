</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadian 
businesses wishing to compete in the global market often face 
hurdles in obtaining timely information on financing, laws and 
natural and human resources in the provinces and municipalities 
in which they wish to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address these challenges, the Minister of Industry launched a 
powerful new business support web site called the Canadian 
Business Map.  The Canadian Business Map provides links to over 
3,500 municipal, provincial, national and international 
government and private sector sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of this new product by Industry Canada shows 
that this government recognizes the need to support Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Liberals it seems believe in nothing and therefore can stand for 
absolutely everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take equality.  Liberals say that everyone in Canada is 
equal.  Their vision of equality however is summed up in George 
Orwell's novel <I>Animal Farm</I> where he wrote that all animals 
are created equal, only some are created more equal than others. 
This represents the Liberal vision for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equality is linked with unity and I suggest that Liberals start 
thinking about the benefits of true equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday a majority of Canadian premiers added an official 
aboriginal position to the Calgary declaration on national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now if the Liberal government believes in equality and national 
unity, I invite it to take a stand here and ensure that 
grassroots aboriginals, not just the leadership, have a say in 
the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask you:  would not true equality be a tremendous 
unifying principle for such a great country?

2310 Army Cadet Corps on its upcoming 50th anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its establishment in 1948, the corps has given over 5,000 
young Saultites a chance to develop leadership skills and improve 
their physical fitness.  It has also taught them civic 
responsibility and respect for Canada's rich military history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Past and present instructors at the 2310 can take pride in the 
fact that they have helped prepare young Saultites for both the 
challenges and opportunities of adult life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that former Sault army cadets have met 
with success in many walks of life.  It is also for this reason 
that the lessons learned by our cadets truly become lifelong 
lessons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore invite all former cadets and their families to 
participate in the corps' 50th—

Aster scientific research station in Saint-Louis-du-Ha-Ha in the 
Témiscouata region has received the Michael Smith award.  This 
award goes to Canadian and Quebec organizations that have 
contributed to advancing, promoting and popularizing science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The station's director, Guylaine Carrière, received the award 
at a prize giving ceremony yesterday at the Science World Hot Seat 
Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The achievements of the Aster scientific station are many. 
They include the establishment of the Inforoute Globe-Trotter 
summer camp in co-operation with the Conseil du loisir scientifique 
de l'est du Québec and Industry Canada.  There is as well the 
Léonard workshop, which has enabled students in mechanical and 
electrical engineering at the University of Quebec at Rimouski to 
come in contact with an impressive range of engineering fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, my congratulations to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome—Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
goals of Katimavik are simple: to allow young people to develop 
through community service and to enable them to become aware of 
their environment by knowing and understanding Canada better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Katimavik allows a young person to share the 
life of a Canadian family in a new community, to live differently, 
to work for a non-profit organization and, generally, to improve 
his or her skills in the other language.  A real school of life, I 
would say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student work exchanges we initiated in Brome—Missisquoi 
two years ago must continue and develop along the same lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of colleagues in this House want to be part of this 
student exchange program next summer.  I head a committee working 
on this, and I invite suggestions from all my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Katimavik could become the vehicle of choice for this 
summertime exchange program, I think young people across Canada now 
and in the future will be thanking Senator Jacques Hébert.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Elgin regiment dates back to 1866 with the establishment of 
the 25th Elgin battalion of infantry.  The regiment was called 
out on active service on several occasions and served during 
World Wars I and II, earning numerous battle honours.  As an 
engineering regiment, they now typically will participate in 
cleaning land mines and building bridges as well as many other 
ways of contributing to our peacekeeping mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has shown that the members of the Elgin regiment are 
used to change.  Serving first as an infantry battalion and 
subsequently assuming armoured and reconnaissance status, the 
Elgin regiment now embarks upon a new chapter in its long and 
proud history as the 31st combat engineering regiment, the 
Elgins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the members of this regiment and say that 
I am proud to represent such a committed group of Canadian 
citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

counter threats of strikes and lockouts at Canada post.  The

last night we got the chief negotiator for Canada post and the 
negotiators for the union wrestling on the floor in Hull.  They

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

But I think it is in the best interests of the workers that there 
is a system of negotiated settlement, and we do hope there will 
be one.  They have a right to have a union and the right to 
negotiate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, strikes, lockouts, even back to work legislation are 
traditional instruments of the past and they do not work.  None

delivery of the mail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government why it does not use some creative

final offer arbitration.  It used that in the dock strike in

<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

its own legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question.  If the government does not want to intervene in 
the bargaining process, why does it not fix the process?  Why 
will the minister not act in the long term public interest and

of Canada. 
That is what the government supports.  We want them back at the

although the inflation rate has dropped to 1.5%, the Governor of the

which Inuit people are part of the administration of that

</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-4 be amended by 
adding before line 4 on page 1 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“0.1 The Canadian Wheat Board Act is amended by replacing 
the enacting phrase with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian 
economy; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS interprovincial and export trade in grain produced in 
Canada is an essential element of the agricultural sector of the 
economy, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS it is necessary to establish an organization to 
coordinate such trade; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS such an organization will have a very significant effect 
on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of 
the best financial return to them as its object and first 
priority and must be accountable to them for its performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>THEREFORE Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, thank you for your personal intervention 
to guarantee my right to have an independent legal expert from 
legislative counsel draft my amendments to the bill.  I am very 
disappointed with the unilateral decision to have procedural 
clerks drafting my amendments to government bills.  Lawyers draft 
the government bills and amendments, and members of the House 
deserve no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for defending my rights and privileges 
and providing the independent confidential legal advice and 
services I need to do my job as a legislator in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fundamental privilege of the House to decide on the 
rules of the House.  So far we have been denied the opportunity 
to debate and vote on the quality and availability of essential 
legal services for MPs to do their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We represent a substantial number of people.  The amendments we 
make are very important and deserve the proper consideration and 
advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your 
personal intervention in this instance.  It has made it possible 
for me to better represent the interests of my constituents in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also express my objection to the referring of bills to 
committee before second reading.  It was my experience that the 
Liberal majority on the agriculture committee was no more open to 
amendments than any Liberal dominated committee reviewing a bill 
after second reading.  That is a very serious concern because we 
need that input.  Unless the government allows for proper 
critique of its legislation we are wasting our time in the House. 
I hope that will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has subverted the original intent of referring a 
bill to committee before approval in principle and is now using 
this procedure to skip second reading debate and deny members an 
opportunity to represent their constituents in the House.  The 
procedure was supposed to open up the democratic process, not 
shut it down more than it already has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have introduced seven amendments to effectively address the 
deficiencies in the bill.  With these amendments I proposed the 
following improvements to the Canadian Wheat Board Act.  I will 
briefly go through them and hope to have an opportunity at a 
later time to talk to each one.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forth an amendment to add a preamble to the act and an 
amendment to change the object of the act from orderly marketing 
to maximizing the financial return to producers and three 
consequential amendments to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also put forth an amendment to allow producers to voluntarily 
exclude one or more types of grain they produce from control of 
the act for a minimum of five years.  In addition to this opting 
out clause my amendment would provide producers with the 
opportunity to opt back in by giving the board two years notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I put forth an amendment to introduce a five year sunset 
clause which would repeal the act if it does not achieve its 
stated objective of securing the best financial return to 
producers.  Talking about sunset clauses, that should be in all 
legislation.  If the legislation does not meet its stated 
objective we should scrap it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to speak to the four main proposals put 
forward in the amendments:  adding the preamble, making the first 
priority of the Canadian Wheat Board Act to secure the best 
financial return for producers, to provide opting out and opting 
back in provisions, and to provide a sunset clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to speak to each of my amendments as they appear in the 
appropriate grouping of amendments.  First I will speak to the 
preamble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced Motion No. 1 to correct a serious oversight.  The 
Canadian Wheat Board Act does not have a preamble.  The act 
current says “an act to provide the constitution and powers for 
the Canadian Wheat Board”.  If any act of parliament needs a 
preamble it is this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For far too long the government has been saying what the 
Canadian Wheat Board is supposed to be doing but has done a 
pretty good job of keeping the real facts a secret.  The board 
says one thing and thousands of farmers disagree.  Surely the 
government cannot disagree with the preamble I have introduced in 
the House today.  If it does, I would like on record the points 
it disagrees with and the points it would like to see amended. 
That should be obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is the basic foundation stone for the Canadian 
economy.  Interprovincial and export trade of grain is an 
essential element of our agricultural economy.  I do not think 
anyone can disagree with that, so I hope it will be approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to organize and co-ordinate such trade.  Whoever 
co-ordinates this trade must have as a first priority the goal of 
securing the best financial return for producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in the House can argue against that objective?  The minister 
responsible for the wheat board even said so in the House on 
October 28, 1997.  I quote what the minister said. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board in every market in the world extracts 
the very best price it possibly can get for the farmers of 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case we should put it in writing.  The board must 
be accountable to producers for its performance and we should be 
willing to say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are far more than just motherhood statements.  They set 
the framework around which the act and the bill must be debated. 
For the government to pass an act of such importance as giving a 
government monopoly powers is asking for those powers to be 
abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully request that all members of the House support the 
inclusion of a preamble to the Canadian Wheat Board Act.  It is a 
serious oversight not to have it in there.  This is the preamble 
that should be included: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian 
economy; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS interprovincial and export trade in grain produced in 
Canada is an essential element of the agricultural sector of the 
economy, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS it is necessary to establish an organization to 
co-ordinate such trade; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS such an organization will have a very significant effect 
on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of 
the best financial return to them as its object and first 
priority and must be accountable to them for its performance. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the amendments I have put forward is to protect 
all farmers.  The government always says that it is listening to 
the majority of farmers. 
In a democracy everyone must be protected and their rights must 
be respected, which is included in the amendments I have put 
forward.  A significant number of producers are represented by 
people on this side of the House.  I appeal to the government to 
listen to the amendments we are making.  They are common sense 
reasonable amendments and they should be considered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude has been “Why should we provide proper legislative 
counsel to the opposition?  The government will not listen to our 
amendments anyway”.  They are asking why they should provide 
resources.  That attitude has to change.  What we do in the House 
is fundamental to preparing legislation all Canadians have to 
live with.  We need the best resources and the best legal advice 
to make legislation what it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we appeal to the government to give us the resources 
and to consider the amendments we put forward.  They are 
reasonable amendments that address the concerns of the people we 
represent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to 
respond to the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very substantial piece of legislation, very important 
to all Canadian grain producers.  It is an important aspect of 
the governance of that industry.  That is why I am very proud to 
support the legislation.  In speaking to Bill C-4 it certainly 
accomplishes the objectives set out by the minister responsible 
for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Yorkton—Melville criticized the government for 
its decision to refer the legislation to committee before second 
reading.  I simply point out to the hon. member and to all 
members present that it is a very unique and important method of 
actually getting input from members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once adopted at second reading the spirit of the legislation 
cannot be changed by the House.  That is one reason the 
government saw fit to adopt a method of referring legislation to 
committee before second reading so that members would have ample 
opportunity to look into the details of the bill and to provide 
constructive and positive suggestions for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In criticizing this method of referring the legislation to 
committee before second reading the member has criticized the 
fact that he now has the opportunity to put forth his amendment. 
Amending the preamble to any legislation would not be in order 
after second reading.  By actually referring the legislation to 
committee before second reading the hon. member has the 
opportunity to put forward his motion to amend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just say that as a point of clarification. That is the purpose 
of that directive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion is to provide a change to the preamble 
of the bill.  That is basically what we are here to discuss. The 
hon. member is providing an amendment to the enactment section of 
the bill.  What must be pointed out is that the original bill, as 
proposed by the government and approved by committee, provides 
substantial opportunity for the governance of the Canadian Wheat 
Board by the producers themselves.  Two-thirds of the board of 
directors would be put in place by the producers and not by the 
government.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the form of governance I think the democratic process 
should take.  That is the form of governance I think the farmers 
want and that is exactly what we heard in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted a stronger role for producers, and clearly 
two-thirds of majority control of the board of directors for the 
Canadian Wheat Board accomplishes that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose, if I were to anticipate for the member's motion 
here, would be to add the preamble, to put specific restrictions 
on the board of directors so that it would be somewhat encumbered 
in its job and subject to what many would consider to be 
frivolous lawsuits in the performance of its duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble, as put forward, in essence accomplishes exactly 
what the bill already accomplishes, with one critical difference. 
It provides specific language, which I am sure opponents to the 
Canadian Wheat Board would enjoy the opportunity to capitalize on 
and to create quite a feeding frenzy by the legal community whose 
members of certain jurisdictions would so aptly want to support 
as opposed to supporting farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will rise not in support of this amendment to put a preamble 
into the bill for the simple reason that I am extremely confident 
that the bill itself accomplishes the goal of providing the 
producers the opportunity through the process of annual meetings, 
through the process of disclosure, through the process of 
producers themselves maintaining their own majority control over 
the processes of the Canadian Wheat Board. We are accomplishing 
exactly what producers want us to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very important point and while I see some merit in the 
spirit of what the member is trying to accomplish, quite frankly 
and potentially a little naively what the amendment would 
accomplish is probably a feeding frenzy by the legal community 
trying to poke holes in the fact that the farmers themselves, the 
producers, will now take a majority control, a majority position 
on the wheat board. They are the ones who are most capable with a 
majority position, a clear two-thirds, 10 out of 15, to guide the 
report into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no hesitation whatsoever in speaking favourably to Bill 
C-4 in its original intent as passed by the committee of all 
parliamentarians.  It is a very good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get into these discussions about democracy and about 
freedom of members to be able to practice their craft in the 
House of Commons, something that I would simply remind the hon. 
members opposite of is this.  They criticized the fact that the 
minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board chose to put 
this legislation, with the consent of the House, before committee 
before second reading so that the members who sat on the 
committee with me could take a good solid look at the specifics 
of the bill and have the opportunity to put forward constructive 
changes before the bill was tabled and before the bill was 
adopted at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really seeing here is that members opposite are 
criticizing the fact that they had the opportunity to participate 
in the process. They are also criticizing the producers' 
opportunity to participate in the process.  They want to stifle 
the ability of the producers who will be sitting on that board of 
the Canadian Wheat Board.  They want to stifle that opportunity 
for those producers to be able to do their job in the best 
interest of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I do not support the amendment.  I suggest to the 
members opposite that what they really should be focusing on here 
is to let farmers, the ten members, the majority of members who 
will be sitting on that board, do their job and let them provide 
the Canadian Wheat Board with the leadership in concert with the 
Government of Canada, in concert with all the people of Canada, 
the best options for all farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with great pleasure that I speak this afternoon to Bill C-4, 
an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government headed by the Prime Minister, the 
member for Saint-Maurice, thought that a slight revamping of the 
more than 60-year-old Canadian Wheat Board, a body viewed with very 
mixed feelings by grain producers themselves, it might be added, 
would be a good idea. 
Discontent in the three western provinces and in the Peace River 
area was such that producers were on the verge of signing a general 
petition calling for nothing less than the total abolition of the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, 18 months ago, the minister responsible for the board, a 
western minister of course, tabled amendments in the form of Bill 
C-72. We in this House devoted much effort to improving this bill. 
But because of this government's lack of foresight, we are now, to 
all intents and purposes, back at square one with Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague in the Reform Party, the member for 
Yorkton—Melville, is suggesting a preamble to Bill C-4 that I 
feel I must approve.  I will tell you why.  When a bill seems to 
be good, there is no need to shy away from saying so. 
What interests me most in the motion put forward by the hon. member 
from the Reform Party, is the preamble saying that agriculture 
plays a vital role in Canada and especially in the three western 
provinces and the Peace River region.  Do you object to that, Mr. 
Speaker?  You agree with me that it is no crime to include that in 
the preamble to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing is that this organization, the Canadian 
Wheat Board, has an important effect on grain producers and must, 
accordingly, have as its object and first priority the securing of 
the very best financial return for them.  The Canadian Wheat Board 
will have to be accountable to the grain producers for its 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, can you look me in the eye and say that you 
object to the Canadian Wheat Board making every effort to obtain 
the best prices for our grain producers? 
The Liberal government objects to having this in a preamble to the 
bill.  It makes no bloody sense.  Worse yet, they are going to ask 
the Canadian Wheat Board to account to grain producers for its 
actions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible is objecting.  I fail to see why. 
Bill C-4 does have good intentions.  For instance, there is at 
least some attempt to democratize the administration of the 
Canadian Wheat Board, by having 10—not enough in my opinion, but 
at least this is a first step in the right direction—of the 15 
directors elected by universal suffrage by the grain producers. 
That is a step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case it has been forgotten, there used to be five 
commissioners, and all five were appointed by the governor in 
council.  These were generally five patronage appointments, not 
necessarily five truly competent administrators. 
When the colour of the government in power was blue, Conservatives 
were appointed.  Now, since it is red, we have just had the 
announcement of a series of Department of Agriculture appointments, 
and they are all Liberals.  One was a bag man, one the chief 
organizer, one had worked hard to get his boss, the Prime Minister, 
elected as leader of his party.  You will recall this, Mr. Speaker, 
since you supported him too and got a little reward for it, since 
you are now seated in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 is an attempt to change the Canadian Wheat Board Act 
for the better—at least I hope it is for the better, and the 
government is sincere—for the benefit of grain producers.  So why 
fear it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just been listening to the words of the Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
He said they were afraid they would have to tie the hands of the 
directors of the Canadian Wheat Board.  Is it a crime to tie their 
hands and require them to obtain a better price?  I do not think 
so.  Given that the board will be dealing with $6 billion or $7 
billion, even a fraction of 1% will mean a better price.  A 
fraction of 1% of $7 billion means many many millions of dollars 
that the board could come up with and put into the pockets of 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite my colleagues in the government to have another look 
at the proposed preamble.  It is not because it was introduced by 
the Bloc Quebecois that it is no good.  It looks like the Liberals 
think that if it is not their idea it is not good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to have to reread the main part of this 
preamble, but the part that interests me, once again, is the part 
that would oblige the Canadian Wheat Board to obtain the best 
possible return on grain.  The board should also be accountable for 
its performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, a vote against this motion, the first on Bill C-4, 
indicates a lack of transparency and a fear of working effectively 
for western grain producers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too am 
very pleased to be taking part in this historic debate on Bill 
C-4, the amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act, this 
afternoon.  Before I talk about the preamble before us, Motion 
No. 1, I will respond to the comments made by the parliamentary 
secretary about how privileged members who serve on the committee 
should feel for the ability to come to the House and propose 
amendments since the bill was referred to committee prior to 
second reading. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would take more comfort in that if I had not felt as a member 
of the standing committee that there was a rush to judgment 
throughout the entire process.  I do not recall specifically how 
many groups appeared before the committee, but they were grouped 
in threes and fours so that we could get through the bill in a 
matter of two or three weeks.  The amendments were rushed through 
in one session.  It was not a very effective way to consider a 
bill of this magnitude which will have a long lasting impact on 
Canadian grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the preamble put forward by the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville, he said that it is not motherhood.  I think 
that there is a lot of mom and apple pie in it.  However, I also 
think that there is nothing wrong with us saying that in a 
preamble, as my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois articulated a 
few moments ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party and the CCF before it have always been 
very strong supporters of the Canadian Wheat Board and we 
continue to be strong supporters of it.  What is wrong with 
insisting that there be a preamble that makes it very clear?  The 
motion which is before us does that.  It states what the vision 
and mission of the Canadian Wheat Board is to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those vision and mission statements are very much in vogue these 
days.  We see corporations and other groups doing it.  What is 
wrong with such a statement being in the preamble about what it 
is that the Canadian Wheat Board is all about?  It is a reference 
point that producers and others can look to when seeking guidance 
or when they have concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, New Democrats believe that the wheat board has 
been a very good marketer for Canadian grain producers over the 
years.  We see absolutely nothing illogical about having this as 
the preamble and we will be supporting this particular motion 
when it comes to a vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am somewhat reluctant to speak on this piece of legislation which 
has gone through committee and returned to the floor of the 
House.  The reason I am reluctant is because we have been talking 
about participation in the process, as the hon. member from the 
governing benches indicated.  Quite frankly, I am disappointed in 
the opportunity we were given to participate in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure most Canadians recognize that this is probably the 
most important piece of legislation which will affect the western 
Canadian producer in this session of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board had an 
opportunity to put forward legislation which in fact would take 
the producers of western Canada into the 21st century, taking 
into consideration the open global marketplace that we have 
today.  He certainly had an opportunity to put into place 
legislation which would allow producers in western Canada to take 
full advantage of the produce they are producing currently at 
world prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that he was going to listen to all of those 
people who were prepared to appear before the committee.  He 
wanted to hear their comments.  He wanted to make sure their 
comments were embodied in this legislation.  Quite frankly, the 
process that we went through in committee was, in my estimation, 
a railroad job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was put through committee in record time.  We 
were not allowed to listen to all of the opinions of all of the 
people who wanted to come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House two examples.  In committee I put forward 
an amendment to bring the minister back to the committee.  The 
minister said, in his own words, that he wanted to come back to 
the committee after we had heard the witnesses to be able to hear 
what positions were being taken by those individuals. 
I asked the committee to extend the period of time that it was 
sitting to invite the minister back and I was turned down on that 
request.  The minister I believe would have come back but the 
committee did not want to waste the time to hear all of those 
comments.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggested that there is a parallel organization called 
the Ontario Wheat Board which has a fully elected board of 
directors, which has certain freedoms for its own producers that 
are not allowed in this particular piece of legislation.  I would 
have liked to have heard from those individuals.  The Liberal 
members of the government in committee would not allow us to 
subpoena or bring those people before the committee to hear how 
they operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, there was obviously an opportunity for the 
legislation to do what it should have done for the next numbers 
of years on behalf of our producers.  I come from an area which 
is referred to as the wheat city.  This legislation is very 
important.  No one, I do not believe, really wanted to get rid of 
the Canadian Wheat Board.  All we wanted to do in this 
legislation was to make sure that it is more competitive in 
today's market and today's world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for this preamble, this amendment that is before us, Motion 
No. 1, I cannot see why any member of this House, including the 
government, would not support it.  As the parliamentary secretary 
indicated, the government wishes to have the producers in charge 
of their own marketing corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this preamble says is that the corporation will be working 
for the producers.  Why not put that in the legislation so that 
it is there and people and the corporation recognize it is for 
the producers and not for the Government of Canada, not for the 
Minister of Agriculture, nor for the minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party will be supporting Motion No. 1.  In fact it is 
somewhat reminiscent of certain other motions that follow behind 
this.  I know we will be dealing with them at another time in 
other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that the government takes great pride 
in saying that this new legislation will make the Canadian Wheat 
Board accountable to producers, will make it transparent and 
certainly will make it accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, the only way it will be accountable is if it has 
the full board of directors elected by the producers themselves 
and not have five of those directors appointed by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another serious concern and that will be spoken to 
later in the amendments with respect to the appointment of the 
chief executive officer, the president.  This will take many 
hours of debate to make sure that the government recognizes that 
an appointed CEO is just simply another arm of the federal 
government and not accountable to the producers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to be able to stand here and suggest that 
Motion No. 1 will be supported by my party when it comes to the 
vote and if indeed the Canadian Wheat Board is accountable to the 
producers, it should have that said specifically in the body of 
the legislation.  I cannot see why government would not allow 
this to happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as with the hon. member from the fifth party who just 
spoke, I am almost reluctant to speak to this bill in light of 
what has transpired over the previous month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member articulated, this bill has been rushed 
through from beginning to end.  For the government to try to 
pretend to the viewing public, to the Canadian people and in 
particular to western Canadian farmers that it has used this 
process to bypass second reading and to hustle this bill off to 
committee, and it has used this process in order to try to better 
the bill, is an absolute fallacy. 
It is totally ridiculous when people take the time to view what 
has really transpired over the last while.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way these amendments have been grouped is very odd.  At some 
point in time I would like to have it explained to me how they 
came to be grouped the way they are.  It is hard to rationalize 
how they have placed some 48 amendments into the various seven 
groupings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1, which is the preamble, totally comprises Group No. 
1 and was put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Yorkton—Melville.  Part of the motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect 
on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of 
the best financial return to them as its object and first 
priority and must be accountable to them for its performance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the key part of the preamble put forward by my hon. 
colleague for Yorkton—Melville.  It sets the tone for the entire 
bill.  I am very pleased on behalf of the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville to note that we have support for his Motion No. 
1 from the other three opposition parties.  That is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public recognizes that it is sometimes very difficult to get 
unanimous support from all four opposition parties in this place. 
All parties view this as a very important preamble.  Although 
some on the government side would say it is just motherhood and 
apple pie, it does set the tone for the entire bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a letter into the record that came to me from the 
Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association that was sent to the 
hon. Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board.  This 
letter indicates the level of dissatisfaction with this bill that 
exists within the farming community:  “I append a copy of a news 
clipping listing the organizations which support the inclusion 
clause in Bill C-4.  They are:  the National Farmers Union, 
Family Farm Foundation, Catholic Rural Life Ministry, Concerned 
Farmers for Saving the Wheat Board and `several' Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool delegates of which there are 123 in total”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say: “The coalition against C-4 has the following 
membership:  the Canadian Canola Growers Association, Manitoba 
Canola Growers Association, Flax Growers of Western Canada, Oat 
Producers Association of Alberta, Alberta Winter Wheat Producers 
Commission, Western Barley Growers Association, Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business, Saskatchewan Canola Growers 
Association, Alberta Canola Producers Commission, Canadian 
Oilseed Processors Association, Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, 
Western Canadian Wheat Growers Associations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it poses the interesting question to the minister:  which 
of these groupings do you feel better represents the interests of 
western Canadian farmers?  If you believe—and it is hard for me 
to think otherwise—that the second group better represents the 
views of farmers, could you please explain to me why, against the 
opposition of these groups, Bill C-4 still contains the inclusion 
clause?”  The letter is signed by Mr. Larry Maguire, President 
of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that Mr. Maguire did not write the 
letter on behalf of one organization that the government would 
care to discount by saying that it had always been anti-wheat 
board and pro-free choice, pro-free marketing.  He wrote it on 
behalf of a coalition of many groups that represent literally 
tens of thousands of farmers who are concerned not only about the 
inclusion clause but about a lot of clauses and the very scope of 
this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me say at the outset that we will be debating 
seven groups of amendments and many members I am sure will get up 
seven times to speak to various facets of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to keep saying this because to a certain extent it 
angers me as a former grain producer who grew grain for 20 years 
under the Canadian Wheat Board. Reform is not opposed to the 
Canadian Wheat Board. I say that because at times it seems that 
some of our political adversaries like to paint us in that light. 
Reform is not opposed to the Canadian Wheat Board.  We want to 
see it improved, strengthened and address the real needs of 
western Canadian grain farmers. Above all, we want the wheat 
board to be accountable to the farmers.  However, we do not see 
that in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated during my 10 minute intervention before this bill 
was shunted off to committee that first and foremost we want the 
Canadian Wheat Board to be made voluntary.  Until farmers have 
the ability to opt in or opt out or market their grain through 
the board or through the private sector, I do not think farmers 
will really be supportive of the existence of the Canadian Wheat 
Board as we know it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were comments made earlier by my colleague from the New 
Democratic Party about the groups of witnesses.  I think all of 
us on the opposition side at committee were very disappointed in 
the process there, where witnesses who had travelled at 
considerable expense and time to appear before the committee were 
lumped together and there was not really an adequate chance to 
listen to them and have an honest open debate and exchange of 
information.  It really puts pay to the argument by the 
government that the reason why it superseded second reading and 
put the bill off to committee was to try to better the bill. That 
simply did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show how divisive this bill is, it actually accomplished the 
near impossible. The minister has accomplished the near 
impossible.  He has managed to alienate almost every single 
Canadian farmer, every single person who is involved in grain 
production and transportation in western Canada with this one 
piece of legislation. To show just how divisive it is, imagine 
the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee of 11 farmers itself 
being split and the majority of those producers calling for the 
complete withdrawal of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read an excerpt from the November 6 front page of the 
<I>Western Producer</I> newspaper quoting the remarks of the chair 
of the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee: “Macklin 
disputed government claims that one of the results of the 
legislation will be to democratize the wheat board and turn power 
over to farmers thought the two-thirds of board members they can 
elect”.  Then there is direct quote: “We think this new 
structure will be more subject to political manipulation than the 
old structure”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I completely agree with that assessment.  I think this bill is 
not going to address the needs. In fact, it is going to continue 
to sow the seeds of divisiveness in western Canada instead of 
addressing the real needs out there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I must oppose 
this particular amendment to the preamble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  If members will just give me a chance I 
will explain why.  It should be obvious.  I cannot see why the 
other parties have fell for this line by the Reform Party which 
is just a strategy that over time, through legal challenges to 
the board, will in fact undermine the board.  That is the real 
strategy here.  Let us put it on the table and call a spade a 
spade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go too far with the Reform Party opposite, I do want to 
correct a matter that my friend, the hon. member for Frontenac, 
said.  He talked about the commissioners who have been 
appointed to the wheat board over a number of years.  He was 
fairly critical of those appointments.  I think the record shows 
that the appointments by various governments of commissioners to 
the wheat board over time have been excellent in that the wheat 
board has always been able to return to producers the maximum 
that is in the market and most times has outdone the open market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the motion by the member for Yorkton—Melville, what 
does the preamble really mean?  Let us be serious on this. How 
does it really stand up in law?  We know in the past, and it is 
clearly on the record in many places, that the Reform Party has 
never been a strong supporter of the Canadian Wheat Board.  It 
gives it lip service but it tries to undermine it at every stead. 
I believe it was last year when the barley producers were 
violating the laws of Canada that some of these members opposite 
were actually supporting those producers in terms of trucking 
barley across the United States in a law breaking venture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we trust the Reform Party in terms of what it is really 
trying to do concerning this piece of legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe, as I said a moment ago, there is a subtle strategy at 
work here by the Reform Party in which it is trying to use a 
preamble to the bill to set the stage where the Canadian Wheat 
Board will be challenged legally time and time again.  Look at 
the amendment.  It reads “whereas, whereas, whereas”.  Finally, 
in the “therefor” we get to it stating the exact same thing as 
the government is saying in terms of enacting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One usually uses “whereas” at a political convention for 
resolutions.  We are not doing this for a political convention. 
This is a superior piece of marketing legislation for a marketing 
organization that has always stood by the farm community.  This 
is legislation that empowers the Canadian Wheat Board and, 
through empowering the Canadian Wheat Board, it empowers the 
grain producers of western Canada to maximize returns in the 
marketplace with, of course, as we have done in the past, the 
backing of the Government of Canada in terms of guarantees on 
borrowing, credit guarantees, initial price guarantees and the 
authority to be a single desk seller and thereby be able to 
maximize returns to producers in competition to other players in 
the international marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just take a moment in terms of the preamble and compare 
it to what has happened in the past with the wheat board.  I turn 
to the Canadian Wheat Board 1995-96 annual report “Marketing for 
the Future”. In a corporate profile this is what it said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) is the marketing agency for 
western Canadian wheat and barley growers.  The CWB markets these 
grains in the Canadian market to more than 70 countries around 
the world with the goal of attaining the best price possible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it says in its corporate profile now.  It does not 
need to be said in terms of preamble to the legislation.  Annual 
sales revenue ranges from $4 billion to $6 billion depending on 
grain prices and the amount of delivery by farmers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes the Canadian Wheat Board the largest single wheat and 
barley marketing corporation in the world.  Imagine that, 
marketing on behalf of Canadian producers with that kind of 
market power and market authority.  All proceeds from sales less 
Canadian Wheat Board marketing costs are passed back to farmers. 
In that sense western Canadian farmers are the Canadian Wheat 
Board's only shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again turn to the comments made earlier by friend from 
Frontenac when he was critical of those wheat board 
commissioners.  We expect the new board will be able to do 
similar things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A performance evaluation, which was also outlined in this wheat 
board report, indicates how well it has been able to do.  That is 
why we need this kind of legislation, so that it can continue to 
do those kinds of things for western grain farmers.  I quote: “A 
performance evaluation conducted during the 1995-96 crop year 
showed Canada ranks highly with its customers in such areas as 
quality of product, customer service, technical support and 
dependability of supply”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the point of the dependability of supply, if we went with 
some of the resolutions proposed by the Reform, you could not 
assure yourself, as a marketing agency of supply, because you 
would never really know what was happening with that supply area. 
With the kind of authority we have under the wheat board you can 
depend on that kind of supply and you can market intelligently, 
not just boom and bust, as the members opposite are basically 
saying we should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another study study conducted by three economists showed that 
the Canadian Wheat Board's single desk system generates an 
additional $265 million per year in wheat revenue for farmers, 
thereby enhancing Canada's competitiveness. It also showed the 
Canadian Wheat Board provides a low cost marketing service to 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows what the Canadian Wheat Board has been able to do in 
the past with appointed commissioners.  This legislation, 
although giving farmers more say in terms of the management of 
the Canadian Wheat Board, sets the stage to ensure it has more 
say and the kind of authority to continue to market in that way 
into the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is how low, because of these efficiencies, the 
Canadian Wheat Board is able to keep its administration expenses, 
down to 0.7%.  That is remarkable for one of the largest 
marketers around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot support this legislation because I think the Reform 
Party in this preamble is playing games. I am surprised the NDP 
and the Bloc and the Tories fell for these kinds of subtleties. 
Certainly these kinds of decisions are better left to the board 
of directors to decide what is in the producers' best interest 
rather than providing a heyday for lawyers bringing law suits 
that challenge the Canadian Wheat Board decisions as not being in 
the producers' interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real game Reformers are playing.  How many lawyers 
are over there in your camp anyway?  I thought you were trying to 
represent producers here, not the legal community?  That is what 
I thought but obviously that is what you are up against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, one 
of the most elemental rules in this House is that we speak in the 
third person rather than straight across the floor.

in the best interests of producers.  We have had the hearings.  I 
have said three times that this preamble to the legislation is a 
very subtle way in which the Reform Party is really trying to 
undermine the real future of the Canadian Wheat Board.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
relatively brief, given that everything is relative in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of motions have been tabled during this debate on Bill C-4 
and I do not want to anticipate, but I think the best is yet to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond party politics, this motion reflects a global view which is, 
all in all, beneficial to grain producers. The motion asserts the 
importance of this legislation and takes us to the heart of the matter. 
Just looking at the reactions this afternoon, the debate on Bill C-4 
will definitely be lively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same thing in committee, which led us to think that it 
is probably important to include Motion No. 1, which is a preamble to 
the act. Some may feel it is redundant, but it is better to be safe than 
sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of witnesses heard is evidence of the interest in this 
legislation. No one in this House is opposed to the Canadian Wheat 
Board, but the views and the means to achieve our goals are quite 
different. As for Motion No. 1, which we support, we can only be in 
favour of trade coordination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A coordinated marketing structure for agricultural products, both 
at the interprovincial and at the international level—in the case of 
exports—would benefit our producers. 
I think we all want to see more powers in the hands of grain producers, 
to make the decision making process more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that any business organization must try to achieve the best 
performance. And these days, businesses must account for their 
performance, that is to say, for their management practices. We want 
grain producers and the agricultural sector as a whole, which is the 
cornerstone of all our industries, to be as successful as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, I think that, if they were here today, grain 
producers and all those who came forward would support this motion 
because, as it stands, Motion No. 1 makes a lot of sense. 
I would not call this a partisan strategy, far from it; call it an 
overview of the debate on Bill C-4 and what is important to us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was enthused when the hon. member for Malpeque started to talk 
about the benefits of the Canadian Wheat Board.  He must have a 
relative in Winkler, Manitoba.  During the fair this summer I had 
an office there and people came to talk to me.  One gentleman 
came in and asked me to support the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to maintain the wheat board.   I have always wanted to 
keep the wheat board but I want to make it accountable and make 
sure it gets the best prices for the farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wanted me to make sure the wheat board stayed.  I asked him 
how much wheat board grain he grew and whether he was a big 
farmer because I did not know him.  He had a quarter section and 
a good job at Triple E, a mobile home manufacturer.  He grew a 
quarter of wheat board grain, mostly feed barley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him how many bushels he sold to the wheat board and his 
answer was zero.  He sold no grain to the wheat board.  I then 
asked why he was concerned about keeping the wheat board.  It was 
because he raised hogs and wanted to keep cheap feed prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Malpeque went from dairy to beef cattle. I 
know why he wants to keep the wheat board.  He wants to keep 
cheap feed prices.  That is the support the wheat board has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to hear him say that the wheat board is the main 
gatherer of supplies.  It has the supplies it can deliver.  Why 
do we have all our wheat board grain in bins, all the canola, 
flax and lentils?  Everything is gone.  It has been sold at good 
prices.  Why do we have wheat board grains in the bins?  There is 
no money for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about law breakers.  The member for 
Malpeque should explain which laws were broken.  All they did was 
sell their grain for a better price than they could get from the 
wheat board.  Is it criminal to get the best price for their 
grain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see why members opposite object to the preamble my hon. 
colleague from Yorkton—Melville proposed.  They do not want to 
sell it for the best price.  They are afraid to put that in the 
preamble because somebody could challenge that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did parliament originally pass the wheat board act?  In the 
1920s and the 1930s it was to provide competition to the grain 
companies to get a better price for the farmers.  Why has a 
preamble never been included in the wheat board act?  Why is it a 
sin to put that preamble into an act that is supposed to protect 
the interests of farmers?  I would like that explained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we pass legislation in the House that does not 
identify what it is all about?  Why would we pass legislation if 
we do not have the guts to include the preamble or to indicate 
the intent of the bill, what it is supposed to do, and the bylaws 
in the bill upon which regulations and rules have to be set? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everybody is a lawyer.  We do not have any on this side. The 
Liberals have lots of them so they should be able to identify the 
intent of a bill.  If they do not want to identify the intent, 
why have it?  It sounds ridiculous to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was impressed by the hon. member from the Bloc.  We have 
always been classified as separatists; Reform members are 
separatists. We can work together with our Bloc colleagues and 
identify good and bad legislation. I appreciate those members in 
the House who have the guts to say what is right and what is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the world would we pass legislation to divide the 
country?  If it is not unifying when Reform and Bloc members 
agree on a bill, I do not know what is unifying.  What are we to 
say about that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will hon. members from Ontario answer?  Every member of its 
wheat board is elected.  Why should Manitoba, Alberta and 
Saskatchewan have partially appointed boards?  Why are Manitoba, 
Alberta and Saskatchewan different from Ontario?  Why can we not 
elect all the directors and make them accountable to the farmers? 
That is what should happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they can give me a solitary reason why they should not be 
elected when Ontario's board members are elected, I will agree 
with them.  As long as it gives different powers and different 
regulations to different provinces, it only creates separatism 
and hostility among certain parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had enough of that.  We have seen for three and a half 
years in the House the divisiveness that is created when 
different regions have different powers.  Why do we want to 
create another difference?  I would like that explained to me.  I 
cannot see that happening in the bill, the way it is drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why these people are afraid of identifying the 
bill for what it is.  If the bill does not give farmers the right 
to sell their grain for the best price, it is not worth the paper 
it is written on.  It will do more harm than good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the House to support amendments such as the one 
moved by the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also express my appreciation to the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris.  He did a very good job relating his feelings. 
He is a member of the opposition who has an interest in farming. 
He is located in a central community which benefits from the 
farmers around it.  He knows what he is talking about.  He is not 
just talking through his hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a pleasure to say a few words.  I am sure I will get 
another chance when some of the other motions are being debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage Liberal members to stay in the House and listen to 
the debate.  I see they have disappeared again.  We can see from 
that how much interest they have in the bill.  We can see how 
much they are concerned about what is happening in western 
Canada.  It is a shame there are only four or five members on 
that side of the House when we are debating a bill of this 
importance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would simply like 
to point out that some disparaging remarks have been cast on 
members of the House.  I would like to point out that those 
disparaging remarks, I think, should be retracted given the fact 
that the Reform Party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Do you want to debate that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>   —is in dereliction of their duties for 
the simple reason that I see a party which has a caucus of over 
50 members, but I only see four in front of me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to debate this important bill in the House 
today.  We have seen quite a bit of activity here talking about 
the low attendance in the House.  I would agree that this is a 
very important bill for western Canadian farmers and people 
should be paying attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak in support of my colleague from 
Yorkton—Melville and his introduction of a preamble to Bill C-4. 
The preamble I am interested in is the section where he says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect 
on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of 
the best financial return to them as its object and first 
priority and must be accountable to them for its performance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we want such a preamble introduced in the bill?  I 
suggest it is because under section 5 of the current bill, there 
is no accountability to farmers.  We did not have it in Bill 
C-72, it was not in the previous Canadian Wheat Board Act and we 
do not have it in this bill.  This is an effort to try to bring 
some accountability by the Canadian Wheat Board to its producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent M-Jay Farms case, the Canadian Wheat Board argued 
forcefully and successfully, I may add, that it is not 
accountable to farmers.  It has always taken this position in 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1976 the Riske case, it found in favour of the 
board and not in favour of accountability to farmers.  When the 
board is talking to farmers, however, it says quite the opposite. 
The board should not be allowed to speak from both sides of its 
mouth on this issue.  Since the board is accountable to the 
minister and not farmers, I wish that the minister would stop 
letting the board misrepresent this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hehn, Chief Commissioner of the board has said on many 
occasions, and I will quote:  “We look forward to a strong and 
successful partnership with farmers of western Canada.”  That is 
in the Canadian Wheat Board annual report of 1994-95.  “There 
can be no partnership without accountability.”  He also goes on 
to say on another occasion:  “It is your grain and your 
marketing agency”, Grain Matters, January-February 1996—“With 
no accountability, again this is an absolute falsehood.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the Chief Commissioner of the board: “We are looking 
for ways to be more accountable to farmers.”  Grain Matters, 
May-June 1996.  He said this at the very same time that the board 
was before the courts arguing just the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the grain case of the M-Jay Farms the board was arguing that 
there is no accountability to farmers by the board.  It is only 
accountable to the ministers, and the courts found exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say: “We are structured to do the job for 
farmers” the Edmonton <I>Journal</I>, October 11, 1996.  Had he 
been totally truthful he would have said: “We are not 
accountable to farmers and we are in court here today to prove 
it.” And that is exactly what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore there is nothing in the amendments to Bill C-4 that 
would make the board accountable to farmers.  I refer to the 
board's section 5 which says, and I will read it.  This part has 
not been changed at all.  Section 5 says: “The board is 
incorporated with the object of marketing in an orderly manner 
interprovincial and export trade grain grown in Canada.” It says 
nothing about accountability to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I read the findings of the court in the M-Jay case, where it 
ruled against M-Jay Farms, they said: “But the express purpose 
of the act as set forward in section 5 is not the maximization of 
profits for producers, but rather the orderly marketing of grain 
grown in Canada in interprovincial and export trade.” 
Essentially quoting section 5.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go on in the court case to say “Taken in this view I take 
it that this statute is responsibility not to any individual 
producers but rather to the minister under the act”.  The 
members on the other side ask us why we are trying to bring 
accountability into this House, why we would ask for it in the 
preamble to the act.  We are doing it because they would not make 
changes to section 5.  The court has found consistently that 
under section 5 the Canadian Wheat Board is not responsible to 
farmers but to the Minister of Agriculture. Nothing has been 
changed in the act.  Section 5 has not been changed and therefore 
there is no accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Two-thirds of the board are farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for 
Malpeque is making some noises from the other side.  He is 
talking about the structure of the board under this current 
arrangement, but the board is still accountable to the Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board.  Two-thirds of the 
members on the board are elected and one-third are appointed but 
the chair of that board is appointed by the Minister responsible 
for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is totally out of touch with the debate in 
western Canada concerning what is going on and what farmers want. 
Farmers want a system in which they have a choice in how they 
market their grain.  I know a great many farmers who want to keep 
the Canadian Wheat Board so they can pool their product, accept 
an average price and use that vehicle.  I also know a great 
number of farmers who do not want to use that vehicle.  They want 
a dual system.  They want to be outside of that monopoly.  This 
bill does not address that at all and I suggest it is doomed for 
total failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no accountability in this act.  When my colleague from 
Yorkton—Melville said that the very least we can do in the 
preamble to the act is to suggest that we must have 
accountability to farmers rather than to the minister, we were 
ridiculed by the other side.  We were ridiculed by people who do 
not have constituents under the Canadian Wheat Board 
jurisdiction.  I see a member who grows potatoes in P.E.I.  I do 
not see any move to try to include potatoes under the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act.  I see a lot of lawyers over there from Toronto 
who are more interested in keeping control over Canadian farmers 
than they are in serving their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a system— 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  The colleague opposite 
keeps referring to individuals on this side and suggesting to the 
Canadian people that there are lawyers and only lawyers on this 
side who are listening to the debate.  I think that is an 
irrelevant point and he should not be calling attention 
untruthfully to the composition of the people on this side of the 
House.  I am not a lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is not a point 
of order.  Resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I see that the truth 
hurts.  It is very interesting that the people in the Liberal 
Party who want to maintain the status quo of the Canadian Wheat 
Board have even moved beyond the status quo of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  They are now trying to have more crops included that 
farmers are not asking to have included.  Those very people are 
not representing areas that are under the Canadian Wheat Board 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What authority do they have to put a group of farmers in western 
Canada under a system they do not even have in Ontario, Quebec, 
Prince Edward Island, any areas where there is agriculture?  I do 
not think they should have that moral authority.  When we ask 
very simply that there should at least be some accountability 
shown in the preamble to the act as in Motion No. 1, even there 
the Liberals do not have enough dignity to say that they respect 
farmers in western Canada, that they respect that there should be 
some accountability.  They even want to deny us that.  It is 
wrong and they will pay the price for it.

and to make consequential amendments to other acts.

suggested by Reform Party members.  For the party in power, and 
especially for the member for Malpeque, I would like to read the 
motion tabled by our friends in the Reform Party. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the 
Canadian economy; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS interprovincial and export trade in grain 
produced in Canada is an essential element of the agricultural 
sector of the economy; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS it is necessary to establish an organization to 
coordinate such trade; and

of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as 
follows: 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised at the speech by the member for Malpeque, who 
is opposed to such a preamble.  This is not the first time a 
preamble has been discussed.  There was talk of a preamble when the 
notion of distinct society was raised in connection with the Meech 
Lake accord. 
There was a preamble in which Quebec was described as a distinct 
society.

no significance back then.  Now, as the member for Malpeque sees 
it, the preamble explains everything, is highly significant, and 
could mislead the courts if they were called upon to interpret it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently, a new proposal was made in western Canada, 
about the unique character of Quebec, something comparable to the 
Pacific salmon, and it was said that “maybe that could be added to 
the preamble if a constitutional amendment is made”.  Others said 
“No, it would go at the end”.  Regardless of whether it comes 
before or after, I believe that a preamble has to give a general 
idea of the legislative text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the preamble per se is not a section of the act, 
but a guide. 
We know that the members of this new Canadian Wheat Board, or some 
of them, are MPs who lost their seats in the last election, people 
who will get their reward from the Prime Minister and the party in 
power for their contribution to democratic debate on June 2.  It 
might not, however, be a bad thing to remind them in a preamble 
that their primary authority is the farmers, the producers, not the 
one responsible for appointing them to the board, particularly when 
an act like this one is intended to last a good length of time, 
since it is made to be longlasting, hoping that it is the best 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If such is the case, if the government passes this legislation 
to be in effect for a goodly length of time, hoping to apply it for 
a long time, it is possible that its buddies who are appointed in 
this first batch to the Canadian Wheat Board could turn up 
elsewhere, be promoted to something else. 
However, its friends or those who could be friends with the others 
later on have to understand from reading the preamble of the bill 
governing them that its priority and purpose is to look after the 
interests of grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the member for Malpeque always rises 
here, waving his arms about as if this were a personal issue, as if 
it were an attack against him personally when we take apart and 
criticize a bill that he is defending.  I do not know why he does 
not just use a little common sense.  There must be common sense in 
Malpeque too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Malpeque should drop his habit of leaping 
up and save his strength for other occasions, of which there are 
many in political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I want to say too that the bill does not require the 
Canadian Wheat Board to be accountable to wheat producers.  The 
bill requires it to be cost effective, but who is going to decide 
if it is cost effective?  It is all very well to say the board will 
be managed in a way that ensures its cost effectiveness, but who is 
responsible for ensuring the cost effectiveness of the board?  Is 
it the appointed head of the wheat board, the person who appointed 
the directors, friends of his political party? Or is it the 
producers, who may be affected by the sometimes irrational 
decisions and choices made by the administrators of public funds, 
decisions that are even less rational because they are not 
accountable to the people, the producers in this case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the attitude displayed by the member for Malpeque, 
despite the carryings on of my colleague opposite who is protecting 
his chum and shares his views on the matter, in so vigorously 
opposing what we propose to put in the preamble of the bill, is 
mistaken and leaves that very impression with everyone including 
the Liberals.  A member rose on a point of order saying he had the 
impression, from the way things were being dealt with, that the 
members considered him dishonest.  That does not come from us.  I 
was seated and had said nothing.  If he thinks he is dishonest, it 
has a lot more to do with his bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time may have come to focus on the bill and suggest that the 
hon. member for Malpeque stop challenging virtue and peace, order and 
good governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that the hon. member for Malpeque may want to sell 
just about anything to anyone; that is his job as parliamentary 
secretary. He can be made to say anything, that is his job, as he has to 
protect his minister. But let us try to get across to him what is really 
being asked by our colleagues in the Reform Party, with whom I seldom 
agree, but agree with this time. Good common sense ideas can spring from 
anywhere. I mentioned Malpeque, but they can also spring from western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that they are absolutely right. Without being partisan 
about this bill, I think it could be a good bill, a bill that does what 
it is meant to do and a bill that can have a positive effect. There is 
no need to get carried away and go on opposing the Reform proposal. As 
a former political figure in Quebec, the late Maurice Bellemare, used to 
say “What matters is not the size of the sledgehammer but the swing you 
put in the handle”. He has put quite a bit of swing in demolishing 
something that stands to reason and is founded in logic and necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of this House, especially those who feel as 
uneasy about this bill as the hon. member who spoke earlier, who feel 
attacked even though they are innocent—and they all are—, who feel 
targeted by the bill and threatened by its consideration, to share their 
feelings with the hon. member for Malpeque, who will inform his 
minister, who will in turn inform whomsoever he pleases, as long as the 
end result is that an interesting bill is brought back to us. If justice 
is not done to grain producers, it should at least appear to be done. 
That would be better than nothing. We cannot hope for more than that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was not expecting to take part in the debate because 
agriculture is an area of great expertise.  I draw your attention 
to members opposite who have just asked me to sit down.  I 
apparently in the opinion of some members opposite should not 
speak because I am not directly involved in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I am speaking is that I have sat here for 
about an hour and a half listening to the debate, especially the 
comments from the opposite side.  Among the things that have been 
said by those opposite is their suggestion that everyone on this 
side is a lawyer as if somehow that is something reprehensible 
and a reason for not commenting on legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time that comment was made there were quite a number of 
Liberal MPs on this side of the House, and I have to say none of 
them were lawyers including myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I found reprehensible in the debate coming from 
the other side was the suggestion from one member of the Reform 
Party that because MPs may not be from the west, may not be from 
the prairies and may not be directly associated with farmers 
growing wheat, they somehow had no right to participate in a 
debate on the bill.  It is certainly true that I am from central 
Ontario— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  <I>Hansard</I> will disclose that this 
comment was made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly that it is a privilege to speak in the 
House, on either side of the House, on the opposition side or on 
the government side.  We all have a duty to examine legislation 
whether or not we have special expertise in the area under 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion that only westerners can debate a wheat board 
bill plays right into the hands of the separatists who would 
suggest that the only people who can debate the future of Quebec 
are people who live in Quebec.  I reject that and I think most 
Canadians reject it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to contribute to this debate is what little I 
can contribute to the debate.  I would like to talk about the 
question of preambles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, Motion No. 1 put forward by the official 
opposition would establish a preamble to the bill.  I am not a 
lawyer and many members on the other side are not lawyers, but if 
they would care to pick up the telephone and ask for advice, they 
would discover that preambles do not count for anything in 
legislation.  Legislation begins where it states “Her Majesty, 
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts”. The legislation follows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been campaigning on my side of the House to stop 
government legislatures, bureaucrats, whoever writes the laws, 
from writing preambles.  Preambles are smokescreens.  Preambles 
are when the clauses in the legislation are not sufficiently 
exact.  The clauses do not say and do what the government is 
convinced they will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the opposition suggesting that we should pass 
legislation which carries on a tradition that really got rolling 
in the 35th Parliament of smoke and mirrors through preambles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it really mean if there is a preamble which states 
“whereas agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian 
economy?”  What does that mean?  What will it do for a judge? 
Does it really matter?  Will it affect how the law will be 
interpreted?  I suggest not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has no force on judges.  My colleagues opposite can check it. 
In the legal profession they call it the pious hope clause.  It 
has no binding implications for what the judge must do.  The 
judge must read after enacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been debate about the wording accountable to farmers 
being in the preamble.  This is where I will have to accuse my 
colleagues opposite of not wanting to have a rational debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The phrase accountable to farmers sounds noble.  I know it will 
play very well in western Canada, but we are talking about 
government legislation.  We are talking about setting up a 
federal government body.  We are not setting up a provincial 
body.  We are not setting up a farmers union.  We are setting up 
a body that has to be responsible to the federal minister because 
there is no other way of doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  They protest.  What they are proposing 
is unions.  That party does not want government in Ottawa.  It 
does not want government in the provinces.  It wants some sort of 
people's parliament that can only translate into a union.  As 
usual, the Reform Part is on the same side as the Bloc Quebecois, 
wishing to dismantle government institutions in favour of 
regional institutions.  That is an absolute formula for disaster 
for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank heavens you were not going away, Madam Speaker; I was a 
little worried there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> Instead of the smoke and mirrors of a 
false debate, of a phoney debate about a preamble that has no 
force or about accountability that cannot exist, we are talking 
about a government board that has producers on it.  It is 
accountable in the traditional way that government bodies are 
accountable.  They are accountable to their elected 
representatives who are represented in turn by the minister.

composition with farmers.  That is the real debate.  If the

constructive, then by all means they should have a debate that 
criticizes clauses in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the clauses in the bill that will be ruled on by the 
courts which actually govern how the bill will operate.  Please, 
a debate about a preamble that everyone knows is meaningless is 
not really a serious debate at all.

<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, you 
have spoiled my fun.  I was looking forward to correcting you on 
that.  The name of my constituency changed from Vegreville to 
Lakeland and I am quite proud and delighted with this change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also delighted that I can be here taking part in a debate 
on a motion like this regarding a change to the preamble, which 
was brought forth by the member for Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe by bringing this amendment to the legislation before 
the House, he has initiated some very important debate on an 
extremely important issue.  We need that and I am proud to be 
able to represent the farmers of Lakeland constituency and I 
believe beyond that to some extent on this extremely important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get started on my comments, I would just like to make a 
comment on the comments of the member for Hamilton—Wentworth. 
One of the comments he made was that a preamble is needed only if 
the legislation in unclear.  He has got that right.  This 
legislation is unclear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked for clarification.  We have suggested 
clarification.  We have put forth perhaps 30 amendments or more 
to try to clarify this legislation.  Had the government done its 
job and had its members listened to farmers in the process, we 
would not have to do that.  We would have clear legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we do not, therefore we have to debate this 
preamble.  In fact, one of the changes we called for was a change 
to section 5 of the Canadian Wheat Board Act.  Section 5 is the 
part of the act that deals with who the board exists for. Section 
5 says that the wheat board exists for the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed changes under Bill C-72.  Bill C-4 is the 
reincarnation of Bill C-72.  We suggested a change to section 5 
so that it would clearly state in that section that the wheat 
board exists for the benefit of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has entirely refused to accept that change.  I 
am upset by that.  Farmers in my constituency are upset by that 
and this is a change we have to make to this legislation before 
it is passed.  We know it will be passed somewhere down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do everything we can of course to see to it that this 
bill does not pass because it is unacceptable.  I want to get 
right to the group of amendments that we are debating here, which 
is the preamble.  It was presented by the member for 
Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the member for Malpeque across the floor shouting some 
comments again.  I want the record to show that it was that same 
member for Malpeque who refused an emergency debate on ending the 
postal strike just a few minutes ago in this House.  I think that 
is intolerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not have a postal strike in this country, but I 
digressed.  Let the record show that it was the member for 
Malpeque who in fact refused that this House allow that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the group of amendments that we are debating.  What this 
group of amendments does is state clearly that the wheat board 
exists to maximize profits to grain farmers in western Canada. 
That is what this group of amendments will do and that is 
important because the current wheat board act does not state 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it states clearly that the wheat board exists for the 
pleasure of the Government of Canada.  I want to talk a little 
about that because there are some very important points to be 
made.  We cannot assume that the wheat board will always do what 
is in the best interests of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through a bit of history in the little time I have to 
demonstrate that very clearly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start before the turn of the century.  To market grain 
for our farmers, we had a series of co-operatives spring up. The 
Grain Growers was the first co-operative which became the United 
Grain Growers down the road with several amalgamations.  The 
purpose of the growers was to maximize farmers' profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later we had the prairie pools come in, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta.  The purpose of those organizations was a little 
different.  It was to maximize profits but also to share profits 
equally amongst members, to pool, to do what the wheat board now 
does.  This was the purpose of the first prairie pools, to pool 
profits.  Something else other than just maximizing the 
individual profit of a farmer came into the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look a little farther down, in the late twenties what 
happened was the prairie pools were getting into trouble with 
their pooling.  At the same time as holding back grain from 
market, hoping the prices would rise, the pools also speculated 
on the Winnipeg commodity exchange.  Because of that they got 
into severe economic difficulty and went to the Government of 
Canada for a bailout.  The bailout was the first version of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  Even the first version of the Canadian 
Wheat Board was not a monopoly.  Farmers had a choice, which is 
exactly what we are calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important cornerstones of the pools was for farmers 
to have a choice.  There would be no mandatory pooling in any 
grain or within the members of the co-operative, no mandatory 
pooling.  That was something carried over to this first wheat 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was during the war to help with the war effort.  I think it 
was somewhat justified although some people including people who 
became very important members of the Liberal cabinet later, like 
Mitchell Sharp, said that it was debatable whether the monopoly 
should have been put in place.  There certainly was debate about 
that from Mitchell Sharp.  In a book he wrote quite recently he 
condemned the monopoly of the wheat board staying in place after 
the war.  He was somewhat less judgmental of the board during the 
war.  Even important Liberals in the not too distant past have 
opposed this monopoly for the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board during the war 
was not to maximize profits for farmers.  The mandate was to get 
grain for the war effort at affordable prices.  That was clearly 
the mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the end of the war most Canadians, even a lot of farmers, 
were willing to tolerate that.  Farmers care about this country. 
They were willing to do their share to help with the war effort, 
more than their share.  That is so true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the war the monopoly was maintained for five years. 
Canadian farmers lost hundreds of millions of dollars through the 
maintenance of this monopoly.  They had no choice but to market 
through the monopoly, and again, it was to help the war effort. 
Yet the burden was not spread amongst all members.  After the war 
farmers paid a dear price for the board not having the express 
goal of maximizing profits.  That was intolerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This monopoly was enshrined in the seventies into the wheat 
board act.  Since then we see that there is nothing that states 
the purpose of the board is to maximize farmers' profit in the 
act.  That is why this preamble is so important.  It is not 
enough.  We need it clearly stated in the wheat board act itself 
that the reason for the wheat board existing is to maximize 
profits.  This legislation does nothing to help that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close on a comment on what the debate is in 
western Canada.  The debate is not whether we keep the board or 
not.  A vast majority of Canadian western farmers want the board. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they do not want the monopoly.  They want the freedom 
to choose whether they market through the board or around the 
board through their grain company or on their own to a customer, 
whether the customer be in Canada or somewhere else in the world. 
That is the debate.  Polls have shown that a majority of western 
Canadian farmers favour giving farmers a choice in marketing 
grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These polls have been tabled at committee and are available. The 
proof is there.  What we must do with this legislation is amend 
it so that farmers have that choice, a choice which I think is 
given to people in all other businesses, and the ability to 
choose whether they want to market through this government 
institution or in some other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the rest of the debate on the amendments 
to Bill C-4. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite a 
bit older than you are so you probably do not remember <I>The 
Music Man</I>.  I remember in the musical <I>The Music Man</I>, the 
guy came into town and he was going to help the young people in 
that town.  He quickly identified that one of the problems in 
that town was the pool hall.  I remember the song went “We've 
got trouble right here in River City and it is because of pool, 
That starts with <I>p</I> and that rhymes with <I>t</I> and that 
spells trouble”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, Mr. Speaker, we have trouble right here in River City, 
Ottawa, and the trouble is the power of the government to dictate 
what Canadians have to do.  I would say it starts with power.  It 
starts with <I>p</I> that rhymes with <I>t</I> and that spells 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me enlarge on what I am saying here.  Here we have western 
farmers who have not been given a choice to even express 
themselves.  We had this phoney ballot over there in the west 
where instead of giving the farmers an opportunity to check on 
the ballot a choice which many of them would have chosen, namely 
a dual marketing system, that was refused to them by these 
bureaucrats and autocrats here in Ottawa.  Shall I call them the 
dictators here in Ottawa because that is exactly what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, now the government is spinning this support for the 
wheat board as a continuation of the unaccountable, autocratic 
system that is there and that is not to the benefit of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking here about group one, the first amendment, the 
amendment to put in a preamble.  One of those Liberals over there 
said “Well, the preamble is meaningless”.  I beg to differ. 
Whenever a court rules, part of its thinking is how to determine 
the intention of the legislators.  If we declare what that 
intention is in the preamble it can have great weight in a 
court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to propose that the reason these Liberals do not 
want this particular amendment to pass and why they will 
autocratically with their party discipline overrule the common 
sense of a few of the Liberals over there who might vote for 
this is because its members must all vote together.  It must 
force this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as a little aside, something which annoys the dickens out 
of me is that here we are debating a very important issue and yet 
the decision on whether or not to vote for this amendment is 
going to be made by a person who, I venture to guess, will not 
have heard a word of this debate this afternoon.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lawyers, non-farmers and people from Ontario and the 
east who are not even covered by the wheat board.  As a matter of 
fact, I am led to believe that the marketing system of grain in 
Ontario is by a fully elected board.  If that is good enough for 
the farmers in Ontario why should we say to the farmers in 
western Canada “Oh, you don't know how to choose your own 
president of your board.  We had better get the minister to 
appoint him”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know what I think?  I think if the Liberals were to 
put a preamble here they would say whereas the Liberal government 
needs a place where it can appoint some of its friends and 
buddies and whereas the government needs a home for some of the 
failed Liberal candidates, therefore we should have a wheat board 
so that we have a place where we can appoint some of these guys.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you this question, Mr. Speaker.  I believe that you have 
had some business experience.  I do not know whether you have had 
any farm experience, but I happen to have.  I grew up on a farm 
in Saskatchewan.  It just so happens that the wheat board covers 
wheat and barley, but if the quality of that grain is down where 
it sells for feed, then it does not necessarily have to go 
through the wheat board.  A farmer can purchase or sell the feed 
grains outside of the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going to amaze you.  It will astound you.  The Liberals 
claim this wheat board is the best thing that ever happened to 
western farmers, and yet I know of farmers who have taken their 
high quality grain and voluntarily declared it to be feed 
quality, the very lowest quality, because selling it as feed they 
get more for it than if they sold it through the blinking wheat 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that wheat board is serving the farmers under conditions like 
that, then I have a bridge to sell you somewhere in the middle of 
the Atlantic Ocean.  This is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board has to have a purpose for being.  Why would 
there be any objection to having a preamble that says in simple 
terminology this is the purpose for this wheat board?  Why should 
there be a wheat board without a stated purpose?  That is really 
the debate here and I think the reason that the Liberals are 
opposed to this is they do not want the farmers to have it 
explicitly given.  The Liberals do not want them to find out the 
truth about their purpose, motivation and the reason for the 
existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we need this preamble so that when the farmers of the 
prairies go to challenge the accountability of this wheat board 
in court, the judges can look at that preamble and say the 
purpose of this wheat board is to serve the farmers. The purpose 
of this wheat board is to maximize their profits, not sell their 
grain at beneath feed prices, but to get the maximum of profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that farming right now is very competitive.  It is 
difficult to make a living on the farm these days, and I know of 
what I speak.  My brother farms on land which I worked on when I 
was a kid.  He and his boys are farming way more land and they 
are getting about three or four times the production per acre 
that we did when I was a youngster.  My brother is having a 
harder time making ends meet than my dad ever did.  Why is that 
with three or four times the rate of production?  It is because 
the farmers do not have the freedom to take what is rightfully 
their own and sell it where they want to sell it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the wheat board is doing its job, the wheat board will get 
the business.  There is no doubt about it.  If I am a farmer and 
I have some grain to sell, I am going to look at the different 
places where I can sell it.  If I get $2 a bushel here and $3 
here and $4 here, unless there are some very strange extenuating 
circumstances, I will pick the one that gives me the best price, 
the $4 per bushel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that there is a case where the farmer is offered by 
the wheat board maybe $2 a bushel with the hope of a future 
payment to make up the difference.  That is how it works.  Let us 
say that farmer sees another place where he can get maybe $5 a 
bushel right now, cash.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Liberals.  There are two or three of them over 
there who can think for themselves.  Will they have the courage 
to vote against their party and vote for common sense and say 
yes, if the farmer wants to have the right to sell his grain 
outside the wheat board he should have the right to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That happens to be in my view almost a human right. Whose grain 
is it? Who seeded it?  Who prepared the soil? Who paid the taxes? 
Who paid for the fuel?  Who paid for the fertilizer?  Who paid 
for the tractors and the machinery?  Who worked 18 hours a day? 
Who prayed for rain?  Who prayed for the locusts to go away? If 
we can get rid of the Liberals and the locusts, the farmers will 
have it made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be serious here at the end of my time.  I really want to 
appeal very seriously to the members over there.  The people who 
are making the decision on whether to vote for this are not 
hearing these arguments.  May they please use their heads.  May 
they please be independent in their thinking and vote for what is 
right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is 
the first opportunity I have had to rise in the House to speak. I 
cannot think of a better subject to do it on. It is a subject 
that I have grown up with all my life and heard about all my 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into my speech, I would like to thank the people 
who helped put me here, the people who worked on my campaign and 
the people who had enough courage to vote for me.  I hope I do 
not let them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a feeling of responsibility that I rise today to 
address the amendment to the wheat board act, Bill C-4, and in 
particular Motion No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This wheat board act historically has been a subject of much 
discussion in the constituency I represent, the constituency of 
Lethbridge, and obviously right across the prairies.  Quite 
frankly, it has been a very divisive subject.  It has pit rural 
neighbour against rural neighbour and region against region.  It 
has caused a lot of hardship and a lot of hard feelings among the 
farm families on the prairies, probably more than any other 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are grain farmers on the prairies who want to see the 
Canadian Wheat Board completely dismantled. They are fed up with 
the lack of accountability to the producers. That is what this is 
all about.  It is accountability to the producers, not 
accountability to the government, and the lack of options that 
these producers have to market their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to be at an impasse here.  The government has taken this 
bill, it has worked with it and brought it back and it is still 
not acceptable.  Either the government continues to ignore the 
demands of producers, while many grain farmers are 
inappropriately fined and jailed, or it takes this sorry excuse 
of a bill back to the drawing board, makes some serious 
amendments and starts listening to the full scope of 
recommendations by producers and even its own Western Grain 
Marketing Panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government had the opportunity, why did it not change 
this tired legislation?  Why did it choose not to?  Why instead 
did it bring forward a half baked proposal that does not address 
the critical problems that are facing beleaguered grain farmers 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If producers did not support the bill when it was Bill C-72 
during the last Parliament, then they will not support this one. 
This government cannot change things just by slapping another 
number on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly enough, perhaps this piece of recycled legislation is the 
best the Liberals can come up with.  Considering that the 
Canadian Wheat Board controls $5 billion in sales, has 
approximately 110 producers and that farm group after farm group 
testified at the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
that this is a seriously flawed piece of legislation—I have 
letters from producer groups in western Canada explaining the 
problems they see with the legislation and begging this 
government to make changes—I guess I naively thought that the 
government would come up with something better, make a more 
serious effort on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-4 the government has failed to prove to producers that 
it is in the grain marketing business.  The time is long overdue 
for grain marketing to be treated with common sense using sound 
marketing principles in order to bring maximum returns to the 
producers for their products. That is what this bill should 
address, maximum returns for the producer.  A previous prime 
minister even went on record in years past to say “why should we 
sell this grain?”

</I></B></P><P align=left>Monopolies in other industries are rarely tolerated, so why are 
grain producers exceptions to the rule? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of grain farmers have spoken and Bill C-4 shows that 
the government is not listening, which perhaps may help to 
explain why it is rushed through committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not shown producers that it will be 
responsible to them through a completely producer elected board, 
insisting instead on appointing the key members of that board. 
The time has come for government to relinquish its monopoly on 
grain marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fully effective board of directors is fully elected board of 
directors if the voice of farmers is truly to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently, if the aforementioned amendment were adopted, 
section 3.02(4) would be deleted since it would not be necessary 
to specify equal powers between elected and non-elected 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has insinuated all the way through the process, 
and I heard the minister responsible say this, that the expertise 
to run this board does not exist among the producers. They have 
to have five appointed members because it is such a large 
business.  I suggest to the government that it look at some of 
the operations these producers have if it wants to see efficiency 
in operations. It could learn something and could maybe 
incorporate some of those practices into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine if producers ran their operations like the 
government does.  We do not hear of too many farmers who are 
running up huge deficits year after year, all the while adding to 
a huge debtload.  If only governments were held to the same 
degree of accountability as producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has chosen to cherry pick through the 
recommendations of the Western Grain Marketing Panel, focusing on 
the recommendations that fit its agenda and ignoring the 
recommendations that fit the needs of producers. What happened to 
all the recommendations that producers and the panel supported? 
Why were the requests for marketing offices producers are asking 
for ignored?  Why is the government so afraid to put some options 
on the table for producers?  Why did the government not resolve 
the contentious and divisive issue when it had the chance?  Where 
is the transparency that producers are demanding?  The auditor 
general is still denied access to the wheat board operations. 
This in itself is ringing alarm bells with producer groups across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board does not have to answer to the Access 
to Information Act.  How can the directors act freely if they are 
bound by this secrecy?  Why will the Liberal government not come 
clean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done in Bill C-4 to address the 
unbelievable problems in the grain transportation system in this 
country?  Absolutely nothing.  This government never even 
bothered to tackle the Canadian Wheat Board's role in grain 
transportation anywhere in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems and inefficiencies cost grain producers dearly every 
crop year, year after year.  The nightmare we experienced last 
year must not become a legacy to the efficiency or the lack 
thereof in our transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it always the products of hardworking Canadian grain 
farmers that sit on rail sidings?  Why are the grain cars put on 
sidings while other products continue to port?  Could it be 
because neither the rail company nor the wheat board is penalized 
for late delivery?  Could it be because the penalty goes directly 
to the producer, becoming just another transportation tax for 
producers to pay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, why when the Liberal government had the chance did 
it not address these problems?  Why when the Liberal government 
had the chance, and took the time and went to the considerable 
effort of setting up a panel to make recommendations in producing 
the bill, did it not put to rest the suspicions of producers in 
the divisive aspect of the Canadian Wheat Board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rural families of Canada and the prairies, families on both 
sides of this issue, deserve far more.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now debating this motion as the spokesperson for the 
Progressive Conservative Party. I thank the members of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for recognizing the importance 
of this issue, which is to help reduce child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me explain the reasons that led me to table this motion. 
We are all proud to be Canadians. As we know, to be a Canadian is to be 
part of a society which is blessed with a quality of life, which is 
based on fairness, and which enjoys sound economic development. We rely 
on a Canadian way of doing things that promotes economic development and 
social justice. We are recognized all over the world as the defenders of 
tolerance and fairness. 
However, there is a fly in the ointment. Among all industrialized 
countries, we come in second place in terms of the number of children 
living in poverty, right behind the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Campaign 2000, the changes that have occurred since 
1989, when the government pledged to eliminate child poverty, look like 
this: the number of children living in poverty has increased by 46%; the 
number of two-parent families living in poverty has increased by 39%; 
the number of single parent families has increased by 58%; the number of 
children living in families where unemployment is chronic has increased 
by 44%; the number of children living in families on welfare has 
increased by 6% and, finally, the number of children living in 
unaffordable housing has increased by 60%. These figures speak volumes. 
The problem is serious. Today, almost 1.5 million children live in 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to join the fight against this lack of 
equity. At the first ministers conference in June 1996, child poverty 
was put on the national agenda as a priority. Almost all premiers in 
Canada have asked their ministers responsible for social services to 
co-operate with the federal government on a new integrated child benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development recently announced this 
new benefit, and I congratulate him and his government on this 
initiative. A decision has been made to review the benefit and the 
respective roles of the federal, provincial and territorial governments 
in child assistance. The federal government intends to transfer to 
provincial and territorial governments the responsibility for helping 
low income working families. 
This function was filled by the earned income supplement, a program that 
will be integrated with the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All low income families in Canada will receive this new combined 
benefit, whether the parents work or not. Provincial governments will no 
longer have to pay extra benefits to families on welfare for the 
dentist, the optometrist and many other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the bill has not yet been announced. We all know it 
will come into force next July, but nobody really knows what is in it. 
It should define the role of the provinces. How much are they going to 
spend to alleviate child poverty, and how are they going to spend it? 
This undisclosed agreement is already called the reinvestment framework. 
Why is it called that? 
Because the federal government promised that the provinces would 
reinvest as much as the federal government, on a proportional basis of 
course, that is, the $6 billion invested by the government and maybe the 
additional $850 million it promised to invest in the next mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will hand bigger and more equitable cheques 
to all low income Canadian families. It has defined its own role more 
clearly, and we look forward to the reinvestment framework that will 
define the role of the provinces and territories.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just say that this reinvestment framework will be, I hope, 
of a comprehensive nature because no support measure can in itself solve 
the problem of poverty. This is a vast problem that has to be addressed 
from a comprehensive point of view. Children are poor because their 
parents are poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the report entitled “Improving Social Security in 
Canada”. It shows how the Canadian family and its needs are changing. It 
says, quite rightly, that most social programs were created in the 1950s 
and 1960s, when the typical family included three children and two 
parents: a father at work and a mother at home. Today, the average 
family has less than two children, and both parents work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 20 years, we have seen a steady increase in the 
number of double income couples, the number of working mothers with 
young children and the number of single parent families. Young parents 
are more educated, but they have unstable jobs, often part time, and 
without fringe benefits in most cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, the proportion of couples with school age children and 
with both parents working was 70%, compared to 30% in 1950. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have a decent standard of living today, families need a double 
income. The family is changing, and support measures must change too. 
Many changes are needed. We need quality child care. We need to make 
support for the care of handicapped children more accessible. 
Child care services must be flexible to fit work schedules and work 
locations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just seen how the social fabric of the family is changing, 
but everything else around the family is changing too. We must also look 
at community action programs for children. We must develop general 
approaches to problems related to children, prioritize new approaches 
and consolidate the ones that already exist, such as the community 
action program for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the breakdown of the social fabric and the solitude felt by 
many people who live as shut ins in their apartments, not knowing their 
neighbours, we must rely on community organizations to renew the ties 
that have been lost and to rebuild our social fabric. We must help them, 
and this help is also part of a comprehensive vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also prenatal nutrition programs, or assistance to 
native communities, who are living in worrisome conditions, to say 
the least.  As well, there are parental and maternity benefits.  As 
I told you, the problem is extensive and must be examined in a 
comprehensive manner, which includes asking ourselves whether we 
really have achieved equality between the sexes because a legal 
framework exists, or whether the reality of the matter is something 
else again.  Let us not forget that, of the 15.7% of children 
living with a single parent, that parent is their mother in 92.8% 
of cases, and that the vast majority of them, approximately 70%, 
live in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The longitudinal survey on children and youth revealed that 
one child in four is poor in Canada, that the economic disparity 
between them differs widely from one region of the country to 
another, that in Newfoundland one child in three lives under these 
conditions as opposed to one in four or five elsewhere in the 
country. 
It is a sorry state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can these children do well in school?  How many of them 
arrive hungry, with no lunch or snack, having left chilly living 
quarters in clothes as thin as their parents' wallets?  How many? 
One and a half million, one child in four.  Under such conditions, 
neither you nor I nor any of my colleagues would do well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we come back to the improved and expanded federal 
benefit.  This benefit will mean that many families will have more 
money to help them make ends meet, and for many of them the benefit 
will play a vital role.  But even the most generous benefit would 
not stamp out child poverty, because even in its improved form the 
benefit will still feel the effects of inflation next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, if I may, quote the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, who said recently at a dinner with members of the 
Laval chamber of commerce that by “putting our fiscal house in 
order, Canada has regained some leeway and the ability to make 
choices, important choices for society.  And governing is about 
making choices”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1740

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later in his speech he said also “There cannot be any real and 
strong economic union without having also a collaborative and dynamic 
social union to support it. The national child benefit is the latest 
example of this dynamic relationship between our social values and the 
concrete initiatives that are taken. One thing is certain: children who 
are cold and hungry when they arrive at school are in no condition to 
learn. This is unfair. In Canada, this makes no sense. Children are our 
future, the future of our society and the future of our economic 
development”. And what he says is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanism for the benefit is simple: the government will 
increase the revenue of low income families. 
As for the provinces, since they will have to pay less for social 
assistance, they will be able to invest again in programs and services. 
This is what the minister pointed out when he said “Each province will 
benefit from greater flexibility. Quebec's flexibility, for example, 
will increase by $150 million a year”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would also like to point out that the people also need 
flexibility. Just imagine, if the benefit were indexed to the cost of 
living, the cost would increase by $170 million a year. That is $170 
million the government saves each year, but it is also $170 million less 
for the underprivileged every year. That is because there is no 
protection for the child benefit. That is because the benefit is only 
partially indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain. The amount of the benefit is adjusted every year, 
but only if inflation is above 3%. 
Because inflation has remained under that level for a number of years 
now, and following the upswing in the Canadian economy, there has never 
been any increase or adjustment to their benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are dependent on what governments decide. If we are giving 
them something today, it is because we gave them nothing before. We are 
only catching up. They have to be allowed to keep up with the cost of 
living. Canadian families are suffering from declining purchasing power, 
and the underprivileged have trouble meeting their family obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child benefit could be an important safeguard against the 
devastating effects of child poverty, but the value of the benefit has 
constantly declined over the last decade, because it is only partially 
indexed to inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government spent $4.1 billion dollars in child 
benefits in 1984, and $5.1 billion in 1994.  This represents a 25% 
increase compared to an increase of some 46% in the cost of living. 
If the 1984 benefits had really been indexed to inflation, they 
would have risen to $6 billion in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that some decisions, such as setting a limit for 
indexation, were based a a certain context.  When this was adopted 
in 1985 by the Conservative government of the day, the country was 
emerging from the economic crisis of 1982, and needed to tighten up 
its administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were heading toward a financial dead end.  This was what 
the right decision had to be. But, as the Minister of Human 
Resources has said, public finances have been put on a sounder 
footing. Now we have to make societal choices. 
To govern is to make choices, as the minister has said, but it is 
also knowing how to adapt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian council on social development, if we 
add up all the 1% and 2% increases in inflation over recent years, 
the loss for Canadian families represents 13% of total benefits. 
This now ought to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inflation raises the nominal value of family income.  Far more 
families are moving over the income limit every year by receiving 
the child benefit, even if the real value of their income has not 
increased.  The cumulative impact is a reduction in the child 
benefit of some $150 to $170 million yearly.  As a consequence, an 
additional investment in the benefit system merely replaces what 
has been lost in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a way of counteracting this effect of inflation, and 
it is to agree to examine the level of indexation, which is why I 
rise to defend this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the government recognized that the same situation for 
our seniors' benefits needed remedying.  I am therefore asking that 
we do as much for our children.

tell our children that they are important to us.  We must remind 
them that the intention in 1989 of eliminating child poverty by the 
year 2000 still stands.  We must not forget, hon. members of 
Parliament, that we must be fair in the choices we make in society. 
We must not forget that it is the children living in poverty today 
who will be turning the wheels of the economy tomorrow.  We must 
not forget to be fair in the way we consider the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that Canada's economy seems to be back on track, we must 
remember that we can now look ahead and put social justice in this 
country back in balance.  To this end, we must present all of our 
children and their families with an honest and a realistic schedule 
for resolving the problem of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remind federal, provincial and territorial authorities 
that, if they do not work together in carrying out their 
responsibilities and their duties toward those who are most 
disadvantaged, we will not resolve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not really trying to move them along, but for a number of 
years we have produced endless reports and studies and I think it 
is high time to show the million and a half children living in 
poverty that their country is trying to find ways to improve their 
situation.  Let us give them the means we consider necessary to 
resolve their situation, and later on they will come to recognize 
our good intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us try to give our children a healthy space to develop. 
A balance between federal, provincial and territorial governments 
and getting things in hand in the community will lead to the 
establishment of effective structures that will put an end to the 
devastating effect of poverty on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the members of this House, therefore, in order to 
eliminate the negative effect of inflation, to review the level at 
which the child benefit is indexed, as they did with seniors' 
benefits. 
Let us reclaim Canada's title of champion of social justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak to this private member's motion which recommends that the 
government review the level at which the Child Tax Benefit is 
indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am unable to support the motion and in the few minutes 
available to me I would like to explain my reasons.  Before I 
begin I want to emphasize that the government continues to place 
a very high priority on making assistance available to families 
with children, particularly those at the low and modest income 
levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a moment to explain how the indexing provisions work 
with respect to the child tax benefit.  Under the Income Tax Act 
the child tax benefit is partially indexed on an annual basis. It 
goes up each year by the amount the consumer index exceeds 3%. 
Many of my colleagues will recall that this policy of partial 
indexation was introduced to help address the severe fiscal 
problems facing the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partial indexation of the child tax benefit is consistent with 
how other elements of the personal tax system are treated.  For 
example, the basic personal credit, the spousal credit and the 
tax brackets are all partially indexed.  This is a policy which 
applies broadly across the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Income Tax Act has been amended a number of times to allow 
for the child tax benefit discretionary increases.  In actual 
fact the motion before us today should be considered as a 
proposal to amend the Income Tax Act and move to full indexation 
of the child tax benefit base and threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know the only realistic alternative to 
discretionary increases is the full indexation of the child tax 
benefit.  While the government fully supports the broader goal of 
increasing assistance to families with children, let us not 
forget that with an inflation rate of 1.6% per year, restoring 
full indexation of the child tax benefit would cost the federal 
government about $160 million per year.  In addition, it would be 
difficult to restore full indexation to some tax parameters and 
not others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal revenue implications of moving to full indexation of 
all tax parameters are quite substantial, with a cost of $850 
million a year. 
The cost is cumulative, so it means that it will be $850 million 
in year one, $1.7 billion in year two, and so on.  Such revenue 
losses could threaten the government's program to restore fiscal 
balance.  Because of these potential fiscal costs the government 
is unable to support the motion.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I assure the House that the government will review the 
policy of partial indexation once our fiscal position makes it 
possible to do so.  In the meantime the government is committed 
to targeting additional assistance to priority areas like 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two budgets, for example, the government increased 
by $850 million the assistance provided to low income families 
through the child tax benefit.  Since July 1997 over 720,000 low 
income working families have received increased benefits as a 
result of restructuring and enriching the working income 
supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maximum benefits increased from $500 per family to $605 for the 
first child, $405 for the second child and $330 for each 
additional child.  Next July these benefits will be extended to 
all low income families as part of the joint federal-provincial 
initiative known as the national child benefit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit system has three key objectives:  to 
prevent and reduce child poverty, to improve work incentives and 
to simplify administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the national child benefit system the federal government 
will assume a larger role in providing basic income support to 
families with children.  The provinces and territories will make 
corresponding reductions to the child component of their social 
assistance payments and reinvest all the savings in complementary 
programs and other benefits and services for low income families. 
For the lowest income families the proposed increases in the 
child tax benefit represent a 50% increase in federal benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing I remind hon. members the government has promised 
a further enrichment of child benefits of the same magnitude 
during its mandate.  As I stated earlier, these actions 
demonstrate that assistance to families with children, 
particularly low and modest income families, is and will continue 
to be a priority of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat that the government will review the policy of 
partial indexation once it is fiscally appropriate to do so.  For 
these reasons I am unable to support the motion before the House. 
I encourage all my colleagues to do the same and not support the 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is as pleasure for me to speak today to 
the motion moved by the member for Shefford, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should review the 
level at which the child benefit is indexed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can question the brevity of this motion, the strength of its 
wording or the message to be conveyed, but the fact remains that it is 
interesting to be able to debate this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is rather ironic. Members will recall that the present 
partial indexation was introduced by the Tory government of the day. 
This partial indexation works as follows. It was decided that as long as 
the inflation rate did not reach 3%, there would be no indexation. This 
means that, since 1992, there has been no indexation whatsoever. 
Therefore, families have been systematically losing money at a higher 
rate than the real inflation rate, because if the real inflation rate 
had been taken into account, the child benefit would have been increased 
accordingly. Right now, there is no indexation. For the families 
involved this represent a shortfall of $850 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more ironic is that the Liberals have been pursuing 
the same policy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT48"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT48"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1755

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in 1992, the current Deputy Prime Minister stated “The 
government talks about this new child benefit program it has come up 
with, but let us look at this program. In fact, a family with a $40,000 
annual income will only receive $44 more each year. Within three years, 
this benefit will be reduced by 10% and, in ten years, most families 
will no longer be receiving any assistance because this benefit is not 
indexed for inflation”. That is what the current Deputy Prime Minister 
said in February 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals came to power, they picked up where the 
Conservative government left off. They chose not to change this 
situation. 
According to the Caledon Institute, which conducts quality social 
analyses, the child tax benefit is infected by the partial deindexation 
virus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a losing proposition for all families. Those that were 
entitled to benefits lose out on full deindexation, but low income 
families are much harder hit. In their case, whatever amount is not 
indexed represents money they cannot depend on for their daily 
requirements. This is a correction the Liberals failed to make and 
should have made when they came to office again in 1993. Today, they are 
being reminded of that fact the motion put forward by the Conservative 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also be remembered that, before 1984, the family policy 
included family allowance payments, child tax credits and exemptions for 
dependent children. 
In 1984, some $6.7 billion was paid out under this family policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changes introduced in 1997, this amount had gone down to 
$5.1 billion, which means a $1.6 billion cut in payments made to 
families over 13 years. So, the $850 million that the human resources 
development minister said would be put back into the system will only 
partly offset the cuts made since 1993.  That is why we may feel it is 
very relevant to take a good look at the child benefit indexation rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to remind you of the somewhat prophetic 
words of Benoît Tremblay, who said in 1992—he was the member for 
Rosemont at the time—that it was tantamount to giving up on having a 
real family policy. 
We are moving away from a family-based policy toward a policy designed 
to fight poverty, but we are no longer doing so by using an integrated 
approach that would allow families in Quebec and Canada to enjoy 
adequate benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Tremblay said “The perverse effects will be felt 
gradually”. 
These perverse effects have indeed become reality. What the Deputy Prime 
Minister said in 1992 did happen, and now we are facing a situation 
where, from year to year—because we are not about to see a 3% rate of 
inflation in the coming years—the same thing will systematically 
occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, at the rate things are going, the $850 million 
shortfall generated between 1992 and 1997 may well exceed $1 billion by 
the year 2000. 
It also means that over an equivalent period in the future, let us say 
until the year 2002, the shortfall for families will total $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore urgent to look at the situation and to make up for 
this shortfall generated by a decision which was made by the 
Conservatives and maintained by the Liberals, and which now has a major 
negative impact on all families in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Shefford is right in saying that the government 
should review the level at which the child benefit is indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is right, but I think we should do more than to review the 
level at which the child benefit is indexed. 
We should actually look at the possibility of fully indexing the child 
benefit. The government would then realize that, as far as this House is 
concerned, full indexation is the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that the 3% rule came into effect following 
years during which the inflation rate had stood at 10%, 12%, 8%, 6% and 
5%. Three per cent seemed very reasonable then. It was truly felt that 
automatic indexation would take place year after year. But this was not 
the case. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen inflation rates of 2.%, 2.5% and 2.8%, but it is the 
general inflation rate that counts. It can happen in a given year that 
the cost of living for daily necessities increases by more than 3%, but 
there is no indexing because the general cost of living index is less 
than 3%. So year after year, families have been absorbing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask why there is an increasing number of poor children, why 
there is an increasing number of families who cannot make ends meet and 
why we are in the process of building a split society, the answer I 
would say is that we have been slowly undermining the middle class by 
eliminating a benefit that allowed people to have an adequate standard 
of living and reamin above the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we can say because of all this that we have a policy 
that discourages families with children, that the family policy has been 
replaced by the fight against poverty, but this does nothing to further 
the objective of a true family policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to say that it cares for children and that it 
wants to fight child poverty, but the $850 million that it is promising 
to invest will only partially remedy the shortfall. An amount of $1.5 
billion was mentioned earlier. So there will still be a lot of room for 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve this, to ensure that the motion by the member for 
Shefford can be more effective, I will propose an amendment. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK209">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all of the words 
after the word “review” and substituting the following: 
“the possibility of fully indexing the child benefit.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the final version of the motion would read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of 
this House, the government should review the level at which 
child benefit is indexed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in this period of prebudgetary consultations, the 
government will be able to determine the figures and make the 
assessments necessary to ensure fairness once again, to give our 
families a chance, and to send the message that we want families to take 
their rightful place and to have the financial means to provide an 
adequate education for their children. We have to restore full 
indexation and thus prevent a recurrence of the unfairness we have 
today, when inflation rates of 1.2%, 2% or 2.5% are depriving families 
of these benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end with this and I would like to submit my amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe the amendment is in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when there is a debate about the welfare of Canadians, 
particularly young people, everyone is very interested.  I 
commend my colleague from Shefford for bringing forward her 
private member's motion which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should review 
the level at which the child benefit is indexed.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment has been proposed by the Bloc to bring the level to 
full indexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are all aware as Canadians, or at least most of us who 
have had families, the child benefits payable in Canada have 
undergone many changes during the past two decades.  The 1985 
budget, which is about 12 years ago, subjected the entire child 
benefit system to partial indexing.  That is what the member for 
Shefford is suggesting we need to study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Benefits increase only if inflation exceeds 3%.  Since the Bank 
of the Canada and the Government of Canada have made a commitment 
not to allow inflation to go over 3%, what we essentially have is 
no benefit increases even though there are inflation increases, 
which means that the value of the benefit is steadily eroding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This partial deindexing has now been in place for 12 years.  It 
really amounts to an automatic annual tax increase.  This is 
because inflation still erodes the value of the benefit and 
erodes the value of the threshold at which maximum benefits are 
paid.  There is a double whammy which increases the tax payable 
for families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the child benefit nor its threshold of $25,921 for 
maximum payment is fully protected against inflation.  The value 
of the benefit has steadily declined for 12 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is doing a lot of breast beating about 
child poverty and how it will attack it.  It is very interesting 
the government has done nothing about something that has eroded 
the disposable income in the hands of families who have to look 
after children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbelievable though it might be, the parliamentary secretary 
just said “We would like to do things like this but we will 
oppose the motion because there will be a fiscal cost to this”. 
He is really saying “We need the tax bucks, so forget it”. This 
keeps eroding the income of poor families who then produce the 
poor children the Liberals say they care so much about. Sometimes 
we do wonder if it is not true that Liberalism simply is saying 
the right thing but doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partial deindexing of the child benefit like the partial 
deindexing of the so-called refundable GST credit and the partial 
deindexing of the personal income tax system is regressive.  We 
use these buzz words a lot, but it really means that it hits poor 
people more than it hits higher income people.  This falls most 
heavily on the working poor, the very ones with the poor 
children, the child poverty the Liberals have said they will do 
so much about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tax increases are not transparent.  The Liberals can say 
one thing and do another.  It is very easy for them to hide this 
tax increase.  Although it happens every year the tax increase is 
never debated in the House and most Canadians do not even realize 
it is going on.  It is like the bracket creep we keep talking 
about.  It is the same sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Canada's leading social critics says that this amounts to 
social policy by stealth.  I find repugnant that this is from a 
government, from a party that is always talking about compassion 
for the poor and the downtrodden. It says it will help those most 
in need and to redistribute the social benefits of the country to 
those who need them the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet what do we find?  We find policy after policy after policy, 
including the current increases in the Canada pension plan 
premium, which fall most heavily on those least able to pay 
penalizing the families and the children most in need of the 
extra dollars the government is sucking out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This erosion of net family income continues in many ways.  The 
child benefit is only one example.  It results in higher and 
higher taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian family has suffered a $3,000 drop in real 
income since the Liberals took office in 1993.  If the Liberals 
had actually said their policies would cost $3,000 more a year by 
the time they were out of office, how many Canadians would have 
voted for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Liberals get elected on?  Jobs, jobs, jobs.  They 
were also to get rid of the GST.  They did neither.  They dropped 
the average Canadian family income by $3,000.  No wonder there is 
child poverty.  Now the Liberals can ride to the rescue and say 
that they will certainly do something about it.  They caused it, 
so they should do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1951 and 1973 real family incomes more than doubled, but 
since the mid-1970s total family earnings in real dollars 
adjusted for inflation have actually not improved at all.  This 
in spite of the fact that more and more two people in a family 
are working.  There is less ability for parents to make choices 
about caring for their own children because they simply need the 
extra dollars from both of them working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the rising numbers of dual income families, total 
inflation adjusted after tax incomes have fallen by $2,733 per 
worker since 1984.  This is simply unacceptable.  It is no wonder 
families do not have enough money to feed and clothe their kids, 
to pay the mortgage or the rent, and to make sure that their 
children have the necessities of life.  It is because the 
government thinks it is more necessary for the government to have 
the money than for the children to have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is incredible.  I hope nobody misses this fact.  Canadian 
taxpayers must start paying taxes at an income level of about 
$6,460.  If they make that grand sum of $6,460 per year the 
government says “All right, guys, start paying up”.  Who can 
live on $6,000?  Somehow government thinks that if they make over 
that they owe the government something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A family of four at an income level of $11,800 has to pay income 
tax.  It is brutal, absolutely brutal.  Under the seniors benefit 
the government says they do not have to pay tax for a family 
income of $11,000, but a family of four has to pay tax. No wonder 
there are poor children and families in the country.  Yet every 
year the government wants more.  It takes more and more.  I am 
happy, Mr. Speaker, that you and many other members of the House 
care about this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian family spends more in taxes than on food, 
clothing and shelter combined.  In 1996 Statistics Canada said 
the average Canadian family spent $21,000 on taxes but only 
$17,000 on food, clothing and shelter.  Government takes more out 
of us than we have left to look after our needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is simply increasing the rate.  It has an 
insatiable appetite for tax dollars.  That is why we call the 
finance minister a taxaholic.  That is exactly what he is.  One 
bottle is not enough any more.  It has to be more and more every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party simply says enough is enough.  When Canadians 
make money they should be able to keep the amount necessary to 
feed their children, to clothe their families and to provide them 
with shelter and the necessities of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes a whole chunk of the money Canadians need 
to look after their families and then says that it is giving some 
back.  The parliamentary secretary just said they would like to 
give more if they could afford it.  They will someday but in the 
meantime they cannot because they have fiscal costs.  It would 
cost them too much.  They need our money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to start giving Canadians tax relief.  Government does 
not have the right to take more and more money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this debate on the child 
benefit. It is an issue that is very important for children and 
families in this country.  I would like to congratulate the member 
for Shefford on her decision to move this motion.  On behalf of all 
my colleagues in the New Democratic Party, I would like to indicate 
our support for the motion as amended by the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is clearly an important one for all of us to be 
debating in this House.  It calls for a review of the indexing of 
the child tax benefit.  It is a very important initiative that 
should be part—and I add, a part—of a number of changes to the 
child tax benefit and to a whole range of initiatives dealing 
with children's needs and children's poverty in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the child tax benefit will erode over time if 
it remains partially indexed.  A portion of its gains will be 
lost to inflation each year.  The inflation over 3% formula, in 
operation for more than a decade, means that the value of child 
benefit declines in real terms by 3% each year as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for the Reform just mentioned, it is in fact 
“social policy by stealth”, as so aptly put by Ken Battle of 
the Caledon Institute.  As my colleague from the Bloc pointed 
out, the origin of this problem does rest with the Progressive 
Conservatives.  Let us keep in mind that the Tories introduced 
this negative feature into federal benefits, into the personal 
income tax system and the refundable GST credit, and it is the 
Liberals who have continued this policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a doubt in our mind, this government, the Liberal 
government today, must move quickly to reindex benefits to 
inflation to stop this decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, this is about one benefit, one 
initiative important to our goal, a goal I believe we all hold in 
common:  to reduce child poverty, but it should be recognized as 
only a beginning.  We must have in this country a comprehensive 
strategy to reduce child poverty that includes specifically 
setting targets for reducing unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we have a strategy to reduce child poverty unless we 
reduce unemployment?  In fact, no strategy to reduce child 
poverty can be complete without a real target for reducing 
unemployment and a will to meet those targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistically speaking, it should be noted that for every 1% 
drop in the unemployment rate, 72,000 children can be lifted out 
of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another element that must be part of any strategy to 
address child poverty in this country today.  That initiative is 
something that has been promised so many times over by 
Progressive Conservatives and Liberals in this country in 
election after election after election and then put on the back 
burner.  That must be raised again to the forefront of our 
political agenda, and that of course is affordable child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit is structured to impel low income mothers 
into the workforce without providing funding for quality child 
care options.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should be ashamed of its decision time 
and time again to keep this issue on the back burner despite 
clear commitments, especially in the 1993 election, to ensure 
that this country would have a national child care plan to 
provide quality, affordable, accessible spaces for families right 
across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no discussion initiated at present by the federal 
government around this issue at all.  There is no hint of any 
plans from the Liberal government to strengthen child care as a 
complement to the child benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we address child poverty?  How can we assist families 
cope in these very difficult times unless we make very serious 
inroads in the provision of such a valuable service for this 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics speak for themselves.  For all the time the 
Liberals have been in power and failed to keep their promise on a 
national child care plan, failed in providing a meaningful social 
assistance program in this country and failed in so many other 
respects, in that time 200,000 more children have fallen below 
the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more families, especially single parent families headed 
by women with small children, are struggling on a day to day 
basis and falling further and further behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely imperative for this House, for this Parliament 
to look at the child benefit in a much bigger context.  The $600 
million in new federal spending announced in the 1997 budget is 
only a drop in the bucket compared to the billions of dollars the 
federal government spends on other programs, the additional 
billions the federal government hands out in tax expenditures and 
the $7 billion Ottawa has cut from federal social transfers to 
the provinces under the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit, however important, does not really 
offer any new gains.  It merely substitutes ground already lost. 
As a result of a decision in the late 1980s to partly remove 
inflation protection from the existing child tax benefit, its 
value has been eroding by up to $150 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's announcement of $850 million down payment or 
$600 million in the new federal spending will only serve to bring 
poor families closer to where they were when the Liberals took 
power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the provinces today are pushing for a further commitment 
of $2.5 billion into the fund by the year 2000.  Certainly it is 
our hope and I hope the hope of many other members in this House 
that this government, the Liberal government, will move ahead 
with such a commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a commitment to a comprehensive anti-poverty agenda, the 
child benefit is but a band-aid solution that actually acts to 
depress wages and further marginalize poor people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are poor because their parents are poor.  Eliminating 
child and family poverty will require a concerted effort on all 
our parts.  It will require and demand a comprehensive strategy 
from the federal Liberal government that would include many 
essentials, that would include job creation, housing, child care, 
training and post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no hesitation in supporting the motion today, 
particularly as amended by the Bloc to ensure full indexation of 
the national child benefit.  However, we want to register our 
concerns about the absence of a comprehensive strategy from the 
Liberal government and use this opportunity to call on the 
government to come forward with a meaningful comprehensive 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must act now in order to put Canada back on track to meeting 
the all-party goal, members will remember, introduced in this 
House in 1989 by the then NDP leader Ed Broadbent, a goal that 
said we must end child poverty by the year 2000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, we are awfully close to the year 2000 and we have only 
seen child poverty worsen in this country.  It is getting more 
serious with each day that passes because of a failure on the 
part of our national government to take up this issue and put in 
place a comprehensive strategy that gets at the roots of the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us use this opportunity today to recommit ourselves to that 
goal to eliminate child poverty from this country as quickly as 
we can.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to debate the motion of the hon. member for 
Shefford.  I congratulate her for bringing this matter to the 
House.  It is something we are all concerned about and that is 
the issue of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked a lot tonight about the issue of inflation and how we 
need to adjust child tax credits for that.  I would like to come 
at this from a different angle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that long ago that not all of our legislation, 
through the income tax system, was totally indexed to the rate of 
inflation.  In fact, we lived in inflationary times.  Peoples' 
wage agreements and various other aspects of their financial 
lives were tied to the consumer price index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that that creates an inflationary spiral.  In other 
words, every time the rate of inflation went up, everybody's 
income went up, child tax credits went up, everything else went 
up and it similarly impacted on inflation.  I cannot help but 
impress on the member how devastating that inflationary time we 
lived in not long ago was to low income families.  They are the 
ones who are less likely to be able to adjust to the dramatic 
rising costs of living, their rent, food, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one aspect I want to address on why I oppose the 
member's motion.  I believe that if we move in this specific area 
of child tax benefits, we will similarly be obligated to do the 
same thing throughout the whole income tax system.  You cannot 
very well argue that at one point is a necessity and yet at 
another point it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you look at it in broad terms you will also see that this 
would create over $850 million in lost tax revenues.  Not only 
that, it also brings us back into this inflationary economy which 
will have a tremendous dilatory effect on low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is concerned about the issue of child poverty. 
We did in fact inject $850 million into the envelope of an 
enhanced child tax benefit system for working income families. 
As we speak members of both federal and provincial governments 
are debating the issue of how to deliver this program within 
provincial envelopes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see that one of the things our government is 
insisting on is that there be an accountability package that goes 
with it.  In other words, it is not simply money locked into an 
envelope of a benefit package but there is some way as a country 
we can measure the success of those programs.  In other words, 
there is some way to measure if child malnutrition has been 
improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are things that are not so easy to jump up and be in 
favour of and implement.  They take time and effort and 
dedication.

<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to see you in the chair 
this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today on a very serious issue dealing with impaired 
driving in Canada.  Last October 24, I asked the Minister of 
Justice if she would table rapidly amendments to the Criminal 
Code dealing with this serious issue.  I also asked her if she 
would commit to concrete steps on behalf of the government to 
review the Criminal Code, roadside procedures, and enact a 
victims bill of rights in unison with an effort to combat drunk 
driving in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister to date has not committed to either of those 
requests.  One thing that we have seen in the past is that her 
predecessor and, I would submit, the current Minister of Justice 
have given lip service to amendments in this area.  They have 
often talked of it and they have appeased, I would suggest, to 
some degree victims rights groups and those concerned with this 
issue by giving the appearance of wanting to do something about 
it, seeming very sincere and genuine in their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to date we have not seen anything concrete either by 
way of a legislative initiative or even the time spent in talking 
to these groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is anything that has become clear over the past number 
of months in this House on the issue of impaired driving it is 
that the statistics and the effect on the ground that impaired 
drivers have on the roads and highways throughout the country and 
on the lives of Canadians are significant.  The statistics are 
absolutely shocking when one delves into them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in her answers to the questions indicated that she 
was waiting for a report to be tabled by the transportation 
department.  As well, she was waiting to meet further with her 
provincial counterparts.  I again suggest that this is a delay 
because it is very clear that none of these individuals in the 
Department of Transport or her provincial counterparts can effect 
an immediate change to the Criminal Code of Canada.  That 
responsibility lies with the minister herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate today what I have said previously.  In my mind, the 
Minister of Justice has an opportunity to do something and to do 
something quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to suggest a few things in the time I have.  The 
statistics I have indicated have been stated time and time again: 
4.5 persons killed in Canada every 24 hours, every day of the 
week, 365 days of the year.  Impaired drivers injure or kill over 
300 people in Canada every day.  In 1995 alone, 519 people were 
killed across the country by impaired drivers. These are shocking 
statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that alcohol significantly increases the risk 
every time a person gets behind the wheel, regardless of the 
level of intoxication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to do something and quickly.  The most effective way 
to do that is to bring in amendments to the Criminal Code that 
would strengthen police ability to deal with impaired driving. 
Nothing has been done to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there are concrete things the government can do today. 
As a start it would be to lower the blood alcohol concentration 
that is criminal in this country, to review the Criminal Code 
with respect to reasonable and probable grounds required by 
police officers so that they might investigate crash sites 
involving death and serious bodily harm. That evidence of an 
accident would, in and of itself, be grounds for police officers 
to make a demand.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could change the language in the Criminal Code to 
reflect the seriousness of impaired driving accidents involving 
death and the suggestion would be to characterize it as vehicular 
homicide.  If nothing else, this would emphasize the seriousness 
of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of these new standards would also go hand in hand 
with the enactment of a victims bill of rights which would 
include and enhance greater participation of victims in the 
criminal trial process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Justice is committed to this issue and is 
prepared to do more than just lip service then these issues will 
be brought up further in the justice committee and will be acted 
on rather than simply given fair comment and ongoing debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something the government must take a leadership role in. 
The Canadian public has spoken very clearly.  Eighty per cent of 
people in this country want the government to act on these 
issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
point out to the hon. member that things are not as simple as he 
puts them.  There has been much discussion in this House on this 
issue. Despite what the hon. member said, we are on the record as 
saying this is a serious issue and we are taking it very 
seriously.  The minister will be taking it up with her provincial 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member, as a member of the justice committee, 
that the justice committee has already stated that we will be 
dealing with the issue of drinking and driving as well as with 
the issue of victims rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate shows that it is obvious that impaired driving is 
a problem we dearly want to see resolved, whatever our political 
persuasion.  Although members do not all agree on the best 
solutions to this problem, they all share the same goal, which is 
to reduce the number of cases of impaired driving. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent statistics from the Canadian Centre for Justice 
Statistics were released yesterday. The rate of persons charged 
with impaired driving in 1996 went down by 7% from what it was 
the previous year.  The 1996 rate showed a marked decrease of 47% 
compared with the 1986 rate. That does not mean we are proud of 
these statistics or that we should all say the problem has been 
solved, but contrary to the statistics mentioned by the hon. 
member, these recently released statistics indicate the rate of 
persons charged with impaired driving has gone down.  For 1996 
all the jurisdictions in Canada reported a decrease in the rate 
of persons charged with impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre stated that in looking at the adult court survey data 
included in the <I>Juristat</I> that unlike other offences under the 
Criminal Code, persons charged with impaired driving are more 
likely to be found guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is very committed to bringing forth some solutions 
to this problem.  She will be—

their average age was 52, that the region is suffering high 
unemployment, and that these workers were calling for a modified 
POWA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Louise Harel in Quebec is in agreement.  Jean Dupéré, the

Human Resources Development in Ottawa is refusing to budge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should sit down and take a serious look at the 
issue of these men from the BC mine in Black Lake.  Black Lake is 
four kilometres from Thetford, and the small <I>a</I> asbestos region is 
not the same as the large <I>A</I> Asbestos region. 
The guys from the BC mine are not workers from British Columbia, as 
the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for International 
Cooperation claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Minister of Human Resources Development himself 
not reply to our questions regarding the creation of a modified

completely adrift.

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation, 
and tonight, the reply will probably come from the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why they think the BC Mine workers are from British 
Columbia and that is also why the minister himself is wrong in 
portraying the city of Asbestos as the capital of the asbestos industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should leave the war veterans aside and take care of 
the BC Mine veterans. 
Furthermore, he should address the issue of cooperation between Quebec 
and Canada instead of letting the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister for International Cooperation stumble in his place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in the Black Lake region would be better served if 
cabinet knew that Black Lake is not Asbestos and that the BC Mine is in 
Black Lake and not in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these workers are over 50 and they are entitled to a 
modified POWA because, on March 7, 1996, an application to that effect 
was submitted to the Minister of Human Resources Development; 
furthermore, the program must be modified because Jean Dupéré is ready 
to make his own contribution to this POWA.

the minister, despite the fact that he is not here, is sensitive, 
open and always willing to listen to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have previously indicated, the government recognizes 
difficulties experienced by Canadians who lose their jobs, 
particularly those affected by the closing of the mine in Black 
Lake, in the hon. member's riding.  However, this layoff cannot 
be considered under the program for older workers adjustment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The POWA ended last March because, among other things, it was not 
fair and equitable to all older workers in Quebec and Canada.  The 
program was offered only in some provinces.  The Government of Canada 
assumed 70% of the cost and the provinces 30%.  There were so many 
restrictions to the program that a good number of older workers simply 
could not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government generously offered almost $3 million to help the 
miners at the British Canadian miner re-enter the workforce.  The 
Department of Human Resources Development went from passive income 
support to proactive measures in order to help workers re-enter the 
workforce. 
Provinces also worked along that line.
