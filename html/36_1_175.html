opinion that the intent and policy of the words in question is in 
the public interest and reflects the opinion of the great 
majority of Canadians, and this House proposes, in lieu of the 
amendments made by the Senate, that the amendments be amended to 
read as follows:

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak this morning on Bill 
C-20, an act to amend the Competition Act.  As you know, we 
passed third reading of this bill in the House on September 23, 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this bill is to improve and consolidate the 
Competition Act. 
Some of the key amendments were intended to equip the 
competition bureau to combat the degrading crime of misleading 
telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also included provisions for whistle blowing intended 
to protect employees providing the competition bureau with 
information on activities of their employer limiting 
competition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those whistleblowing provisions were removed from the bill by 
the Senate as a result of arguments made by Progressive 
Conservative members of the Senate who focused on some concerns 
raised by the Canadian Bar Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today this House has the opportunity to reconsider the 
whistleblowing provisions and an opportunity to do something 
positive for Canadian consumers and legitimate businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that protection for whistleblowers has been 
the subject of a number of legislative proposals over the past 
several years and has been introduced in private members' bills. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director of investigations and research at the competition 
bureau acted on this continued interest in whistleblowing by 
asking Mr. Justice Dubin to study the matter and identify the 
provisions that would be relevant should legislation on whistle 
blowing have to be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This study and its appendix on the provisions on whistleblowing 
were released on November 18, 1997 and posted on the Web site of 
the Competition Office for the public to consult. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the initiative of the hon. member for Ottawa Centre, the 
whistleblowing provisions were introduced into Bill C-20 on May 
26, 1998 when it was under consideration by the industry 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member proposed these provisions to encourage 
individuals who have knowledge of price-fixing arrangements to 
act in the public interest and to report them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member indicated then, the amendments resulted from 
a great deal of consultation with many people in the community 
and throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Bar Association raised some concerns about the 
whistleblowing provisions with the Senate Standing Committee on 
Banking, Trade and Commerce, one of which was that there had not 
been sufficient consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made use of this time for additional consultation with 
the bar and other groups that have expressed interest in this 
provision. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Interest Advocacy Centre, an organization comprising 
over 800 private members and corporations representing over 1.5 
million Canadians, provided strong support for the provisions on 
whistleblowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Direct Marketing Association also considered the 
provisions very important.  The Canadian Bar Association as well 
considered there was enough protection for whistleblowers in 
Canadian legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government believes it is important to enact these 
additional protections as an express encouragement by parliament 
to people to report criminal activity limiting competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the substantive objections of the bar, the principal 
concern is that there could be criminal liability for requesting 
an employee to do something that is not actually illegal at the 
time of the request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act sets out certain criminal offences, but also 
deals with so-called reviewable matters in which conduct such as 
an abuse of a dominant position only becomes illegal after it is 
prohibited by the Competition Tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet this concern I have proposed an amendment to the 
whistleblowing provisions which will limit their application to 
conduct that is a criminal offence under the act and will not 
refer to conduct that is merely contrary to the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBA also argued that the potential for criminal sanctions 
could lead to inefficiencies in businesses where an employer 
might hesitate to discipline unproductive staff, even though 
legitimate reasons exist for doing so.  However, the burden 
always remains with the crown to prove all elements of the 
offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  If legitimate reasons exist 
for disciplining or firing an employee, then those reasons will 
no doubt raise the reasonable doubt that would preclude a 
criminal conviction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion is that employees acting in good faith when they 
report competition limiting behaviour have our protection 
against vengeful employers.  The provisions on whistleblowing, 
by balancing the rights of the employees and the employer, do 
not place an undue burden of proof on the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have proposed in response to some of the concerns about 
the possibility of excessively heavy sanctions, is to withdraw 
the sanctions set out in the first provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An employer will now be liable to the same sanctions as the 
Criminal Code provides for the infraction of a federal statute. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that it is important to send the right signal to 
Canadians that we need to work together to combat crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed that this issue held up Bill C-20 in the 
other place last December.  I believe the modifications proposed 
to the whistleblowing provisions do represent improvements to the 
bill and do address the principal concerns of the Canadian Bar 
Association and of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is time for us to act quickly again.  We need to provide 
appropriate protection for whistleblowers to enable the 
Competition Bureau to obtain the information needed to properly 
investigate criminal activity.  We need to bring Bill C-20 into 
force to provide effective measures against deceptive 
telemarketers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With every day that passes, there are new victims of scams. 
Every day that passage of Bill C-20 is delayed, the confidence of 
Canadians is put at greater risk.  This is the moment to 
consider consumers, businesses and the organizations responsible 
for implementing the legislation across Canada, who have 
advocated expeditious passage of Bill C-20. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to show all of these consumers across Canada that the 
House is listening to them.  I urge that the bill receive 
expeditious passage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to the proposed amendments 
to Bill C-20.  Before I begin I would like to reacquaint members 
of the House with the full scope of this important piece of 
legislation.  I think that once my colleagues understand the 
necessity and urgency of this proposed legislation they will also 
understand why the motion before us is worthy of support, and why 
the changes made in the Senate would only work to dilute the 
effectiveness of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is an act to amend the Competition Act and to make 
consequential and related amendments to other acts.  Essentially 
this bill will create an enforceable and judicial code of conduct 
for those in the direct marketing industry.  But I can assure 
members of the House that this is not an onerous government 
imposition on this industry. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a welcome framework for ethical practice, welcomed by 
legitimate direct marketers who understand that a legislative and 
regulatory environment designed with common sense can create a 
business environment that will foster growth and profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Direct marketers understand that only in an environment of trust 
and accountability will Canadian consumers use their services. 
Direct marketers also understand that this trust and 
accountability must come not only from their own due diligence 
and fair conduct but from legislation supported by the full 
weight of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 gives teeth to the voluntary practices already adhered 
to by legitimate players in this $4 billion a year industry. 
Under this new law, telemarketers would have to identify who they 
are representing, disclose the price of their services or 
products they are selling, and explain clearly why they are 
making the call.  These three simple provisions, had they existed 
in the past, could have saved many Canadians from the humiliation 
of being victims of deceptive telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is fair to wait any longer to give this 
protection to Canadian consumers.  My hon. colleague from 
Kelowna, British Columbia pointed out in a speech he gave some 
time ago that protection against telemarketing deception has been 
debated in this House since 1996 and that the cost of ignoring 
this problem is estimated to be approaching $5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally do not plan to delay the implementation of this 
bill any longer and will consequently be keeping my remarks as 
brief as I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also proposes amendments to the Competition 
Act. Before I address those amendments, I would like to stress to 
this House as I have done on other occasions that while 
competition laws do have the potential to create a fair and level 
playing field in the market, they can be arbitrary and 
economically stifling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laws that make criminals out of individuals who are guilty only 
of selling quality products at low prices should not be supported 
in a democratic society that believes in the power and justice of 
economic freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not support a Competition Act that would allow men like 
Bill Gates or Canada's own Conrad Black to be treated like common 
criminals only because they dare to achieve and they dare to be 
the best at what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like members of this House to take note of these remarks 
as competition laws will surely surface in this House again and 
again.  We can choose to create fairness in the context of 
economic freedom or we can create a bureaucracy under which both 
consumers and producers will suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the overall strategy to deal with deceptive 
telemarketing, amendments were made to the Competition Act to 
control deceptive marketing, advertising and pricing.  These 
changes were designed to complement the code of conduct created 
in the same legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments continue to have the support of the Reform 
caucus but it must be understood that even the most rigorous 
protection against deceptive direct marketing or misleading 
advertising will accomplish nothing if individuals do not step 
forward to ensure that the law is adhered to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who are the victims of deceptive marketing in any form 
are often too ashamed and too embarrassed to bring their concerns 
before a court.  When the victims of a crime are afraid to act to 
ensure that justice is applied consistently, something else must 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To combat this situation, the legislators involved in the 
creation and fine tuning of Bill C-20, particularly my colleague 
from Ottawa Centre, sought to create a unique process by which to 
ensure that the new law was properly adhered to.  I am making 
reference here to the whistleblowing provisions in Bill C-20, the 
provisions that an unelected and unaccountable Senate decided to 
remove from this act, the provisions that we must reinstate in 
this House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whistleblowing provisions have been designed to assist the 
Competition Bureau in investigating violations of the Competition 
Act as it applies to deceptive direct marketing. Those 
individuals who bear witness to violations of the Competition Act 
can bring their concerns directly to the competition commissioner 
with the assurance that their privacy will be protected. 
Furthermore the proposed law would ensure that those who did wish 
to expose practices that hurt our most vulnerable members of 
society would be protected from the reprisal of their employers.

Canadian people toward this House and toward the laws that govern 
our nation.

provisions is offensive in and of itself.  It is an insult to 
democracy that the work of elected members of parliament can be 
undone by individuals who are accountable to nobody.

We will also support the Liberal motion before the House that 
seeks to reinstate the whistleblowing provisions removed by the 
Senate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to support the hon. minister's motion to send Bill C-20 back to 
the Senate with an amendment restoring the substance of the 
whistleblowing provision which the Senate took out of the bill at 
third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first proposed adding the whistleblowing provision to the bill 
at the committee stage on May 26, 1998. I was heartened by the 
support this provision received by my colleagues in the industry 
committee and by the House at third reading.  I was disappointed 
to learn that the passage of Bill C-20 was delayed by the Senate 
because of concerns about this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the whistleblowing provision is to assist 
competition authorities in the investigation of price fixing 
agreements and conspiracies by providing protection to employees 
who come forward to report those crimes.  These crimes undermine 
competition and victimize both consumers and legitimate 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my comments to the industry committee last May, I referred to 
a letter that was sent to the committee by the Public Interest 
Advocacy Centre, an organization which represents over 800 
individual and group members and over 1.5 million Canadians. They 
support this provision by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly support this proposed amendment.  Often the only 
persons who are aware of an offence are employees or others who 
are vulnerable to retribution by the company in question should 
they act in the public interest by advising the competition 
authorities of a violation of the law.  It is essential that such 
persons be protected from retribution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that often the only persons who are aware of an offence 
are the employees who are vulnerable to retribution and it is 
essential that they be protected from retribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the testimony heard by the Senate committee on banking, trade 
and commerce there were concerns about lack of consultation on 
this provision and arguments that the present confidentiality 
provisions and common law informer protections are sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whistleblowing provision will protect the identity of 
persons who come forward with information on how prices in the 
gasoline industry or any industry for that matter are really set. 
The whistleblowing provision will punish employers who take 
retribution action against employees who act in good faith in 
reporting price fixing arrangements and conspiracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whistleblowing provision in this bill signals parliament's 
express encouragement to individuals who have knowledge of 
anti-competitive criminal activities to act in the public 
interest and to come forward with that essential information.  By 
restoring this provision to the bill today, we reiterate that 
encouragement and underline the importance parliament places on 
the free operation of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by the Minister of Industry restores the 
substance of the whistleblowing provision approved by this 
elected chamber last September with changes that address concerns 
raised by the Canadian Bar Association before the Senate banking 
committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the changes clarifies that the whistleblowing protection 
operates only with respect to the criminal sections of the 
Competition Act, not with respect to those subject to civil 
process. The second has the effect of reducing the maximum 
penalty for employers convicted of dismissing or disciplining 
employees for reporting an offence or for refusing to participate 
in an offence under the Competition Act. Instead of the specific 
penalty provisions I have proposed, the Criminal Code penalties 
for contravention of a federal statute will apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes will have the effect of speeding the passage of 
the bill.  I support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill C-20 contains many important provisions in 
addition to the protection for whistleblowers, most notably the 
provisions dealing with deceptive telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public has waited much too long for the passage of 
this bill.  I urge my colleagues from all sides of the House to 
support this motion today without any delay. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was next, after the 
official opposition, to respond to the minister's amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Right, but first we will have questions and 
comments on the remarks made by the hon. member for Ottawa 
Centre. Are there questions or comments? No? Resuming debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning, 
in spite of the fact that we voted against Bill C-20 to amend 
the Competition Act at second and third reading because, in our 
opinion, it weakened rather than toughened the provisions of the 
act, we will be voting in favour of this amendment, which we 
believe deserves the support of each and every one in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate, an unelected body, delayed passage of the bill 
approved by parliament, notwithstanding our opposition, by 
putting forward to the House of Commons an amendment to remove 
from Bill C-20 the protection the Competition Act continues to 
afford employees or any other person who discloses to the 
competition commissioner unfair practices considered illegal. 
Its arguments are based mainly on concerns expressed by the bar 
association, but it has shown that this was an absolutely 
essential provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act is already, we feel, weakened by the bill. 
If employees know or have reasonable grounds to believe that a 
company is engaging in deceptive marketing practices and are 
unable to inform in confidence the body responsible for 
enforcing the Competition Act, they would then be in the 
position of allowing these deceptive marketing practices to 
continue.  They would even be forced to take part in them 
because they could not blow the whistle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an employee gets in touch with the commissioner of 
competition and his employer finds out and can lay him off 
without recourse, who will notify the commissioner of 
competition?  Nobody; no employee will be able to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter which I myself did not read, but which was cited 
when this issue was being studied by the Senate, the Bar said as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers should not be obliged to continue to employ employees 
or entrepreneurs in whom they have lost confidence.  The fact 
that an employee complains to the commissioner can only worsen 
the work climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An employer acting in good faith should be 
able to let an employee go with prior notice or compensation in 
lieu thereof.  This legitimate action by the employer will no 
longer be possible because paragraph 66(2) makes it a criminal 
offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this letter from the bar association proves 
beyond a doubt that employees need protection, because it is 
certain that if an employee contacts the commissioner in good 
faith to disclose his employer's practices, the employer will 
lose confidence in him.  If, as the bar association says, it is 
legitimate for the employee to be dismissed because of this loss 
of confidence,  hon. members will agree with me that no employee 
one will contact the commissioner.  The commissioner will 
therefore not have access to certain information, as it would 
very likely not come from another source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out here that a large number of workers in Canada 
are not unionized.  Being unionized would give them a degree of 
protection.  Not being unionized is a serious problem in such 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that, since the bill allows the 
use of electronic surveillance, it seems to me that consistency 
requires the name of the person who has contacted the 
commissioner in good faith to report anti-competitive practices 
to be kept secret, due to the highly invasive nature of 
wiretapping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of all this is to indicate that we are going to be 
voting in favour of this amendment.  I would, however, be remiss 
if I did not point out once again that, unfortunately,  this 
bill generally weakens the scope of the Competition Act.  I use 
the word “generally” because there is one provision in 
particular that enhances the powers of the commissioner, the one 
relating to fraudulent telemarketing. 
As for telemarketing fraud, it is important to provide some 
protection to its many victims, including elderly people like 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that it was important and even urgent to take this 
measure. There are too many contradictions in this bill, a 
decriminalization that is not obvious and that is replaced with 
a discretionary power in the hands of the commissioner, who may 
not have the necessary budget to be everywhere he should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we regret this weakening, and this is why we voted against 
the bill, even though we support this morning's amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois was not the only one to be really concerned 
about these amendments to the Competition Act. 
Let me quote an emeritus professor from the University of 
Toronto, whose expertise in that field is well recognized. He 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I find a real inconsistency in Bill C-20, since it 
transforms misleading advertising offences into offences that 
require wrongful intent. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill now provides that intent must be present for an 
individual to be accused of misleading advertising.  This was 
not the case before, and is still not the case so long as the 
bill is not passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does, however, for the first time, establish telemarketing 
offences subject to the old system of strict liability offences. 
That makes no sense.  On the one hand, we are told we must 
fight deceptive telemarketing practices by making offenders 
criminally liable. But in other areas, such as misleading 
advertising, considered to be similar, they back off and require 
proof of criminal intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Ziegle goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if the drafters had received two sets of contradictory 
instructions.  This fact alone requires explanation and 
justification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my knowledge, none was provided, and I see no 
reason why we have a set of standards on criminal proceedings in 
the Competition Act and another in other laws such as the Food 
and Drugs Act, the Currency Act, our safety standards 
legislation, and so on. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, this bill must be passed quickly.  We have had our 
say, and we will see whether the future will prove us right. 
We can correct the bill again, but it is important that it be 
adopted, for the provisions on misleading marketing, among 
others, and this is why we support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak on Bill C-20, an act to 
amend the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned by other members, Bill C-20 has returned 
from the Senate with sections 66.1 and 66.2 deleted. These 
sections pertain to whistleblowing and the government has 
proposed new amendments to reinstate these provisions. The only 
significant concession that the government has made, however, is 
withdrawing any reference to criminal sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I give my comments on the amendments to the question I 
would like to reiterate on behalf of the Progressive Conservative 
Party our overall support for this bill.  Our party has always 
understood that the promotion of competitive markets is of 
fundamental importance in today's global and extraordinarily 
competitive economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition stimulates innovation and growth in jobs, provides 
businesses and consumers with competitive prices and product 
choices that they need and increases overall the average standard 
of living in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a modern competition law Canadian businesses will 
encounter anti-competitive barriers to their entry and expansion 
in their markets. They may find in time it is difficult to source 
and input at competitive prices and ultimately they may encounter 
other refrains in their ability to remain competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the Senate has made the correct choice to remove the 
whistleblowing provisions which were not part of the original 
legislation but were added by the House industry committee.  That 
is not to say the intent of legislating whistleblowing provisions 
is wrong.  But as pointed out by organizations, including the 
Canadian Bar Association, sections 66.1 and 66.2 were an undue 
intrusion into the role of the employer with respect to otherwise 
completely lawful behaviours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whistleblowing provisions were introduced by the industry 
committee during its hearings. Consequently they were not part of 
the same public consultation process as the other provisions of 
the bill.  The Canadian Bar Association went further and said 
that section 66.1 would require the commissioner of competition 
to keep confidential the identities of persons who notify the 
commission when they have reasonable grounds to believe that 
another person has committed or intends to commit an offence. 
Section 66.2 would prevent employers who dismiss, suspend, 
demote, discipline, harass or otherwise disadvantage an employee 
or deny an employee a benefit of employment for whistleblowing 
activities, and effectively employers are also prohibited from 
the above employment actions if they believe an employee will 
undertake the above whistleblowing actions. 
I will read one paragraph from the letter by the Canadian Bar 
Association that was sent to the chairman of the Senate committee 
on banking, trade and commerce.  Page 4, paragraph 6 reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers should not be required to continue to deal with 
employees or contractors in whom they have lost confidence.  An 
employee's complaint to the commissioner would generally sour the 
work environment.  An employer acting in good faith should be 
entitled to terminate an employee either with notice or damages 
in lieu of notice.  This legitimate action by an employer would 
not longer be available—.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the Canadian Bar Association added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed whistleblowing provisions conflict with the 1997 report 
by the honourable Charles Dubin, whom the Competition Bureau had 
retained to study the issue.  The Dubin report concluded that 
there was no need to amend the Competition Act to protect 
employee whistleblowers because protection is available through 
existing processes.  The Dubin report also found that the 
whistleblower legislation in other jurisdictions has had little 
or no impact. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are significant problems in both the concepts and the 
drafting of section 66.2.  These problems will create unnecessary 
and difficult situations for employers.  In addition, there are 
issues respecting section 66.1 that should be of concern to the 
commissioner and to the Competition Bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past year the direction of the Competition Bureau, Mr. 
Konrad Von Finckenstein, was asked at both House and Senate 
committees to give the bureau's position on the whistleblowing 
provisions.  His response was: “The amendments were put forward 
not by me and not on our suggestion but by a member of the House. 
I am neutral on it. I see the deterrent value. On the other 
hand, I do not want to create something that is going to cause 
employers a lot of harm or interference with normal employee 
relations or is going to cause a lot of useless work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is hardly a ringing endorsement.  Section 66.1 and section 
66.2 even as modified by the government do not represent 
government policy but rather the initiative of one member of the 
House without in our opinion proper consultation or study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated earlier, Justice Dubin when asked to express his view 
on the desirability of such legislation produced a report which 
concluded that the whistleblowing provisions are not necessary 
because an employee would have rights currently under common law 
and employment status.  This was recently confirmed by the 
Supreme Court of Canada in Wallace v. United Grain Growing 
Limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear. Our party does agree with the intent of 
whistleblowing provisions and to a certain extent in the 
potential of whistleblowing provisions.  This debate should be 
subject to proper consultation and scrutiny and not hastily 
rushed into.  Elected officials sometimes are prone to look for 
quick legislative solutions to otherwise complex public policy 
issues.  We would like to see more consultation and more 
discussion and more rigorous diligence.  In researching this 
there are organizations, including the Canadian Bar Association 
and the head of the Competition Bureau, that have expressed 
significant reservations about the effectiveness of 
whistleblowing provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party will therefore oppose the 
government's amendments to Bill C-20 and support the bill as 
amended by the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those members who criticize the Senate when individuals or 
senators collectively take active roles in amending legislation, 
and at the same time or perhaps days before or days after will 
criticize senators for doing nothing, they should be consistent. 
We want a Senate that is active and participates in these types 
of very important public policy debates. I believe we do. Even 
those members of this House who are opposed to the Senate need to 
recognize that we have a Senate at this time and that the Senate 
contains members who have significant experiences and a depth of 
experience and knowledge of public policy quite exceptional in 
many areas, particularly areas such as the Senate banking 
committee, which I have had the pleasure of working with as a 
member of the House of Commons finance committee.

of the House to respect that institution and to encourage that 
institution and its members to diligently pursue important issues 
of public policy such that we can ensure collectively the House 
and the other place will produce the types of legislation 
Canadians need.  It is extraordinarily important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Senate reform is something individual members of the House 
feel is needed, that is an issue which should be pursued with 
legitimate healthy debate.  As long as we have a Senate and as 
long as we have members in that Senate who are capable, 
intelligent and diligent public servants that work hard on behalf 
of Canadians, not just offering what Canadians want today but 
what Canadians need in terms of public policy in the future, we 
should be encouraging intervention and input from the Senate, not 
discouraging it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard 
my colleague but I cannot help but ask the following questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he tell me what part of the amendment or the motion he 
does not support?  Does he not support the fact that if an 
employee in a company or an organization finds out about 
wrongdoings by an employer he should report it to the Competition 
Bureau?  Or, does the hon. member not support the fact that if 
this employee comes forward with the information we should 
protect the confidentiality of the information?  Or, does he not 
support the fact that if an employer decides to fire an employee 
because that employee reported wrongdoings the employee deserves 
to be protected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What part of the particular motion does he not support?  This is 
exactly what the motion does.  This is exactly what this 
amendment to Bill C-20 does.  I admit we have taken out some of 
the teeth, but the bottom line is that we did that in order to 
respond specifically to the concerns and to aspirations of 
organizations such as the Canadian Bar Association.  In fact its 
concerns have been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleague were told now that the Canadian Bar Association 
supports the motion before the House of Commons, would he be kind 
enough to ask his colleagues to support the motion?  The Canadian 
Bar Association already indicated its support of it.  Therefore a 
big chunk of his concerns should be dealt with in the particular 
position taken by the Canadian Bar Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding anything else and putting partisanship aside, 
would the hon. member, in fairness, having heard what I just 
said, not reconsider his position and support the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
of the hon. member.  Nobody in the House would disagree with the 
intent of the whistleblowing amendments.  The intent is sound, 
but unfortunately there are toxic levels of naiveté in the hon. 
member's arguments.  The enforceability of the whistleblowing 
amendments would potentially create a regulatory nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of the Competition Bureau, Konrad Von Finckenstein, has 
said effectively that he will not provide either support or 
opposition to it.  I will read his response again: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the amendments were put forward not by me and not on our 
suggestion but by ... a member of the House....  I am neutral on 
it ... I see the deterrent value ....  On the other hand, I do not 
want to create something that is going to cause employers a lot 
of harm or interfere with normal employee relations or is going 
to cause me of useless work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I took 
note of the hon. member's speech with regard to Bill C-20.  He 
spoke of proper scrutiny and more consultation.  He spoke of 
wanting a more active Senate.  He spoke of consistency, 
capability, diligence and effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he apply all the things he wishes Bill C-20 had with 
regard to whistleblower protection to the Senate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Absolutely, Mr. Speaker.  I would in 
fact argue that there are members of the Senate who are working 
very hard serving Canadians on an ongoing basis.  We also have 
senators in the Senate banking committee with which I am very 
familiar who have forgotten more on finance and banking issues 
than many members of the House know, even those on the finance 
committee of which I am a member.  We see legislation which the 
House sends to the Senate being improved and made better for 
Canadians by the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I absolutely would like to see the same degree of rigour that 
would apply to this legislation or any other legislation and the 
same level of scrutiny applied to the Senate.  Like any 
organization, there are members of the Senate who are more 
capable and pursue public policy with a greater amount of vigour 
and diligence than others.  There are also members of the House 
who pursue public policy more vigorously than others.  There are 
members of the House who love politics but do not really like 
public policy.  Politics can be the natural enemy of public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I like about members of the Senate is that their focus 
in many cases is exclusively on public policy.  There are members 
of the Senate who have a significant level of experience and 
depth of knowledge in particular areas which is unequalled in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. member may be opposed to the Senate and may want 
to see systemic overhaul of the Senate, and that is a legitimate 
issue for discussion, while we have a Senate we have a duty as 
parliamentarians to work with the senators to develop legislation 
in the best interest of Canadians and not simply to criticize 
senators for purely political partisan reasons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-20.  The government 
introduced the bill to address the issue of direct marketing 
fraud.  The bill is intended to protect consumers as well as 
legitimate direct marketing businesses.  It is a code of conduct 
for the direct marketing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on two items in particular.  The Senate 
has recently returned the bill deleting sections 66.1 and 66.2 
which deal exclusively with the issue of whistleblowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of whistleblowing I think the country needs more 
whistleblowers.  We need people who expose the abuses of 
government. 
We need people to stand up when wrongs have been committed.  As a 
result that is why I support whistleblowers.  I not only want to 
see whistleblowers protected with regard to Bill C-20 in the 
direct marketing industry.  I want to see other whistleblowers as 
well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see some whistleblowers in the other chamber. 
Right now they are beholden to the Prime Minister; they are 
appointed by the Prime Minister.  I want to see effective 
whistleblowers who can blow the whistle on problems with the 
federal government and not fear that they hold some allegiance to 
the Prime Minister for their appointments.  I want whistleblowers 
who are accountable to the people who elect them rather than to 
the Prime Minister who appointed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries have effective whistleblowers. Germany with its 
Bundesrat has effective whistleblowers. They gather people who 
are representatives of the various Landers or states in Germany. 
They get together to determine whether or not bills that have 
been passed in the Bundestag are effective.  They whistleblow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if people who represent the state or the Lander 
of Baden-Wurttemburg or Berlin, or any of them, decide that they 
do not like a particular piece of legislation, that it goes 
against the interest of their particular state or their 
particular Lander, they will whistleblow.  They will go ahead and 
blow their whistle and expose the federal document or whatever 
was passed by the Bundestag for being ineffective or for not 
dealing properly or not dealing fairly with their particular 
grievance, with their particular state or their Lander. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Germany is not the only country that has effective 
whistleblowers.  The United States also has whistleblowers.  That 
country to the south with which we do 80% of our trade has 
whistleblowers.  It changed its laws so that it would be able to 
elect its whistleblowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first state that actually did that via a constitutional 
amendment, the 17th amendment to the U.S. constitution, was 
Oregon.  Now effective whistleblowers are recognized within the 
constitution of the United States, those people in its senate. 
Those who come from the state of Idaho can have the same 
representation as those that have a more populous representation 
in the House of Representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>California represents more people than all the inhabitants of 
Canada and has two senators.  Idaho and Wyoming, small states in 
comparison, have two whistleblowers as well.  The whistleblowers 
in Idaho may blow their whistle about potatoes or injustices that 
have happened with regard to agricultural policy in the same way 
that whistleblowers in the state of California may blow their 
whistles with regard to whatever may be troubling California in 
its state of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to see whistleblower protection.  I have faith in 
whistleblowers.  They are important to the system.  We need to 
know what the problems are and have fair criticism.  I want to 
see fair criticism and not rubber stamps of government 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now in the other place we have a clear majority of people 
who were appointed by the Prime Minister for his party, the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  We would like to see whistleblowers 
elected by the people from the various provinces who fairly 
represent the regions in the provinces.  That is what we are 
talking about: real whistleblowers, not rubber stamps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whistleblower protections proposed in Bill C-20 are opposed 
by the Canadian Bar Association and opposed by the Senate.  For 
Canadians who may be watching—

provinces on the social union, I awoke this morning to learn that 
the unemployment rate in Canada had fallen to 7.8%, the lowest 
rate in almost nine years.  This means that in January 87,000 
more Canadians, including 44,000 young people, had a job to go to 
each day, jobs that they did not have in December.  Bravo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time I have been concerned that as our economy went 
through a period impacted by technological change unemployment 
had become structural.  By smashing through and below the 8% 
unemployment barrier, our government has proven that its policies 
of sound fiscal management and progressive job creation 
initiatives are working.  This bodes well for the country as this 
government will continue to offer all Canadians the strong and

opportunity to sign a truly historic document that was all 
inclusive. Instead, because of his inflexibility, we have yet 
another agreement that does not have Quebec's signature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister please explain to Canadians why it was 
more important to him to prevent provinces from opting out than 
to allow Quebec to opt in? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is most unfortunate that 
the hon. member does not join with the vast majority of Canadians 
in celebrating the important agreement that was entered into 
yesterday by nine provinces, two territories and the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member looks at that agreement, if the hon. member 
listens to the premiers of this country, what she will understand 
is that it is a historic moment in terms of the degree of 
collaboration and partnership that will exist in this country as 
we move forward as governments working together to deliver good 
social policy for all Canadians regardless of where they live. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

that if it was not for her government, the provinces would slash 
spending in education, health care and social services. In 
reality, over the past five years the only government that has 
significantly reduced spending in these areas has been this 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister give Canadians one example of a province that 
has cut more funding in health care than this federal government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I simply reiterate for the 
hon. member that yesterday was a historic occasion in which all 
governments, nine provincial governments, two territorial

ensure adequate, affordable, stable and predictable funding for 
social programs in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this government learn that it is not the federal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what I said and what is quite clear to the case is that we are 
now in a position to invest significantly more money through the 
budget over the coming years for health care.  The provinces, 
including Quebec, have agreed to use that additional money for 
health care.  The provinces have reaffirmed the principles of the 
Canada Health Act.  By using that additional money and that 
common resolve to deal with the urgent present problems and plan 
for the future of sustainable medicare, Canadians will indeed see 
a return to access to quality care in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

Canadians currently on waiting lists in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 the Prime Minister has gutted social spending by 
$2,200 per family.  Yesterday after fighting tooth and nail with 
the provinces he agreed to grudgingly give back $267 per family. 
Let us get this straight.  He cuts $2,200 per family and now he 
is giving back only $267 per family?  Where is the rest of the 
money?  Did it all end up in some golf course in Shawinigan? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the bottom line for this government and for governments 
throughout the country is access to quality health care for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that made yesterday a historic day is that we 
had every government in the country, all 13, saying that they are 
committed to the principles of our health care system, that they 
will use additional money provided through our budget to improve 
it.  Health ministers know where the priorities are:  to solve 
the present urgent problems and to make sure we plan for a 
medicare that is sustainable for the 21st century.

<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

Speaker, it is entirely legal for the Government of Canada to 
spend money for the benefit of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in the history of this federation, and 
probably of most federations, a federal government is committed 
to consulting the provincial governments significantly before 
acting, to give them prior notice and to listen to their point 
of view, so that it will be possible to work jointly to the 
benefit of Canadians.  That is modern federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is not modern federalism, is pulling back and saying “What 
we want is to opt out tomorrow and separate the next day”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, among the 
sticking points between Quebec and the signatories is the matter 
of interprovincial mobility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the area of education, Canadians studying in 
Quebec universities pay higher tuition fees than students from 
Quebec.  This policy is criticized outside Quebec, even though 
Canadian students in fact pay lower tuition fees in Quebec than 
they would in their own province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that, in the future, the federal government 
will attack Quebec's policy of differential tuition fees on the 
basis of this agreement?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member has not read the agreement, of course, 
because it provides that, in the case of potential negative 
effects of interprovincial barriers, a reasonability test will 
be given.  If the barrier is reasonable, there will be no reason 
to eliminate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add one thing on the federal spending power.  The 
province benefiting most from that spending power is Quebec. 
First, it receives nearly half the amount of all equalization 
payments.  Second, with the Canada social transfer, Quebeckers 
currently receive more support than other Canadians for their 
universities, hospitals and social programs, because the 
Government of Canada is there—

notwithstanding the pros and cons of the social union, it is 
clear that we still have a very serious social problem in this

man who died on a heat grate within view of the Ontario 
legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Finance, when will there be a serious 
national response to the recommendations made by the task force 
in Toronto on homelessness?  When will the federal government 
assume its responsibilities in this matter along with other 
governments to make sure that the scourge, the embarrassment, the 
shame of homelessness is once and for all dealt with in this 
country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

problem and all levels of government have to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We participated in the Golden task force and we put in $300,000. 
CMHC also participated with the research branch. In December I

<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is not all that complex.  Social housing has been 
gutted in the country.  Welfare assistance is not what it used to 
be.  There was a time in this country when people were not 
homeless because they had enough money not to be homeless and 
they were not being kicked out of psychiatric institutions in the 
name of deinstitutionalization, which is another form of cost 
cutting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government bring all levels of government 
together?  Let us have the equivalent of the effort that was put 
into the social union to return this country to the kind of 
country it used to be, a country where we do not have thousands 
and thousands of homeless Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

together and an example of this is the Golden task force.  There 
is another conference in March in Toronto.  CMHC is organizing a 
working group across the country.  We hope that all levels of 
government come to a solution to this very serious problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
scandal over employment insurance quotas, the Minister of Human

fraud must be dealt with, but there is a big difference between 
that and forcing the responsible employees to enforce an already 
restrictive law by setting targets for the number of cuts they 
must attain.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

the reputation of the unemployed in the difficult situation we

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no quotas.  I have stated this in the House on a

my question is for the Minister of Transport.  I wonder if he is

have been in the habit of running, which are 5,000 to 6,000 feet, 
we now have trains which are 153 to 160 cars in length. There is 
a great concern arising among the people who work on the trains 
and in communities across the country about these trains not 
being able to clear crossings in the time that trains used to 
clear crossings.

Code concerning the criminal liability of corporations, directors 
and officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to establish in certain circumstances 
the criminal liability of corporations for criminal acts or 
omissions carried out by their officers or staff.  This would 
arise if the corporation management knew or should have known of 
the act, or omission, or condoned or was wilfully blind to it. It 
is not necessary for the act or the omission to be committed by 
the same person who authorized it or tolerated it.

<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to 
reiterate for the folks back home because of the interlude for 
members' statements and question period, what we are talking 
about today is Bill C-20.  It has to do with direct marketing. 
More than that, we have had the Senate and the Canadian Bar 
Association, along with some other characters, say that there 
should not be whisteblowing.  Because they do not approve of the 
whistleblowing provisions they have tried to strike clauses 66.1 
and 66.2 of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to move beyond the fact that just because it is being 
advocated by the Canadian Bar Association and the Senate we have 
to be somewhat suspect about these things.  Whenever we have 
those types of groups getting together to say that we should not 
have protection of public interest with regard to whistleblowing 
we have to watch out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People talk about combating crime.  They say they want to see 
protection.  They say they want to see the victims of crooked 
manoeuvres looked after.  They also believe the House should 
listen.  As a matter of fact, all of those four statements came 
from the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at some of those issues when it comes to the 
idea of whistleblowing and that other place called the Senate.  I 
want to see protections too, just like Michael O'Connor, a lad 
who lives here in Ottawa.  He started up a group called Taxpayers 
Have Had Enough.  He wants protections for the average Canadian 
taxpayer to make sure that the Senate is living up to its duty 
and responsibility and that it is being accountable to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael O'Connor, just like everybody else in this country, 
contributes to the salaries of our people in the Senate.  When he 
learned that Andy Thompson was only spending one day in the 
spring and one day in the fall in the Senate, for a total of two 
days every year, collecting a yearly salary of $64,000 plus 
$10,000 in expenses, Michael O'Connor was upset.  He is a part 
time health care worker in the Ottawa area.  He actually took 
time from his summer vacation to go to the Senate Chamber to 
research what the attendance records were.  It broke his heart to 
learn that when the Senate only sits 68 days of the year somebody 
can attend only two of those 68 days and still qualify for their 
full salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the protection there?  We need whistleblowers and we 
did not have effective whisteblowing on the Senate side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Minister of Industry, in speaking to Bill C-20, said 
that the House is listening, and so the House should listen.  A 
few years from now when the Prime Minister decrees an election, 
the writ will be dropped and I and all other members of this 
place will go back home to talk to our constituents.  We will 
tell them what we represent, what mandate we want to carry 
forward in the election and, if we form the government, what we 
will undertake to do. 
Therefore the House does listen.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in that other place, the Senate, there are people who have 
been appointed there for decades. There is no measure to ensure 
that they have to listen to anybody.  There are those in the 
Senate who are diligent and do a decent job, indeed there are. 
But the problem is they are tainted by all those others who do 
not do due diligence and do not do their job, the Andy Thompsons 
of this world who are absent to the point of disrepute, of 
bringing dishonour not only upon that institution but ours as 
well.  The whole parliament suffers as a result of those types of 
truancies and problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we call upon the Prime Minister to recognize the 
results of Senate elections, not only in the province of Alberta 
but other places that have enacted legislation similar to 
Alberta, such as British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the Prime Minister to act upon the promises he made in 
his 1990 Liberal leadership race.  At that time he said it was 
possible to hold Senate elections and so he should.  Had he held 
Senate elections and recognized Senate elections since he became 
Prime Minister, a vast chunk of the people who sit in the Senate 
today would be elected and accountable senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we want to see.  We want to see Liberals who hold 
dear their promises, and prime ministers who stand by their 
words.  That is what we want to see.  We want to see taxpayers 
who have not been burnt like Michael O'Connor and his group. 
Taxpayers have had enough. They want to see effective 
whistleblowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Bill C-20, the Reform industry critic talked 
about victims of deception.  He talked about advertising and 
pricing. He talked about competition.  He talked about contempt 
in individuals unaccountable to anyone.  Let us talk about 
victims of deception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now an election is going on in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
The premier goes around bellyaching that the federal government 
does not listen, and he was part of the cabinet of that 
government.  He was part and parcel of a party that promised that 
it was going to make changes to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens all too often?  The concerns of those provinces, of 
those hinterlands fall on deaf ears.  If that man who is running 
for premier in that province now, if Brian Tobin recognized 
Senate elections, held Senate elections in the province of 
Newfoundland, he would not have the prospect right after that 
election—and I will make a prediction for February 9 when that 
election has come and past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are five vacancies that I know of in the Senate, three for 
Quebec, one for Newfoundland and another for Ontario.  If Brian 
Tobin had held an election concurrent with the provincial 
election for members of the House of Assembly in the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, Newfoundland on February 9 would have 
somebody who represented the interests of Newfoundland and not 
just those of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure both you, Mr. Speaker, and the member who is

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
we are talking about accountability.  Today we are talking about 
people who have been victims of deception, the citizens and the 
taxpayers of this country and particularly those people in the 
province of Newfoundland who are going to the polls on February 
9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A previous premier of that province, Clyde Wells, recognized 
that a Senate election would allow for people to stand and 
represent the interests of Newfoundland and Labrador in the 
Senate and not be beholden to the Prime Minister and not be 
appointed by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strong voice for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador is 
needed in the Senate.  They need somebody who is going to point 
out the problems with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans not 
giving them the straight goods. They need somebody who is going 
to say that the federal mismanagement of the fisheries has been a 
travesty and has resulted in the elimination and the wipeout of 
the cod stocks and the groundfish in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
They need somebody who is going to say that provincial rights 
should be paramount with regard to the fishery and that the 
province should have a say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not need more bellyaching from a premier who has not 
been able to demonstrate much or come through with much, despite 
the fact that he sat in the federal cabinet, despite the fact 
that he is a good buddy and chum of the Prime Minister.  They 
need somebody who is going to be accountable to the people of 
Newfoundland and not the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are talking about regarding victims of deception 
with regard to the Senate, with regard to Bill C-20, with regard 
to whistleblowing.  They need somebody who is going to be an 
effective whistleblower for the people of Newfoundland, not just 
a bellyacher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have also heard people talk about advertising and 
pricing.  Recently we have heard the Senate go on about how the 
senators want to have cameras in their committees because people 
are not seeing them do their work.  No surprise as they only sit 
68 days of the year.  It is pretty tough to see them when they 
are only there 68 days.  And some of them only sit for two days 
of the year.  It is pretty tough to notice somebody if they are 
only there two out of 365 days a year. It is pretty tough to 
notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good idea to bring cameras into the Senate 
committees and advertise their proceedings so people can see what 
goes on in that chamber. In terms of pricing it is going to cost 
a few million dollars. The Senate would love it for those 
committees that operate.  They would love to get their mugs on TV 
and try to justify their $64,000 a year salaries.  That is what I 
say to advertising and pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard people talk today about competition.  I am a 
big fan of competition as are a lot of people in the country. 
They want to see public choice.  That is why they want to get rid 
of the system of appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People want to move toward elections because with elections 
there is competition.  Candidate X, candidate Y and candidate Z 
can say what they want to do for the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador, what type of things they want to institute, what 
policies they want to change, what status quos they want to 
overthrow.  That is the type of thing we want to see from a 
Senate election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of thing we had in Alberta in 1998 when we held 
the second and third Senate elections in Canadian history.  We 
did it once before when Stan Waters was elected to the Senate. 
There will be others, mark my words, because it has come time for 
change in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard people talk about contempt today.  Indeed there is 
great contempt in the land for politicians in general, but no 
more contempt is there than that for the Senate.  That is why we 
have politicians in this place—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I know the hon. member has had 
more than his fair share of interruptions but I think it only 
just to point out to him Standing Order 18 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No Member shall speak disrespectfully of the Sovereign, nor of 
any of the Royal Family, nor of the Governor General or the 
person administering the Government of Canada; nor use offensive 
words against either House— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member will want to be very judicious in 
his choice of words when he is discussing the other place.  We do 
have freedom of speech in this House and he is entitled to say 
what he wants, subject to the standing orders.  The standing 
orders are quite explicit in what he can say about the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite him to watch his language and try to ensure that 
he complies with the standing orders in every respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad that you have 
raised this whole issue of offence because there are people who 
are offended.  They are taxpayers and they are citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about offence and we talk about contempt.  There is so 
much offence and so much contempt in this land that there are 
those in this very chamber, in our House of Commons, who are 
advocating for the abolition of the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not advocate for the abolition of the other place. I 
recognize that there are things part and parcel of this House of 
Commons that are present today that are in a sense a sickness and 
a disease upon our body politic in this country because we do not 
have an effective other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason there is contempt, the reason there is offence, the 
reason there are cries for abolition of the Senate— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Even from Liberal members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  That is right, Mr. Speaker, even from 
Liberal members, those who benefit wholesale from having the 
appointment process right now, those who hope to be able to wind 
up in the favoured books of the Prime Minister and to sit in the 
other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason there is such contempt, the reason there are such 
calls for abolition is that we do not have accountability. 
Individuals are not accountable to the people who elect them. 
They are not accountable to the regional interests as was set out 
in 1867.  They are not accountable to the interests of the 
provinces.  These are serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People talked today about Bill C-20.  The Bloc Quebecois 
industry critic talked about public interest advocacy and 
weakening competition.  I share the member's concerns with regard 
to these two issues.  I believe that having a change in the 
Senate will advance this idea of strengthened competition and 
will advance public interest advocacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators have a difficult time speaking on behalf of the public 
and advocating on behalf of the public interest when they do not 
represent or have not been elected by the public.  When they are 
appointed by the Prime Minister, the process by which they are 
appointed, that very deed itself taints what they otherwise would 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I heard the Tory industry critic talk about Bill C-20.  He 
said that the intent of whistleblowing legislation is good. 
Beyond just intents the member also talked about proper scrutiny, 
more consultation and wanting to have an active Senate.  Nobody 
more than I would like to see an active Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate sits 68 days a year.  I would like to see the 
senators do more scrutiny but in order to do that, I need them to 
attend. When there are people who attend only two days of the 
year and senators who only show up for 10% of their meetings, I 
raise these concerns because I want to see an active Senate.  I 
want to see an effective Senate.  I would like to have all of the 
people in the other place in attendance every single one of those 
68 days of the year.  I would like to see them there more than 
that but if we could at least see them all there for the days 
they are required to show as it stands right now, I would feel we 
had a more active and effective Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in consistency.  My Tory colleague talked about 
consistency in the law.  I want to see consistency.  I remember 
the Liberal campaign promises in 1968.  They were before my time 
but I read about them.  Pierre Elliot Trudeau campaigned across 
the land that he wanted to see changes to the Senate, but in 1968 
the election came and went and we did not see changes to the 
Senate. 
The Liberal leadership in 1990 promised to see changes in the 
Senate.  We did not see them then.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to see consistency as much as anybody.  So for all these 
reasons I agree with my colleagues.  I want to see more scrutiny. 
I want to see more accountability.  I want to see a better 
whistleblowing institution.  The Senate must be reformed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Calgary West spoke at great length about the Senate 
and very little about Bill C-20.  I guess there is obviously a 
relationship because the amendments made to Bill C-20 came from 
the Senate and some people would find that objectionable, that an 
unelected body would have any legislative power or ability to 
influence bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question gets back to Reform's idea about the elected Senate 
and the need for Senate reform.  I have often found it a sort of 
an irony when many of us worked so hard to get the Charlottetown 
accord put through, the constitutional amendments, which actually 
would have given what the Reform Party has been asking for, 
elected senators, Senate reform along the lines the hon. member 
seems to feel are necessary.  Our party, as the hon. member 
suggested, believes the Senate should be abolished, not reformed 
to be elected.  He is accurate in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in hearing the hon. member's views about 
how the Reform Party justified working so hard to sink the 
Charlottetown accord, the constitutional amendments, when it is 
actually the position of the Reform Party that it wants the 
elected Senate which it would have had if the Charlottetown 
accord had gone through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct 
something the member said, that the Reform Party quashed the 
Charlottetown accord.  It was not the Reform Party.  We were 
merely the vessel for people who had concerns across this land 
with regard to Charlottetown and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were people across this land who got out to the polls in 
that October.  I remember it well.  I remember there were people 
in provinces right across this land, including Quebec, who voted 
against Charlottetown.  It was the people of Canada, the people 
of the respective provinces of Canada, who got out to the polls 
in October 1992 and rejected Charlottetown because they rejected 
the process.  That was the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party served as a vessel for those people who saw 
problems with the quotas inherent in Charlottetown and who saw 
problems with the special deals that were part and parcel of 
Charlottetown.  It was the people of this country from coast to 
coast to coast who rejected Charlottetown, not just the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank goodness the Reform Party was there to serve as a conduit 
for all those who saw the problems, the fallacies and the 
inherent contradictions in Charlottetown.  If the Reform Party 
had not been there I do not think we would have had a public 
referendum.  I think Brian Mulroney would have gone ahead and 
simply imposed that law without having consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I stand in my place today is as a youngster 
of 10 years old in grade five I remember well the patriation of 
the constitution in 1982.  My father and I and many others had 
problems with the idea that the charter of rights and freedoms 
was based on collective group rights rather than the rights of 
the individual.  As a result of that I understood at that tender 
age that it was important to be active in politics because my 
father and many others like him, the people of this country, 
never had a chance to vote on the patriation of the constitution 
and the structuring of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, 10 years later, we did have a vote and I am going to 
argue that were it not for the Reform Party the people of this 
country would never have been able to cast a ballot and make 
their own decisions for their own constitution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is really refreshing and enlightening to see a young 
member of parliament get up and give us some real history. 
It is a credit to the Reform Party and the first reformers who 
came here that honesty and truth were number one in our party 
policies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member for Calgary West what really 
is the problem that when taxpayers or voters tell the House what 
they want it does not get accomplished.  The member mentioned the 
Premier of Newfoundland that he has realized all of a sudden that 
to deal with the federal government is not a simple as he thought 
before.  We have seen it through history time and time again. 
One very prominent Liberal recently told me that in two national 
Liberal conventions they passed a motion that would promote a 
triple-E Senate.  The Liberal conventions have recognized that 
there should be a change in that other place but it has not 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member tell me what kind of vehicle do we need to 
get the wishes of taxpayers and voters accomplished in the House 
instead of being ignored? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, time and time again people 
in this country raise a cry for changes.  They raise a cry for 
changes to the Young Offenders Act and they raise a cry for 
changes to the Senate.  We look at polls across the country for 
the last several decades there have been cries for a return to 
capital punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at all these issues.  Yet even though there have been 
free votes in the House of Commons on these issues, the will of 
the people has not been reflected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a profound problem with our democracy when the will of 
the people, the will of the clear majority in this land, cannot 
bring forward law and have it enacted.  There is a profound 
sickness and problem with what we have as an institution. That is 
why we need to see more free votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about real free votes. That means we do not have 
the government whips and the Prime Minister's office come down on 
the backs of the backbenchers in the governing party, the Liberal 
Party of today, and tell them that the government will fall 
because of having a free vote, because they cast their ballot, 
they vote nay or yea as their constituents would want them to 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is important that we bring forward a formal vote 
of non-confidence. That way if a money bill or any other bill 
falls, the government does not fall. There would have to be a 
formal vote of non-confidence in order for the government to 
fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would free up backbenchers not only on the government side 
but in every party to vote the wishes of their constituents. That 
little change would help advance democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one would be for us to have initiative so that 
taxpayers, citizens, constituents could go ahead with a petition 
and sign up their neighbours door to door. With that process they 
would be able to put on the ballot in the next election, to save 
taxpayer money because people have brought up the costs of 
democracy, a question of whether they want to see a return to 
capital punishment, whether they want to see an elected Senate, 
whether they want to see substantive changes to the Young 
Offenders Act or the faint hope clause, section 745. On all these 
types of things there has been vast public outcry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With more free votes, with a formal vote of non-confidence, with 
recall legislation to get rid of a member of parliament who does 
not represent their will, with initiative all these things can be 
accomplished.  We need also to reform the Senate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
were talking about Bill C-20, although that seems like a long 
time ago after what we have just been through. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20, in a nutshell, is about two things that we need to 
deal with today.  The whistleblowing aspect for telemarketing 
fraud is first and foremost.  Second is an issue we have not 
heard talked about much today, the prenotification of mergers 
process, the attempts to strengthen and simplify this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I raise this is that it is a matter of record.  The 
NDP did not vote in favour of Bill C-20 when it came up last 
spring and that was our reservation about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applauded the effort to clean up telemarketing fraud and 
to implement whistleblower protection for employees.  That 
certainly is in keeping with our policy.  We are very pleased to 
see any reference to whistleblowing raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not vote in favour of Bill C-20 due to this other 
aspect, the prenotification of mergers process with which we 
simply were not comfortable.  The reason we are dealing with Bill 
C-20 today is that it went through third reading.  It went to the 
Senate and came back to us with amendments, the key amendment 
being the elimination of any reference to whistleblowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great disappointment to us.  We are very much of the 
mind that it is time to recognize whistleblowing protection in 
our public service and in the private sector.  We believe good 
managers would welcome whistleblowing because it helps to alert 
them to wrongdoing of any sort throughout the enterprise over 
which they might have jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in the public sector our managers could use an 
improved level of whistleblowing to alter them to, for instance, 
the misuse of funds within their own government agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whistleblowing is an issue we have been hearing a great deal 
about in labour circles.  The trade union movement has recognized 
for a great deal of time the need for whistleblowing protection 
because actually in common law the obligation of loyalty to the 
employer is paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an employee blows the whistle on some sort of wrongdoing and 
causes some inconvenience for the employer, discipline is 
actually justified in that case, especially if the employee is 
mistaken, even if they turned in the circumstances without any 
malice and with the best of intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the employee was wrong without any saving clauses in 
legislation to back them up, they could be disciplined and even 
discharged from their workplace for pointing out these 
wrongdoings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whistleblowing is key and paramount to backing up workers and 
helping them feel comfortable with alerting the public or their 
employer about wrongdoing of any kind.  Telemarketing fraud, we 
heard today, a $100 million a year problem, lends itself to this 
kind of manipulation of employees or intimidation or coercion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are often poorly paid employees working in a call centre 
of some type.  If the employer is an employer who would willingly 
undertake fraudulent enterprises or criminal activity, chances 
are pretty good they are not a very good employer either. They 
are the type of employer who would intimidate, coerce, harass the 
employees for blowing the whistle on them or for even threatening 
to or for even revealing to the public the true nature of the 
fraudulent enterprise that is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we need to do everything we can to clean up the 
telemarketing industry.  I think it is actually rife with fraud. 
Frankly, the direct marketing people welcome any legislation that 
would help improve the image of that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a lower form of animal than the 
telemarketing fraud practitioner who would take advantage of 
often seniors or shut-ins or people who are vulnerable and 
incapable of making good judgment about the products they have 
been asked to purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a personal experience with this.  An elderly relative of 
mine was in her late nineties when she started being harassed by 
unscrupulous telemarketing companies which by the way seem to 
share lists. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once one gets its hooks into a senior citizen, the others seem 
to come in like vultures.  It seems a whole series of sales 
people have started to harass this elderly relative of mine and 
have taken her for most of her life savings.  For instance, 
absolutely fraudulent work has been done to her home.  One 
salesman told her on the phone that her chimney looked like it 
was pulling away from her house.  Being in her late nineties she 
was not able to go outside to see whether or not it was true. 
They sold her a $5,000 fix-it job to reattach the chimney to her 
house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being in the building trades, when I went to visit her next and 
learned of this I went outside to look at the chimney and found 
that it had never been leaning away from the house and had never 
been fixed.  It is absolute, blatant fraud.  They realized that 
they had a live one on the wire because she was a single woman in 
her late nineties living alone and with only home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to do everything in our power to try to 
stop that kind of activity.  I compliment aspects of Bill C-20 if 
there is anything we can do to limit this type of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said this was the lowest form of animal in my mind, the person 
who would deliberately defraud vulnerable people or shut-ins. 
Frankly I have more respect for somebody who would mug than 
somebody who would cheat in this fashion.  I have more admiration 
for somebody who sticks someone up and steals a wallet.  At least 
they can see it coming; the person is being forthright about it. 
However this kind of stealth is a reprehensible problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would stop more of these people if we had this whistleblower 
protection and employees who have been engaged, and often against 
their will, in sucking these people would feel comfortable in 
blowing the whistle.  If there were some wrongdoing going on we 
would be able to stop more of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a coincidence that today I plan on handing down to the 
journals branch my own whistleblowing legislation in the form of 
a private member's bill.  It is very thorough and comprehensive. 
It deals with the Public Service Staff Relations Act.  I am 
hoping that other members of parliament will see fit to support 
it.  As I say, good managers welcome whistleblowing because it 
points to all kinds of opportunities for savings or efficiencies 
within the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20, as we expect, will go through.  The NDP is pleased to 
say that we can support the motion made by the Minister of 
Industry today.  I listened to the minister's remarks and I found 
that I could associate myself with them quite easily.  It is 
quite honourable that we are trying to do something about the 
fraud that exists in that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest issues is the reporting of price fixing. This 
is one aspect the minister pointed out.  We believe the Direct 
Marketing Association, as I mentioned, is eager to have the 
reputation of its industry improved, and it will be done through 
this regulation.  I should point out that it is not a 
heavy-handed regulation.  It is not interference in the free 
market by any stretch of the imagination.  This is regulation for 
consumer protection and for the well-being of this rapidly 
growing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the NDP will be voting in favour of the 
motion.  I am also pleased that there will at least be some

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 3 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-63, an act respecting Canadian citizenship, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Wentworth—Burlington.  I 
take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration for proposing a much needed update of 
the Citizenship of Canada Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has put forward a series of initiatives to update 
citizenship and immigration legislation and procedures.  These 
efforts represent a very welcome change in some Canadian 
institutions that will play a key role in our country's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our existing citizenship act was well suited to the time when it 
was last revised in 1977.  However, with all the changes we have 
seen over the past couple of decades and with the wide array of 
interpretations the term resident has been subjected to, it is 
time to revise our legislation to reflect today's social, 
political and economic realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that we include changes to strengthen the 
value of Canadian citizenship.  As an immigrant to Canada I have 
a keen sense of this great value as do my family and millions of 
other Canadians who are grateful for the chance they have been 
given to become citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act is a step in the right direction for all of us since 
it helps to promote the great value of Canadian citizenship. That 
is important for those of us who already possess this valuable 
asset.  It is just as important for those who want to become 
Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know we owe a lot of our global prominence to new 
Canadians, their hard work and their contacts.  An increasingly 
global outlook is one of the keys to Canada's future as are new 
Canadians and their initiatives and the new Citizenship of Canada 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reflect with my fellow members of parliament on the 
history of Canadian citizenship, which is about people coming 
from all corners of the planet to build a country characterized 
by tolerance, generosity and compassion, a country that 
represents a beacon of hope in an often troubled world torn by 
strife, wars and intolerance.  Citizenship is about people and 
nation building.  Its evolution represents the very essence of 
our collective identity as a people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nation as a concept relies in large measure on citizenship and 
the evolution of citizenship represents the very essence of our 
collective identity as a people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of us will remember, the creation of Canadian 
citizenship was an initiative of Paul Martin Senior who served at 
the time as Canadian secretary of state.  At the end of World War 
II, as Mr. Martin walked among the graves of soldiers in Dieppe, 
France, he recognized the names of several soldiers from his 
hometown.  He was struck by the fact that despite the different 
ethnic origins of their names they were all Canadians.  He 
decided it was high time to work toward recognition for Canadian 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Citizenship Act of 1947 marked the beginning of a new era in 
our history.  To emphasize its importance Prime Minister 
Mackenzie King was the recipient of the first certificate of 
Canadian citizenship.  After World War II Canada experienced an 
unprecedented increase in its population.  As the population of 
our country grew and changed and our Canadian identity gained in 
stature worldwide, the concept of citizenship evolved leading 
parliament to review the original Canadian Citizenship Act.  A 
revised act came into effect in 1977.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 21 years have passed since the last major amendments 
were made.  Over that time Canada has changed.  The world has 
changed.  It is important and necessary for our legislation to 
reflect those changes and strengthen the value of Canadian 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the features of the new act that contribute to 
strengthening the value of our citizenship.  New criteria for 
attribution of citizenship are certainly a big step in that 
direction.  By proposing clearly defined precise requirements we 
can now rely on a more effective decision making process.  These 
criteria guarantee that new Canadian citizens will be deeply 
committed to our country and its values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of children born to Canadian parents who no longer 
reside in this country, the transitional citizenship is limited 
to the second generation.  This means that the second generation 
of Canadians born abroad will obtain citizenship at birth but 
lose it at the age of 28 unless they live in Canada before that 
time.  The residency requirement is three years of physical 
presence within a five year period.  Successive generations of 
Canadians born abroad cannot obtain Canadian citizenships unless 
they meet the same requirements as any other participant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new requirements have been established because we strongly 
believe that to preserve the value of Canadian citizenship we 
must ensure that all people who are Canadian citizens develop and 
maintain real links with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also with this in mind that we have introduced important 
changes in the requirements for permanent residence.  Under the 
new act applicants for Canadian citizenship have to prove that 
they have spent three years out of five years in the country. 
This requirement is a good way to ensure applicants are well 
acquainted with Canadian society, our lifestyle and our values. 
By meeting the requirements these future Canadians will 
demonstrate their commitment to participate fully in the life of 
our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, as the minister pointed out, the new act also 
introduces a more flexible framework for application of these 
conditions by giving them five years instead of four to go 
through this requirement.  Furthermore, applicants will be 
expected to have sufficient knowledge of one of the country's two 
official languages.  They will have to be familiar with values of 
Canadian society and demonstrate that familiarity without the 
help of an interpreter.  With these well defined criteria the 
decision making process will be simple, clear and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently over 90% of citizenship applications are 
straightforward.  Each application must nonetheless be approved 
by a citizenship judge.  This process is long and costly.  With 
the new act decisions will be based on criteria already set out 
in law and will therefore be more expeditious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way to strengthen the value of Canadian citizenship is 
to promote it actively.  With a more effective decision making 
process in place our citizenship judges will now be called 
citizenship commissioners and will have more time to promote the 
values symbolized by citizenship across the country.  Not only 
will they continue to be ambassadors of citizenship within the 
context of citizenship ceremonies, but they will extend that role 
to other community events in order to reach more people and make 
Canadian citizens more aware of the responsibilities and 
advantages of being Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment criteria for citizenship commissioners are 
defined in the new act.  We believe they will foster consistency 
and ensure the commissioners are outstanding citizens with solid 
track records.  Our new commissioners will be Canadians who have 
been publicly recognized for their important contribution to 
civic life and have demonstrated their attachment to the values 
embodied in Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act also includes measures to enhance the protection of 
Canadian citizenship.  The vast majority of applicants for 
citizenship are law-abiding individuals who contribute greatly to 
our country, to daily life and to the growth of Canada.  In the 
pursuit of our objective to be properly prepared to face the 
occasional difficulty we have added new measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed act sets out a new prohibition.  This includes the 
power to refuse citizenship in the public interest.  The proposed 
act also gives the minister new authority to cancel citizenship 
in cases where it was obtained by using a false identity while 
the individual was not entitled to citizenship due to a criminal 
offence.  It has more severe sanctions for offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister mentioned, we are also proposing to revise our 
oath of citizenship.  Like the other modifications we are 
suggesting that this proposal evolve from extensive 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians say they want our oath to reflect our contemporary 
values.  They also want clearer references to loyalty to Canada. 
Our existing oath has not been updated since it was first 
introduced over a half century ago.  The oath clearly states our 
allegiance to Canada and its values as well as our allegiance to 
the head of state.  The words express a strong commitment to 
these values. 
I would also like to remind all my colleagues that the 
citizenship act is the result of extensive efforts initiated by 
the minister to respond to Canadians and their concerns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is the result of a lengthy consultation to modernize one 
of our most valuable assets, our Canadian citizenship, with full 
respect for our Canadian identity, values and traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be appreciated, the changes proposed in the new act are 
designed to strengthen this most valuable asset, Canadian 
citizenship.  Therefore I ask all members of the House to support 
the new citizenship act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am actually nervous about speaking to Bill C-63.  I, 
who have spoken in the House perhaps 60 to 70 times without 
notes, am nervous this time.  It is because of the nature of the 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all the circumstances of my speech.  I learned that 
Bill C-63 was on the order paper just late Wednesday morning.  I 
hurried over for question period to get a copy of the bill and to 
study it, because I had not looked at it before, just in time for 
the opening ceremonies on Wednesday which involves, as the House 
knows, the singing of O Canada.  I came in here just on time.  I 
was not on House duty, but the others were gathered on the other 
side and I stood next to the member for St. John's and sang with 
her.  In O Canada is “God keep our land glorious and free”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I sat in my place as question period unfolded and the Prime 
Minister answered questions from the opposition on various 
subjects.  I read the proposed oath of citizenship that my 
colleague has just mentioned that has been put forward with Bill 
C-63.  My heart sank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry I do not share the view of the parliamentary 
secretary that this oath of citizenship really does reflect what 
we are as a country.  The parliamentary secretary explained to me 
subsequently that it was something created by consensus, by 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that sometimes consensus and consultation is not the 
way to go and where really one has to come to that place and to 
those people who deal every day with what it is to be a Canadian 
as part of their lives, as part of their professions perhaps to 
get an idea of what an oath of citizenship should be all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oath begins: “From this day forward I pledge my loyalty and 
allegiance to Canada”. Loyalty and allegiance are synonyms. 
They are the same words. So we begin the new oath to take us into 
the next millennium with a redundancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on: “We pledge allegiance to Canada, Her Majesty Queen 
Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada”. This is another 
redundancy. When I pledge allegiance to Canada I pledge 
allegiance to all Canada's democratic institutions.  I pledge 
allegiance to this parliament.  I pledge allegiance to the Queen. 
So long as the Queen is the Queen of Canada I pledge allegiance 
to the Queen whenever I pledge allegiance to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, I am a monarchist.  It is just that I am not so 
sure that we need in this part the Queen along with pledging 
allegiance to Canada, because I feel it is something of a 
redundancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oath goes on: “I promise to respect our country's rights 
and freedoms and defend democratic values and faithfully observe 
our laws and fulfil the duties and obligations of a Canadian 
citizen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not capture what it is to be a Canadian.  These are 
generalities.  Yet in this place every day we debate very 
fundamental values that drive this country.  One cannot be a 
member of parliament for more than a week or two before one 
realizes the five real principles that drive this country, that 
make this country free, that make this country Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those five principles are equality of opportunity, freedom of 
speech, democracy, basic human rights and the rule of law. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That day in question period we dealt with all those issues 
because always, in a country like Canada, the issues that have to 
be dealt with in parliament are the issues where we try to 
balance those five principles, where we balance the rule of law 
with basic human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that day in question period we dealt with hepatitis C, the 
problem of a ruling on child pornography and similar things. All 
these things deal with this balancing act on the five principles 
of Canada and Canadian freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My biggest disappointment when reading the new oath was that 
there was no reference to God.  Do members realize that among all 
the major nations that accept new citizens, we are the only 
country that has dropped God from our oath of citizenship. 
Australia has “under God” in its oath.  Great Britain has 
“Almighty God” in its oath.  New Zealand and the United States 
have “so help me God” in their oath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did have it at one time, 1976 I think it was, but for some 
reason it was decided that “so help me God” was not important 
in Canada's oath and it was dropped subsequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a deeply religious person but I believe there is an 
eternal presence, there is something more, some higher authority, 
a higher authority than parliament, a higher authority than the 
country.  We have reason to count our blessings as Canada.  Those 
blessings emanate from a higher presence, from God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a member of a village church, the United Church of Canada. 
I am not a terribly regular churchgoer but I do go. The stained 
glass window is yellow. As the minister may be speaking or the 
choir singing, that window lights up with sunlight.  I sit in my 
pew and think how grateful I am to be among my people, my 
community, how grateful I am to be a Canadian where there are no 
wars and no strife, where I can feel at home with people who love 
one another.  I know that is a heck of a thing to say but that 
does happen in church.  That is what church is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the referendum crisis in 1995 the Liberals had a lot more 
seats than now and there was an overflow on the opposition side. 
I had a seat on the opposite side, right next to the opposition, 
that faced toward the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my most moving memories was during that debate on the 
referendum crisis to see the Prime Minister attempting to defend 
the country he believed in, in the most crucial moment of his 
life trying to defend Canada against what was a real questioning 
of whether Canada should stay united. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could see the Prime Minister trying to find the words and 
trying to speak and he would look over my way because I suppose 
the camera was directly behind me and he could address the 
Canadian people.  I could look into the Prime Minister's eyes as 
he spoke and I knew the passion he was feeling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of that I could look up to the northwest window, 
the Ontario window, and the sunlight would invade the glass of 
that window. That window is comprised of trilliums and at the 
very top the three maple leaves of Canada. The trillium of course 
is the trinity and the trillium that was chosen for that glass is 
not all white. It is stained red. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we make these associations we realize there has to be a bit 
more than just words, more than just things, there has to be 
something that is greater than all of us that does give these 
blessings that make us Canada, that make us Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to think that 99.99% of new people coming from anywhere 
in the world come from cultures where there is a god.  It may not 
be the God of Christ.  It may be the god of another great 
religion but still there would be a god and I think they would 
expect to see an oath of citizenship that contains the word god, 
an invocation to God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat here today among my colleagues with the encouragement of 
the members for Brampton West—Mississauga and for 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey.  I made an effort to write a 
new and different oath of citizenship.  I wrote it right here. 
This is not a prop.  This a piece of paper on which I jotted my 
notes during question period.  This is what I wrote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote “In pledging my allegiance to Canada and Her Majesty 
Queen Elizabeth the Second”, and the next part was difficult 
because I did not want to say promise.  I did not know what words 
to use and then it occurred to me with the encouragement of my 
colleagues: “I take my stand, I take my place among Canadians”, 
and the rest of it flowed very easily, “united before God whose 
sacred trust is to uphold five principles: equality of 
opportunity, freedom of speech, democracy, basic human rights and 
the rule of law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It flowed so much more easily in French:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend 
my colleague for a very good speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often wondered about these same things, how we can 
possibly detach ourselves from any anchor in our society.  That 
has happened to a great extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am also a Christian believer, one who believes in the 
Scriptures and the teaching of the Bible and tries to the best of 
my ability to follow those instructions given and to worship God 
and lead my family in that, I have a very serious and practical 
question.  It is one with which I have battled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to matters of faith belief we ought to be in a 
mode of persuasion and not of coercion.  I am aware that to a 
degree when one gives an oath if one does not want to minimize 
the meaning of it it has to be one that people can freely respond 
to in sincerity.  I think of the oath we take in becoming members 
of parliament.  I do not want to cast any aspersions against any 
of my colleagues here but there were some members of the House 
whom I do not really see how they could in sincerity give that 
pledge and that oath. 
How do we balance the coercion and the temptation to insincerity 
in giving the oath with actually having the oath in place as he 
suggests?

country is a god of all people in all religions, or all religions 
and all people, if you will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sense, even the atheist has a place with God and it is 
appropriate for any of us to acknowledge that there is something 
higher than humanity.  We may define it in many different ways, 
but there is something higher than humanity.  We know that when 
we see things beautiful.  We know that when we see our freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mistake that has occurred in the past is that people thought

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to address Bill C-63.  Before I begin I would 
like to compliment my colleague from Wentworth—Burlington for 
his very passionate and heartfelt speech and for his willingness 
to be open to share some of himself with us.  Often we do not 
take the time to do that and I appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to frame my comments toward this bill in the 
context of what I see to be a major problem within the current 
immigration system.  I make that comment very clearly, once 
again, with the immigration system, not with the concept of 
immigration.  Immigration is a positive contribution to Canada. 
Canada is a country built on immigration.  No one disputes that 
fact.  That is a part of our great history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that there are some serious and very glaring 
problems within our immigration system which need to be 
addressed.  They have been brought to the attention of the 
minister and the government, not just by opposition members but 
by many different groups from around the country in a number of 
different areas. In fact, I would be so bold as to say that the 
immigration system is broken and it appears as though the 
minister is either unwilling or unable to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make those comments not flippantly and not in a rhetorical 
manner.  I have had the opportunity to study the system over the 
last year and half and it has come to my attention that there are 
some very serious problems which need to be addressed that have 
not been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see a problem, when we see a concern with something, 
when we know there is a problem and yet we fail to take action, 
then we also fail to take the responsibility for that lack of 
action and the consequences which flow from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that there are some serious consequences as a result 
of many inactions within our immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move on to address some of the information that the 
minister has shared with us in the tabling of the bill.  I would 
first point out that the current minister has been the minister 
for three years and this is the first substantive legislation she 
has brought forward.  I have some questions as to why it is that 
this would be her first piece of legislation when there are many 
other issues at hand right now.  I am not saying that this is not 
important legislation, but in my mind and in the minds of many of 
my colleagues, we do not see this as being the top priority. 
There are some glaring concerns that need to be addressed which 
simply are not addressed through this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems within the immigration system are most strongly 
felt by those individuals who are part of the immigrant community 
and who have come to Canada recently.  The comments they share 
with me are that if the government is concerned about fixing the 
system, why is it that it does not do anything when it sees a 
problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, the individuals within the immigrant community are 
then painted with the same brush as the very few individuals who 
would cause problems within the system.  They want the abuses to 
the immigration system to be addressed and fixed.  They are, in 
many ways, finding their concerns falling on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out one situation.  This is an issue that 
has been brought up by opposition and by many people across the 
country, by lots of different groups.  It is a situation that is 
happening in the Vancouver, British Columbia area right now 
having to do with people who are abusing the system because of a 
loophole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some individuals have come to Canada and have claimed refugee 
status falsely.  As a result of that, they have abused the 
system.  That is not the only problem.  Many of the individuals 
who have falsely claimed refugee status have been selling drugs 
on the streets of Vancouver.  Again, it is a small number of 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious problem and it is having a huge impact in the 
downtown east side of Vancouver.  It is spreading into the suburb 
areas around Vancouver, to the areas of New Westminster, Surrey 
and elsewhere.  This is a concern that has been brought up over 
and over again.  There appears to be very little response coming 
back in any substantive way from the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I make the point that when someone knows something is 
wrong, when someone knows there is a problem, when they can see 
it staring them in the face and they can see the effect it is 
having on individual lives, on individual people, on the young 
people and others living in these communities, and yet they fail 
to take action, it is a dereliction of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the position that the current minister is in. 
There are individuals who are calling for changes, calling for 
something that I have suggested, which is an expedited process 
for those individuals who have been charged with drug 
trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these individuals, prior to or upon their arrest for 
dealing drugs, have claimed refugee status.  In our current 
immigration system they go into the mill.  They go into the 
waiting line with all the other individuals to have their refugee 
status determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that there is no differentiation between those 
individuals who are flagrantly abusing the system and those 
individuals who are genuine refugees in need of Canada's 
protection.  They all go into the same grouping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could take up to a year and a half or two years before 
anything is done to settle the claim the individuals have made. 
A simple answer to that problem would be to have an expedited 
process where those individuals who were brought up on these drug 
charges would be processed quickly to see whether they are truly 
refugees and then removed from the country if it is found that in 
fact they have made a false claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not do it quickly?  Why not deal with the issue and solve 
the problem?  It is something that the minister could do today. 
It is something she could do today if she had the willingness to 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only conclude that it is her lack of action, her lack of 
responsibility in moving on this issue and others that points to 
the fact that she is either unable or unwilling to make that 
change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other areas that fall into that same category, 
where there are individuals who are abusing our system, abusing 
the goodwill of Canadians, without any action being taken. 
Again, it is a small number of individuals who are causing the 
problem, the people who are abusing the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Word is out on the street internationally that Canada is an easy 
place to get to.  Canada is an easy place to make a false claim. 
When a refugee claim is made, the claimant is entitled to all the 
rights of a citizen, apart from being able to vote.  They have 
access to free medical care, welfare payments and legal aid. 
What is very insulting about this current situation is that these 
individuals are taking advantage of Canadians.  They are taking 
advantage of us.  Something could be done, but it is not being 
done, and that is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are talking advantage of legitimate claimants.  They are 
taking time and resources from the immigration department which 
could be used to deal with individuals who are truly refugees. 
Those resources are going to process individuals who are 
undeserving of our protection, who have committed criminal acts, 
who have made a false claim and who are not in need of the 
protection of this country.  They are here for sometimes two or 
three years.  I have heard of cases where individuals have been 
here for five to ten years.  That is unconscionable and something 
needs to be done about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we bring up these issues we are rebuffed by the government 
in a harsh manner.  We are told that we are not supportive of 
immigration, which is patently false.  I cannot emphasize that 
enough.  The fact that we want to fix the system shows we care 
about immigration.  We will fix the system, given the chance to 
do so, while government members sit idly, twiddling their thumbs, 
in the face of these issues.  We will bring positive change.  We 
will bring those things that need to be addressed and fixed to 
the forefront and deal with them quickly because they are of 
great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of government members have made statements like the 
following when we have brought up this issue.  It is a glaring 
issue.  There seems to be a contradiction.  The Liberal member 
for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, in a recent letter to 
his constituents, stated “I happen to believe that by deporting 
refugee claimants convicted of dealing drugs we would be taking a 
major step forward in the fight against the illegal sale of 
drugs.  They should be deported immediately, with no review or 
appeal allowed to drag things out”.  It seems a bit extreme to 
me that a government member would be suggesting that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members of the government have said in committee that the 
official opposition does not support immigration.  I cannot agree 
with that.  It is patently false.  We want the minister to move 
forward with positive change.  If she is going to sit idly by and 
do nothing when these problems continue to happen over and over 
again, let her stand aside, let her government stand aside, 
because we will do the job.  We will move forward with positive 
change and we will take care of the issues that Canadians are 
asking be dealt with, rather than having a government that sits 
idly on its hands and watches these things happen over and over 
again with absolutely zero response.  That is unconscionable.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ENERGY EFFICIENCY STRATEGY 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 8, 1998 consideration of the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat 
Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to continue the 
debate on this very worthwhile and important motion, Motion No. 
300. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this motion which deals with energy efficiency and the 
federal government's response to the calls and expectations of 
energy efficiency is a very timely debate and discussion.  The 
impact of the Department of Natural Resources Canada's programs 
on energy efficiency has been very positive both for the 
environment and for the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Picking up where I left off I would like to say to the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Centre that he was quite correct in his 
earlier conversation with the House when he made the link between 
energy efficiency and job creation.  Every $1 million invested in 
energy efficiency projects generates approximately 20 years of 
employment and millions are being invested each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's energy services industry grew by 600% between 1991 and 
1995 and is now a $300 million industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy efficiency also creates indirect jobs and it reduces 
operating costs for industry and businesses which in turn makes 
them more competitive in domestic and international markets. 
Competitive companies grow with the economy and generate 
employment and income for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian industry is showing the way when it comes to 
energy efficiency. Nearly 250 companies, representing about 75% 
of total industry energy use in Canada, have registered with 
Natural Resources Canada's industrial energy innovators program. 
About 80% of these companies have filed voluntary action plans to 
improve their use of energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety-seven per cent of the participants in the industrial 
energy innovators have also registered with the climate change 
voluntary challenge and registry incorporated and with the VCR. 
Another 46 industrial companies have registered directly with the 
VCR.  Through the Canadian industry program for energy 
conservation, industry has formed 19 individual sector task 
forces that work in close partnership with Natural Resources 
Canada in finding ways of improving energy efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House some other examples of Canadian energy 
efficiency achievements.  During the 1990s the amount of energy 
used by new clothes washers and dryers, for example, decreased by 
about 20%.  New refrigerators, freezers and dishwashers are using 
between 30% and 40% less energy than those manufactured just 10 
short years ago.  Those improvements are largely the result of 
federal regulations that establish minimum energy performance 
standards for household appliances and for other energy using 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progress is also being made in the transportation sector which 
is the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in 
Canada.  The sales weighted average fuel consumption rating for 
new cars sold in Canada improved by about 8% from 1990 to 1996.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a technology perspective Canadian leadership is 
particularly evident in the buildings area.  For example, for the 
past two years the energy technology branch of Natural Resources 
Canada has spearheaded the green building challenge 1998, an 
international project to develop and test a system to assess the 
environmental performance of buildings around the world.  Just 
last month Canada hosted more than 600 international delegates at 
the green building challenge conference in Vancouver. This event 
was a huge success and strengthened Canada's position at the 
forefront of green building design and construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian firms are also developing leading edge energy 
efficiency manufacturing processes.  For example, with research 
and development support from Natural Resources Canada, Stackville 
Limited of Mississauga, Ontario has developed an innovative 
powder metallurgy process for manufacturing automative parts. 
The process eliminates casting, forging and tooling operations 
which means it saves both energy and materials.  It has helped 
make Stackville one of the largest producers of powder metallurgy 
auto parts in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are finding that you do not have to be a large corporation to 
be a world leader.  A small company from Lethbridge, Alberta is 
generating a great deal of interest after developing the world's 
first cargo carrying natural gas motorcycle, again with support 
from Natural Resources Canada.  The so-called cargocycle produces 
20% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a similar gasoline 
powered motorcycle and has enormous potential in the 
international markets.  This company is now exploring options for 
commercial production that could mean 3,000 new jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member who put forward this motion for his 
efforts.  It is providing government with an opportunity to 
highlight our achievements to date.  I look forward to continue 
working with him and this House in advancing the cause of energy 
efficiency and in the process advancing the cause of Canadian 
industrial efficiency and productivity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Motion No. 300 is an interesting and clearly well 
intentioned motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many NDP and Liberal initiatives it takes the attitude that 
government is the be all and the end all of society and that 
people will not do things for their own good unless they are 
whipped along by government coercion through regulation and what 
not.  It also refers fairly heavily to a federal building 
initiative.  I wonder about these things.  I will get into that a 
little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of retrofitting buildings to make them more energy 
efficient is a very valid one.  It certainly is not new.  On a 
very elemental level, 40 years ago my parents decided they were 
going to install central heating, a furnace in the old farm 
house.  Before they could do that they decided they had better 
insulate the place. They put in a furnace and did not want to 
spent a lot of their hard earned money to buy oil to melt snow. 
That was not considered a good idea.  These were practical 
people. They were not trying to protect the environment.  They 
were not worried about that dreadful gas carbon dioxide being 
emitted from their chimney.  They were interested in keeping some 
money in their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his address of December 18, the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Centre said the savings are unbelievable and almost too good to be 
true. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1340

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had some experience around here with spurious data and 
glossy ministerial bunk in other fields of endeavour so my 
reaction is that sometimes if something seems too good to be 
true, it is probably false.  Before private owners spend money to 
upgrade buildings they do cost benefit analyses.  They do not do 
that as a make work project.  Their decisions are validated by 
the bottom line.  Above all, after they have made decisions 
they let contracts to do the work in a properly tendered manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a cautionary note, when we talk about federal government 
retrofitting, I invite hon. members to look around them. We have 
been retrofitting this place for the last four years.  It is 
interminable.  The last time I looked the government had spent 
about $400 million.  It is already over budget and it is half 
done.  This is the way the federal government operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some problem with the idea that we must look to the 
federal government to take care of waste of 
energy problems.  I would like to see some figures that are 
believable and provable.  When our critic in this area tried to 
get some details on some of these federal building initiatives 
from the government, he was effectively stonewalled.  There was 
no detail available. So a word of caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry left to its own devices, free of a lot of regulatory 
and tax impediments, will develop energy efficient strategies 
because it is profitable to do so.  Although this is anecdotal, I 
will tell the House about a couple of projects developed by the 
innovative Canadian mining industry many years ago not to 
conserve fuel in the national interest or to curb emissions of 
combustion gases but to help them make more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best examples I can think of was designed and built 
more than 80 years ago in the town of Cobalt, Ontario where a 
mining company drove a vertical shaft up near the bed of a river 
at a waterfall so they had an enormous cascade of falling 
water coming through the raise.  That water was used to compress 
air.  The compressed air, which was produced at virtually no cost 
and with no fuel, was then used to power the drills 
to drill the holes in which they would load the dynamite 
to break the rock in the mines in the neighbourhood.  It was a 
wonderful system developed 80 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an example in the Sudbury area with which I am more familiar 
because it gets into my age group.  In order to help with 
the ventilating system of a deep mine, International Nickel 
Company drove a raise into the bottom of a very large worked out 
area near the surface of the ground and installed its ventilating 
fans.  They would suck the down draft air through these old 
workings.  In the winter the company sprayed a fine spray of 
water into the old workings.  As the water froze it heated the air to 
give them free air heating to ventilate the mine. There was this 
great mound of thousands of tonnes of ice sitting near the 
surface of the mine so in the summer they sucked this air past that 
mound of ice and had a cooling system for the deep levels of 
the mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry is not stupid. 
Industry will do what is necessary to conserve energy, especially 
now when we consider the extremely high cost of fossil fuels. 
They will do anything they can to prevent the waste of valuable 
resources.  This is where the real work will come from.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no confidence whatsoever in any federal government 
initiative to do anything, to do it right and to do it 
economically. It does not happen, or if it does, it happens by 
accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note I will relinquish my space to others.  I do hope 
the hon. member from Winnipeg will give some thought to what I 
have said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our 
party's environment critic, the member for Fundy—Royal, has been 
working assiduously on this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Motion No. 300 has provided some really good 
food for discussion and progress within this parliament about the 
very important issue of the environment and how the public and 
private sector can work together. The government can work with 
and engage Canadians in a very important dialogue to make 
progress in a concrete way, particularly relative to the 
environment, given our Kyoto commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the previous speaker said he has no 
confidence in the federal government's ability basically to do 
anything.  I must challenge the hon. member on that assertion. It 
is not necessarily the size of government.  The size of 
government has been debated largely in the House and by 
Canadians, but we have to consider the role of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the government does have a role, a leadership 
role, to play in the area of the environment.  The benefits of a 
clean environment are not felt solely by individual Canadians nor 
by individual companies.  There is a societal benefit to a clean 
environment.  As such it is imperative that the government act 
decisively to work with the private sector to meet the 
obligations we have made in Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy efficiency benefits all members of society. When the 
private sector engages in more energy efficient behaviour, we 
will see a lowering of operating costs for business and better 
workplace productivity.  Productivity is an extraordinarily 
important issue.  Our productivity has been lagging that of our 
trading partners over the past 20 years.  This is one area, one 
opportunity Canada has to improve productivity in environmental 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a particularly important issue, given the degree to 
which the U.S. government and President Clinton and 
Vice-President Gore have engaged in a leadership role on the 
environment, on sustainable resource development and energy 
efficiency.  Canada cannot stand back.  We must take a more 
proactive role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government engages in more energy efficient behaviour 
ultimately the taxpayers will save money.  It will help us meet 
our international obligations, for instance those made at Kyoto. 
Over time, municipalities and provincial governments will be able 
to invest the money saved by more environmentally sound practices 
in things like community infrastructure, recreation and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government particularly has a leadership role to 
play in this area.  We have seen organizations such as Edmonton 
Power and the Canadian Homebuilders Association promote 
efficiency in new homes.  This type of technology can be sold not 
just within Canada but globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the potential to improve the quality of life of 
Canadians and to reduce the damage to the environment by using 
greener sources of power.  Ultimately less taxes will be paid by 
Canadians because energy efficiency will result in greater 
operating efficiency for government.  In time there will be a 
better quality of life for all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, it is unfortunate that the government is not actively 
pursuing these initiatives, as opposed to the opposition and my 
colleague from the New Democratic Party who has put this motion 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing concerns me relative to the commitment we have made in 
Kyoto.  That is the lack of meaningful dialogue in Canada prior 
to those commitments being made. There was very little meaningful 
dialogue with the sub-national governments, the provincial 
governments and the municipalities.  The level of dialogue with 
the private sector was not as extensive as it should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we are debating these issues now but 
it would have been far better had we debated them more thoroughly 
and diligently prior to going to Kyoto.  Then our commitments 
made in Kyoto could have been based on sound research and 
consultation with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now after the fact we need initiatives like Motion No. 300 which 
brings to the forefront the important issues:  jobs and energy. 
There is an inextricable link between energy efficiency and 
investments in energy efficiency augmentation and employment 
growth, particularly in the new economy in a global sense. Around 
the world countries will be seeking better approaches to energy 
efficiency and better approaches to some of the age old problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opportunity for Canada not just to compete globally 
in this newly emerging sector, but to succeed globally. Young 
Canadians can pursue education in these areas and participate in 
what could be an exciting new growth industry where Canada could 
be a leader. We need leaders in Canada who recognize the 
potential of this extraordinary opportunity to contribute not 
only to a better quality of life for Canadians, but for a better 
quality of life for everyone on this planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility to this generation and future 
generations to protect the environment.  We have been extremely 
fortunate. For far too long we have taken for granted our 
country, its tremendous potential, its natural resources and the 
relative purity of our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuing this type of initiative more actively would cause us to 
consider and improve every aspect of everything we do in our day 
to day lives to contribute to better energy efficiency and to a 
cleaner environment.  Ultimately if we do this properly, there 
will be more jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Reform Party's position is that global warming is 
not a proven phenomenon and may not exist.  We can ask a thousand 
doctors if smoking causes cancer and we might find one who says 
that it does not.  The fact is the weight of evidence clearly 
indicates that global warming is a problem. When the weight of 
evidence is so overwhelmingly in support of global warming being 
a problem, it would be irresponsible for us not to act 
decisively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not have to mean a loss of jobs.  This does not have 
to mean, as some would assert, a loss of opportunities.  It can 
mean more jobs, more opportunities, a cleaner environment, a 
better Canada and a better world.  All of that is possible if we 
act decisively and we ensure that this House provides the 
leadership so that Canada can provide the kind of global 
leadership that the world needs on the environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, let me begin by congratulating the member for 
bringing this motion to the House.  I am pleased to see his 
commitment to energy efficiency and his interest in the federal 
buildings initiative, something that is important for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy efficiency helps Canadians save money.  It ensures a 
responsible use of our resources and as has been pointed out, it 
ensures and protects our environment.  Energy efficiency is 
important not only for government but for all Canadian 
homeowners, industry, small business, and automobile drivers for 
that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy efficiency is a winning strategy.  It contributes and 
helps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is critical in 
achieving our Kyoto commitments on climate change.  Our 
commitment on energy efficiency is also key in creating high tech 
jobs and in making Canada a world leader in this field, something 
of great note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks today will focus largely on the role of the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services in this 
initiative.  As a major property owner in Canada, the Department 
of Public Works and Government Services has the opportunity to 
promote and implement energy management initiatives such as the 
federal buildings initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal buildings initiative, or FBI, is a voluntary program 
which helps government departments and agencies improve the 
energy efficiency of their facilities.  The FBI offers a new 
approach to updating federal buildings with energy saving 
technologies and practices with no front end cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal building initiative employs an innovative 
contractual arrangement involving a pre-qualified energy 
management firm and federal government departments or 
organizations.  Through this arrangement the full cost of energy 
efficiency improvements is financed with the resulting energy 
savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The energy management firm finances a project and supplies and 
installs the new equipment.  The department then pays the 
resulting lower energy bill to the utility and an amount 
equivalent to the energy savings to the energy management firm 
until the full cost of the energy efficiency improvement is 
recovered. At no time does the department pay more than its 
pre-improvement energy bill. After the improvements and costs 
have been recovered, it pays a lot less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FBI reduces the cost of government operations. It generates 
thousands of jobs and in the process lowers greenhouse gas 
emissions.  In many buildings, annual energy savings of between 
10% and 15% can be achieved by implementing relatively simple 
measures such as high efficiency fluorescent lights and motors, 
and heating-cooling system upgrades.  Energy accounts for roughly 
30% of a typical facility's operating and maintenance costs so 
that even modest improvements can add up to improvements that are 
substantial in nature and substantial in savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me describe a few success stories.  In Winnipeg for example, 
Public Works and Government Services Canada is upgrading four 
federal buildings which will result in annual savings of 
$100,000.  Environment Canada reaped annual savings of $880,000 
through its retrofit of a Burlington, Ontario facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public Works and Government Services Canada alone has signed 29 
contracts representing about $33 million in energy investment by 
the private sector. This generates over $5.2 million in annual 
savings for energy costs, reducing CO2 emissions by 80,000 tonnes 
per year and creating 660 jobs in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2000, Public Works and Government Services Canada 
estimates that it will have reduced energy consumption by $12 
million per year and CO2 levels by 14%. This is quite remarkable. 
This is an important element in the government's response to 
meeting our greenhouse gas emission commitments which were made 
in Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to launching its own projects, Public Works and 
Government Services Canada as a common service agency helps 
others departments implement the federal buildings initiative by 
undertaking project management on their behalf.  With its broad 
expertise in the areas of procurement, fleet management, water 
management, water conservation and energy efficiency, Public 
Works and Government Services Canada is well suited for this 
task.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre will be pleased to hear that 
public works is now pursuing the feasibility of the federal 
buildings initiatives in all leased buildings it manages.  This 
of course means more energy savings and more job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually every department that owns buildings has made a 
commitment to pursue this initiative and the programs of the 
federal government are having an increasingly positive effect on 
the energy efficiency of government operations.  We are also 
encouraging the private sector to go faster in its reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only appropriate then for the federal government, a big 
energy consumer itself, to set this kind of important and 
positive example.  Canada is recognized as a world leader in 
energy efficiency, and deservedly so.  That is something we can 
all be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre that the 
federal buildings initiative is alive and well and will be 
implemented wherever and whenever possible.  It is important that 
we as Canadians do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak in support of Motion No. 300.  We highlight job 
creation in the motion.  That is a basic belief of the hon. 
member who placed this before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this country takes the leading edge in addressing its federal 
responsibilities we would be creating development into high tech 
expertise.  This expertise could be exported to federal buildings 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a similar climate to European countries, circumpolar 
countries and countries with boreal forests. The high tech 
expertise we would practice and use under the federal buildings 
program could generate opportunities in long term employment and 
investment back into our communities and industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are about 50,000 federally owned buildings in this 
country.  In retrofitting these buildings through the federal 
buildings initiation and the many departments that would be 
investing, my colleague from Winnipeg Centre is correct in 
calling on the House to recognize that this buildings initiative 
can work but it has to be accelerated. In about five years we 
have had about 100 buildings that have been addressed.  We have 
to address 50,000 buildings. We have to accelerate this program. 
That is the challenge before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is asking that the federal government undertake its 
responsibilities on the properties it owns and make them energy 
efficient and in the process address the unemployment regions, 
the training of the many trades that would be affected in all 
regions of Canada.  There should be an equitable program, not 
just located in certain urban centres.  These buildings are in 
all corners of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's international commitment as highlighted in the Kyoto 
protocol was targeted at a 6% reduction from 1990.  Since 1990 we 
have increased greenhouse gas emissions up to 13%.  That is a 
total of 19%.  Almost 20% has to be targeted now.  That is almost 
a quarter out of all our initiatives that we have to take from 
here on in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative has to be taken seriously by all Canadians. We 
listen to members who say the federal government cannot take 
leadership.  It cannot take leadership behind closed doors. 
Leadership has to be shown by example, as this motion is saying. 
The federal government could show example by retrofitting its own 
buildings and leadership by taking the question to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 12 issue tables that have been formulated by the 
greenhouse gas and Kyoto protocol secretariat.  Those are closed 
debates.  None of these members of parliament are participating.

industry debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry is protecting its interests.  It has put its foot 
down directly on what will impact on the Kyoto protocol but this 
protocol is well on its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific reality is this target is not even adequate 
enough to address the economic disaster we will create for our 
children to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from employment and environmental opportunities, I think 
what we need to do since it is a millennium project as well that 
could be coined is to prepare our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These buildings are age old, rusting, moulding.  Let us recreate 
the future for our children but have them do it.  We have young 
people who are represented through visiting this House, visiting 
museums, visiting the many art galleries throughout the country 
and these buildings are going to be renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a new building up recently, the home of the Maple Leafs, 
the gardens.  It is the last of the old arenas from the original 
six.  These things cannot be retrofitted to a point that they 
have to be rebuilt as well.  They need to be completely redone. 
That is the challenge here as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has challenged us to extend the life of these 
buildings by retrofitting them.  It is a challenge to check out 
new technologies so that when we get to building the new 
buildings, when we build the new structures, the technologies are 
tried and proven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to Kyoto. Members accompanied our delegation.  We were 
shown in Japan the high tech initiatives of solar energy. 
Anything that faced the sun had a photovoltaic cell. It captures 
enough power to power all their computers when they operate.  It 
is continuous power to generate any power need they want in this 
building as long as the sun is shining.  Even though there are 
clouds it still collects the power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not capitalize on these leading edge technologies, we 
will be buying Japanese technology.  Why can we not buy Canadian 
technology, invest in it now so that we can sell it worldwide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was growing up there was a concept in <I>Popular 
Science</I>, geothermal energy.  My vision of geothermal was that 
someone sticks a pipe far down into the ground to the hot rock. 
They could heat their water and get it up here.  That was my 
imagination, down to the centre of the earth.  It came out in a 
movie. Actually geothermal goes only a few feet below.  It works 
the same way a refrigerator works. There is a heat pump.  It is 
exchanged and then pumps can be run just below the permafrost. 
In the farther north, they have to go a little deeper but it is 
also available.  It is just a few degrees.  The heat can be 
captured and circulated in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about Toyota coming on the Hill just before the year 
was over and the Minister of Natural Resources was riding around 
in a hybrid car built by Toyota.  I challenged the minister to 
bring up vehicle designed by a farmer in southern Saskatchewan. 
He designed his own electrical vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it have to be labelled Toyota?  Why can it not be 
Canadian made?  Why can it not be made in Canada?  It is.  There 
is one in Saskatchewan.  We saw it on CBC. It woke me up during 
the Christmas holidays.  A man designed his own battery powered 
car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the creation. 
That is the energy of Canada that makes our country great.  We 
have minds that have travelled to see the world.  We have 
technology, theoretical and academic experience in our 
engineering departments of universities.  Why do we not challenge 
these as a Canadian leader since our budgets are in place for the 
federal departments?  The budgets are filled every year to 
consume energy.  Why not take a portion of the consumed energy 
and invest it for retrofitting to save energy? As long as energy 
is being saved there is investment into our youth to broaden 
their minds and experience and to create a major job experience 
for them into the future.

that came through an initiative by a Cree community, 
Oujé-Bougoumou. It will be a community highlighted for the 
retrofitting and energy saving initiatives in northern James Bay 
Cree.  They will be the highlight of Bonn, Germany in the next

be highlighted internationally.  It was initiated by a federal
