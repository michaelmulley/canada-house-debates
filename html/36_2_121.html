</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  This matter was scheduled to come 
before the House, I believe, on Wednesday of this week and that 
was changed late last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in my riding on Friday and as a result some amendments 
that I had submitted never saw the light of day at the committee 
hearing and were submitted by the member for Kamloops.  As the 
justice critic for the party, I am prepared to speak to those 
amendments today but I would ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House that my name be substituted for the name of the member from 
Kamloops as the mover of those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for the 
hon. member's name to be substituted for that of the hon. member 
for Kamloops on those motions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on this point of order, as you have ably outlined, 
we have heard now that the report stage of Bill C-3 will be 
before the House.  It will be a hotly contested bill.  Officials 
of the House have been inundated with notices of proposed 
amendments.  The government itself has been so inept at the 
handling of the bill that it also has over 100 amendments to a 
bill with only 199 clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many proposed amendments by other members that the 
parliamentary website has not been able to publish these notices 
with the regular notice paper.  As of 8.30 last evening I was 
unable to find the questions that might be before the House this 
morning and yet the government expects all members to be here 
prepared to debate this substantial bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I am equally concerned that Canadians have not been 
informed about what the possible amendments to the bill will be. 
This is a very important bill and arguably the most important 
bill that we will see before the House in this session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in real danger.  We are close to undertaking a secret 
proceeding around a very public bill.  We are in this position 
for several reasons.  We are in this quagmire because of 
arrogance and incompetence on the part of the government and its 
inability to have any form of compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the job of the Chair, I would suggest, to in any way 
make up for or explain the incompetence of the government and yet 
it is my submission that there is a basic duty on the Speaker to 
maintain an orderly process in the House.  The Chair must do this 
in an orderly fashion when members are not able to access the 
basic information on the questions they will be ordered to debate 
and decide upon.  This is not an orderly proceeding.  This is a 
sabotage of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 76.1(5) gives the Speaker an unfettered power to 
select amendments for the report stage.  To date the Chair has 
been reluctant to use that power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the House of Commons in this session has 
started down a path on which none of us should be willing to be 
accessories.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the instigation of the Reform Party's amendments on the 
Nisga'a treaty, we now see copycat tactics that the Bloc used 
during the clarity bill and now C-3.  The House is being turned 
into a disorderly House because the Chair has failed to maintain 
an orderly process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, Standing Order 10 demands that 
the Speaker maintain order.  Standing Order 76.1(5) reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(5) The Speaker shall have power to select or combine amendments 
or clauses to be proposed at the report stage— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is empowered and, I would suggest, impliedly ordered 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two orders of the House are sufficient to allow the Chair 
to put a stop to this tactic that is leading the House of Commons 
into disrepute.  A repeat of the voting circuses that we have 
seen here are unnecessary.  It will not lead to an improvement 
of the bill and it is not an orderly proceeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill received no clausal examination at committee. Everyone 
here should be ashamed of what happened at the committee on this 
bill, particularly the Minister of Justice and the Queen's 
Attorney General of Canada.  This is not the way we should be 
considering bills in parliament.  We are seeing once again that 
the committee stage is being flouted.  This is not the way to 
pass laws and dumping these amendments now before the House of 
Commons without any real examination at the committee, none 
whatsoever, nada, is a complete abuse of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these circumstances all of us must examine our conduct and 
our consciences if we are to proceed.  The Speaker, I would 
suggest, and I say this with greatest respect, is not a mere 
decoration in this place.  The Speaker has a duty to the entire 
House and the entire country to make parliament work and to make 
parliament relevant.  The Speaker has the power to put a stop to 
this sabotage of democracy.  It is time for the Speaker to do 
that job.  This place will grind to a smoking, screeching halt if 
we continue down this road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I suggest the Speaker should vigorously use the power and 
the office he has to select amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the House and the public should have adequate notice as 
to what selected questions of debate will be in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the government should get its act together and bring in a 
clean bill incorporating the changes that it earlier muddied with 
its own amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, instead of trying to ram everything through the House of 
Commons and reacting to dilatory tactics with an iron fist, the 
government should admit that it made a serious mistake with this 
bill, change the order of business today and stop treating the 
House as if it were its own private play toy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some in this place will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the House 
got itself into this mess and that it will get itself out of this 
mess.  I state to you quite seriously that for every hour that 
the House debates in needless, ritualistic voting as a dilatory 
tactic, the House diminishes itself in the eyes of Canadians and 
other democratic nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has the power to prevent this from happening.  It is 
the Speaker's duty to do so and the House of Commons and 
Canadians generally expect the Chair to act in a way that will 
bring the House credit instead of disrepute.  By proceeding in 
this fashion the chair and the Speaker are being rendered to that 
of a bingo caller.  This is not to be permitted.  This should not 
be an attack on parliament, which it is.  It is necessary and it 
is incumbent upon the Chair to act decisively in this fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in connection with the point of order raised by our hon. 
colleague, the House leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party, for all intents and purposes, it contains a number of 
elements, and I am totally in agreement with some of them but 
not with others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the House leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party says that the Chair did not use his power, 
his prerogative to select amendments, I believe he is wrong. 
The total number of amendments tabled with journals branch is 
far higher than the figure of 2,133 you gave earlier. 
In other worlds, the Chair did exercise its discretionary power 
to select certain amendments and reject others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the Progressive Conservative Party took the 
trouble to point out that the essential reason for our finding 
ourselves in this situation today, and for a similar situation 
in the past, is the lack of openness of the government, its 
stubborness and its partisan manipulation of this parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government imagines it can use its majority in the House to 
impose anything it wants on this parliament.  This closed-minded 
rigidity goes so far as to propose to us a bill so badly put 
together than even the government needs to amend it.  It alone 
has proposed over 150 amendments to a bill than does not even 
contain 200 clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is indication that the government ought to have softened 
its position and agreed to withdraw its bill and to make the 
necessary changes.  Instead of doing so, which would have forced 
it to admit it had made a mistake, it has decided to go ahead 
and to force parliament to examine its bill, imperfect as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have before this parliament today a far from perfect 
bill at report stage, with this government itself having to 
propose 150 amendments to it.  As we have said and often 
repeated, this bill is not just imperfect in form but in 
substance as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the reasons the government has decided to examine this 
bill may be justified in some areas of the country, they are 
certainly less justified in Quebec, where we have come to terms 
with juvenile delinquency by means other than those the minister 
is proposing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit to my colleague, the House leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party that, with a bill erring in 
substance and not simply in form, it was to be expected that we 
would move amendments to correct not simply the form of the bill, but 
its substance as well.   Not surprisingly we are tabling a great 
many amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that it is very disrespectful toward the Chair 
to claim that it has not made a ruling, that it has not 
exercised discretion in excluding a number of amendments, 
because it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also be concerned that the Chair is being autocratic and 
discretionary to an extent beyond that permitted under the 
standing orders of the House and in deciding on the relevance of 
the amendments, as it has up to now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is 
right in saying that a tendency is developing to use report 
stage as a dilatory tactic in the passage of bills, it is not 
the opposition parties who are to be blamed. I would respectfully submit to 
him that he should not criticize the opposition parties for 
using this tactic but place the essence of the blame if not all 
of it squarely on the shoulders of the government, which for all 
intents and purposes compels the opposition parties to use such 
dilatory tactics because the government is not playing fairly or 
working constructively in its efforts to use this parliament for 
partisan purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the standing 
orders and the usual practices in the House have all been 
complied with by the government.  The Speaker made a decision and 
we should proceed with that decision.  We should not reflect on 
the decision of the Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is rather amusing to listen to the 
House Leader of the Conservative Party talk about closure when it 
was his party that was one of the biggest abusers of this method 
of governing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party always respects the decisions by the Chair 
and we will respect the decision you make in this matter today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I just want to speak briefly on this point of order.  I think it 
is once more regrettable that the House finds itself in the 
situation it is in as a result of what transpired in committee 
and the inability of people to move amendments in committee. 
We can point fingers as to whether or not it was the government's 
lack of receptivity to changes in the legislation or a particular 
opposition party's position with respect to the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that we now have before us a very undesirable 
situation:  a committee process in which people were not able to 
move any amendments.  Therefore it is impossible for any of us to 
claim that the bill received the kind of attention that it should 
have on a clause by clause basis.  Now we are potentially faced 
with one of these voting marathons again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the case may be, I think there is a larger argument to 
be made.  Perhaps now is not the time to make it, in the heat of 
battle, so to speak, but it is an argument I have made before and 
I think others have made before.  There should be more power 
given to the Speaker to act in the interests of the whole House 
and in the interests of the general reputation of parliament when 
procedural things like this present themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now whether the Speaker wants to use this context to initiate a 
new interventionist approach by the Chair is something that the 
Chair itself will have to deliberate upon, but we do have 
a cumulative crisis of legitimacy with respect to how we 
deal with report stage.  If there is anything that the Chair 
could do in this respect, I would urge the Chair to consider it 
or to consult with the House leaders or others as to how this 
might be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we have to proceed with what we have before us 
and I would urge the House to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order please. The Chair is about to 
rule on the point of order raised by the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and the Chair really appreciates the 
comments of other members on this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair has given a ruling in respect of the admissibility of 
the amendments.  Of the 3,100 or so that were submitted, I am 
told 156 have been rejected as not in order and will not be 
proposed to the House in the course of the debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that from 1964 to 1968 we adopted a 
number of rules that have changed the practice in this House 
concerning amendments at report stage by including a new debate 
at the report stage of bills, after a standing committee of the 
House tables its report on a bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members are aware of the fact that these changes to 
the rules were made.  At that time certain discretion was given 
to the Chair in the standing orders and there have been 
amendments to that from time to time in the years since.  But I 
think it is fair for hon. members to know, and I am sure all hon. 
members do know, that the Chair has exercised its discretion in 
certain ways throughout the period from 1968 until now, so we 
have 30 years of practice in this House of dealing with the 
admissibility of amendments at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have today, which we have had before, and not just on 
the three bills where we have had a significant number of votes, 
is a deliberate choice by members of the House to submit 
amendments that, based on Speaker's rulings in the past, are in 
order.  What has happened on this occasion is that a large number 
of amendments have been submitted that, based on previous rulings 
by the Chair, are in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for the Chair to adopt the solution proposed by the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, that is, to 
exercise powers that are there in the rules, that have never in 
fact been exercised before, and that in fact have been exercised 
but in different ways than what we are faced with today.  Members 
have chosen to draft amendments to get around rulings that 
Speakers have made as to their discretion under Standing Order 76 
and they have done it apparently in compliance with those 
previous decisions which, in my view, are binding on the Chair 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure and House affairs committee, after the two other 
voting marathons we have had, has considered the issue and chose 
not to come up with any amendments to the standing orders 
reflecting their consideration and reflecting the difficulties 
that we encountered.  The duty of that committee is to make 
suggestions for changes.

procedure here today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<I decline to do so.  The ruling I have made on behalf of the 
Speaker is in my view a satisfactory ruling on the points.  It is 
in accordance with past practice in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House wishes to make changes in the rules or wishes the 
Speaker to exercise his or her discretion in another way, I think 
that can be done through the procedure and House affairs 
committee, not on a point of order in the House.  Accordingly, I 
must reject the point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I simply wish to make a brief correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, you undertook the rather fastidious task of 
reading all the amendments that were duly and legitimately 
tabled regarding Bill C-3. We are going to begin the report stage 
study of this bill today. We have, of course, the list of the 
amendments that are on the order paper but we are told that it 
is impossible to get copies of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we parliamentarians seriously be expected to do our job 
in the House if we cannot get copies of Bill C-3? Is it possible 
to see that we get copies before carrying on?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Each member received a copy of Bill C-3 after 
first reading, and there are other copies available here in the 
building.  We can get some for the members if there is a 
problem.  Each member's office was sent at least one after the 
bill was tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No changes were made to the bill during its examination in 
committee.  I believe the committee report contained no 
amendments, so it is the same bill.  Copies are, I believe, 
available now at the table.  If there is a problem for any 
members in this connection, we can get more.  There are some 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did indeed get a copy 
of the bill, but you will understand that when a bill is a 
complicated at this there is more than one person in each MP's 
office working on it.  There being more than 3,000 amendments, 
you will understand that more than one person in each office is 
working on such an important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the members in this House are going to vote on the 
amendments without even having the original tool in hand, Bill 
C-3.  For there to be democracy there must be information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself asked a page for a copy of the bill and I do not know 
whether he found one or not.  Some other members of my party did 
the same and were told there were no more available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before resuming work on this bill, I would point out that there 
is such a thing as a photocopier and if necessary photocopies 
can be made. We must have Bill C-3 in our hands so that we can 
seriously pursue our work on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that you are in agreement with us on this, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm has 
been a member of this House for a long time and he knows full 
well that when a bill is being debated in the House there are 
always copies of the bill available at the table. Today is no 
exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member to approach the table and get a copy of 
the bill if he needs one. There are several copies at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand what you are 
telling me, but what I fail to understand is that you are 
telling us to go get copies of the bill ourselves while you are reading 
the amendments, when we have asked the pages to provide us with 
copy and were told that none were available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe a few adjustments need to be made here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand that the members have now 
received copies of the bill. There are many copies available.

him, I went to get the seven copies of the bill that were at the 
center of the table, I distributed them, and we are still 
missing three copies. Would it be possible to get at least three 
more copies and maybe more if other members of the House want 
some? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As I indicated earlier, each member received 
at least one copy of this bill, probably two, after its

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with the motions in Group 
No. 1 of amendments to Bill C-3. This is a very complex bill and 
we had to look at it very closely to get the government to 
reconsider, and particularly to show the government that it was 
making a mistake in wanting to pass Bill C-3 at all costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experts in the area of young offenders do not understand. 
I parenthesize here to state that not one of the experts from 
Quebec who appeared before the committee supports the minister's 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of the experts working with the Young Offenders Act on a 
daily basis can find a single reason for the minister to want to 
amend the Young Offenders Act at all costs and ram through the 
bill criminalizing the young people who are having problems with 
the law. The only reason would be a political one, to try and 
win votes in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the creation of the Canadian Alliance, the government 
opposite has been trying to build an image for itself in western 
Canada, the image of a party that it more to the right, a party 
more and more like the Canadian Alliance Party. 
It has taken the Young Offenders Act and the young offenders as 
hostage to bolster its image in western Canada on the eve of a 
federal election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that I made spoke hours on end in committee, and 
even reached out to the minister, suggesting that, before 
completely changing a legislation that has proven its efficiency 
over the past 15 to 20 years, she should stop the proceedings of 
the committee and tour the provinces to examine their youth 
policies, and come and see what we are doing in Quebec, where the 
crime rate is the lowest in Canada because the Young Offenders 
Act is enforced properly in Quebec. The present Minister of 
Justice recognizes it, as does her predecessor, the current 
Minister of Health, who was the Minister of Justice at the time, 
the legislation is very well enforced in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was telling the current Minister of Justice that, if she made 
comparisons and looked at the Young Offenders Act closely, she 
would be able to see if there was any reason whatsoever to 
change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With my 27.5 hours of speeches in committee over the past 11 
months, I have tried to give the minister time to go and see for 
herself, particularly in Quebec, what was being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She did not see fit to take a little time to consult and to 
check how the act is implemented in Quebec. She did not check 
either in the other provinces, with the result that we find 
ourselves today in front of a very complex piece of legislation. 
The minister has attempted to sprinkle here and there certain 
notions she picked up along the way either in my speeches or in 
the briefs presented to the committee by witnesses who came from 
Quebec to tell her she was on the wrong track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a whole, the bill remains complex. Given its goals, it is 
unenforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never said nothing should be done to try to improve the 
enforcement of the Young Offenders Act, quite the contrary. An 
extensive study conducted in Quebec in the 90s resulted in the 
Jasmin report, which concluded that the blame did not lie with 
the act, but rather with its enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is enforced properly in Quebec, there is always room 
for improvements. 
Had the Young Offenders Act been enforced properly in the other 
provinces, in particular in western provinces such as Alberta, 
British Columbia and Manitoba, they would not be clamouring for 
changes to the Young Offenders Act now. These provinces where it 
is enforced the least have the highest detention rates, the 
highest youth crime rate, and an increasing number of young 
re-offenders. This shows that the problem is not the act, but its 
enforcement, as I have been saying for weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the good elements in the existing Young Offenders Act is 
that it is tailored to their specific needs since a 14, 15, 16 
or 17 year old cannot be expected to have the same 
responsibility as a 30 or 40 year old adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 3 of the existing Young Offenders Act, under the heading 
declaration of principle, says it very clearly. It contains the 
major thrusts for dealing with young persons in trouble with the 
law, and trying to rehabilitate them and reintegrate them into 
society. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate aim is to help a youth with a problem to become an 
anonymous citizen and to integrate into society as a citizen, as 
if he did not have any legal problem or any criminal problem. 
The aim is really to try to see to it that this youth might 
someday pay income taxes, get married, have children and get 
integrated very anonymously into society. In Quebec, we see it 
as a long term investment and believe that protection of society 
will be increased if this youth does not re-offend and does 
integrate into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the declaration of principle, in section 3(1) of 
the Young Offenders Act and the following sections, there was 
all that was needed to guide the court so that a judge hearing a 
case could consider a youth with a criminal problem as a 
particular case. The judge could deal on an individual basis 
with young people with criminal problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything necessary was there in the declaration of principle. 
I do not want to read it all for my time is limited, although I 
could speak for several hours more since the subject is close to 
my heart, but, only to remind hon. members of a few elements 
found in the declaration of principle, I will quote this “While 
young persons should not in all instances be held accountable in 
the same manner or suffer the same consequences for their 
behaviour as adults, young persons who commit offences should 
nonetheless bear responsibility for their contraventions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on it provides that “because of their state of 
dependency and level of development and maturity, they also have 
special needs and require guidance and assistance”.  A little 
further on it says, “depending on circumstances, the needs 
and facts of a youth's childhood, which might explain his 
behaviour, must be taken into account once again”.  The thrust 
in this declaration of principle was to provide alternative 
measures for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was everything in this declaration of principle.  The 
minister axed this declaration.  She said no to Quebec, which is 
properly applying the Young Offenders Act.  She made a sort of 
omnibus preamble.  It contains all sorts of things that are not 
integrally part of the bill like section 3 of the act is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the series of amendments in Group No. 1, there is one by the 
minister that will complicate things even further. It is an 
amendment to the preamble, when what counts is how the courts 
will apply it, especially the interpretation the supreme court 
gave of the special needs of adolescents dealing with a problem 
of crime within the context of rehabilitation and return to 
society especially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will to close by saying that the major difference between 
Bill C-3, which we are studying today, and the Young Offenders 
Act lies in the fact that the act referred to needs, whereas the 
minister with her bill now wants to talk about the gravity of 
the offence.  She is putting the offence at the centre to enable 
a judge to impose a sanction, as the minister puts it in the 
bill.  This is unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise today to debate Bill C-3, the youth 
criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the cornerstone of the Government of Canada's youth justice 
renewal strategy Bill C-3 provides for a fair and effective youth 
justice system that involves young people, families, victims and 
communities.  This legislation modernizes the youth justice 
system and builds stronger links with other programs and services 
that help children and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience has shown that the current youth justice system is 
not working as well as it should.  More must be done to prevent 
youth crime in the first place, to develop meaningful responses 
to youth crime when it does occur, and to emphasize 
rehabilitation and reintegration so that youth who do get into 
trouble with the law can turn their lives around.  Working toward 
these three key objectives is the best way to ensure the 
protection of society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights I have had the benefit of hearing from many Canadians with 
insightful ideas about youth justice.  The Government of Canada 
has been listening.  As a result of the input received from the 
thoughtful witnesses who appeared before the committee on Bill 
C-3, and through consultations with provincial and territorial 
governments, professionals, the legal community, academics, 
aboriginal groups, voluntary and stakeholder groups, and young 
people and their families, the government is proposing amendments 
designed to improve upon the approach in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed Youth Criminal Justice Act sets out the purpose of 
the youth justice system through its principles.  The new 
principles reinforce that the criminal justice system for youth 
is different from the one for adults.  Bill C-3 emphasizes 
preventing crime, ensuring meaningful consequences for offending 
behaviour, and rehabilitating and reintegrating a young person as 
the most effective way to contribute to the long term protection 
of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of witnesses who appeared before committee put forward 
suggestions that seek to clarify further the principles in the 
bill, some of which have been accepted by the government.  For 
example, we are proposing the inclusion in the principles of a 
reference to the importance of timeliness in dealing with youth 
offending behaviour.  We are also proposing a provision 
specifically requiring judges to take into account a young 
person's individual needs and level of development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment to the principles would stipulate that 
measures taken should respond to the needs of aboriginal young 
persons.  In addition, while the importance of treating victims 
with courtesy, compassion and respect, and of providing them with 
information about proceedings and an opportunity to participate 
and be heard, a proposed amendment would enshrine the interests 
of victims in the preamble of the legislation.  We would also 
propose emphasizing in the preamble the importance of making 
information about the youth justice system publicly available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 makes a distinction in the way we deal with the small 
number of youth who commit the most serious violent crimes and 
the vast majority who commit less serious offences, providing 
more effective measures for dealing with both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 gives the police more tools for dealing with youth in 
their communities in order to try to turn youth around before 
they get on to commit more serious crimes.  Greater police and 
crown discretion early in the process will lead to meaningful, 
effective and faster resolutions of the majority of less serious 
cases.  The formal court process and custody will be used to deal 
with the more serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard concerns expressed about the definitions of 
non-violent, violent and serious violent offences in Bill C-3. 
Some have indicated that the definitions may lead to confusion as 
to what comes within a certain category of offence.  To remove 
any ambiguity the government proposes to delete the definitions 
of non-violent and violent offences from the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference between a non-violent and a violent offence is 
obvious and therefore these terms do not need to be defined in 
legislation.  In addition, we would improve the definition of 
serious violent offences by replacing the phrase “creates a 
substantial risk of serious bodily harm” with a reference to 
“attempts to cause serious bodily harm”.  These proposed 
amendments should provide greater clarity to the categories of 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it is important to involve others in the youth 
justice system in order to improve upon understanding and to 
provide support for victims, youth, families and communities in 
responding constructively and meaningfully to offending 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things Bill C-3 specifically encourages conferences 
at many stages of the proceedings.  Some conferences may involve 
bringing together professionals such as child care workers, 
school psychologists or others who are already involved with 
youth to seek advice and ensure continuity of services.  Others 
may be in the nature of sentencing circles or family group 
conferences involving victims, offenders and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While conferencing has been strongly endorsed, some are 
concerned about the lack of definition in the bill.  Therefore we 
are proposing amendments clarifying who may hold a conference and 
giving provinces and territories scope to regulate non-judicial 
conferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of witnesses also expressed concerns about youth ending 
up in the criminal justice system when their problems and needs 
could be more effectively dealt with through the child welfare 
system.  A proposed amendment to Bill C-3 would recognize that a 
judge can make a referral of a young person to child welfare 
authorities for an assessment.  While this is something that 
judges already have the authority to do, the amendments would 
encourage a link between the two systems in appropriate cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major flaw of the Young Offenders Act is that it does not 
include sufficient provisions for safe, supervised reintegration 
into the community.  Bill C-3 aims to better support the young 
person's reintegration back into the community, which protects 
the public by guarding against further crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that periods of incarceration will be followed 
by periods of supervision in the community.  To ensure “truth in 
sentencing” and clarity for the young person at the time of 
imposing the sentence, the judge will state in open court the 
portion of time that is to be served in custody and the portion 
to be served in the community.  Breaching conditions of community 
supervision could result in the youth being returned to custody. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally the reintegration scheme has been strongly endorsed. 
Some, however, have expressed concern about requiring that the 
period of supervision in the community be half as long as the 
period of custody in all cases.  Under a proposed government 
amendment, where a young person rebuts the presumption for an 
adult sentence on a presumptive offence, judges will have the 
discretion to set the periods in custody and the periods in the 
community.  This will allow more flexibility in dealing with 
those who receive youth sentences for the most serious violent 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of witnesses have raised concern about the 
admissibility of statements made by youth.  The legitimate 
concern of the police and others that the exclusion of youth 
statements for technical reasons under the Young Offenders Act 
brings the administration of justice into question needs to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 currently permits a judge to allow the introduction of 
a statement that has not been taken in accordance with the 
requirements set out in the bill if the admission of the 
statement would not bring the administration of justice into 
disrepute.  In order to clarify the intent in drafting this 
provision, the government is proposing an amendment specifying 
that this applies only to technical breaches and that statements 
will only be admitted if the admission would not bring into 
disrepute the principle of enhanced procedural protections for 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important concern about the Young Offenders Act has been 
voiced by both the police community and victims groups.  The 
existing law does not allow for publication, without a court 
order, of information that would identify young victims or 
witnesses who are involved in a young offender's case, even where 
the victim or witness and his or her family want the information 
to be published.  This means, for example, that parents of a 
deceased child victim of a young offender do not have the right 
to publish the name of their son or daughter without facing 
criminal sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A proposed amendment to Bill C-3 would correct this situation by 
allowing a young victim or witness to have his or her identity 
published with parental consent, and in the case of a deceased 
young victim, by allowing parents to publish or cause to be 
published information identifying their deceased son or daughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, many of the proposed government amendments are aimed at 
enhancing the clarity and reducing the complexity of Bill C-3. 
These amendments include improvements to drafting language in the 
bill and the consolidation of certain clauses in order to 
streamline the legislation.  In addition, at the request of the 
provinces and territories, the Government of Canada is proposing 
a number of technical amendments aimed at facilitating the 
administration of the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Youth Criminal Justice Act is built upon the values 
Canadians want in their youth justice system.  Canadians want a 
system that prevents crime by addressing the circumstances 
underlying a young person's offending behaviour.  They also want 
a system that seeks to rehabilitate young persons who commit 
offences and reintegrate them into society.  The system must also 
ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful consequences 
for his or her offence.  Canadians know this is the most 
effective way to achieve the long term protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our new approach also responds to the concern of Canadians that 
the youth justice system has to do a better job of instilling 
values such as accountability, responsibility and respect.  The 
system must also be more responsive to victims needs, encourage 
young people to acknowledge the harm done and provide restitution 
where appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that Bill C-3 will provide Canadians with the 
kind of youth justice system they want and deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK524"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to comment on what we are doing here 
today.  The longer I am around this place, the more I become 
convinced that most of what we do here borders on being a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is given the impression that legislation is drafted 
pursuant to the needs of Canadians.  The government presents 
legislation, and parliament reviews and improves it as necessary. 
Supposedly that is part of what we are doing today.  I seriously 
question how effective our review and improvement can be under 
the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 was first introduced in March 1999. The justice 
committee was assigned to review it, and after listening to 
interested parties of expert and lay witnesses, to consider 
necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the justice committee from all parties, including the 
government, decided that a number of alterations were needed to 
Bill C-3.  One particular member of the committee decided that 
rather than put all the substantive amendments forward for 
consideration, he would filibuster the committee in an attempt to 
force the government to consider only his wishes for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was his right, Mr. Speaker.  Please do not get me wrong. 
That was his right under the rules.  I certainly understand that 
there are tools and procedures available to opposition parties 
and members to try to get their point across.  However, where the 
committee, as representative of this place, failed in its duties 
is when it was given its marching orders, so to speak.  A closure 
motion was issued to the effect that the committee was to be 
given only 10 hours of further debate, and then it had to report 
back to the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point, with all due respect, the chair of the committee 
had an obligation to take control of the committee, close down 
the debate on the filibuster, and move to the clause by clause 
consideration of the many proposed amendments.  Having the 
committee return the bill to the House without any change 
whatsoever has in effect left this place without the value of the 
committee's time and effort of review.  The House is in the same 
position it was in almost two years ago.  What a waste of time, 
especially on a bill that was supposed to be a top priority of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further compound my consternation over the operation of this 
place, we then have the manner in which the whole process at the 
report stage of the legislation has unfolded.  The committee 
reported back to the House on Bill C-3 last Thursday, September 
21.  Because of the government's scheduling, amendments had to be 
filed with journals branch by Friday at 2 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only now, on Monday morning, the day of the debate at 
report stage, that we can even see the amendments proposed into 
groupings as assigned by the clerk.  After years of delay and 
after months and months of waste, we are provided with a bill 
without the benefit of committee recommendations.  After years of 
delay and after months and months of waste, we are now in a type 
of overdrive to process the legislation almost overnight. 
Regardless of any individual political perspective, I would argue 
that the public is definitely not well served by this process, at 
least in the way it has unfolded with Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It truly amazes me that this place can be mired in quicksand and 
be going absolutely nowhere, and that it takes an imminent 
election to force the government to move.  What disappoints me 
the most is that even when the government does move, it exhibits 
little consideration, if any, for our citizens.  Although I do 
not wish to jump to any conclusions, my intuition tells me Bill 
C-3 will be passed virtually intact, with little difference from 
the questionable version of the supposed new youth justice law as 
presented by the government back in March 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may be proven wrong, but debate in this place at this stage 
will likely have little, if any, influence on the legislation. 
Regardless of the arguments presented by interested Canadians and 
by members of this place, it appears that it was always the 
intention of the government to merely go through the motions. 
There was never any real intention to listen to or even seriously 
consider other viewpoints calling for substantive change.  This 
legislation, if it passes from this place in its current form or 
with little change in substance, will be a travesty to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to address some of our amendments that are proposed in this 
grouping, our Motion No. 35 would eliminate a presumptive 
offence.  Under our amendments we are doing away with the whole 
concept of presumptive offence, serious violent offence and the 
interpretation problems of the government's legislation over just 
what will be determined to be a violent offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our proposals there are to be just two categories of 
offence, namely violent offences and non-violent offences. 
Violent offences are defined as those within a list of named 
offences.  The list has been taken directly from the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent offences will be those that federal legislation already 
uses to determine safety concerns when considering how to treat 
adult offenders.  By following this list we are being consistent, 
we are being all inclusive, and we are being transparent so that 
Canadians citizens, our courts, and offenders will know why and 
how our youth justice process will operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no guessing.  There will be no extensive legal 
argument.  If an offender is charged with a specific offence on 
the list, that offender will be processed in a predetermined 
manner.  The courts still retain all the powers and discretion to 
apply specific circumstances to each specific case. If the 
offence is not on the list, the offence will be classified as a 
non-violent offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Motion No. 44 would similarly eliminate the definition of 
“serious violent offence”.  There would be no presumptive 
offence designation; there would be only non-violent and violent 
offences, as I spoke to before.  We have a “serious violent 
offence” designation, but only if the crown attorney makes 
application and the court sees fit to endorse the information. We 
have an overly restrictive list of presumptive offences. Under 
our proposal, violent offences are specifically listed.  No 
interpretation will be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again Motion No. 49 speaks to the whole issue of violent offence 
and presumptive offence.  Leaving the terms undefined will not 
ease the difficulty; it will just put the problem into the courts 
to be interpreted.  This will be costly and will delay justice 
once again as the legal argument is made and the appeals have to 
be heard.  It is the responsibility and obligation of parliament 
to present laws that do the job.  We should not put off these 
problems on to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our proposals at least attempt to clarify what will be a violent 
offence and what will be a non-violent offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present definition within the legislation states “An 
offence that causes or creates a substantial risk of bodily 
harm”.  That definition will keep lawyers and judges busy for 
years to come and is open to various interpretations.  Just like 
conditional sentencing, it will bring criticism and 
dissatisfaction from our citizens when it is limited in scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Easy questions of fraud upon the elderly will obviously be 
determined to be outside this definition, but many of our seniors 
may well be hurt much more seriously on being defrauded of their 
life savings than if they were hit over the head and robbed of 
their cash on hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens to the offence of sexual assault?  Will an offence 
be determined to be violent if the victim does not fight her 
aggressor?  Will it be a violent offence if the purse snatcher is 
successful in grabbing the purse from a senior citizen without 
knocking her over?  Where will the line be drawn between what is 
a violent offence and what is non-violent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition proposed by this amendment clearly lists the 
offences to be included within the category of violent offence. 
We avoid these interpretation difficulties, we avoid the cost and 
time of legal argument, and we bring greater certainty to our 
laws.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the 
amendments before the House on Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin my remarks by saying this is a bad piece of 
legislation.  It is a bill the government has typically brought 
forth after seven and a half years of promising it would try to 
fix our youth criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be frank.  What we have seen happen here is the 
government has tried, in its typical form, to do all things to 
all people to fix this situation.  As a result it will please no 
one.  As a result, we have a piece of legislation that is 
unworkable, cumbersome, complicated and confusing.  At the end of 
the day it will make worse a system that is already struggling 
and not working.  It will make the situation worse for Canadians, 
worse for youth, worse for parents, worse for police, and worse 
for all those in the system who are struggling to make it work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the initial underpinnings of the criminal justice system, 
coupled with the usual protection of the public and coupled with 
elements and philosophies of rehabilitation, was deterrence and 
denunciation for those who cross the line, those who choose in 
their wisdom to act in a way irresponsible and contrary to the 
laws of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, like others we have seen brought forward, is 
completely devoid of any reference to deterrence, of any 
reference to the fact that society, the public, and the 
government have a right to express their dismay with those who 
choose to break the law.  This is not to say we should ever go 
too heavily in that regard, but it should be there.  Courts use 
it.  Lawyers refer to it.  Judges have it at their disposal to 
mete out as part of a sentence references to the word 
“deterrence”, general and specific deterrence.  That is meant 
not only to aim this sort of justice at the offender, but also to 
send a message to those who choose to act in a like fashion. This 
bill is devoid of that concept.  It is devoid of that philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My loquacious friend from the Bloc has taken it upon 
himself—and as has been referred to, it is his right to do 
so—to express his outrage on behalf of his party.  He says on 
behalf of his province that this is the only way he can get his 
message heard.  It is a sad comment that here we are now debating 
in a summary fashion on the floor of the House of Commons 
amendments to this bill, which is perhaps the most important we 
will see in this session of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from witnesses from across the country, many of whom 
expressed extreme reservations about the way in which the bill 
has been tabled.  The government has admitted its failure in 
putting forward over 150 amendments to its own bill, which only 
has 199 clauses.  That is an absolute condemnation by the 
Department of Justice of its own work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is that the opposition has had to resort to 
extreme measures.  I believe this has now gone over the top. This 
has now gone far beyond what was intended as a statement in terms 
of trying to bring the government back to the centre, back to a 
point where there can at least be reasoned discussions as to how 
we compromise, how we bring about some feeling that we can at 
least bring about legislation that will be responsible, that will 
respond to the needs of Canadians but will also respond to the 
lack of resources that exists.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That as an underpinning in this legislation is telling Canadians 
they should do more.  It is telling the people in the system they 
should do more with less.  It is saying “We are going to give 
you the ability through legislation to do more counselling, to do 
early intervention, for police to now sit in the living rooms of 
Canadians with their children to discuss how it is that we remedy 
these problems of young people who have gone astray”.  At the 
same time there is not a single commitment, not even a reference 
to the fact that police, parole boards, counsellors, social 
services, anyone involved in the criminal justice is going to 
receive further resources, further back-up, a further strategy 
even to adjust and to react to an escalating situation of more 
violence among young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most startling, Mr. Speaker, and you would be aware of 
this as someone who follows the criminal justice system, is the 
escalation of violence among young women.  It is something that 
has caught the attention of many Canadians that to their shock 
and horror this is happening.  It is happening across the 
country. It is not limited to cities.  It is happening in rural 
Canada as much as it is in our cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This entire piece of legislation is such an inadequate response 
to the problems that exist.  It is such a convoluted, cumbersome, 
bureaucratic, red tape response that it is going to make the 
system worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the commentary on the bill and the debate in the House 
in the coming days and weeks, if it comes to that, is going to 
point out a lot of the technical problems that exist with the 
legislation.  One of the problems I hasten to point out is that 
it creates in essence new procedures that are already not working 
in the adult system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking specifically of preliminary inquiries.  Ironically 
the justice department envisions a system where we may limit the 
use of preliminary inquiries in some instances. That is already 
being done in some jurisdictions.  The new territory of Nunavut 
is collapsing the justice system to make it more efficient and 
streamlined.  What are we doing as a result?  We are taking the 
same systems that are failing and pulling them into the new youth 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly we are taking a system that was never intended to be 
used for violent offences that pertain to sexual assaults—I am 
talking of conditional sentences—and lo and behold what do we 
find?  Yes, wait for it, the justice department in its wisdom has 
decided to bring conditional sentences into the youth criminal 
justice system.  Once again it is applying them to crimes which 
they should not be applied to and judges are being given that 
discretion.  In fairness, judges have to listen to the arguments, 
they have to listen to the constitutional submissions that will 
be put forward by lawyers.  Lo and behold once again there is a 
gaping hole in our justice system, something that is not working 
for adults, and we are bringing it like a plague into the youth 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned preliminary inquires.  It is also introducing a 
parole system for young people.  If there was any redeeming 
feature in the old Young Offenders Act it was that when a judge 
specified a young person was going to be incarcerated in the 
worst of all circumstances, when there was no other alternative 
available, a young person would receive a sentence and would do 
every day of that sentence.  There was the confidence that the 
young person would do every stick of time that the judge in his 
or her wisdom decided was appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we going to see now?  We are going to see a parole 
system foisted on the young offender system.  Now young people 
are going to be released at the discretion of an official who is 
working within the system.  I do not mean to cast aspersions on 
the entire system or whitewash this problem, but we have seen 
problems in the adult system, such as the 50:50 release plan that 
was put in place by the former commissioner of corrections.  We 
have seen a philosophy where we have to get people out of the 
prison system, even putting people at risk on occasion.  Lo and 
behold the justice department through these amendments, through 
this bill intends to put in place a system that will undermine 
this concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to use the words truth in sentencing, but at least 
there was an indication that when a person received a sentence he 
or she would do that time under the old Young Offenders Act. That 
will be wiped out, completely taken out of existence by the 
amendments the new bill has brought in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say we should not allow judges to use discretion. 
Surely we have to support judges in their very difficult duty in 
a very difficult time.  Crime is becoming more complicated. It is 
becoming more pervasive certainly in different areas.  We know 
for a fact that young people are becoming involved in crime at an 
earlier age, which is another amendment I will hopefully speak to 
later in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated the intention when this bill was introduced 
and reintroduced in her many comments outside the House, through 
the public forum of the press gallery as opposed to on the floor 
of the House.  If the intention is truly about early 
intervention, if it is truly about borrowing the concepts of 
restorative justice, better community involvement, more 
involvement of parents, more involvement that focuses on 
reconciliation with the crime, with the offender, with the 
community that has been offended, why would we want to prevent 
the ability to bring young people in at the earliest stage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to suggest that crime is rampant among very young 
children that are outside the parameters of the Young Offenders 
Act, that is to say under the age of 12.  This summer there was a 
recent example of a young man, 11 years old, who walked into a 
bank to rob it.  Under the current system there is no mechanism 
to respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can transfer youth to adult court, we should be able to 
transfer children to youth court.  The minister has completely 
closed her mind to this.  She has not responded to the wishes of 
the provincial attorneys general.  She has not responded to the 
wishes of reasoned individuals who have put forward evidence that 
this should happen.  It is indicative again of a closed mind, 
holier than thou approach, an approach which says “We will 
bestow upon the country the system that we feel is appropriate”. 
It is wrong.  It is not going to work.  Hopefully throughout this 
debate we can demonstrate in opposition that there are reasonable 
amendments that should take place for the legislation to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before the House resumes debate, I 
know there are a lot of popular members in the House who receive 
telephone calls, but I remind hon. members that cellular 
telephones are not permitted in the Chamber. 
<P><A NAME="LINK526"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in response to some of the comments made and 
to discuss some of the amendments moved in this large group of 
amendments.  It is important first of all that we come to some 
kind of understanding as to how we arrived at this point today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough said we are 
debating amendments to what may be the most complex piece of 
legislation to come before the House of Commons in this setting. 
Indeed, one colleague who has been here a lot longer than I have 
told me that this was the most complex piece of legislation after 
the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced in the last session of parliament.  It 
was then unfortunately numbered Bill C-68, not a popular bill 
number for the Minister of Justice.  It went before committee and 
there was some discussion at first reading. Then for whatever 
reason, it was determined that parliament would prorogue and the 
legislation died.  It came back as Bill C-3.  It has had a long 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those watching and those who read <I>Hansard</I> will know that 
the Minister of Justice was questioned time and time again on 
this bill.  Members asked when it would be brought forward by the 
government and they were told it would be in a timely fashion and 
it was. Unfortunately the debate has not taken place in a timely 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, when this complex piece of legislation was in committee, 
there was no opportunity to debate the necessary and important 
amendments that have been placed before the House by different 
parties.  Those amendments fall in different camps and different 
areas.  On behalf of the New Democratic Party I moved 20 
amendments, all of which I thought were reasonable and sensible, 
some of which would have been healthy to debate at committee.  My 
colleagues from the Conservative Party moved another 40 or so. We 
will not talk about what some of those were because they are not 
in this group of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that there were problems with this bill on the day 
that it was announced. I outlined the problems and I had hoped 
that by the time the legislation came to the House some of those 
problems would have been resolved. 
We now know that there was an opportunity to resolve them.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the thrust of the bill is that the Minister of Justice 
has attempted to appease both those who want tougher sentences 
for children and those who call for restorative justice.  It is a 
difficult balancing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good measures in the bill that deal with 
extrajudicial sentencing.  By extrajudicial measures we mean ways 
to deal with young people who find themselves in trouble with the 
law on their first or second offence, not a serious offence, who 
in many instances are acting out against society.  There are 
provisions in the bill that allow the community to get involved 
in a restorative justice sense, to help work with a young person. 
The problem is that the provinces are to administer the criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level we pass the legislation dealing with the 
criminal code and the criminal youth justice act. It is then left 
to the provinces to administer the law we create.  Part of the 
problem with the bill is that the resources will not be there to 
put in place the extrajudicial measures that might be so helpful 
to young people who find themselves in trouble with the law for a 
first or second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know of one attorney general at the provincial level 
across the country who thinks the resources allocated by the 
federal government will be sufficient to put in place those 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when the Young Offenders Act, which we are replacing, 
was first introduced.  We ran into the same problem. I was 
practising in the courts in those days. On many occasions a young 
person would come before the judge and the judge would not want 
to send the young person to jail.  The act had provisions for 
other measures but the province had no money. What was written on 
paper and what was provided for in the law were not put into 
effect by the provinces. When I questioned the Minister of 
Justice on this she felt that the resources were adequate and 
given the tight financial circumstances we found ourselves in as 
a nation, there were no more resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know now there was a $12 billion surplus.  It has gone to pay 
down the debt because it was not allocated for any of the other 
programs that might have found the money useful.  I submit that 
putting in place this comprehensive piece of legislation and 
asking the provinces to take on the administration of it, those 
provinces could have used some of the resources the government 
found itself with.  It would ensure that young people who come 
into conflict with the law would at first instance have the 
benefit of working with their community and the community would 
have the resources to work with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, we are all responsible for the children in our 
country.  All of us are responsible for the children in our 
community. When a child breaks the law it is a call to all of us 
to respond. Poorer communities will not be able to take 
advantage.  Poorer provinces, especially the have not provinces, 
and there are more of them than the have ones, will not be able 
to take advantage of some of the good, proactive measures that 
are in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing the Minister of Justice did in an effort to calm 
members of what was then the Reform Party was to make the law 
tougher, if that is the word one wants to use, at the other end. 
In the bill is legislation which allows a judge to send 14 year 
olds to do adult time if necessary.  Under the previous 
legislation it was rare; an adult sentence would not be imposed 
on a young person unless he or she was over 16. This bill goes a 
little further than that.  It allows the court to sentence a 14 
year old to adult time for certain types of offences or if the 
judge feels it is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has talked 
about judicial discretion.  That is where I disagree with him, 
and I do not disagree with him often. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are dealing with young people in particular, no one is 
in a better position to understand the type of sentence that 
young person needs than the judge who has heard all the evidence, 
has seen the parents in court, has seen the victim in court, has 
seen, sometimes, the victim's parents in court, and has access to 
all kinds of information from social workers and doctors.  No one 
has that information except the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely if we are going to provide judicial discretion in any 
area of the law, that judicial discretion should be used in the 
case of young offenders.  I have worked in the criminal court 
system and the criminal youth justice system for a long time. 
The complexity of those cases can be understood only by the 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a shift, but before I go on to that I want to 
respond to the case that was raised, about the 11 year old who 
went in and committed a bank robbery.  I submit that the 
appropriate measures were taken.  That was a young boy.  He 
did not know what he was doing.  What became clear in the 
investigation was that there was an adult who directed this boy 
to do something.  Surely the person to be charged is the adult. 
If we are going to start elevating 11 and 10 year olds 
to the criminal justice system, then I wonder where we stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Pampers in the courtroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Yes, Pampers in the courtroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a strange conundrum here.  When we are dealing with 
crime what we know under the rule of law is that to be convicted 
of committing a crime one must have a knowledge of what it means 
to commit the crime.  That is an adult concept.  We do not let 14 
year olds drive cars.  We do not let 12 year olds go into the 
liquor store.  We do that because we know they do not possess the 
necessary judgment.  Yet some members of the House are prepared 
to send them to jail.  I have serious questions about that 
aspect, but my time is up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to say it is a privilege to speak to 
Bill C-3, but seeing where we are today it is less than a 
privilege to address the problems we are having with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back in time a little.  Since being elected in 1993 
I have been working on issues of justice.  In 1995 or 1996 I met 
a fellow whose name was Cadman.  He had lost his son.  His son 
was murdered by a young offender.  I heard him speak many times, 
in British Columbia in particular, about the need for change.  I 
thought he was a good speaker who was certainly dedicated to the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came time to look for nominees for the 1997 election, I 
approached him.  I said that if he wanted to go further with this 
issue, why not become a member of parliament, go into the House 
of Commons and make a change?  Today that person is the hon. 
member for Surrey North, who is somewhat frustrated, as we could 
hear a little while ago.  He has headed up the Young Offenders 
Act for us from the day he came into the House in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a lot of emotions about this run through his mind, and I 
think back to the meeting we had in a restaurant in Langley.  I 
said that if he became a member of parliament he could make 
substantial changes and all the things that happened to Jesse 
would at least be the start of major change in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do I find?  I find that for at least the last decade 
Canadians have been looking for changes to the Young Offenders 
Act.  For the past seven years we have had a Liberal government 
in place and for seven years we have had no substantive changes

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are, before an election, rushing through the House of 
Commons a bill effecting changes to the Young Offenders Act.  I 
must say that in many cases the changes are poor at best.  They 
leave out a lot of things that many witnesses who came before 
committee have asked for and will not get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was tabled two years ago.  One could hardly say it has 
been rushed, but what has been rushed is that at the last minute 
we find some 3,000 amendments before us, some 150 of them made by 
the government to its own legislation, some 50 amendments made by 
the Canadian Alliance and on and on.  With that many amendments, 
the legislation obviously is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could say that perhaps with all the amendments accepted we 
could make an omnibus change bill and things would get done and 
would change for the better, but there are some serious things in 
this bill that will not get changed.  One wonders why, after its 
seven long years in office, the substantive things we are looking 
for will not get finalized by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not allow the publication of the names of young offenders 
convicted of serious offences?  That is not included in the bill. 
It was discussed and recommended by probably the vast majority of 
witnesses who came before members of the House of Commons.  In 
the final analysis this was ignored by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not carry over youth records to adult records?  So many 
times I have been involved with inmates who have committed other 
crimes after they have been released from prison.  We look for 
their records.  We see what is behind these individuals.   When 
we talk to corrections people all we get is a shrug of the 
shoulders.  They say that they did not know the individual was as 
bad as that.  They say that the other part of his history was as 
a young offender and they do not know about that.  They are not 
allowed to know.  They are not allowed to put it on his record. 
People like me or the police cannot see it.  It is as simple as 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not allow the carrying over of youth records?  What is wrong 
with that?  Why, after the government's seven years in office, 
does this issue continue to get ignored?  Why, after this bill is 
passed by a majority government, will it not be included?  We all 
know that it will be a long time before the government again 
tables legislation on the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not include young offenders who are aged 10 to 15?  What is 
wrong with that?  Time and again the government has been told 
about the need to get 10 and 11 year olds not necessarily 
incarcerated but onto a path to try to change them when they do 
get into trouble.  What is wrong with that?  Why did it not get 
addressed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see that with all these amendments before 
us, many of them coming from the Bloc, which is stalling for time 
to make it difficult for the government because that party is 
upset at the bill, there are changes in the bill that are 
necessary.  My fear is that they will get tossed out by the 
government because there are so many amendments to the bill.

to the bill that are really just wasting time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the House understand the need to have 
changes to the Young Offenders Act.  We have been demanding them 
for well over a decade.  The Liberals are into their seventh year 
of responsibility for the act.  Still, at the end of the day we 
will be faced with nothing substantive.  What do we do when we 
get to third reading and find that all we are dealing with is the 
shell of what we wanted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time for the government to call an election.  I 
think it is time that we put issues like this before the people. 
In my opinion the government has a poor track record on many 
things, but the one thing in justice that it will be hauled up on 
is the lack of substantial action on the Young Offenders Act, 
something we have all been looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize to the member for Surrey North.  I thought he could 
come to the House and get substantial changes to something that 
he wanted very badly, like the rest of Canadians.  It is just too

to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correctional Service Canada still seems to be falling short on 
the fundamentals.  I had always thought that the concept was to 
remove criminals from society, but here I have a report where a 
convicted drug trafficker, housed in the most violent offender 
section at Millhaven, was able to set up a home office for 
himself.  Using a cell phone he successfully imported Colombian 
drugs into Toronto as well as planned a Rambo-like escape using 
military weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be simple to smuggle drugs when a body cavity search 
fails to notice a cellular phone.  It must have been one of those 
super small flip phones.  My lesson for the solicitor general is 
that it is time to tear down Correctional Service Canada and 
rebuild the whole system, not build on yesterday's mistakes.  By 
the way, that is not why they are called cell phones.

The Liberal ads are getting bigger and better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture stubbornly refuses to admit that all 
his multi-million promises to Canadian farmers are not worth the 
paper his press releases are printed on.  Farmers wait months for 
responses to their requests for assistance after spending 
hundreds of dollars getting them prepared by professional 
accountants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the minister that his programs are too complex for 
the people who need help.  As it is, 58% of the claims in 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, two of the hardest hit areas, are 
rejected.  Ninety per cent of claims for 1999 remain unprocessed. 
I suggest to the minister that his programs are too complex for 
the people he has running them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday the minister stated that the full commitment of $600 
million had been disbursed for 1998.  That is not so.  In fact 
that is the total including the 40% provincial contribution; a 
couple of dollars short.  Of the promised 1.7 billion federal 
dollars only 41% has gone out to the few farmers who have been 
able to fight through the government red tape.

of democracy in the air because some Liberal MPs are beginning to 
speak out against the practice of the Prime Minister of not 
letting them vote for their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister inhale this fragrance of freedom, send a

lower taxes?  Will he keep them free from punishment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK568"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

on this side of House than on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that while the hon. Leader of the Opposition 
was with the Government of Alberta he was asked for a free vote 
on same sex benefits at that time as was permitted in Ontario. He 
said this was Alberta and it was not on the agenda.  His answer 
was no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago there was a request for a free vote on Bill 
C-11.  Some MLAs of the Conservative Party wanted a free vote. He 
went there to make sure that there was not to be any. 
<P><A NAME="LINK569"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

hon. premier just resigned today and I truly respect that man. He 
was right when he said that we needed a new generation of 
leaders.  The reason for that is obvious with that response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister, who disagrees with his finance minister 
on the high marginal rates of taxes and who now disagrees with 
his MPs, do one of two things?  Will he either resign because he 
has no support over there or call an election based on his record 
of being the highest taxing leader in the G-7 countries?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

having fun on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell him that Canadians know the person I am, a politician who

<P><A NAME="LINK571"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

olympics of high taxation Canadians deserve the gold medal for 
having to carry the heaviest weight of taxes of any of the G-7 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister do something about the fact that for 
people to move from low income to middle income it is the 
greatest and most difficult leap of any of the G-7 nations 
because of the high marginal rates?  Will he lower these rates? 
<P><A NAME="LINK572"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the last budget the Minister of Finance reduced the 
rate for middle income earners in Canada.  We did that in the 
last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reduced taxes for three years since we balanced the 
books.  We balanced the books.  We had a $42 billion deficit. Now 
we have a surplus.  We have started to reduce the national debt. 
We have started to reduce the income tax for people.  We have 
invested in health and in universities.

answer a question related to his own advisory committee on 
science and technology which said that brain drain was continuing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have a tax reduction program.  The Minister of Finance has said 
himself that the additional resources we have received will 
enable him, at the appropriate time, to lower taxes more quickly 
than expected.  This is good management.  Fortunately, we had 
revenues higher than we expected, because the economy is doing

this, including the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P><A NAME="LINK580"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would point out that we said last year there would be $11.5 
billion in surpluses, and the Minister of Finance was expecting 
$3 billion.  I am convinced that he knew as well as we did.  The 
problem is that he does not want this debate. The government is 
making promises without substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not see the need for a mini budget so 
that we have more than just election promises with no guarantee

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since July there have been reductions in taxes that will total

Perhaps we could speed up the process even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly two weeks ago, we decided to inject $21 billion over 
five years, that is, more than $4 billion annually, into health 
services in Canada.  The hon. members were totally in agreement. 
That means that, of the $12 billion announced, $8 billion has 
been already allocated.  That is two thirds.

surplus.

years and will allocate all the unexpected surpluses, the hidden 
surpluses, to debt reduction, without any debate on current 
major and urgent social issues? 
<P><A NAME="LINK583"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everyone knows that, under the law, when there is a budget 
surplus at the end of a year, that surplus is used to lower the 
country's debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should be pleased that a government which faced 
a $42 billion deficit when it took office was able, over the 
past three years, to pay more than $20 billion off the national 
debt. That had not happened in 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should be pleased, because future generations

employment insurance benefits does not deserve any 
congratulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister admit that, in the coming months, any 
surplus that was not anticipated by the Minister of Finance in 
the last budget will be allocated to the debt, even though there 
are urgent needs relating to unemployment, gasoline prices and 
excess taxes? The money that the Minister of Finance has in his 
pockets is money that is no longer in the taxpayers' pockets.

the Minister of Finance always presents an economic report to

will make such a presentation again this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are going well, but I should point out to the hon. member 
that, for example, we allocated substantial amounts of money for

about bringing aboriginal communities into the fisheries and

had 29 agreements with aboriginal communities.  We have built the

opportunity for aboriginal communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
three ways for a government to dispose of unexpected surplus 
funds: It can do nothing, as has been done on numerous occasions, 
and then the money goes directly on to the debt; it can take 
piece-meal decisions, in which case the money is spread around to 
win votes; it can bring down a mini budget, hold an informed 
debate on the problems facing society, and then take proper 
managerial decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which of these three is the government going to choose? 
<P><A NAME="LINK603"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance,

Quebecois has called five times for a mini budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say with confidence that Canadians did not need the last 
mini budget nor do they need a mini budget today.  Furthermore, 
it is interesting to note that while we underestimated our 
revenues by 3.6%, the province of Quebec has raised its revenue 
forecast by 3.8%.  This is a national and an international 
phenomena.  It is a good news story.

around all over the place for the purpose of winning votes, of 
improving their visibility with the taxpayers.

given the major social problems confronting our society and the

first let me welcome the hon. member to her new role as the 
health critic for the Canadian Alliance.  It is not a position 
that kept her predecessor very busy.  In fact we did not get many 
questions on health from the Alliance at all.  It is a little 
self-conscious about its position on an issue about which 
Canadians feel so strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted that her first question allows me the opportunity

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there seems to be no end to the 
Liberal shameless vote buying with other people's money. Now that 
he is about to call an election, the Prime Minister has decided 
to increase EI payments to seasonal workers who already earn a 
comfortable annual income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member for Calgary—Nose 
Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, worse is that the 
increase will come straight from the pockets of struggling low 
income workers, needy EI claimants and employers who pay job 
killing premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Liberals think they can get away with such blatant 
manipulation of Atlantic Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK647"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as everyone knows when we started, the premiums were 
$3.07 and now they are down at $2.40.  It shows what we have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And for enlightenment, I checked in Alberta because we have 
received a lot of complaints about investments. I have a list of 
about 19 golf courses in Alberta that have received money due to 
the good office of the Leader of the Opposition today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK648"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development issued a very unfair ruling for 
seasonal workers who lost their jobs between July 9 and 
September 17 in the Lower St. Lawrence, North Shore, 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and Charlevoix regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister allow a double standard whereby workers who 
lost their jobs after September 17 will get 32 weeks of 
benefits, while those who lost their jobs in the two preceding 
months will only be entitled to 21 weeks of benefits? Let us 
hear the minister's definition of fairness. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK649"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed we listened to the concerns of 
seasonal workers in that part of Quebec.  That is why we 
implemented a phasing in of the changes to the employment 
insurance boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is also why we are implementing transitional measures, 
precisely for the men and women to whom the hon. member makes 
reference.  That too is why we are working in the community, 
myself and the Minister of National Revenue, with employees and 
employers to find new opportunities for the men and women living 
in that part of Quebec.  I wish the hon. member would join us in 
that endeavour.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the finance 
minister has said that the government would deal with the issue 
of post-secondary student debt to the extent of its resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week when the minister was boasting about having $12.3 
billion more than he had expected, why did he not act to reduce 
the level of student debt that has increased on his watch?  Is it 
that the minister has had a hard time keeping his promises, or is 
it that he agrees with the Leader of the Opposition that student 
debt is just a personal problem? 
<P><A NAME="LINK652"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the last few years the 
government has taken strong action to relieve some of the burden 
on students with their debts by elongating the period in which 
they can pay the loans and by deductibility of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of March this year we had a $12.3 billion surplus 
which automatically goes against the debt.  That means that as a 
result of the payment of the debt in the last two budgets, we are 
saving $1 billion a year in interest costs. That is to the 
benefit of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

the region surrounding her area, my officials are working with

responding that he did not quote from an official document.  By 
our rules, there would be no need to lay these documents upon the

Mr. Speaker, I might request that you might want to take a look 
at <I>Hansard</I> for that particular day.  I do not have a copy 
handy with me this second, but in the parliamentary secretary's 
response he said point one, point two, point three and it says this, 
it says this, it says this.  We will not know whether or not he 
was quoting from the document until the document is tabled. 
<P><A NAME="LINK660"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  What we have is one hon. member claiming one 
thing and another hon. member saying that it is not a document. 
As your Speaker, I must of course abide by the rules of the House 
and respect and believe, as we always do, all hon. members. 
Therefore, as far as I am concerned, we have a statement made by 
the hon. member that he did not quote.  Therefore, we will let it

back to the very early days of Canada to our ancestors who in the 
wilderness when the winter was upon them sat and huddled around

part of the Canadian tradition.  My bill, I hope, will enable

<Question No. 100—<B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the breakdown and 
ratio of funding that the CBC is receiving in the current fiscal 
year 2000-01 from the Canadian television fund and Telefilm for 
the production of documentaries, feature films, children's 
programming and drama, showing not only national figures but 
regional figures by province and also a breakdown by name of 
production company and/or individual independent producer; and 
how do these figures compare with those for the last three fiscal 
years? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK681"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> The Canadian government provides the 
Canadian television fund (CTF) an annual contribution of $100 
million. The fund assists in the production of high quality 
programming in English, French and aboriginal languages for 
broadcast in prime time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian television fund is a private not for profit 
corporation, with a 16-member board of directors drawn from the 
public and private sectors. The CTF makes its decisions 
independently from government on who will receive funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation does not receive funding. 
Rather, CTF contributions go to private producers whose programs 
are licensed and broadcast by the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of funded projects by genre and by producer are posted 
to the CTF website (www.CanadianTelevision Fund.ca) and are 
published in the fund's annual report, also posted to its 
website. 2000-01 data is unavailable as the decision making 
process is still under way. Figures include all CTF numbers, 
including those administered by Telefilm Canada through its 
participation in the fund. We expect the final 1999-00 data early 
this summer when the CTF presents its annual report. Interim 
lists are on the CTF website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please find attached a table showing national and regional 
figures, financial and percentage, by province for the CTF and 
CBC-SRC triggered projects for the years 1996-97, 1997-98 and 
1998-99. This information is provided by the CTF.

<Question No. 101—<B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the new funding announced for CBC Radio: (<I>a</I>) 
how much and what percentage of the total of the new funding for 
radio went to the province of Quebec and French radio; (<I>b</I>) what 
is the percentage for CBC radio in French and CBC radio in

</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK682"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> The government provides the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation with a parliamentary appropriation to 
provide a national public television and radio broadcasting 
service for all Canadians in both official languages. This 
service is primarily Canadian in content and character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a crown corporation operating independently from government, 
the CBC is not required to provide details of its expenditures 
beyond those which are contained in the audited financial 
statements of its annual reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) The Canadian Broadcasting corporation does not break down 
its funding by province; rather its funding is allocated to 
French and English radio and television, and administrative and 
other services associated with its production, programming and 
distribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective April 1, 2000 the corporation has announced an 
increase to the base funding for its radio services of $10.2 
million. This new funding is being shared roughly 60:40 
between the English and French radio services respectively and 
will be directed at enhancing and enriching the quality of their 
program schedules as well as for new initiatives designed to 
extend CBC's radio services to more Canadians. These latter 
initiatives are currently under developement by both the English 
and French language radio services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) and (c) CBC's English and French language radio services 
have a combined annual funding platform of roughly $260 million. 
This represents close to 20% of CBC's total annual spending for 
its operations including specialty services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the $260 million spent annually on CBC's radio services, 
roughly 60% goes toward funding CBC's two English language radio 
services: Radio One and Radio Two. The remaining 40% funds La 
Première Chaîne and La Chaîne Culturelle, CBC's French language 
radio services. As a percentage of CBC's total funding package, 
therefore, this equates to close to 12% being spent on CBC's 
English language radio services and 8% begin spent on CBC's 
French language radio services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This funding relationship does not migrate much from one year to 
the next as can be seen from the following which has been 
extracted from CBC's annual reports for the respective years 
provided:

Bill C-68 as tabled in the House.  What I should 
perhaps say today is that the Liberals are alliancing 
themselves, if that is the right word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party is getting chummy with the Canadian Alliance, 
drifting to the right, I would say, because its ship literally 
veered off in that direction. 
I think it is a fundamental error for the Liberal Party to drift 
so far to the right on a bill such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as this past weekend, I read that the hon. Minister 
of Public Works, that great Liberal Party organizer in Quebec, 
the hon. member for Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, was saying that one 
of the four fundamental pillars of the next election campaign 
would be compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to understand, and I would like to hear the 
minister's explanation of how they plan to show any compassion 
when they propose to lock up young offenders as young as 12, 13 
or 14 years of age.  Where is the compassion in that?  Is that 
what compassion is?  Maybe this is the Liberal version of 
compassion.  It is not, however, the Bloc Quebecois's idea of 
compassion, nor that of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to see how my Quebec colleagues from the federal 
Liberal Party will vote on this. I am anxious to see them vote 
one by one, and to hear them explain their vote to their 
constituents. Some things are fundamental: there is a systematic 
and generalized opposition to this bill in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Coalition pour la justice des mineurs opposes it, among 
others, and it seems important to me to mention it. I will name 
all those who oppose the bill, and you will see that there are 
even people from outside Quebec who oppose it. Everyone who 
wants to defend minors in Quebec is on this list. Let us not be 
fooled. Liberal members, including members from Quebec, are 
getting ready pass this bill. It must be made clear that these 
members will vote against all the members of the coalition that 
I will mention here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the Commission des services juridiques, the Conseil 
permanent de la jeunesse, the Centrale de l'enseignement du 
Québec, Jean Trépanier, of the Criminology Faculty of the 
University of Montreal, the Community Legal Center of Montreal, 
the Fondation québécoise pour les jeunes contrevenants, the 
Institut Philippe-Pinel and the Association des directeurs de 
police et pompiers du Québec. These people are in a good 
position to know what they are talking about. They are 
constantly in contact with this type of clientele and they say 
that this bill would not work and should not be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also included on this list are the Conférence des régies 
régionales de la santé et des services sociaux, the Association 
des centres jeunesse du Québec, the Crown Prosecutors' 
Office—that is the Justice Department of Quebec—and the 
Association des CLSC et des CHSLD du Québec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also realize that they are in daily contact with these 
people and understand that what exists today in Quebec is much 
more valuable than what the minister wants to introduce and 
force down the throats of all Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marc Leblanc of the École de psychoéducation, the Regroupement 
des organismes de justice alternative du Québec, The Child 
Welfare League of Canada, The Canadian Criminal Justice 
Association, the Association des avocats de la défense du 
Québec, the Société de criminologie du Québec, Dr. Jim Hackler 
of the Department of Sociology of the University of Victoria, 
Tim Quigley of the University of Saskatchewan, Dr. Marge 
Reitsma-Street of the University of Victoria, and the British 
Columbia Criminal Justice Association are all part of the 
coalition that is telling the Minister of Justice today that she 
is headed the wrong way. Many Canadians and practically all 
Quebecers are opposed to this legislation. This is easy to 
understand because the bill before the House is strictly 
political. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before examining a bill and voting on it, we, as lawmakers, must 
first know if such a measure is needed. 
There is no need for such a drastic law in Quebec. Members need 
only look at the statistics. Youth crime is decreasing, but 
there is more to it Statistics show that the further one goes 
east the more one notes a drop in youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the youth crime rate in Quebec is lower than in 
Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. The reason is that: 
Quebecers consider the youth justice system more as a 
rehabilitation process. We have to get the young offenders back 
into society. This bill before the House does just the opposite. 
It would throw these young people in jail. And as everyone knows, 
prison is a school for crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In prison, 14 year old kids are living among older criminals for 
whom it is perhaps harder to get back into society because of 
their age. For a 40 or 50 year old man who has been a killer all 
his life, rehabilitation is less likely. Of course, Quebec will 
try to give him a chance, but the most important thing is to 
give young offenders the opportunity to redeem themselves. 
Throwing them in jail with hard core criminals would defeat the 
purpose. Statistics show that Quebec has a higher rehabilitation 
rate among young offenders because we have come to realize that 
these young people need support and supervision, not jail time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier a major coalition and all its members. But 
there is also another very important element that must be 
mentioned. 
Not one of the 125 members of the Quebec National Assembly 
supports this bill. I have here a motion I consider important 
which was adopted by the Quebec National Assembly on November 
30, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the National Assembly request that the federal Minister of 
Justice suspend the legislative process with respect to Bill C-3 
in order to make a better assessment of the implementation by 
the provinces of the measures provided for in the Young 
Offenders Act and ascertain that Quebec will be able to keep its 
strategy based on the needs of the young, with an emphasis on 
crime prevention and rehabilitation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the basic principles in the motion are rehabilitation 
and prevention. 
These notions should prevail much more frequently in our 
society. We should stop investing money to deal with just the 
consequences of crime. With the minister's proposal, we will 
have to invest a lot of additional money. It is expensive to put 
people in prison, and even more expensive when we deal with 
young offenders because, with this bill, they will probably end 
up in prison several times during their lifetime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, this does not take into account the international impact. 
There are United Nations conventions dealing with juvenile 
delinquency and the protection of children.  The government is 
totally disregarding that, because these conventions say that 
within a justice system the young person must come first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have been explaining for the last 10 minutes or so, we 
have proved that it works in Quebec.  Social reintegration is 
possible and we rehabilitate young offenders. We do not condemn 
them to be criminals for the rest of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, naturally, I will support all the amendments. 
Judging by the number of amendments on the table, it is clear 
that the bill is totally inadequate.  We have had to move 
3,000 amendments to improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us pass all these amendments. If it is not possible, we will 
definitely vote against the bill at the third reading stage. It 
is not too late for the minister, however.  It is not too late 
for my Quebec colleagues, the Liberal members from Quebec. They 
can still set an example for once and pay attention to the 
heartfelt cry of the people of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in 1993 when I first came to the House one of the first 
speeches I was able to deliver was on the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 there was a cry from the public throughout Canada to do 
something about this act which after 10 years of being in place, 
having been brought into the House in 1984, had proven to be not 
a very effective means of dealing with young people.  If a 350% 
increase in violent crimes means it was successful then there is 
something wrong with that success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My apologies to my worthy colleague.  Our colleague is 
recognized as the House expert on this subject.  I think it most 
unfortunate that we do not have a quorum here to listen to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands has called quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, here we 
are in the year 2000 and nothing has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came here in 1993 I was informed that the top priority 
at that time was the Young Offenders Act.  In fact the previous 
Minister of Justice called for a meeting with me and one of my 
colleagues to discuss the Young Offenders Act because it was such 
a high priority.  Yet it did not go anywhere.  There were 
submissions from across Canada from thousands and thousands of 
Canadians.  There were submissions from all parties in the House 
of Commons.  There was a strong cry to do something about the 
Young Offenders Act, and here we are still tinkering around with 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous justice minister did nothing.  It appeared to me 
quite obvious after a little while that the idea that the Young 
Offenders Act was top priority was nothing more than smoke and 
mirrors and just talk, because they tinkered with it and did 
nothing.  Then the new justice minister came in in 1997 and again 
it was a top priority.  What did we get?  A glossy print of a new 
thing called the youth justice system, a glossy print of 
tinkering around, not truly bringing any significant changes to 
the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then along comes the day we are to have a discussion on it, and 
we find out the act has gone through a justice committee for days 
and days, being filibustered most of the time, and nothing has 
changed in it.  It has not been amended.  It has not been changed 
at all. 
Now we are looking forward to voting this week on something like 
3,000 amendments the Bloc has presented.  The Bloc is opposed to 
this particular bill for certain reasons, but we are opposed to 
this bill for totally different reasons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing that puzzles me is the cry from the Quebec 
population, who through various polls have indicated that 70% to 
80% of them are calling for tougher measures in the Young 
Offenders Act.  They want something done but the Bloc is 
presenting the opposite.  That is not very good representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really amazes me is hearing the Liberals and the Bloc talk 
about what they are going to do with young offenders.  They spend 
minutes and then hours talking about the criminal element, the 
ones who commit the crimes.  They make no mention of the victims. 
Once again, as with all legislation regarding justice, the 
victims are shoved in the background.  The criminals are brought 
to the foreground; we talk about them and what we must do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the successful justice system we have.  That is 
the one where Karla Homolka lets herself in and out of her 
cottage and dresses up in an evening gown and has a birthday 
party.  She is able to do all the things the victims can never 
do.  Yet that is our wonderful justice system.  We must 
concentrate on Karla Homolka.  We cannot concentrate on the 
families and on the victims of these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about 10 year olds being brought before the courts and 
being run through a system to deal with the problems they have. 
The NDP and the Liberals scream, oh my goodness gracious, 10 year 
olds.  I spent 32 years in the business of working with young 
people in a schoolhouse.  Believe me, 10 and 11 year olds know 
right from wrong, as do a lot of 8 and 9 year olds, and maybe 
even younger ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a strong believer in prevention.  We had excellent programs 
for trying to detect young people at risk.  We tried to catch 
them early in life so we could deal with them properly and 
through the right channels, in the hope that we could prevent 
them from ever entering the crime scene.  There are two fine 
towns in my riding, Strathmore and Airdrie, that have excellent 
youth justice committees.  They are working hard to prevent crime 
and help these people, but we need legislation.  When someone 
crosses the line and prevention methods do not work, something 
has to be done.  What is that something to be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the suggestion that we should listen to the United 
Nations, the wonderful United Nations that says we have to learn 
to teach people to be more sensitive, that we have to sensitize 
our children.  Maybe we have to sensitize them to Hollywood and 
to TV and all the violence that goes on there.  I do not know 
what the United Nations means by saying that we have to sensitize 
our children to all of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole problem is getting worse, not better.  All the 
rhetoric and all the reports they talk about do not indicate at 
all that it is getting better, yet the government claims it is 
doing a wonderful job.  It is not happening.  It is now 2000. 
Since 1993 it has gotten worse.  It continues to get worse. 
Nothing is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read into the record a letter that I received from 
Theresa McCuaig.  She is the grandmother of Sylvain Leduc. 
Members may remember the terrible tragedy that took place in 
Ottawa.  She says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with other family members victims of horrific youth crimes, 
on three separate occasions we have addressed the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights concerning youth crimes. 
I truly wonder if anyone knows how difficult and embarrassing it 
is, to sit in front of a group of strangers to share our ugly 
stories and the grief we feel over our murdered and maimed 
children. 
Did you know that as we walk into that room, we are filled with 
hope that the people we are addressing will hear us and make our 
world right again?  We do not ask for much, simply the protection 
of future victims and hopefully some justice for them.  We 
sometimes cry and tremble inside as we re-live the horrors of our 
children's pain or death for you.  We feel like we're begging for 
the common sense changes needed to our unjust laws.  At the time, 
we feel soothed and are impressed that you, our government 
members, actually take the time to hear us.  We leave the room 
tapping each other on the back, convinced that what we've said 
will really make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I've followed the committee's progress, watching its members 
working hard in preparing their many recommendations to the new 
youth justice act.  I was impressed with their hard work and was 
appalled that the committee was given only 10 hours to debate 
their recommendations.  Apparently no one cared to hear what we 
had to say.  Regrettably, none of us were heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all its inadequacies the new youth justice act will be 
debated this week.  I'm told that those who have grave concerns 
will debate it forcefully.  Regardless, I know in my heart that 
the act will be passed simply because those who oppose it are 
outnumbered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among we insignificant `little people' it is whispered that the 
bill is quickly being pushed through to make it look good for the 
upcoming election that will soon be announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, I suggest you do not bother asking victims to come 
humiliate themselves by testifying in front of the justice 
committee.  The resulting pain and disappointment added to our 
great grief are just too difficult to live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that our testimony had about as much impact on our 
government as our victim impact statements have in the courtroom. 
None! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the members of the justice committee who have worked so hard 
on this bill, I offer you my heartfelt sympathy and can appreciate 
your great disillusionment and disappointment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

contempt for the House, as they usually do.  I would ask for a 
quorum, please.

I begin my speeches by saying that I am pleased to speak on an 
important bill.  This time, although it is an important bill, I 
am not at all pleased to speak to it.  Why?  Because this bill 
is an aberration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is in a much greater hurry to go after 14 year 
olds than organized crime. 
How long have my colleagues from Berthier—Montcalm and 
Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert along with the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois and all its members been fighting for more effective 
measures against organized crime and reinforcement of the 
criminal code more consistent than the reinforcement and 
amendments to it in 1997?  They are fighting for real anti-gang 
legislation and, if necessary, the use of the notwithstanding 
clause.  Well, no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the House they are hedging because they are 
not interested in going after the real criminals.  Pursuing the 
real criminals does not necessarily bring in votes.  However, 
pursuing young children and thereby meeting the demands of the 
former Reform Party, now comprised of Alliance members, is more 
profitable. 
They think they will be able to win more seats in the west in 
the next election with a certain right-looking vision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, the Liberals are completely overlooking one thing, 
namely the well-being of teenagers and their ability to be 
rehabilitated and returned to society. The Liberals are 
advocating caning, not rehabilitation for these young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During oral question period, I was surprised to hear the 
minister say that some members have tried to distort the debate. 
She was referring to opposition members, particularly Bloc 
Quebecois members. 
I remind the minister that she was the first one to distort the 
discussion by turning a deaf ear to the consensus throughout 
this debate and by moving over 200 amendments without having had 
the courage to defend her bill and the 200 amendments that she 
moved in the House a few months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, who is doing an 
extraordinary job on this issue, managed to achieve a consensus 
among Quebec's major stakeholders in the area of young 
offenders' rehabilitation. He invited the minister many times to 
appear before the justice committee, precisely to justify the 
thrust that she was giving to the new young offenders 
legislation. But the minister declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone has been distorting the discussion since Bill C-3 was 
first introduced, but it is the Minister of Justice herself. 
She has ignored everything.  Above all, and we will not let this 
drop, she has ignored the needs of troubled adolescents. 
Instead of a bill that addresses needs, there is a call for 
caning.  Needs are no longer important to the Liberal 
government.  The needs of a 14-year old adolescent who has lost 
his way are no longer important.  What is important is throwing 
him in jail.  That is important for winning western votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about the flexibility in the bill.  I have 
read and reread it and listened to all the explanations of the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, for whom I have tremendous respect, 
as well as of all those who spoke to this bill.  There is no 
flexibility, and one of those who offered his opinion was a 
spokesperson for the Coalition québécoise d'opposition au 
nouveau projet de loi sur les jeunes contrevenants.  He said, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces' supposed flexibility in enforcing the legislation 
is no more than a series of limited powers dependent on the 
crown attorneys. Nowhere in this bill is it stated that the 
provinces may implement their own model. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for flexibility.  Furthermore, it is very strange that a 
government wants to change its young offenders legislation, 
which works when properly enforced.  Extraordinary results can 
be achieved with the existing legislation, when it is properly 
enforced.  If there is one place in Canada where the Young 
Offenders Act is being so enforced, it is Quebec.  In Quebec, we 
have had the best results of all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1991, the youth crime rate has dropped 23%. Quebec has its 
lowest youth crime rate in 20 years. We also have the lowest 
indictment rate, the lowest conviction rate and the lowest 
custody rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes to show that when the Young Offenders Act is enforced 
properly, when the focus is on rehabilitation and on the needs 
of young offenders, it works. It works very well and we have 
proved it. And in those places where the act was not enforced 
properly, the results are totally the opposite of what we have 
seen in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look, for example, at the situation in Saskatchewan, 
Ontario and New Brunswick. 
It is incredible. The conviction rate and the custody rate per 
100,000 inhabitants show that the Young Offenders Act was not 
enforced properly. Those provinces have conviction rates and 
custody rates that are considerably higher than the national 
average. Their rates are very high compared to what they are in 
Quebec. All the stakeholders in Quebec think this bill is 
useless and extremely dangerous. 
As far as reintegration is concerned, this bill is way off the 
mark.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference is made in this bill to publishing the identity of 
offenders. How can one think that publishing the names of young 
offenders will help them re-enter into the community? For one 
thing, does publication not make the illegal act committed look 
good in the eyes of other young people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we, while claiming to want to help them and meet some of 
their needs and talking about social reintegration, allow young 
people to see their reputations tarnished by having their 
identity published and whatever offence they committed be 
glamourized, so to speak, in the eyes of their peers? 
It was totally unacceptable to introduce such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, most of those who condemned the Liberal government's 
behaviour said the bill was so complicated that, even if one 
were in agreement with it, it would be an extremely difficult 
bill to enforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the bar association's recent brief indicated the 
following—which confirms what I said earlier—on page 63: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of clause 41 and the following clauses is so complex 
that experts had tremendous difficulty understanding those 
clauses. They have to be rewritten, because it must be 
remembered that this legislation is addressed to adolescents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Quebec bar association experts have difficulty interpreting 
what the minister means and, moreover, there is a solid 
consensus in Quebec to the effect that this is a bad piece of 
legislation, we have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm asked for an opting out 
provision, whereby a province would be able to opt out with full 
compensation, so that Quebec, which properly enforced the Young 
Offenders Act and which achieved spectacular results with the 
rehabilitation of young offenders, could eventually be fully 
exempt from these new provisions and continue to use an approach 
that has so far given such good results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister rejected that request from the coalition, from all 
the major stakeholders in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, as I said, youth crime has continuously been dropping over 
the past 20 years, and in Quebec in particular we have achieved 
incredible success, with the result that our youth crime rate is 
now much lower than elsewhere in Canada, because we did things 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respected the spirit of the Young Offenders Act, whose 
purpose is not to marginalize young offenders for the rest of 
their lives by dragging them before adult courts without any 
consideration and without taking their needs into account. 
Rather, we looked at the alternative and tried, whenever 
possible, and most of the time it is possible, to rehabilitate 
young offenders and return them to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke about unanimity in Quebec, I should have mentioned 
that the supreme court also voiced the opinion that the Young 
Offenders Act should not be seen as the counterpart of adult 
criminal laws.  Even Mr. Justice Antonio Lamer made this point, 
and emphasized that the Young Offenders Act took into account 
the very specific needs of adolescents and that it was not 
necessary for a new law to be the mirror image of the criminal 
laws for adult offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a coalition in Quebec, which has made representations 
to the minister, with the assistance of the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, using shock arguments, arguments set out in 
the documents of the Minister of Justice, which show beyond a 
shadow of a doubt that, if the Young Offenders Act is properly 
enforced, no rod is necessary.  We do not need a new act. 
The one we have is fine.  It needs to be properly enforced, but 
it should not be used for electioneering, as the minister is now 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the House will approve our amendments, that the 
minister will listen to reason or that the government will 
ensure that this bill dies on the Order Paper before a federal 
election is called.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, again we are in the House talking about the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we first arrived here in 1993, I remember the hon. member 
for Wild Rose mentioning that one of the big reasons we came here 
was to see what the government was doing in regard to young 
offenders.  It seems to go on forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can throw blame and shift it around all we want. I just 
listened to the member from Quebec state that all we believe in 
is the whipping post.  He said that Quebec instituted legislation 
that that works really well.  Well, according to 77% of 
Quebecers, particularly those who have been victims of the Young 
Offenders Act, they want the act toughened up a whole bunch.  I 
would bet, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it is at least 77% in 
the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the government, time after time, stand in the 
House and say that its number one priority is for the safety and 
well-being of law-abiding citizens but time after time it has 
failed the law-abiding citizens. The Young Offenders Act is just 
the tip of an example of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons for this.  One of the significant causes 
for the failure of the Young Offenders Act and youth criminal 
justice is the lack of significant funding to properly deal with 
young offenders.  There is a federal-provincial agreement to 
split the costs 50:50 for youth justice. Under the Constitution 
Act, 1867 the federal government is responsible for the criminal 
law through section 91.  Through section 92 the provinces are 
responsible for the administration of the criminal law.  Much 
like this government's shenanigans with health care, it has been 
playing games with young offenders funding.  Rather than 
maintaining its 50% responsibility, the federal government has 
been slowly allowing its participation to erode to the extent 
that recent estimates of its contribution places it closer to 20% 
to 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will argue that it recently allotted an 
additional $206 million toward youth justice.  However, as is 
typical of the government, particularly the present finance 
minister, figures are always used to make larger numbers.  Let us 
take a look.  The $206 million is over three years.  That is less 
than $70 million a year.  Those funds do not cover the present 
shortfall in funding to the provinces and they will not cover the 
additional cost of this new piece of legislation.  Again the 
government comes out with numbers that do not match reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government, as we have had governments before, saying 
“We will be the parent.  We will look after your children”. How 
it did this was by forcing both parents out to work.  When that 
happened the children had nobody at home to look after them when 
they came home from school.  The name that was used for them, and 
I think is still used, was “latchkey kids”.  Where have our 
young people been learning while their parents were working?  Was 
it in the parks?  Yes, they have learned very well how to shoot 
dope, how to pull break and enters and, in some cases, assault, 
and they have learned how to rob.  When the parents decided to 
crack down and put some law and order and discipline into their 
lives the government stepped down on the parents.  The government 
has has taken the rights of parents through something called the 
charter of rights for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old saying “You reap what you sow”.  This is what 
we get.  We have young offenders now who know they will get away 
with just about anything. 
They will serve soft time if they serve time at all.  The most 
they will probably get is probation and, in many cases, not abide 
by it.  I say this because I have talked to students at various 
schools.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people in grades 7, 8 and 9 have said to me “Mr. Stinson, 
we are afraid to go to school, afraid to go out at night and 
afraid to hang around with our friends because of the gangs that 
intimidate us.  They take our clothes when we go to school and 
our lunches because they know nothing will happen to them”. 
There will be no severe penalty and probably no penalty at all. 
We have case after case of repeat young offenders going into 
different communities.  Why?  Because the public is not allowed 
to know their names.  They are protected. Our neighbours do not 
even know what their children are up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wild Rose quoted letters from victims who 
classified themselves as insignificant little people.  When they 
came as witnesses before the committee they felt abused by their 
own politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have to wonder exactly what we were put in this place to 
do when we have people going out of committee feeling that way. 
Something has to be done.  We have tried study after study. We 
have listened to what I like to call the bleeding hearts of 
Canada tell us that soft love works and yet violent offences by 
youth are up 365%.  Same on the government members who sit on the 
other side and say that their programs work when we have a 365% 
increase in violent offences by young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B>  Where? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  The member from Quebec asks, 
“Where?”.  That is a good question.  Where does it work, as 
members are sitting around their tables?  I have to 
wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a quick look at what is happening today.  We hear 
government members saying that 15 and 16 year olds are not adults 
and that 10 and 11 year olds do not know right from wrong. We all 
know full well that 14, 15 and 16 year olds know exactly what 
they are doing when they commit a violent act.  We know that and 
yet we want to keep going down the same old road of doing nothing 
and studying the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak to a personal experience I had before entering 
politics.  My mother had the unfortunate experience of being 
stabbed and left for dead by a 14 year old and his 15 year old 
sister.  They were caught and had to go before the court.  The 
court asked them what had motivated them since there was no 
robbery and no intent.  Their answer to the court was “Who 
cares?”  That is the attitude that is out there. We have a very 
small minority of young offenders saying  “Who cares and even if 
I do care what are you going to do about it because the laws 
protect me and not the victim”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began my speech today saying that the government's first and 
foremost responsibility was for the safety and well-being of its 
law-abiding citizens. 
Who needs our help and protection more than the young people of 
Canada?  Who needs our help more than those 6, 7, 8 or 
9 year olds who want to walk to school in safety and are 
afraid of children their own age or just a little bit older 
because our system does not have the penalties which those 
predators of our children deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, at the request of our justice 
critic, the member for Berthier—Montcalm, who for the past few 
years in this House has been trying to make sure that pieces of 
legislation dealing with young offenders are the best, and in 
keeping with the fact that young people are not the criminals 
they are believed to be in some parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I would like to remind the member who spoke 
before me of a few statistics he is trying to hide because, 
somehow, he agrees with the government's approach, which is not 
based on a fair and reasonable appreciation of what is really 
going on across Canada, especially in Quebec, and which shows to 
what extent the reform brought about by the justice minister and 
her government is purely political and is a vote-seeking 
initiative. It seems that it will have to be implemented before 
an election is called, which looks like it could be very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's very own statistics, which appear in a fact sheet 
dated March 1999, show for instance that between 1991 and 1997, 
the charge rate for young people dropped by 25%, and that the 
charge rate for violent crimes among youth has decreased by 3.2% 
since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the most recent statistics, the crime rate fell for 
the sixth consecutive year in 1997. The 5% drop resulted in the 
lowest police-reported crime rate since 1980. This decrease 
applies to most offences, including violent crimes which 
seemingly would justify a tougher approach and legislation, 
especially sexual assault, for which the rate fell by nearly 1%, 
robbery, which dropped 8%, and homicide 9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent youth crime is still on the decline. Fewer charges are 
laid, yet the government wants to pass new legislation and get 
rid of the Young Offenders Act; it actually wants to repeal it 
even though it has proven to be effective when implemented 
properly, like the Government of Quebec has done in recent 
years, and when a real effort is made to show the kind of 
compassion the courts and those responsible for enforcing 
legislation passed by parliaments to deal with young offenders 
ought to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the Bloc Quebecois tried to stop and will 
continue its fight to stop the federal government from passing 
legislation that, according to all stakeholders in Quebec, will 
in no way solve the problems nor help those who must not only 
sentence young people, but also try to rehabilitate them and 
facilitate their social reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has succeeded in creating awareness among all 
stakeholders dealing with young offenders. Not one of these 
stakeholders supports this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, all groups joined in a coalition around our 
party to indicate to the minister that this legislation should 
be withdrawn, that it is not good for Quebec or the rest of 
Canada and that, as it is, the existing Young Offenders Act 
meets our needs and provides the necessary tools to prevent 
youth crime or to ensure that crimes are punished and that 
rehabilitation and social reintegration of young offenders are 
not threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of all Canadians and especially of young 
offenders, the Bloc Quebecois will continue to plead for this 
legislation to be withdrawn or at least for it to provide an 
opting out clause, since not only the players I mentioned 
earlier and my colleague from Saint-Jean listed oppose the bill, 
but all Quebec MNAs unanimously adopted a resolution to that 
effect. They all wanted to indicate to the government that they 
do not want this legislation to apply to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sense, the right for Quebec to opt out would be a lesser 
evil if, as some members say, Canadians they represent elsewhere 
in Canada want stricter and more restrictive legislation for 
young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purpose of this debate, I would like to add a more 
personal note that I find interesting as an international law 
professor. The bill itself makes reference in its preamble—I am 
referring to one of the preamble's last paragraphs—to the fact 
that Canada is a party to the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. Since Canada has ratified that convention, 
the bill must meet Canada's obligations stated in the 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convention forces member states to get Canada to make a 
commitment to the international community as a whole, as this 
convention is one of the few treaties to have been signed and 
ratified by almost all the members of the international 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 180 of the 191 states, within the international 
community, have ratified the treaty. 
Canada appears to be ignoring one of this treaty's basic 
provisions that says that one of the most important 
considerations in any decision concerning children, and also 
teenagers who are still children, is the best interests of the 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, this bill does not seem headed that way, since it 
focuses more on the protection of society, which should not be 
neglected of course, on the protection of victims, than on the 
best interests of the child, a notion that has the same 
importance in our human rights law as in international 
conventions, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I would like to remind hon. members that 
article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the 
Child which codified the rule of best interest of the child is 
one which Canada has invoked specifically, claiming that the 
Young Offenders Act respected that principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child reminded 
Canada, when it tabled one of its reports on the application of 
the convention, that the principle of best interests of the 
child should be better reflected in Canadian internal 
legislation.  This is far from the case with this piece of 
legislation we have before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that I finish my presentation.  I would like to 
point out in closing that in the Jasmin report in Quebec—a 
totally remarkable report on young offenders—within and beyond 
the law, an appendix titled “Adolescence, from turbulence to 
independence” concludes with the words of a psychologist, 
Louisiane Gauthier, which are very much worthwhile quoting to 
this tribunal of the people that is parliament: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the time a child leaves his mother's body until he becomes 
a member of the social body, the identity he will construct for 
himself will reflect the significant adults whom he encounters. 
These adults, by the authority of membership in the generation 
of those who begat him, are the beacons that light the way for 
the child, through their kindnesses, their mores and their 
rules.  Adults provide him with the ability to respond to the 
major questions encountered in life. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House are adults, let us act as adults.  Let us give 
precedence to the best interests of the child.  Let us not pass 
this legislation which this government wishes to have us pass.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand and contribute 
to the debate this afternoon on Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was interesting that when the minister responded to 
a question today she said that the Young Offenders Act had been 
under debate for the past two years.  I thought she must 
have been sleeping in the 35th Parliament.  The debate on the 
Young Offenders Act was one of the first things we dealt 
with when we entered the House in January 1994.  There had been a 
nationwide request for submissions on the Young Offenders Act in 
the late fall of 1993 and the justice committee tried to move 
that agenda forward in the 35th Parliament.  I believe we were 
successful only in forcing the federal government to bring a very 
weak piece of legislation at the time into the House which dealt 
with nothing that was identified by Canadians as a problem with 
the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that Bill C-3 is another lackluster attempt by 
the federal government to deal with the concern of Canadians with 
the Young Offenders Act and its inability to deal with the 
changes in our society and where young people find themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just adult Canadians who have identified the problems 
with the Young Offenders Act.  It is the young people who have 
indicated to my colleagues and to myself that they do not feel at 
all protected by the Young Offenders Act.  There is no 
significant penalty being paid by young people who choose to live 
a life that is less than desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sympathize with the Bloc in that Quebec does have a much 
better system for early intervention than we will find anywhere 
else in the country.  Early intervention is certainly not 
something that replaces the Young Offenders Act.  It is something 
that should work with the Young Offenders Act.  It is something 
that should continue to be used and supported in the province of 
Quebec and hopefully in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia we have a program in a number 
of communities that deals with first time offenders or young 
people who show that they are getting into the wrong choices. 
Two of the communities in my riding have that program.  The 
process is to bring them into the program for counselling, to 
work with the parents and their schools and to try to give these 
young people, who have made a bad choice or perhaps got mixed up 
with the wrong group of friends, an opportunity to change the 
direction in which they are going without having a criminal 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what a young offender act is all about.  A young 
offender act, although it can deal with some of these alternative 
measures for first time offenders and for young people who are 
not criminal in nature or who are not going to be repeat 
offenders, should have other ways to deal with that.  A young 
offender act deals with young people who have chosen to go in a 
direction that is not acceptable to society.  They need to know 
very strongly and very clearly that their actions are not 
acceptable and there is a penalty to pay to behave that way.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has not happened in the past.  With the present Young 
Offenders Act under which we now operate there is not a clear 
definition of what a young person can get away with.  I think 
young people are asking for that clear definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government has brought in a piece of legislation 
that does not give those kinds of clear definitions.  I have 
noticed that again there is a reluctance to understand there are 
11 year olds in society who are part of the group of young people 
that have chosen to violate the law and do things that are 
abhorrent to society.  Unfortunately those 11 year olds are not 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government thinks that they are dealt with under the 
social services and child protection acts of the provinces, 
surely the statistics out there would indicate that is not the 
case.  The provincial governments do not have the resources or 
the ability to make sure those young people get appropriate 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been brought to my attention over the course of this 
debate that the federal government has once again reneged on its 
commitment to fund the services for young offenders to 50%.  If 
the federal government is to bring in legislation that puts the 
onus on the provinces to deliver a service with the understanding 
that there would be financial contributions of up to 50% of cost, 
why does it never meet that commitment?  Whether it is in health 
or the young offenders act, why is the federal government not 
meeting a commitment it is making to the provinces to fulfil an 
obligation that is there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these young people are brought into the system and are 
treated, perhaps we will not have an increase of 360-odd per cent 
of violent offences by young people.  If a young person breaks 
the law repeatedly, does not pay any significant price for doing 
so and then goes back into the school environment holding himself 
up as a tough dude who will continue that kind of behaviour, why 
would we expect anything different? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House and others in society are asking 
for the government to acknowledge that there are young people out 
there who need substantial support because they do not mean to be 
doing whatever it is they are doing and are being led astray. 
There are also some young people out there who are not nice and 
whose intentions are not to be good citizens of society.  Those 
young people also have to be brought into a system where they 
know what will happen to them, what the lines are and what the 
punishment will be.  It has to be substantial enough that they 
change the direction in which they are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious to many of us when we see what happens in 
society.  If young people are not given opportunities to 
readdress where they are going with educational opportunities, 
counselling or whatever they might need when they are young 
offenders, chances are they will be in the system when they are 
adults.  We have seen it.  Anyone who has had any exposure to the 
prison system has seen that many individuals in that system 
started at a young age and were young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of it is because they never had to pay when they were 
young people.  The concern we have in the House is that we are 
not distinguishing between young people who make a bad choice and 
violent offenders.  In this piece of legislation there is 
reference to alternative sentencing, which means something other 
than incarceration, being applicable to violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw in the sentencing legislation brought down under the 
criminal code a couple of years ago that violent offenders are 
now being given alternative sentences, which means something 
other than incarceration, and put back or left out in society 
because there was not a clear definition in the legislation which 
said a violent offender should be treated differently than an 
ordinary non-violent offender. 
The legislation for young offenders allows that same abuse of the 
system.

not working in the adult system.  Why would we repeat the same 
mistake in the Young Offenders Act when we have identified that 
mistake in adult legislation in the criminal code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there may be the odd provision in the legislation that 
is supportable, for the most part it should not supportable by 
individuals in the House.  It is another weak attempt by the 
Liberal government to brush the issue aside and say that it has 
dealt with it.  We will be revisiting the same issue, mark my 
words, in another couple of years because the government has not 
addressed it any more now than it did in 1995-96 when it brought 
in its previous legislation on the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be nice if the government would be a little more 
willing to listen to the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee giving constructive suggestions and if it would listen 
to opposition members and actually do something meaningful to 
readdress the Young Offenders Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is a 
correction to the Speaker's ruling regarding report stage of Bill 
C-3.  Earlier this day the Chair delivered its ruling on the

youth criminal justice act, and explained that a further decision 
would be forthcoming on the voting pattern for each of the 
motions in all groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the Chair neglected to mention that Motion No. 123, 
standing in the name of the hon. member for

Governor General.

<P><A NAME="LINK697"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to speak to a bill which impacts on society as a whole and Quebec 
society in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the various speeches, it is obvious that we are far from 
achieving any consensus as far as the application of Bill C-3 is 
concerned. The Canadian Alliance would like to go further and the 
government is proposing a bill without allowing us to express 
ourselves freely on the impacts of this bill on society as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so sad to see how much the government is playing party 
politics, how it is using all of its powers to ram through a bill 
that is absolutely not adapted to the solutions and the position 
of Quebec. It is a bill which has not been studied and has not 
received the support of several groups in Quebec, a bill which 
runs counter to the objective of decreasing the crime rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bill that should be the object of some very strong 
speeches to explain to the public the impact of the application 
of such a bill in Quebec. Those opposed to it in Quebec see this 
as a useless and dangerous bill, which has no positive effect as 
far as the reduction of the crime rate is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, the solutions for returning to society a youth who has 
committed a violent crime are to make sure that this youth is 
able to reintegrate into the community, based on our assessment 
of his needs.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister wants to restore public confidence in the youth 
justice system. I have doubts as to the minister's objective 
because, to obtain a few votes in the next election, she is 
bowing to demands in her own riding instead of taking into 
consideration the effects this bill will have on youth in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts from Quebec, people on the front lines who are fighting 
against youth crime, have criticised this bill. One only has to 
think of criminologists, social workers, police forces, lawyers 
and the Coalition pour la justice des mineurs. This coalition is 
made up of 22 associations or individuals such as le Conseil 
permanent de la jeunesse, la Centrale de l'enseignement du 
Québec, le Centre communautaire juridique de Montréal, la 
Fondation québécoise pour les jeunes contrevenants, Institut 
Philippe Pinel, l'Association des chefs de police et pompiers, la 
Conférence des régies régionales de la santé et des services 
sociaux, l'Association des centres jeunesse du Québec, 
l'Association des CLSC et des CHSLD du Québec, Marc Leblanc of 
the École de psycho-éducation de l'Université de Montréal, the 
Regroupement des organismes de justice, the Canadian Criminal 
Justice Association and the Société des criminologues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could name a lot more who are saying no to the minister and to 
her project, because it is does not carry unanimity, and 
especially because it goes against the objectives of Quebec, that 
being the rehabilitation of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, as had been said, has no interest in a repressive 
approach such as the one favoured by the New Canadian Alliance, 
the former Reformers. A change of name does not mean a change of 
mind. The Bloc Quebecois wants to explain these facts to the 
population, because some have said that the justice system is 
ineffective. The statistics for Quebec are very clear: the law is 
enforced and the crime rate has fallen rather than risen. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The animals seem to have escaped from the zoo.  Could we 
have a quorum count, please? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I should not have 
recognized the hon. member because he is obviously not in his 
seat.  What took place a moment ago did not actually take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to point out that I would not have responded to 
a quorum call in any event.  While we can certainly ask for a 
quorum call, I do not think it is appropriate to refer to hon. 
members in any circumstance in a deprecating way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, we did note the absence of 
the members across the way, government members who do not seem to 
be concerned. Those Liberal members from Quebec are not here to 
defend the situation in Quebec regarding the implementation of 
Bill C-3. We will remind them of this fact during the election 
campaign. We see them applauding the decision of the Minister of 
Justice to act in a totally inadmissible way through the 
introduction of Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, this bill has not garnered unanimous support and it 
does not take into consideration the different actors in criminal 
justice and in the area of young offenders rehabilitation. They 
want to lower the age from 16 to 14 years and Reformers would 
like to reduce that from 14 to 12 years and drag these young 
people before a tribunal for adults. These children rather need 
guides in society in order to be rehabilitated. We all know that 
an adult criminal eventually goes back into society after having 
spent some time behind the bars.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at the type of rehabilitation offered to those who 
do not have an acceptable behaviour, whether they have committed 
violent or non-violent crimes. This does not mean that we accept 
the kind of crime they have committed, but I believe we should 
give them a chance to return to society. Otherwise, it would mean 
that we would be keeping them behind bars all their life for the 
crimes they have committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Alliance say that society must show its 
disapproval of these people by punishing them more harshly. 
To send young people to prison where they meet more hardened 
criminals, without giving any thought to their rehabilitation, 
is like sticking one's head in the sand and not see that the 
individual will be released shortly and have to live in and deal 
with society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this young person has not had all the support he or she needs 
to behave appropriately in life then society has to have some 
concern for their rehabilitation.  The young person must not be 
further marginalized.  We must look instead at the adolescent's 
urgent needs so we can provide some help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we know about personalizing treatment.  We have to 
talk about this.  How do we help a young person who has committed 
an offence?  After committing the offence, the young person must 
undergo a process of rehabilitation.  The bill does not permit 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a young person appears before an adult court, 
the period before sentencing would be too long.  It is a fact 
that this period is vital to the individual's rehabilitation. 
There is a very long time, as we know, between the time of 
proceedings and of sentencing.  The young person could easily 
divorce himself from his offence.  There is no agreement on the 
approach proposed by Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, the face of juvenile justice will gradually 
change with the new principles.  The minister should have looked 
at the impact of the way the Young Offenders Act is applied in 
Quebec and the drop in the crime rate.  We know that Quebec sets 
the example in the treatment of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of briefs were submitted by, among others, the 
Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la 
jeunesse. These briefs point out that it is dangerous to treat 
minors like adults and that rehabilitation will become 
increasingly difficult for a young person who has committed an 
act of violence, which is certainly reprehensible, but whom we 
should nevertheless try to rehabilitate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister refuses to budge. She did not allow us to review 
the full impact of this legislation. It is regrettable that, 
today, we must oppose this bill so strongly to show how this is 
not the right way to do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While she may appear to be flexible, the minister is not at all 
flexible regarding the implementation of this bill. Things will 
be done on a case by case basis. Young people in particular will 
not get adequate help on time to be rehabilitated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes a series of limited powers held by crown 
attorneys. This is not what Quebec had hoped for. Quebec was in 
favour of including an opting out clause, to allow us to proceed 
the way we already do in the area of youth crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-3, the youth 
criminal justice act.  I am pleased because it matters to the 
people of my riding of Prince Albert. 
They are concerned about youth crime and about this legislation. 
They are concerned.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a federal penitentiary in the city of Prince Albert.  We 
have at least three other provincial jails in the riding.  People 
know about youth crime, adult crime, all kinds of crime, crime 
committed by people on parole who should not be on parole, the 
whole gamut.  It affects my riding a lot, so I am pleased to have 
this opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is meant to replace the Young Offenders Act, as we all 
know, but that act is so bad that it has been characterized by 
the Minister of Justice herself as “easily the most unpopular 
piece of federal legislation”.  This legislation, after it comes 
into effect, will probably get the same title.  It will be right 
in there with the firearms legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government announced a new youth criminal justice act, 
it claimed it would be a top priority.  Yet it has taken five 
years for the government to get this legislation to second 
reading, let alone to committee, report stage, third reading and 
proclamation.  If that is a priority, I do not know how the 
government would characterize anything less than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the youths for whom this legislation was crafted are no 
longer youths.  They are already into the adult system.  They 
have had no help from this legislation at all, as if it would 
help.  Not only has it taken five years to get here, but all of 
the problems the Alliance has pointed out along the way are still 
in there.  It comes with all those glaring weaknesses.  It pleads 
for meaningful amendment, not what the Bloc envisages, which 
would simply be to return to the old Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance anticipates that the time spent here on 
debate and on amendments at report stage and at third reading 
will be thoroughly wasted, as the governing Liberals appear to be 
deaf to any reasoned arguments to make changes.  There are 
reasons I say this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How have the Liberals handled this piece of legislation to date? 
First of all, Bill C-3 contains very little of what witnesses 
presented during the 1996 and 1997 justice committee hearings. 
After almost a full year before the committee and after a 
significant number of testimonies from witnesses, the committee 
referred the bill back to the House without a single word 
changed, if one can imagine that.  The time and effort the 
members of the justice committee spent listening to the witness 
presentations and preparing amendments for committee were 
thoroughly wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most significant causes of failure of the Young 
Offenders Act and youth criminal justice to date is insufficient 
funding to properly deal with young offenders. There is a 
federal-provincial agreement to deal with that; it is 50:50. They 
are supposed to split the cost of youth justice, with the federal 
government picking up half and the provinces covering half.  The 
federal government is responsible for criminal law through 
section 91 of the constitution.  Section 92 gives provinces the 
responsibility for administration of criminal law. Rather than 
maintain its responsibility, the federal government has been 
slowly permitting its participation to erode.  Recent estimates 
of its contribution place the amount in the range of 20% to 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those in the health field will find this a familiar story.  The 
government will argue that it recently allotted an additional 
$206 million toward youth justice, but that $206 million is over 
how long?  Three years.  That is less than $70 million a year, 
and that amount does not cover the present shortfall in funding 
to the provinces and will not cover the cost of this new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we turn to the legislation itself, we see that uniformity 
of youth justice right across Canada is at risk with this bill. 
Before the Young Offenders Act we had the Juvenile Delinquents 
Act.  One of the major criticisms of that act was that it 
permitted the provinces to vary the way in which they operated 
within the criminal law process.  If a young person commits a 
crime just over the provincial border, that young person may find 
himself in a more difficult situation or an easier situation just 
because of the location of the crime.  That does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the complaints about and criticism of the proposed 
youth legislation, primarily if not solely by the Bloc, Bill C-3 
permits many of the problems of the Juvenile Delinquents Act to 
return to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no adjustment of the age categories.  Youths of 
10 or 11 years old who commit crime are still not to be held 
responsible for their actions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it clear that the Canadian Alliance has never 
advocated locking up all 10 and 11 year old offenders.  What we 
are saying is put them in a system so that the courts can review 
the circumstances and decide the proper method of getting each 
young person who is in trouble back on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to leave young offenders to child 
welfare, and often the welfare authorities do not have the 
resources to properly deal with children in desperate straits. 
Some violent children cannot be controlled without more serious 
and professional treatment facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Saturday night in my riding I spoke with a young father who 
is just frustrated to death with the youth criminal justice 
system.  He is at his wits' end.  Parents cannot even force their 
12 year olds to be accountable to them.  If the courts do not 
deal with them properly and have the proper resources, if the 
parents do not have any authority and social services let them 
go, what is the result?  It is a young person who has too much 
authority, no idea of accountability, and no one to account to 
for his or her actions or for even what the courts lay out as 
steps to get this kid back on track.  It just is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance and many Canadians believe a younger age 
would be an age where the best opportunity for rehabilitation 
could take place.  It will not occur, however, if there is no 
accountability for that age group, just as this father said. This 
is the age group that could be helped the most if they were 
included in the legislation.  This would be real, authentic 
rehabilitation, and it would place young offenders into programs 
that could have a positive impact on their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a side benefit, and this father also made this point, it 
would identify homes where children are not being given the love, 
support, and structure they need to develop into law-abiding 
citizens.  In fact it was his contention that neglect is a form 
of abuse.  They could get the help they need when they need it 
and where they need it.  Should that not be the desire of 
everyone here?  Our official opposition justice critic has 
pointed out that society is not being protected and that this 
piece of legislation will just change nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a look at crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds, we 
see it is a huge problem.  This age group constituted over 70,000 
of the 135,157 cases heard before the courts between 1991 and 
1996.  That amounts to well over half the juvenile cases.  Of 
those cases, one might expect to see a significant number raised 
to adult court, but actually only 385 cases were heard in adult 
court.  Perhaps more significantly, only eight of the 163 charged 
with murder were transferred out of the juvenile system.  Should 
not this government, should not any government, be making a 
serious effort to address the particular problem in the 
legislation it brings to the House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will give the minister a little credit.  She seems to have 
taken note of first time non-violent offenders in this 
legislation, and for that we are grateful. However it is 
difficult to understand why she chose not to exclude repeat and 
violent offenders from lesser forms of punishment.  Young people 
who appear before the courts on a regular basis, who are regular 
clients, need to be dealt with in a serious manner to impress 
upon them the fact that society does not condone their actions. 
This is an issue we will have to deal with.  We can deal with it 
here and now before the bill is enacted, or we can wait for the 
consequences in society and then deal with it here later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the central message of this piece of legislation 
we see that preventing crime, meaningful consequences for 
criminal actions, rehabilitation of the offender and 
reintegration into society are the principles of the bill.  The 
first principle alone could keep a person speaking all day.  We 
could talk about why kids get in trouble with the law in the 
first place.  It has been studied endlessly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read in the declaration of principles, subparagraph 
3(1)(a)(i): “preventing crime by addressing the circumstances 
underlying a young person's offending behaviour”.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the crux of this piece of legislation.  We are looking 
for accountability and responsibility for an individual's actions 
on society.  The main point is accountability and we are not 
seeing it in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What made the Young Offenders Act unpopular in the first place 
continues in the new bill.  We can hear members muttering about 
that over there.  The final word is that the bill will not serve 
those for whom we believe it was written. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK699"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-3, which deals with 
young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important bill because we must never lose sight of 
the fact that it deals with a key segment of our society, namely 
our young people who will take our place in the future. Some of 
these young people may be experiencing problems that bring them 
into our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to commend my colleague from 
Berthier—Montcalm for all the work he has done on this issue. He 
pleaded his case before the justice and human rights committee 
for 27 hours non stop, trying to convince the government, trying 
to get through to the minister who refuses to bring fundamental 
changes to her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Berthier—Montcalm deserves our appreciation 
because he has worked hard on Quebec's behalf, with a clear 
mandate from Quebecers and with a strong desire to protect 
Quebec's fundamental interests on this issue, which goes straight 
to the heart of Canada's problem and which brings to the fore the 
constitutional debate that has been going on in this country for 
150 years. We must be conscious of the fact that this debate is 
now reaching a critical point because it touches a very important 
aspect of our life as a society. So, again, I commend the member 
for Berthier—Montcalm for his work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we cannot say the same for the government House leader 
who, in response to the reaction of the Bloc Quebecois, which is 
defending itself with the means at its disposal, those permitted 
under the rules of parliament, i.e. introducing amendments, the 
House leader who, in his great generosity and foresight—we give 
him his due—said, and I am reading from an article in the 
September 23 issue of the <I>Nouvelliste</I>, which was in turn based 
on a Canadian Press story: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader reacted strongly to the Bloc Quebecois tactics 
“It is an abuse of the rules of the House.  Canadians will not 
be impressed”. 
</UL>
<It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He estimated that this marathon debate could once again be 
expensive for the House of Commons, particularly because of the 
overtime paid parliamentary employees.  “It will cost $3 million 
to defeat the Bloc Quebecois amendments.  This abuse of procedure 
has become almost institutionalized.  It is shocking and must be 
changed.  But, in the meantime, it is Canadian taxpayers who are 
footing the bill”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disgraceful for someone with the responsibilities of House 
leader to react in this way.  He is an experienced 
parliamentarian.  He knows just how helpless parliamentarians and 
parliament are before government when it wishes to steamroller 
such a bill through.  He knows the weakness of parliamentarians. 
The only course left to us is to take extreme measures, as the 
Bloc Quebecois has done in this case, through the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, by introducing amendments which will bring 
home the seriousness of the situation to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high-minded House leader talks to us of $3 million dollars. 
How much did the Liberal-generated debates on the privatization 
of Pearson cost?  How many millions?  How many hundreds of 
millions? What was the bill for the whole helicopters and 
frigates saga?  The helicopters are too big for the frigates and 
the frigates are too small for the helicopters.  What did that 
cost.  How many other similar examples can be cited? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to enforce this new legislation for the next three years 
will cost Quebec $69 million, $23 million annually. And the 
government is worrying us about the $3 million it will cost to 
defend the Canadian democracy that it is so quick to boast about 
to other nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reduce the debate to such a level is a total disgrace, given 
the responsibilities and experience of the government House 
leader. We should keep repeating that it is unacceptable. He must 
be desperate to resort to such an argument. It is the logic of 
the weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> He is a sorry figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Yes, the hon. member for 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell is a sorry figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important debate for the young people who stand 
to be directly affected by this bill. The whole process will 
change. I also mentioned that the debate deals with a 
constitutional issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important debate for our youth, because this bill will 
completely change the way things work right now. It is a totally 
new approach. And as in many other areas, the position of Quebec, 
as a distinct society, as a nation, is different than that of the 
rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus in Quebec is on prevention. Quebec relies on 
rehabilitation. Canada prefers a more punitive and correctional 
model. These are two totally different approaches and the federal 
government comes trampling in to impose its process on us. If it 
wants to impose it on the English-speaking provinces, it is its 
right, its choice. But when it tries to impose it on Quebec, it 
must realize that the opposition being voiced by the Bloc 
Quebecois is only the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have enough time later on, I will list the members of the 
coalition. 
The Bloc Quebecois is but the tip of the iceberg. In Quebec, 
nobody is supporting the federal government at this time. The 
Bloc Quebecois is doing a great job of opposing the bill through 
the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, and we will continue to 
fight for as long as the government lets us and does not impose a 
gag order as it is wont to do too often, in view of its claims to 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a big substantive issue, because our whole philosophy is 
being changed. Instead of talking about prevention, they want to 
punish and emphasize the seriousness of the offences of the 
young, and they minimize their reintegration capacity. Until now, 
in Quebec, our preferred approach has been to build on the 
principle that the individual who has made a mistake can be 
rehabilitated if we give him the support he needs and keep his 
name and the whole matter confidential. In so doing, we believe 
the young offender will go to school, have a family and lead the 
life of a law abiding citizen. All of this is being destroyed by 
this government and especially by the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also a serious constitutional issue. There are lessons 
to be drawn from this. I have just explained how Quebec is on a 
different course. It would be quite possible—and it has been 
requested—that Quebec be exempted from this legislation, which 
could be enforced in other provinces if they so wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Quebec, it should be recognized as distinct, and the 
Prime Minister and member for Saint-Maurice should keep the 
commitment he made in the aftermath of the referendum, when he 
described Quebec as a distinct society. He still boasts about 
that once in a while, but he does nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not keeping his commitment when it comes to either young 
offenders, or the millennium scholarships, the wildlife species 
at risk, or health care, which is a provincial jurisdiction. It 
is an empty shell, which is the reason why it should not be 
forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois voted against the motion because we knew it 
was nothing but smoke and mirrors and that it would be an empty 
shell. The Prime Minister shows it is indeed so every time he 
misses the opportunity to recognize his own people, the Quebec 
people, as a distinct society, not only in Quebec, but throughout 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, it is too far in the past, it is asking too much of the 
Prime Minister, the member for Saint-Maurice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is catching me off guard, I did not think it would 
happen so fast. I say it again, the Bloc Quebecois' opposition is 
only the tip of the iceberg. The whole of Quebec is behind us. 
The National Assembly voted unanimously, that is members of the 
Parti Quebecois, the Liberals, the ADQ, all of them voted 
unanimously denouncing the federal government's attitude.

to stop trying to enact Bill C-3.

run counter to this bill, which hopefully will be defeated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are considering Bill which C-3 is 
an important piece of legislation. It has lots to do with crime 
among youth. As all of us in the House know, there has been 
mounting public pressure on the government to give Canada 
effective laws to deal with youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the vast majority of Canadian youth offer a 
bright hope to our society for the future.  The vast majority of 
youth in the country are people of whom we can be proud, people 
on whom we can base some good hopes for the future.  They are 
fine young people who are working hard to be an effective and 
contributing part of society while learning skills that will 
eventually allow them to lead society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to emphasize that we are dealing with 
laws directed to a very small minority, but a minority that 
places the majority of youth at substantial risk and in fact risk 
to the public at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just on the news yesterday there was a report of a severe 
beating of a 14 year old or 15 year old youth in Edmonton who was 
set upon by other youths.  A gang connection is suspected.  What 
the police had to say really struck me as so bizarre.  The police 
said he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. I am sure that 
was no comfort to the pain and suffering the young person had to 
endure at the hands of lawless youths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we protect our children, families and 
youth from crimes and violence by their peers and others in 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she took the justice portfolio after the last election, the 
minister said that bringing in changes to the Young Offenders Act 
was her highest priority.  That was in 1997. Well here we are on 
the eve of an election, and an election may be called in less 
than a week from today, and legislation is being rushed through 
parliament against huge opposition.  Legislation to do with youth 
justice is being rushed through parliament against grave concerns 
expressed by numerous experts.  Legislation is being rushed 
through parliament with 150 amendments put forward by the 
government that have not even been considered by the proper 
committee of the House.  This is no way to deal with the highest 
priority of the justice minister. I say shame on her for being so 
ineffectual and derelict in her duty in bringing forward what she 
says is her highest priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the last election the justice committee conducted months 
of extensive cross-country hearings to get Canadians' wishes on 
what changes they wanted to see to the Young Offenders Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT72"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT72"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we are told by those on the justice committee that most of 
their work, these months of work, was simply ignored by the 
justice minister in the bill.  In fact the bill has been widely 
criticized for its ineffectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface many of the provisions Canadians have been asking 
for were included but closer examination has disclosed not just 
to members of the opposition but to members of interests groups, 
to experts, to the witnesses before the committee that many 
loopholes in the legislation will result in undesirable and 
unanticipated exceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the worse 
faults in the bill.  Although alternative measures for first time 
non-violent offenders recommended by the official opposition are 
in the bill, those measures are open to repeat and violent 
offenders.  In other words, repeat and violent youth offenders 
may not have any meaningful consequences for their actions. 
Alternative measures are writing an essay, making a poster or 
doing a little community service, very minor responses to what 
can be serious and even violent crimes.  This whole area of 
alternative measures has already proven to lead to incredible 
injustice within the adult system, for example no jail time at 
all for rape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are facing the same unfairness, the same anomalies now 
available in the youth justice system.  We wonder whether the 
justice minister watches what is going on when she simply repeats 
and expands on the mistakes she has made in previous legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second fault is that adult sentences, while they may be 
warranted, will rarely apply to the actions of violent and 
serious young offenders.  Adult sentences will apply only to four 
categories of offences:  murder, attempted murder, manslaughter 
and aggravated sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no adult sentences for sexual assault with a 
weapon, hostage taking, aggravated assault, kidnapping and a host 
of other violent offences.  Whereas the justice minister is 
saying hard core youth criminals can be severely dealt with as 
adults, the truth of the matter is that in almost every case that 
will not happen.  That is a serious flaw in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third flaw in the bill is there is no way to deal with 
serious offenders under age 12.  The minister rose in the House 
today and asked with horror and contempt in her voice why we 
would want to make criminals out of 10 year olds.  The simple 
answer is no one wants to do that, but the sad fact is that there 
are sometimes extremely serious crimes committed, even murder, by 
10 and 11 year olds.  There needs to be a way for society to deal 
with that in a meaningful fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, having every person under 12 exempt from any 
responsibility or accountability in our criminal justice system 
simply invites them to be exploited by adult criminals.  We are 
actually putting young people, children under 12 at risk by 
refusing to have them brought into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
who said this morning that if circumstances sometimes warrant 
youths being transferred to adult court, they also sometimes 
warrant children being transferred to youth court.  That just 
makes perfect common sense and will benefit everyone in society 
including the children in question.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth flaw is that the bill will result in a patchwork, 
uneven, unequal youth justice system because every province will 
administer it differently.  Someone who may be right across the 
border from another young offender or may travel from one part of 
the country to another will have completely different measures 
and processes to deal with their offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That simply does not make sense, especially when the government 
reacts with total horror at the thought that there may be 
different standards of health care across the country.  However 
it brings in measures that will bring completely different 
standards of youth justice across the country.  I wonder where 
the consistency is with the government.  There is not very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time does not allow me to continue with the flaws in the 
system.  I have already mentioned four serious flaws with the 
legislation.  I appeal to the government to stop the insanity of 
pushing through badly thought out, widely criticized legislation 
and to get it right because our children and our society deserve 
much better than what we have in the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK701"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not 
the first time that I rise in the House to speak to this bill on 
young offenders. I have done so at the various stages. I find 
myself here again today, at the report stage, repeating things 
that have been said many times, but the government seems too 
stubborn to understand them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us does not deal with a new federal or 
provincial issue. An act dealing with young offenders has been in 
effect for many years. That act even went through a number of 
amendments a few years ago, and these amendments have resulted in 
a number of improvements to the current act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore that act, which has been in force for many years, has 
had tangible results on youth crime reduction. Indeed, since 
1991, for the last nine years, the rate of youth crime throughout 
Canada went down 23%. This is an excellent result. The federal 
budget has greatly increased, which is not a good result. But 
youth crime in Canada has been reduced by 23% in nine years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation that is currently in force is giving good 
results. In English, there is a saying that goes like this: If it 
ain't broke, don't fix it. Indeed, we have an act that is 
effective, and what is the federal government getting ready to 
do? It wants to scrap it. 
It wants to replace it with a piece of legislation about which 
everyone in Quebec says “It is not going to work.  It will not 
give results.  It will make things worse”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation is based on some very wrong 
assumptions.  They are assuming that, if an act imposes heavy 
sanctions on reprehensible behaviour, those liable to commit such 
acts will think twice before doing so.  Between you and me, Mr. 
Speaker, who among us in this chamber of members of parliament 
and legislators, outside of those with a legal background, can 
say what the sentence is for going out and breaking a car 
windshield?  I do not.  I am not even interested in knowing. Most 
of the people of Canada and of Quebec probably do not know, nor 
do they want to. I have no desire to break a car windshield, but 
not because I am afraid of the law.  I am a peace-loving person, 
able to settle life's problems by normal means.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A child, a teenager will be no more aware of the law than I. The 
fact that we are going to make speeches here in this place and 
that the government is going to toughen up certain measures is 
not going to scare him or her out of the idea of doing something 
wrong.  Most children are normal and will not do such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a variety of reasons, some children have behavioural 
problems and are going to commit some act that they will come to 
regret.  Legislation is not going to make them stop and think, 
when they do something wrong on an impulse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to make a comparison, a rather poor one, but one 
that comes to mind.  This approach is akin to sweeping dust under 
the rug. 
The child, the adolescent, commits some reprehensible act and, 
rather than help him with rehabilitation, we send him to prison 
and put him away, “Go on, dirt under the rug”.  Yes but, let us 
stop and give that some thought.  One day, this young person will 
return to society.  Do you think he will be a better citizen for 
having been shoved under the rug for a time? Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we the public are to enjoy quality of life, we must give our 
children appropriate care.  The existing law provides for this. 
The one being proposed would not permit it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we do more in rehabilitation even.  Our program in 
Quebec is further ahead than that of anywhere else in North 
America.  In Quebec, the juvenile crime rate is the lowest in 
North America.  The process of rehabilitation is the best in 
North America.  The rate of recidivism is the lowest in North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recipe works.  The moral is, since we have a recipe that 
works, the federal government says “Dump it.  Let us make sure 
we have a recipe that will not work”.  This is what we have 
before us.  It is not just the member for Portneuf or the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois saying this.  This is what associations, 
organizations and intermediate bodies are saying throughout 
Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there is a consensus.  The Quebec bar has criticized 
this bill.  In the national assembly, all the parties together, 
unanimously, have criticized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, the Bloc Quebecois, through its actions in parliament, 
speaks on behalf of everyone in Quebec when it says “This bill 
must not be passed as it stands”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the people in the rest of Canada want to treat their children 
this way, I find it unfortunate, but that is their business. For 
the love of heaven, do not impose that approach on the people of 
Quebec.  For the love of heaven, do not force Quebec into this 
unsuitable mould you are going to impose on your families and 
your children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking is very simple.  We want Quebec treated in a 
manner worthy of its values, its experience and its children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we ask is to have added to the bill a little clause to the 
effect that “This law does not apply to Quebec.  The existing 
law will continue to apply”, so that our successful results will 
continue to be a fact of life for Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada wants to go through with that unfortunate measure, so 
be it. Perhaps in a few years, when it sees this 23% reduction go 
the other way, it will realize it made a mistake, but we do not 
want to pay for the stupid mistake that is being made.

children and I would say “We do not want to stay in a Canada 
that will force us to treat our children in an such a shameful 
manner. Let us get out of this country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill is passed in its present form, it will be yet 
another reason, and a good one, to hold a referendum to achieve 
Quebec's independence, so that we can live in accordance with our 
own values, so that we can treat our children properly, something 
which the rest of Canada does not seem to be able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be so simple for the rest of Canada to go its way and 
to let us go ours. 
We do not want to impose our views on anyone and we do not want 
anyone to impose their views on us, particularly when it comes to 
our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak to the bill, as I 
have in the past.  I appreciate that we are in the first group of 
amendments.  I will keep my comments general with respect to the 
youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state at the outset that prior to being elected as a 
member of parliament I did practise law.  I did a fair amount of 
work in the youth criminal courts.  It was a real eye-opener.  I 
want to put this premise at the very beginning:  every single 
youth who ends up in our youth courts will end up back in the 
community, whether they have committed a lesser offence or are 
incarcerated.  At some point in the continuum they will all end 
up back in the community.  We have to keep that in mind so that 
we can help them help themselves and be integrated back into the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My greatest concern with the new youth criminal justice act is 
that we have taken the old Young Offenders Act and repackaged it. 
We have put some new wrapping paper and ribbons on it and given 
it a new name but by and large we have not made the substantive 
changes that are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few examples.  I want to emphasize that in my 
experience I have seen a lot of troubled children with horrific 
backgrounds who end up in our court system.  Trying to stop them 
from becoming career criminals and going through a revolving door 
is another problem in itself.  The focus has to be on ensuring 
they do not end up back in our courts.  How do we help them?  How 
do they become productive members of society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call it a tough love approach.  I think we need to deal with 
these people.  When these young offenders are institutionalized, 
the people at those facilities need to have the tools and 
resources they need to do the job, as so often they do not, such 
as the right counselling and drug programs.  The goal at the end 
of the day is to make sure these young offenders are taught 
discipline and respect for society.  I think that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Minister of Justice say today during question period 
that we want to send 10 year old children to jail.  In very 
serious offences that will be necessary.  That is what we are 
pushing for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cases where 10 and 11 year old children absolutely 
need to be institutionalized to get the help they need.  I mean 
that sincerely.  If we do not send them away when they are 
committing really serious offences at a very young age, it is a 
problem.  In most cases they come from terrible backgrounds.  The 
best thing we can do for those young children when we 
institutionalize them is to make sure that they get the programs 
and the counselling they need.  I would say based on my 
experience that at least half of them have fetal alcohol 
syndrome.  There are all kinds of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Minister of Justice say in question period today 
that we have no compassion, no feelings, and that we want to send 
10 year old children away.  I believe in my heart that it is the 
right thing to do if we are going to get them the help they need. 
That is just one example.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adult sentences under this new youth criminal justice act are 
for only very specific offences:  first degree murder, second 
degree murder, attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated 
sexual assault.  That is why I say we have only repackaged the 
old Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other offences, such as assault causing bodily 
harm, that are extremely violent offences.  There are property 
offences such as breaking and entering and home invasion.  These 
are very serious offences.  We also need to look at these 
offences.  I call it a tough love approach.  We need to deal with 
these young offenders and make sure that this is not a place they 
want to come back to, that they learn respect and discipline.  We 
will only be helping them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas I would like to see addressed that are 
not.  One is with respect to the whole area of legal aid.  I 
watched young offenders who were given lawyers under the legal 
aid program.  One of my concerns is that we are sending the wrong 
message.  Many of these people are striving for attention.  They 
get their own lawyer and think that is cool.  They walk into the 
courts and it is “I have my lawyer with me.”  We do not do 
them a service.  There are other ways in which that could be much 
better addressed.  I do not see this legislation as addressing 
any of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that at the end of the day our goal is to 
help these people, because every single one of them, at least at 
this point in their lives, will be back in society.  We want to 
make sure that they are not just being institutionalized.  If 
they need psychiatric help, counselling, anger management or 
schooling, we want to make sure that all of it is happening while 
they are in these institutions, that they are not just going 
through a revolving door.  I want to emphasize that I do not 
believe in my heart that the bill is doing any of the things I am 
talking about.  It is important that we focus on providing what I 
call tough love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youths used to come up to me and say they did not mind going to 
jail for two weeks.  Some of them actually kind of liked it. 
What they used to absolutely hate was curfews.  Under section 7 
of the old Young Offenders Act there was a provision whereby a 
curfew could be enforced by parents.  In other words, if a young 
offender breached that curfew the parents, as legal guardians, 
had an obligation to report that breach.  Obviously they could 
not control that child, but they had to report the breach to the 
authorities.  That person would then be picked up at a later date 
and brought back before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, along with other conditions, we made curfews mandatory for 
many offences, that would go a long way toward helping these 
children, as I call them, with their problems.  We need to take a 
tough approach.  It does not have to be a mean approach, but it 
has to be a tough approach up front so that young offenders get 
discipline and guidance and learn to respect society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home invasion and break and enters are not even mentioned in the 
act with respect to adult offences.  Other than sexual assault, 
those are some of the most intrusive invasions into one's 
personal privacy.  These are very traumatizing for victims and 
affect their lives for years.  These young offenders, these 
children, who are committing these terrible offences need to be 
dealt with swiftly, not by taking a year to go through the 
process, and without the adjournments.  They need to be dealt 
with very swiftly.  They have to realize that society will not 
tolerate these actions.  They have to learn that there are 
consequences.  We will be helping those children to become much 
more productive members of society and to have a much better life 
in the future.  That is a good approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members from the Bloc oppose this vehemently and 
seem to want to take a lesser approach.  I do not share that 
view.  I am not talking about a mean approach.  I am talking 
about an approach whereby offenders learn respect for and 
discipline in society.  The institution becomes a place they do 
not want to go back to.  While offenders are institutionalized, 
those institutions must have the resources to help offenders to 
help themselves.  Those who do not want to be helped will have to 
learn that there are serious consequences and that those actions 
will not be tolerated in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize it in a sentence, I see this youth criminal justice 
act as just a repackaging of the old Young Offenders Act.  It has 
a new outside, but by and large it is almost the same as what we 
have.

bill, that is, the area dealing with youth custody and 
supervision.  Although one of the main objectives of the bill is 
to ensure that custody is not overused, it will of course still 
be used in appropriate cases, such as those of violent offenders 
and repeat offenders who have not complied with previous 
community sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains a number of significant changes to ensure the 
youth custody system operates so that youth who serve time in 
custody do not return to the community in a situation that is 
worse than when they left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underpinning the whole bill is the belief that young people can 
be rehabilitated and successfully reintegrated into the 
community.  The focus of every custody sentence will be on 
reintegration, on ensuring that public protection is increased by 
measures aimed at assisting the young person so that he or she 
will not reoffend.  This reintegrative approach is in everyone's 
best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most significant changes is the requirement that 
every period in custody is to be followed by a period under 
supervision in the community as part of the sentence.  The judge, 
when imposing time in custody, will clearly state in open court 
the portion of the sentence to be served in custody as well as 
the time to be served in the community under supervision and 
subject to conditions.  This is a very important requirement as 
it increases the transparency of the youth justice system and 
makes it clear that a part of the sentence to be served is to be 
served in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This increases public confidence in the system, as a decision as 
to when the youth should return to the community is stated in 
open court by the judge.  The judge will also make it clear that 
a youth who is serving the community portion of a sentence must 
comply with conditions and that if they do not they can be 
brought back into custody to serve the remainder of that 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing the supervision period in more detail, I would 
like to speak in support of the government motion that would 
provide for increased judicial discretion in setting the 
community portion in relation to the most serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, young people can receive youth sentences 
consisting of a period of custody followed by a period of 
supervision in the community.  This can occur either through a 
custody and supervision order that sets the time in the community 
at one half the time in custody or through specific sentences 
whereby the judge sets the proportion in custody and in the 
community.  The bill currently provides for this judicial 
discretion in regard to youth murder sentences and intensive 
rehabilitative custody and supervision sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government amendment would provide for judicial discretion 
to set the community portion of the sentence in a manner that is 
similar to that for murder sentences, where the offence is the 
attempt to commit murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual 
assault.  These offences, along with murder, are the most serious 
violent offences.  It is appropriate that a judge have discretion 
in setting the custody and community portions in these serious 
cases, as well as for murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like now to turn in more detail to conditions that apply 
to the young person serving the community portion of a sentence. 
The bill contains a list of mandatory conditions, such as keeping 
the peace, good behaviour, and reporting requirements, that apply 
to a young person while under supervision in the community. 
Further, the bill provides that additional conditions can be 
imposed which address the needs and manage the risk of a 
particular young person.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supervision and support in the community will be provided by 
youth workers.  The extent of the contact with youth will depend 
on the individual case.  It will vary according to the needs of 
the youth, degree of risk posed and the program for support and 
supervision that is put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions to be imposed cover a full spectrum and include: 
(a) conditions to establish structure in the youth's life, such 
as school attendance, place of residence, employment and curfews; 
(b) conditions that prohibit factors associated with the youth's 
offending behaviour, such as not associating with members of a 
certain youth gang or abstinence from drugs or alcohol; and (c) 
conditions that encourage law-abiding behaviour, such as 
attending substance abuse programs, counselling or participating 
in community service programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elements of support would also be encouraged by the youth worker 
to assist the youth's reintegration, including such things as 
family counselling, finding educational and employment 
opportunities, mentors and community supports for the youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak in support of proposed government 
amendments which clarify and reinforce that the period under 
condition in the community is not just for the purpose of 
supervising the young person to see whether or not he or she 
complies with the conditions, but also to provide support to the 
young person and to help meet their needs during their critical 
transition from custody to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a young person fails to comply with a condition while under 
supervision in the community, reviews will be conducted which may 
mean a change in conditions or which can mean that the young 
person may be apprehended and brought back into custody.  After a 
review by the youth justice court the young person can be ordered 
to serve the rest of the community portion in custody.  There is 
an onus on the young person in this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each sentence with a custody and supervision portion is made 
subject to the possibility that the young person will not serve 
the community portion if they present a serious risk of 
endangering the community.  The youth justice court may order 
that the young person remain in custody for a period not 
exceeding the remainder of the sentence, if it is satisfied that 
the young person is likely to reoffend before the expiry of the 
sentence by causing murder or serious harm to another person or 
for sentences other than murder where the conditions that would 
be imposed on the young person in the community would not 
adequately protect the public against offences against the 
person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A judge will make it clear to everyone at the time of sentencing 
that if a court considers the young person to be a danger to the 
public, he or she will not be released into the community to 
serve the community supervision portion of the sentence but will 
continue to serve the whole sentence in custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at part 5 of the bill, we find, for the first time, a 
legislative statement of the purpose of the youth custody and 
supervision system as well as the principles that guide it.  The 
emphasis is on contributing to the protection of society through 
safe and humane custody and supervision and through programs that 
assist the young person in effectively reintegrating into the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I noted earlier, reintegration is a key component of the bill 
and supports the protection of society by reducing recidivism 
through guidance and support of a youth during the critical 
period when he or she returns to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, among the amendments tabled by the government is one that 
will make it clearer that the principles in the declaration of 
principles should be taken into account when it comes to making a 
decision on the custody and supervision order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure that supports the reintegration of youth is the 
bill's requirement for a reintegration plan.  When a young person 
goes into custody, a youth worker will work with the young person 
to plan for his or her reintegration into the community, through 
preparation of a reintegration plan that sets out the most 
effective programs for the young person in order to maximize his 
or her chances for successful reintegration into the community. 
When the young person is serving the community portion of the 
sentence, a youth worker will supervise the young person and 
provide support and assistance to the young person in respecting 
conditions and implementing the reintegration plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the custody and reintegration provisions of the 
bill, strengthened by the amendments proposed by the government, 
will work in practice to increase long term public protection by 
assisting in the reintegration of a young person into the 
community following custody. 
It is for these reasons that I am pleased, along with my 
colleagues, to support the bill, because after all, it does 
indeed put the young person first.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have not had 
the chance to speak to this bill before, and the many 
parliamentary duties I have to perform almost prevented me from 
studying it closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as a legal expert or as a person who is knowledgeable 
in this field that I want to take part in this debate today, but 
as a father of five. It is not easy to know what goes on in a 
young person's head, particularly if that person has suffered 
from socio-affective problems, maternal deprivation or other 
problems of that kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell a little story. One day, I went hunting 
with my four year old son and we had a flat tire. For those who 
know a little bit about cars, I took the bolts from the wheel and 
put them in the hubcap, which I left on the road. While I was 
removing the wheel, my son took the hubcap containing the bolts 
and threw it as hard as he could into the woods. What was he 
thinking? I was not very happy, but it is hard to predict what a 
child will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our colleagues from the Alliance, we are all appalled when we 
hear about a criminal act or a brutal assault like the one that 
happened in England a few years ago when two boys aged 10 or 11 
killed a two year old boy. Of course we were all appalled. We see 
these kinds of things once in a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, is revenge society's right? Rather, should it not act 
to protect itself and individuals, especially when they are as 
pretty as my party's assistant whip? Kidding aside, society must 
protect itself. But should it bear a grudge? Should it punish, 
and vengefully so? I believe we are heading in the wrong 
direction when we claim society should exact some kind of 
vengeance on individuals, in particular young people, since they 
are at issue today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not read or see the statistics, but I heard them and they 
tell me, and all the experts and those versed in this area, that 
in Quebec youth crime has really dropped. Earlier the member for 
Portneuf very convincingly said that youth crime fell by about 23 
p. 100. This is worth noticing, and I believe we should stay the 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to work with someone who made a mistake 
when he was young, he killed someone. Fortunately it happened in 
the early 50s. He spent several years in prison, and when he came 
to work with us in Sept-Îles, on the North Shore, he kept it a 
secret, he talked to no one about it. Unfortunately, it became 
known, eventually, which was a real heartbreak for this man who 
was sincerely sorry for what he had done in the past and wanted 
to keep it a secret. He claimed he had paid his debt to society, 
and I believe he had. He behaved in an exemplary manner, was a 
hard worker, but had made a mistake when he was young, and he was 
the first one to be sorry about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living at a time of rapid communications, when we can fax 
a photograph. Some 20 years ago, the RCMP and the QPF had bought 
a publicity slot during Hockey Night in Canada to show what was 
the ancestor of the modern fax machine. 
They wanted to show how it was possible, with the methods of 
communication then available, to send the picture of someone 
wanted in Halifax to Vancouver in record time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the amazing speed of all these methods of communication, 
imagine what will happen if the name of a young person who has 
made a mistake and often regrets it immediately is released to 
the public.  How will he escape the condemnation of the community 
if the facts of an affair are made public by the media?  Only one 
avenue remains.  If he wishes to rebuild his life, he could 
perhaps leave the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Society protects itself and I am not against it being able or 
wanting to do so. But this bill goes further than protection.  We 
have not asked that heinous and highly reprehensible crimes be 
allowed to go unpunished.  That is not what the Bloc Quebecois is 
calling for.  It is simply asking that all the chances be put on 
the side of those young people who can be rehabilitated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find surprising is that Canadian Alliance members, whom I 
respect, are asking elected representatives to lower costs, 
taxes, just about everything.  Now that they have an opportunity 
to take up the call for less, they are calling for more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is expensive to keep young people in prison, and experience 
has shown that those who end up there are more hardened criminals 
than those who were spared.  Spending 10, 12 or 15 years of one's 
life drinking coffee, playing billiards and being bored does not 
do anything for one's compassion.  Prison is the best school for 
crime. 
We all know that. I am not saying anything new to the members 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to keep our youth out of there as much as possible, in 
order to save those who can be saved. I believe this will be 
better for society. The role of justice is not to take reprisals, 
to play the role of avenger and to substitute itself to victims. 
Justice must administer matters in the best interests of the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised, and all the more so when I see the government 
House leader attack us in the newspaper by saying that the Bloc 
Quebecois has chosen a path which will cost the House of Commons 
a lot and that he would not have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply remind him that the cancellation of the 
privatization contract of the Pearson airport was supposed to 
cost $225 million. I believe this is what it has cost for Air 
Canada alone. The last time we checked, I believe the amount had 
already reached $700 to $800 million. I also remind him of the 
cancellation of the famous helicopters, which the government now 
plans to buy once more. How much did that cost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader says nothing about those issues. He 
blames the opposition because it does its work, because its 
opposes a measure which will be totally unjust and harmful to our 
youth. The present system already works well in Quebec, where the 
government administers justice in accordance with the established 
constitutional order. Why not let the government administer the 
system the way it does, since it does it so well?

not very familiar with this kind of legislation—we each have our 
qualities and weaknesses—being more skilled in economic matters.

be guided by grudges or by vengeance, which are bad advisers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, like everybody else, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-3, 
which is the final response by the government to what we said 
during the 1993 election when we said that the Young Offenders 
Act had to be toughened up.  We talked about it and hammered on 
it.  We ranted and raved in this place to bring about changes to 
the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we got the new Minister of Justice, the hon. member for 
Edmonton West.  In 1997 when she was appointed the Minister of 
Justice, she said “Right on.  We are going to bring in changes 
to the Young Offenders Act”.  Here it is the fall of 2000, seven 
years after the Reform Party and now the Canadian Alliance began 
talking about the fact that we need changes to the Young 
Offenders Act and finally we have a document in front of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one has been reading the papers and listening to the rumours, 
there could be an election before this bill is passed and we 
would be right back to square one.  That would not be quite so 
bad because then we would be on that side of the House. We would 
make sure that a young offenders act was introduced in short 
order.  It would be a clear instruction to the young people in 
our country that we do not like to mess around with kids.  We are 
going to instruct young kids who think they can mess around with 
the laws of the country and that they can abuse people and commit 
property crimes and so on that young people should not be doing 
these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short sharp lesson to young kids at that impressionable age 
sometimes can speak wonders and can get them right back on the 
straight and narrow.  That sums up the position of the Canadian 
Alliance:  something short, sharp and productive that lets young 
people in Canada know we want them to be good, productive, dare I 
say taxpaying citizens, rather than a drain and a drag on our 
society as we have to incarcerate them and haul them through the 
court process month after month.  It drags on. Sometimes by then 
they have even forgotten why they are up in front of the judge. 
They scratch their heads and say “Oh, yeah, I remember.  Gee, 
that was a long time ago, wasn't it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unfortunately how our justice system works. It takes 
months and months and sometimes years and years before the young 
kids get before a judge.  And what do they get?  A little smack 
on their fingers and a reprimand from the judge saying “Excuse 
me, but we really do not like you doing that.  Can you please 
refrain from that kind of behaviour from here on in.  Off you go 
and be a nice little kid from here on in”.  And they laugh as 
they go out the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is lots wrong with the Young Offenders Act.  While the 
Minister of Justice says that she has made some changes and 
recommendations in the bill, from our perspective it is woefully 
inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the minister say today that there is no way that she 
would touch 10 and 11 year olds, but we know that 10 and 11 year 
olds need to be brought under some kind of supervision when they 
get totally off track.  They need to be advised even at 10 and 11 
years that there is good behaviour and bad behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about bad behaviour, there are the amendments tabled by 
our colleagues on this side of the House, notably the separatist 
party, the Bloc Quebecois. 
The number of amendments tabled by the Bloc Quebecois looks to be 
about 50% more than the total bill itself judging by the 
thickness of the document.  I think they are playing games.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are serious about changes to the Young Offenders Act.  We 
think this is a serious issue.  The country thinks it is a 
serious issue.  The Bloc members obviously do not think it is a 
serious issue because they have tabled irrelevant amendments. 
They filibustered the bill in committee for 10 hours so that 
there was no intelligent legitimate debate. Unfortunately that is 
the type of debate we get from the Bloc Quebecois, without 
intelligence and without relevancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at one page of their amendments.  It seems that in 
their some 3,000 amendments they suggest that each and every 
clause be deferred for three years, five years, ten years before 
coming into force and that the minister report on each and every 
clause every year, second year, five years, or whatever it is. If 
that was their intelligent intention, they could have called for 
the Minister of Justice to table a report in the House on the 
operation of the Young Offenders Act, but obviously the way that 
they are doing it is not for the benefit of society.  It is not 
for the benefit of the people who are victimized by young kids. 
It is not for the benefit of young kids who need to be brought 
under the Young Offenders Act.  They have done this strictly for 
their own political gain. That is why I would hope that after the 
next election there are a lot fewer Bloc members in the House 
than there are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at Bloc Motions Nos. 2231, 2232 and 2233. Motion 
No. 2231 calls for the deletion of lines 1 to 13.  It gets rid of 
the whole clause.  Motion No. 2232 calls for the deletion of 
lines 5 to 8.  The next motion calls for the deletion of lines 9 
to 13.  There are three motions dealing with the same issue. That 
shows the petty political games our Bloc friends are playing with 
a serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is concerned about safe streets.  We are 
concerned about safe communities.  We are concerned about 
ensuring that Canadian society continues to be respected as one 
of the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear in the crime capitals in the United States, for example 
New York City, that crime is down 10% to 20%, that murders are 
down 10% to 20%.  In the United States serious inroads into crime 
are being made.  They are tough on crime.  Perhaps there is a 
correlation there that the Liberal Party and the government have 
missed.  If we are tough on crime, if we punish crime, then 
people get the message.  They should not do it and it should not 
happen again.  That is not with disregard to rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are myriad reasons for crime.  We cannot point to one 
single issue:  broken families, alcohol, drugs, lack of 
education, cultural problems.  There are myriad reasons that 
people resort to crime.  One of them is a lack of education and 
the capacity for people to live, work and prosper in this complex 
technological world we live in. The other one is the lack of 
moral instruction to differentiate between what is right and 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard in other debates in the House about the fact that 
we cannot talk about morality.  Then we find that young children 
cannot differentiate between what is right and what is wrong, and 
what society considers to be respectable behaviour and what 
society considers to be behaviour that is reprehensible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere along the way, through our soft and fuzzy and pat them 
on the head and ask them not to do it again concept, we have lost 
the notion that we have to teach our kids the difference between 
right and wrong.  We have to teach them how to survive and 
prosper and take advantage of the complex technological world we 
live in.  Other issues enter into it but these are the types of 
things we need to work at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rehabilitation of young criminals pays dividends for the 
rest of the young child's life.  We can take someone who is 
falling off the rails and keep them on the rails, keep them 
productive and a contributing taxpaying member of society. 
Compared to someone who is a continuous drain, the rewards and 
benefits are immense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the minister has fallen far short in this bill. We 
wish we had more time to debate it.  I would love to have more 
time to debate it but let us get this bill in place before the 
election. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK706"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased also to speak to this bill. I must say that 
I made a special effort to be present today because I believe 
that it is extremely important for me to comment on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, I would like to congratulate the Member for 
Berthier—Montcalm. I have watched him these last few month and 
I know he has done a considerable amount of work on this bill. In 
our caucus, he has kept us correctly and adequately informed. In 
committee, he has moved and debated many amendments and tried to 
play a positive role. He has done an extraordinary job and I 
wish to congratulate him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I followed the debate from its start. We all know that Bill C-3 
is a rehash of Bill C-68, which died on the order paper when 
parliament was prorogued. We started all over and the bill was 
examined for a long time in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected in 1993. During my first mandate I was my party's 
critic for training and youth, even though I am a little older 
today. I met with youth groups who were anticipating the bill. 
Their concern was its approach, which was different from the one 
used in Quebec. Consequently, I have been aware of the problem 
for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former service director in the field of recreational and community 
activities, I remember the approach in 
Quebec, which favoured community work instead of imprisonment 
for delinquents; municipalities and recreational 
services made much use of this approach, which has proved very 
effective in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about statistics. 
It must be said that Quebec has the lowest youth crime rate in 
North America. As mentioned by the member for Portneuf, that rate 
has not increased since 1991 under the existing legislation. 
Usually when a new bill is introduced it is in response to a 
growing problem. In this case, the youth crime rate has decreased 
by 23%. Where is the logic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went back to read what the former justice minister, who is now 
Minister of Health, used to say on this issue. For a long time, 
during question period, he used to answer that he did not think 
it was a good approach, that the existing legislation was 
effective, as evidenced by a decrease in the youth crime rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this sudden change? The new minister comes from an area that 
seems to focus more on this issue. We just have to listen to the 
speeches made by members of the Canadian Alliance. There was a 
time when they talked about youth violence every day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, wanting to be re-elected in her part of 
the country, probably decided that she should change direction 
and take harsher measures with regard to young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about one particular aspect of the bill. The main 
change is that from now on 14 and 15 year old offenders would 
be considered as adults under the criminal code. They would be 
incarcerated and treated as adults. As if incarceration were the 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make a comparison. Australia is now hosting the Olympic 
games. We see that the Australians are doing very well; granted, 
they are at home. We also see that the Canadians are not doing so 
well. 
We realize that our efforts are perhaps misdirected. As a 
recreation professional and a former director of leisure 
activities, I have always thought that the educational approach, 
participation in different activities and the avoidance of 
idleness are a good solution. The more the young are busy, the 
less prone they are to commit crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill goes against common sense. I am not surprised by this 
position. Members of the Alliance, who represent a specific area, 
have a certain position, and it perhaps is a reflection of their 
constituents' concerns, and I can respect that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Portneuf said earlier, it is obvious in 
this regard and so many others like the education of the young, 
that we have two nations in Canada. In Quebec, a perfect 
consensus has emerged between all stakeholders. I think it is 
worth repeating their names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commission des services juridiques, the Conseil permanent de 
la jeunesse, the Centre communautaire juridique de Montréal, the 
Fondation québécoise pour les jeunes contrevenants, the Institut 
Philippe-Pinel, the Association des chefs de police et pompiers 
du Québec, the Conférence des régies régionales de la santé et 
des services sociaux and all its members, the Association des 
centres jeunesse du Québec, the Commission des droits de la 
personne et des droits de la jeunesse, the Bureau des substituts 
du Procureur général, and the attorney general herself, Linda 
Goupil, who happens to be the MNA for my riding, are all against 
this bill. Incidentally, the minister did all she could to oppose 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's solicitor general adopted the same approach against this 
bill; the Association des CLSC et des centres hospitaliers du 
Québec, the Regroupement des organismes de justice alternative du 
Québec, The Child Welfare League of Canada, The Canadian Criminal 
Justice Association, the Association des avocats de la défense du 
Québec, the Société de criminologie du Québec, the 125 members 
from all parties in the Quebec National Assembly are all opposed 
to this bill. There is a perfect consensus in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing illustrates this better than the fact that no Liberal 
member from Quebec has yet risen during this debate to speak in 
favour of the bill, because they know that parents, young people 
and youth organizations in their ridings are all opposed to this 
bill. But, because of the party line or the impending election, 
they keep quiet, if they show up at all in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see one Liberal member from Quebec, but his colleagues are 
not in the House. They cannot bear to listen to what we have to 
tell them. They would rather stay in their offices than hear Bloc 
members, who are really speaking for Quebecers on this issue. 
They prefer to stay away. They do not wish to speak on this 
issue. They are not true representatives of Quebecers. It is time 
for a change and it will change soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik has just come in, he 
is getting closer. The government House leader said that we were 
only wasting public funds.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister's last budget provides for $343 million 
more over three years, supposedly for crime prevention, but most 
of it is for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a closer look shows that the present government still 
owes the Quebec government $87 million for its application of the 
current legislation since 1989. What a scandal. How does it dare 
say it intends to spend more while it is not even able to pay 
its debts, while it refuses to pay the Quebec government for 
what it is doing very adequately. This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last point, since my time is almost up. Some are saying that 
the Bloc Quebecois is playing petty politics over this. This is 
absolutely false. There is a consensus. I will not repeat the 
list, as it is a long one. Thousands of our constituents who talk to 
us about this cannot believe that the government wants to do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let us not forget our young. Is it the right 
approach to lock up 14 year olds to rehabilitate them into 
society? It is the right approach, since, as everybody knows, 
prison is the best school for crime?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are back again debating the Young 
Offenders Act or, as it is now called, the youth criminal justice 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a couple of things about our youth.  The first 
thing is that we can very clearly distinguish the two kinds of 
youth.  The vast majority of youth are law-abiding young people 
much like their parents or adult friends, and indeed most people 
in Canada, who are struggling to try to make their way in life. 
They want to look forward to the future with some hope but they 
do worry about their personal safety when they go out at night, 
when they wait at a bus stop or when they interact with other 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a very small minority of young people who choose a 
life of crime, to break the laws, whether it is a lesser crime, 
such as property offences, or more serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that most concerns me and Canadians is what I 
would call a lack of respect.  I have heard over the past number 
of months my new leader, the leader of the Canadian Alliance, 
talk about respect and the need to instil respect not only in this 
institution in the way we do politics and government but the need 
to instil respect at every level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me the most is the lack of respect young criminals 
have for the law, private property, other people's rights and, 
sadly and tragically in some cases, even the lack of respect for 
other human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will focus for a moment on the young people 
themselves.  If we are going to address the need for young 
offenders' legislation, what is now called Bill C-3, the youth 
criminal justice act, we have to talk about the young people in 
the sense that they are the most vulnerable because they are the 
most at risk from their peers.  Who interacts with young people 
more than young people themselves?

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak from experience in that regard in that I have three 
young children.  I am very fortunate to have three beautiful 
young children: a son who is 17, a daughter who is 19, and my 
oldest daughter will be 22 within a month.  I am extremely 
fortunate that they have never been victims of crime.  I thank 
God every day of my life that they have not been victims of 
crime, because I cannot imagine a greater pain for any parent or 
grandparent than to have a young person they are related to 
become a victim of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great failing of this bill is that it does not address the 
fundamental issue of the protection of the vast majority of our 
young people, who as I said are law-abiding citizens, our 
youngest citizens, the future leaders of our nation.  The bill in 
its present form will not address that fundamental issue in any 
meaningful way.  It will not hold young criminals accountable and 
responsible for their actions, and it will not protect the vast 
majority of our youngest citizens who are law abiding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to sum up the bill, right at the outset I would have 
to say it is a colossal waste of time, energy, and effort and a 
betrayal of the trust and faith the Canadian people put in their 
elected parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take a look at the history of youth justice, or what 
the government chooses to call youth justice.  For my entire 
lifetime as a politician, which admittedly is not all that long I 
have been speaking and writing on this issue.  I was only elected 
in 1993 so it has been about seven years now.  I am fortunate 
that, with the co-operation of the newspaper in my riding of 
Prince George—Peace River, I have been writing a weekly column 
for over seven years.  I have probably written a dozen times on 
this single issue of youth justice and the need to reform the 
Young Offenders Act to accomplish those two important goals: to 
hold young criminals accountable and responsible for their 
actions while at the same time respecting the rights of and the 
need to protect the vast majority of young people who are law 
abiding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me it is a bit of a sad testament that all of us, regardless 
of what party we are from, have had to talk and talk and talk 
about this issue for so long with so very little happening.  In 
the last parliament a lot of work was done by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights as it travelled across the 
country holding hearings.  Dozens, hundreds, of Canadians 
participated in those hearings.  They came as witnesses 
willingly.  They gave up their own time to come and relate their 
feelings about this important issue to parliamentarians, in the 
hope that something would change.  That was back in 1996 and 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present justice minister was appointed following the 
election of 1997, so she has been in this position now for over 
three years.  She said her number one priority was to bring about 
these changes.  Finally in March 1999, almost two years after she 
took the office, she introduced Bill C-68, not to be confused 
with the infamous Liberal gun registration bill.  Of course that 
bill died on the order paper when parliament was prorogued in the 
fall of 1999, and it was reintroduced as Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly what Bill C-3 means to people and what it proves to 
people is that the government simply is not listening. It is not 
listening, and what clearer way to demonstrate that. 
Bill C-3 is the Liberal effort at youth justice.  There are the 
3,133 amendments to Bill C-3.  What is important is not that 
there were so many amendments, because obviously political 
opposition parties will use the process of amendments as a 
delaying tactic, or that the Canadian Alliance put forward 
roughly 50 amendments to Bill C-3 which were well thought out and 
well intended.  What is really notable is that the government put 
forward 150 amendments to its own bill.  This must indicate how 
badly flawed its legislation is when it had to bring forward 150 
amendments.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What frightens me is that Bill C-3 and its amendments, 
undoubtedly because of the sheer enormity of the task ahead of us 
as parliamentarians to try and sort through over 3,000 
amendments, will be passed by the government because it has a 
majority.  I suspect it will bring in time allocation, as it has 
countless other times, and will ram a bill through the House that 
it very well knows is deeply flawed.  It will then be up to the 
courts to try and deal with the mess later.  What an absolutely 
ridiculous way to pass legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do Canadians want?  I believe it is not a long list. 
Canadians want sentences to fit the crime.  They want violent 
criminals removed from society.  They want effective crime 
prevention programs in schools to save younger children brought 
into the system so they can get the help they need.  They want 
older teens and violent criminals to face adult court.  They want 
the names of violent and sexual assault criminals to be published 
so that everyone knows about them.  They want the rights of 
victims to be paramount to that of the criminal irrespective of 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that Bill C-3 does not contain any of the 
priorities that Canadians want to see addressed with the reform 
of the Young Offenders Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the time when 
the Liberal Party could describe itself as a social democrat 
party is long gone. Everybody remembers the time when Prime 
Minister Trudeau bragged about being a social democrat and 
introduced in parliament many bills taking into account the 
concerns of those members of parliament who were sincerely 
interested in their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the Liberal Party become a right wing party almost 
overnight and to everybody's surprise? I submit that the change 
can be explained by the imminence of an election. On the eve of 
an election, the Liberal Party has the unfortunate habit of 
spending indiscriminately and of adopting specific ideas to try 
to please different groups, be it from the west, from Quebec or 
from the maritimes. That is what the Liberal Party does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to be said, and people have to know and remember it. 
Quebec's approach young offenders is much more humane and more 
focused on rehabilitation. Curiously enough, the area of Canada 
where the repeat offence rate is the lowest is Quebec, where we 
take these young people, we work with them, we help them, we 
support them and we try to put them back on the right track. The 
members opposite like to say how beautiful and great Canada is, 
but as for young offenders, it is Quebec that gets the best 
results.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we, as lawmakers, change what is being done in Quebec 
to implement a Canadian model that is more rigid? Is there an 
hon. member in this House who can explain to me what principle 
dictates that we should legislate the wrong way around? They do 
not care about what works, while they should. I say this not to 
play party politics, but to inform our viewers. We should take a 
look and ask ourselves some questions. Where is the situation 
best dealt with? Is there a place in Canada where we get better 
results? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just so happens that Quebec gets better results with young 
offenders. There are statistics and data supporting this, and the 
approach is different. Would it not be smart to follow the 
example of the government that has the best results? Would hon. 
members not be commended for taking Quebec's approach? They could 
decide that, since the results are better, they could 
improve their system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, no, they make it harsher. Not only do they make it harsher 
in the rest of Canada, to please voters in western Canada who 
share this view, which is really inconceivable, but they also 
want to influence Quebec's system. They want Quebec's system 
to become harsher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did anyone ever see a government that legislates the wrong way 
around more than this one? The government will go even further. In 
the one place that gets the best results, the government will 
ensure that the same rules will apply as in the rest of Canada. 
We do not want the lowest common denominator. We do not want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader made the unfortunate mistake of 
saying that we were wasting the money of the House of Commons 
with all our amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the government House leader's reasoning on the Bloc 
Quebecois amendments “All your salaries, the electricity, the 
fact that parliament is kept open, this is a waste of money”. 
However, when the 200 amendments introduced by the Minister of 
Justice, because she did not do her job right, are being 
examined, this is not a waste of people's money. 
Interestingly, for the Liberal government—I hope that 
citizens who are listening will take note—when Bloc amendments 
are being examined, we are wasting the government's money; when 
Liberal Party amendments are being examined, this is good. I am 
baffled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we listen to the government, if we follow such reasoning to 
its logical conclusion, let us close parliament, let us stop 
talking about all these things, because we are wasting money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have this debate because we deeply 
believe that for a 14 year old who is sentenced to a minimum of 
about 15 years in a penitentiary, that is a very long time. 
We know how sentencing works for very serious crimes. An offender 
with a life sentence will spend 15 or 20 years in a penitentiary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a parent in Quebec or in the rest of Canada who does 
not understand that his child, a 14 year old, could end up in a 
federal penitentiary for 15 or 20 year, if convicted of a 
serious crime committed out of youthful aberration, out of total 
carelessness or because of a more serious problem?  Is there 
anyone listening tonight who believes that when he is released 
at 29 or 34, the young offender sentenced when he was 14 years 
old will have any chance at all of becoming a normal citizen? No 
one thinks so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being asked to scrap human beings.  We are being asked to 
destroy their lives. Out of rage, or lord knows what mental 
process, they are asking us in Quebec to abolish a rehabilitation 
program which is, by far, giving the best results in Canada, and 
to replace it with a system that will put 14 year old 
children—it could be your son, my son or my daughter—behind 
bars, in a penitentiary, until they are 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means a life completely thrown away, an unspeakable 
reprimand, an indescribable approach, which has nothing to do 
with patience, tolerance or the capacity a society has to support 
its deviant members and to turn them into responsible citizens. 
That is what we have done with young offenders in Quebec, and we 
have succeeded in 98% of the cases.  We must not forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a political issue, it is a human issue. 
All the associations in Quebec that take an interest in these 
issues are unanimous, not because they support the Bloc 
Quebecois, not because they are all mean separatists, but rather 
because they are human. They have an open approach, believe in 
what we do, and want to save human beings, not destroy their 
lives. They are profoundly convinced that our past is a 
guarantee of our future, and they believe in good faith that 
Quebec may have a contribution to make to the rest of Canada in 
terms of rehabilitating offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking her colleagues to think about it. I am also asking 
our colleagues of the other parties to do so. She said it dozens 
of times in the House, and everybody heard it. It was in the 
debates of the House, in <I>Hansard</I>. We heard it and people who 
usually listen to us heard it. She repeated it on all television 
stations, in all the newspapers of Canada and said it many times 
to my colleague, the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, who was 
questioning her. She said “The bill is good. The member does not 
understand it. Quebec does not have to apply this bill that way. 
It will be able to apply its system, as it did in the past. The 
bill will not compel it to use the new system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the member for Berthier—Montcalm, who is a lawyer, a 
jurist, a serious man who has given it thought and discussed the 
issue with people from Quebec, disagreed. He told the minister 
over and over again “This is not true. This is not what we are 
being told. This is not what the judges are telling us. This is 
not what the lawyers are telling us. We cannot all be insane in 
Quebec. There must be someone who is right somewhere. The 
minister has to be wrong”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the minister kept saying “Quebec will not have to 
enforce this act. There is no problem. It will not change the 
system in place. It will only give the rest of Canada the means 
to satisfy its needs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking members opposite, particularly the Liberal 
members from Quebec, in front of all the people watching us if 
what the minister has been repeating dozens of times in the House 
is true, why does she refuse to add a short sentence in the bill 
to the effect that Quebec will not have to enforce the act. She 
has said so in this House. Why not write it down, then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say in front of the cameras to the people in Quebec and 
the rest of Canada, that I have personnally 
offered to the government House leader to have the 
bill passed in less than 30 minutes if he were to agree to 
include in the legislation one little sentence that the minister 
must have repeated 10, 15 or 20 times in the House, to 
the effect that the system in Quebec will not be affected and 
Quebec can choose to ignore this legislation. If the minister 
were to put this in the bill, we would pass it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Our right to opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> If our right to opt out is not upheld,

reason to stay in this federation.
