</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this month the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada and 
several other volunteer organizations from coast to coast are 
hosting a variety of activities and events to raise public 
awareness about learning disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately three million Canadians of all ages—children, 
youth and adults—are challenged with learning disabilities.  My 
20 year career as a teacher taught me that learning disabilities 
are not limited or confined to classrooms.  Learning disabilities 
affect all aspects of human and social functioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students with learning disabilities are twice as likely to drop 
out of high school than their non-disabled peers.  Studies have 
also shown links between learning disabilities and the rates of 
adolescent suicide, young offenders, adult inmates and teenage 
mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move into the new millennium it is vital that all 
Canadians obtain appropriate learning skills and we thank all 
those involved in this very worthwhile endeavour.

gives me great pleasure to rise today to offer congratulations to 
one of Canada's stars, my favourite jazz musician, Diana Krall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diana, a native of Nanaimo, B.C., was recently nominated for 
three Grammys, including album of the year.  On February 23 Diana 
won her first Grammy for best jazz vocal performance for her 
album <I>When I Look in Your Eyes</I>.  This is an amazing 
achievement and a welcome acknowledgement of her talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just listen to how the critics sing her praises:  “A rapidly 
emerging jazz artist”.  “She swings, she flirts, she makes you 
want to cry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diana has the first ever certified platinum jazz album in Canada 
and six albums to date.  She has made the often hard journey to 
jazz stardom and yet combines the inspiration of a child with the 
voice of experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Growing up in Nanaimo she was influenced by her father and 
family's love for music.  Her music has taken her around the 
world but she has not forgotten her Nanaimo roots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate Diana.  We are all very proud of her.

conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference brought together over 350 students and 59 
guidance counsellors to hear from 48 senior business leaders of 
Manitoba based companies.  The idea was that Manitoba business 
leaders could best provide today's students with valuable 
information regarding the tremendous opportunities that exist 
within Manitoba, and that the future is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand to offer my congratulations to the entire team at

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my honour to rise today to congratulate the federal government 
for its decision to support Toronto's bid to host the 2008 Summer 
Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These games are an occasion where athletes come together in the 
spirit of sportsmanship to compete for the title of the world's 
best.  The Olympic Games would give Toronto the opportunity to 
host a celebration of world sport and culture in 2008 and create 
a legacy for our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10,000 athletes, 5,000 coaches and staff, 50,000 volunteers 
and an additional 50,000 sponsors and guests create a force for 
Toronto's bid which is undeniable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the strength of our team, the success of this bid would 
showcase our leading edge expertise, technology, creativity and 
innovation on the world stage.  This would foster the excellence 
of Canadian talent and integrate our heritage and cultural 
achievements into all aspects of the vision of the games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The engagement of Toronto's communities, neighbourhoods and 
residents would allow us to celebrate our athletes, city and 
country with the world.  It is time to share Canada's best kept 
secret, the city of Toronto, with the rest of the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 
22, a report by the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada 
revealed that the educational level in Canada, which already 
enjoys a very decent standing among the member countries of the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the OECD, 
has risen considerably over the last decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, 43% of Canadians between the ages of 25 and 54 had 
completed post-secondary education, while in 1998 this figure had 
risen to 54%. 
The percentage of Canadians who had completed post-secondary 
education in 1996 was 48%, while the average in member countries 
was 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is involved in the development and 
training of our youth.  Whether through training or placement 
programs, we are aware of the importance of focusing energies 
and resources on equipping Canada for the challenges of the 2000s.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The merger of Air Canada and Canadian has resulted in 
significant reductions in service to the Penticton Regional 
Airport.  Today Canadian Regional has given notice that it 
intends to eliminate Dash 8 service.  That means more than 100 
seats a day will no longer be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Penticton Regional Airport is vital to the economy of the 
whole South Okanagan.  It provides a direct link to our busy 
convention centre, agri-tourism industry and expanding high 
technology sector.  When Dash 8 service is eliminated there will 
not even be enough seats servicing the region to meet current 
demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada made a commitment to the federal government that it 
would maintain air service to small communities for a minimum of 
three years.  The people of the South Okanagan expect the 
Minister of Transport to enforce this commitment.  The economy of 
the South Okanagan depends on it.

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
budget is spectacular; that is not too strong a word to describe 
the tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is re-indexing personal income tax—a considerable 
departure from the policies and decisions of the previous 
Conservative government.  This measure will protect Canadian 
taxpayers against inflation as far as taxation is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give some examples of the impact of the tax measures 
contained in this latest budget, a typical four person family 
with one wage earner and a total income of $35,000 will not pay 
any net federal tax, while a typical four person family with an 
income of $40,000 will pay at least $1,623 less net federal tax, 
or 48% less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts made in our last three budgets, coupled with those in 
the five year plan, will bring down income tax for all Canadians 
by at least 22% by the year 2004.  Families with children will 
benefit even more.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
budget, the Minister of Finance finally announced reductions in 
income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What reductions?  This year?  No, next year.  Such election 
opportunism.  However, the federal government had all the 
manoeuvring room it needed to introduce it this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the unemployed?  Nothing, no change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it be this year for regional development or the long 
awaited municipal infrastructures program?  No, not before 2001, 
and with a budget of only $100 million.  The rest will come 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this government does not need coaxing to establish new 
programs or new foundations, including in the area of the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It even dared to give the Minister of Human Resources 
Development new responsibilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to follow through in its support of basic 
research, especially social science research.  I also urge 
continued support for the NRC, a flagship of federal science and 
an invigorated commitment to research in the north.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
week's lesson for the solicitor general focuses on a required 
attitude adjustment of one of his departments, which seems to 
have grown beyond his control.  Once again Correctional Service 
Canada has been criticized by one its friends, the Elizabeth Fry 
Society, for being arrogant and unaccountable.

Canada as— 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—very insular, insecure yet self-righteously arrogant 
governmental department, where prisoners or anyone who questions 
CSC's actions are similarly relegated to the margins and 
classified as unimportant and misinformed, regardless of the 
seriousness and implications of the matters raised.  All energies 
seemed to be focused upon efforts to (confuse) the issues, 
discredit any perceived detractors and continue on with business 
as usual. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This analysis comes from an organization that works extensively 
with CSC.  These attitudes come straight from the very top.  The 
commissioner thinks he is untouchable.  It is up to the solicitor 
general to show this man who is the boss.

today Premier Bernard Lord of New Brunswick announced that tolls 
are to be removed from the New Brunswick section of the 
Trans-Canada Highway, just as he promised months ago.  The 
previous Liberal government created this toll highway and 
established legislation forcing all trucks from Prince Edward 
Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland through the tolls, 
effectively transferring money from all the other provinces into 
New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is a New Brunswick toll highway, the tolls affected 
all of the Atlantic provinces, and I would personally like to 
compliment the member for St. John's East for his tireless 
efforts to seek fair treatment for the citizens of Newfoundland 
and its industries.  As well, the member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac was very much involved with this lengthy 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This now puts the focus on the only section of the Trans-Canada 
Highway in Canada that has a toll charge left, and that is the 
section through Nova Scotia.  Again, a former Liberal government 
established this toll highway and it is now left to others to 
find a way to eliminate the last Trans-Canada toll highway.

Speaker, for weeks now the Prime Minister has been saying that 
there is nothing wrong with how the government handles grants and 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as of today there are two RCMP investigations and a 
forensic audit under way in the Prime Minister's riding alone. 
They are not there investigating parking violations.  They are 
investigating the misuse and misappropriation of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the RCMP thinks there is a problem with grants and 
contributions, why does the Minister of Human Resources 
Development not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is referring to two or three matters out 
of some 30,000 applications.  We do not treat the matter lightly. 
We want to see things looked into thoroughly.  We want to see 
action taken on any problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Leader of the Opposition gets up like this without a 
word about the budget, not a question, not a criticism and not a 
concern, what an endorsement and what a vote of confidence.  He 
may actually vote on our side on the budget speech.  Thanks for 
the endorsement of our wonderful budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the misspending of taxpayer dollars is precisely what 
HRD did with our taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two or three little investigations are taking place in the 
Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we should not be surprised, given how many people 
close to the Prime Minister are involved in manipulating the 
grant handling process; people like Denise Tremblay and René

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

correct them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's misuse of the rules of the House to create

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

about misuse of the rules of the House.  People are concerned 
about the misuse of taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recap.  We have René Fugère, a man who claimed to be 
acting on behalf of the Prime Minister, under investigation for 
illegal lobbying.  We have CITEC under investigation for misusing 
public funds.  We have a forensic audit into a textile factory 
that moved from Montreal to the Prime Minister's riding without 
any business reason.  The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister continue to claim that he is only 
doing his job as an MP when so much of what he touches attracts 
the RCMP? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at least one of these investigations is under way 
because the Prime Minister's office asked the RCMP to look into 
the matter.  This shows that the Prime Minister and his staff are 
doing their jobs in the appropriate way and that the Prime 
Minister, his staff and all of us are concerned about the proper 
use of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party leader, in trying to deflect attention from the 
trouble he is having keeping his own job, keeping his party in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
can see the Liberals' campaign slogan “Calling all cars:  We 
need help here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring we asked the Prime Minister time after time about 
the several questionable grants and contributions to his own 
riding.  Even though these grants involved individuals with 
chequered pasts—we know they had personal business dealings with 
the Prime Minister—he claimed he was only doing the work of a 
good MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that doing the work of good little MPs results in RCMP 
investigations in their ridings? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

few projects that we are handling with the appropriate 
authorities.  There are thousands of projects that are making a 
difference in the lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is absolutely clear by the questions being asked by that 
party is that they do not believe that the Government of Canada 
can support individuals. 
They talk about briefs.  What we know to be true is that this is 
money that will help Canadians with disabilities, young people 
and people who do not have a chance for a job.  We on this side 
of the House believe in those investments.

general is also wrong and does not know what he is talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder the hon. member in her previous question said that we

it will take two things to resolve the problems in health care:

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of money, over the last two years we have increased the 
cash transfers to the provinces for health by 25%.  In terms of

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very straightforward.  How bad does the health

except for $251.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

issued the 10,000 projects so that members of parliament could 
know where the investments were being made in their ridings, this

We have brought information from seven different data bases in

so unreliable that they cannot be depended on when she hands them 
out.  Here is just one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list we obtained under access legislation shows that three 
projects received grants in the riding of Madawaska—Restigouche 
held by the Liberals at the time, but the minister's list assigns 
these same projects to other ridings even though they are still 
in Madawaska—Restigouche.  One is a college.  Are the minister's

with?

to the House that this project is making a real difference in a 
part of the country where unemployment was over 30%.  We expected 
to create 62 jobs and we have created 66. Ninety-two per cent of 
those employed are aboriginals.

government has introduced legislation to protect transboundary 
waters.  At present the Minister of the Environment is trying to 
protect Canada's water resources through a federal-provincial 
accord aimed at prohibiting bulk water removal from drainage 
basins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Minister of the Environment tell the House whether he 
has reached an agreement with all provinces and territories?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we do not yet have agreement of all provinces to the 
accord.  However, since last reporting to the House, Manitoba has 
introduced legislation which is entirely consistent with the 
accord. In addition, it has taken a position with respect to the 
Devil's Lake diversion in North Dakota which again supports the 
approach of the accord.  I am hoping that province will quickly 
come aboard with the accord itself, sign on to the accord and 
that the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan and Alberta will 
do the same in support of their fellow prairie province.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We took the minister up on her offer that if we phoned her

Paul Martin, Sr. when he was working on the establishment of 
hospital insurance, the forerunner of medicare.  On the day that 
it was proclaimed Mr. Malcolm Taylor had this to say: “Paul 
Martin, like Moses, was denied the opportunity of leading his 
people into the promised land”.  Nevertheless, his dream, the 
founding of hospitalization, the forerunner to medicare, was now 
a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Finance.  In his budget, why 
is he now allowing Alberta and Ontario to turn his father's dream 
into something like a two tier health care nightmare?  Why is he

to assist medicare and health care in this country?

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>AMENDMENTS TO BILL C-20 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you have 
before you the member for Rimouski—Mitis, who is deeply saddened 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell you about an extremely serious situation. I had 
never ever imagined that such a shameful thing could take place 
in this archetype of democracy in Canada. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, February 29, 2000, the deputy principal clerk sent a 
letter to the office of the Bloc Quebecois leader, a letter 
which I am prepared to table, if you ask me to do so. 
This letter lists various reasons to support the 
rejection of 700 motions in amendment tabled by the Bloc 
Quebecois, at report stage of Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of these 700 amendments had not been sent to the Journals 
Branch, and this was cited to me an example of reasons to reject 
amendments. I have these two amendments with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Copies of these amendments, which bear reference numbers 5180 
and 5163, were given to me by the deputy clerk, and I can also 
table them. Again, these two amendments were never sent by the 
Bloc Quebecois to the Journals Branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following inquiries by the office of the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois to obtain clarification and explanation, it was 
apparently admitted that an administrative error had taken 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told that, because of the large number of amendments 
tabled, the clerks worked—and this is what it is important that 
you hear, Mr. Speaker—from the legislative counsel's data bank 
rather than from the paper copies we tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the relationship of confidentiality that must exist 
between the legislative counsel and the members who ask him to 
draft amendments—and you know how important this relationship of 
confidentiality and trust is—this is an unacceptable breach of 
the rights and privileges of Bloc Quebecois members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am truly almost speechless, although I still have lots of 
energy left to protest this serious breach of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does one describe such a serious breach in parliament 
itself, a place that should be the very embodiment of democracy? 
We are entitled to ask ourselves some very, very serious 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the explanation lie in the nature of Bill C-20, which, 
however much the government protests, focuses exclusively on the 
future of Quebec?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I appeal solemnly to your sense of justice and 
objectivity.  The nature of your function makes you the 
guardian of the rights and privileges of the House of Commons as 
an institution and of the members that compose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that this is a breach of the fundamental 
freedom of speech of Bloc Quebecois members and of all members 
of the House.  In this regard, I quote from page 261 of Marleau 
and Montpetit, which says that freedom of speech is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a fundamental right without which they would be hampered in the 
performance of their duties. 
It permits them to speak in the House without inhibition, to 
refer to any matter or express any opinion as they see fit, to 
say what they feel needs in the furtherance of the national 
interest and the aspirations of their constituents. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This action imperils these rights, which everyone recognizes as 
fundamental.  Rejection of amendments we had not even introduced 
has infringed upon our most basic right, namely our ability as 
parliamentarians to choose which amendments we wish to introduce 
or not to introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is more.  In accordance with the technical advice 
received from House staff, we submitted a new list of 
amendments which were again rejected. 
This constitutes not only an attack on parliamentary privilege, 
but also, I would add, contempt of the House, because these acts 
are of such a nature as to directly or indirectly impede the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois in the performance of their 
duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Speaker Sauvé stated in a 1980 ruling cited in Marleau and 
Montpetit, page 67: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While our privileges are defined, contempt of the House has no 
limits.  When new ways are found to interfere with our 
proceedings, so too will the House, in appropriate cases, be 
able to find that a contempt of the House has occurred. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative for you to consider that there has been a 
breach of the privileges of the Bloc Quebecois and contempt of 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation leads me to wonder about the future, particularly 
in the days to come when we shall be initiating the debate at 
report stage of Bill C-20, and about what treatment those of us 
in the Bloc Quebecois can expect from the House and its staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should you accept my question of privilege, I am prepared to 
introduce the appropriate motion for the entire matter to be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I will first hear the government House leader, but 
I accept the hon. member's proposal to table these documents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the deputy leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois has brought two different matters to the 
attention of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the fact that her party's amendments were rejected. 
She is relating the fact that the rejected amendments were in 
draft form only and had been submitted without her approval it 
seems. The second is that the legislative counsel in the 
preparation of bills could, apparently, give information to the 
staff of the Speaker of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these are the two matters raised by the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, Mr. Speaker, those who support you, that is the clerks of 
the House, rejected on your behalf amendments that were 
apparently not—and I mean “apparently not”, because I have not 
seen the documents in question—formally introduced, the matter is 
a dead issue, in my opinion, since, if the members had no 
intention of formally introducing any amendments, the fact of 
having them rejected is of no consequence.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must take a moment in this whole exercise to look at 
what we are doing to all those who support us so well in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this at all levels for the people working for us.  We are 
creating impossible situations for those working in parliament 
with results that such impossible situations may cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, there are on the Order Paper, I think, 406 amendments 
to a bill of no more than a page and a half in length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> So withdraw it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> That is our privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> No, no, it is nobody's privilege and I will 
get back to this later on. Second— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> We are not in a dictatorship, here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. This is a question of privilege that 
concerns all members and I would like to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Recently, we had a situation where we had to 
deal with close to 500 amendments. If I am not mistaken, there 
were 471, but these amendments concerned a bill that had 
hundreds of pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, we are faced with the threat of 1,000 amendments to a bill 
that is one and a half page long. 
Those who set the rules of this House—and it is not I, but those 
who came before me—of this Canadian parliamentary democracy opted 
for the British model, never intended, of course, for you, me or 
this House, that the purpose of the report stage of a bill would 
be to stop the legislative process. That was definitely not the 
intention of those who made these rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating such situations, we tax the system in this place to 
the point where parliament is totally paralysed, and we have to 
live with the result. 
The result, according to members opposite—and I cannot even know 
if the allegation is true or false—is that those who support you 
are so overburdened by the excess work that, according to the 
accusers, they are unable to do justice to the Chair regarding 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with their analysis, but let us not forget the 
root cause of what is going on in this parliament. What is going 
on is that some members want to prevent parliament from 
legislating, by resorting to tools that do not even exist. Those 
who want to do that are, in my opinion, doing something totally 
unacceptable. When I say this, I am not imputing any motives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> He is indeed imputing motives, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> No, I am merely repeating— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please.  I wish to hear what the member has 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not believe I am imputing 
motives and it is up to you to decide, which you will do with 
your customary wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that members said in their testimony before 
parliamentary committees that they intended to introduce 
amendments in this House with the ultimate goal of bringing 
parliament to a halt. I am not imputing motives. I am merely 
repeating what the members who are making accusations against 
those working for you today in the House have threatened to do. 
This is the result of the situation we find ourselves in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could table the statements I have just described, Mr. Speaker, 
to the effect that they intended to bring parliament to a halt 
by bogging it down with all this work.

your work.  Those working for you do their jobs not just well, 
but extremely well.  I congratulate them and you on the work you 
do, which is to represent and lead us well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I do not wish a debate, but I see that the hon. 
member for Rimouski—Mitis would like to add something, after 
which I will recognize the official opposition's House leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to add a small clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said that the bundle of documents we submitted was not 
used, it is because the clerk who shares space with the 
legislative counsel consulted the counsel's data base. 
Therefore, he saw on the legislative counsel's computer, to be 
more specific, all of the amendments in the data base.  It is 
that data base that was used to deny our amendments, including 
two that had never been introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I say that there has been contempt of this House. 
Someone went into a computer, that of the legislative counsel, 
in whom we have every confidence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is clear to me that the government House leader is upset with the 
number of amendments put forward.  I know you will deal as best 
as you can with whether they are in order, how they will be 
grouped and all that.  We have to leave it to you and your staff 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It obvious to me that what has happened here again is that we 
have the government bringing forward a very controversial bill. 
It has limited debate in the House of Commons.  It went to 
committee and it limited the debate in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It refused to let the committee travel.  It refused to let the 
committee have a full list of witnesses.  At every opportunity it 
refused to allow the opposition parties, whether for or against 
the bill, to have ample opportunity to discuss the bill in its 
entirety, clause by clause, to get a full hearing of it.  It 
disallowed any travel whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is crocodile tears from the government House leader to say 
that someone is obstructing the business of government when we 
repeatedly see a record number of time allocation and closure 
motions by the government.  Time after time the government has 
been stepping in not to interrupt the operations of government 
but the operations of democracy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are two matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I wish to state that, given the speech by the government 
House leader of a few minutes ago, which was melodramatic to say 
the least, it is not in any way our intention in this question 
of privilege to challenge the excellent work of all of the House 
of Commons staff.  That is not the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two questions were raised.  The totally inappropriate imputing 
of motives by the government House leader in his speech just now 
notwithstanding, there are two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a relationship of confidentiality with the legislative 
counsels.  We worked with one of them in drafting a number of 
amendments. 
A number of the amendments we had prepared were tabled.  I 
believe it to be the most basic of our privileges to select 
which ones to table and which not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noted something that gives us cause for concern. The 
government House leader said “They were not tabled, not 
selected, no problem”.  The problem is that we now have doubts 
about the confidentiality of our relationship with the 
legislative counsels.  It appears that the clerks, which ones I 
cannot say, used the legislative counsels' data base, which 
ought to be confidential.  That is where the problem lies. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other problem is that the Deputy Principal Clerk pointed out 
to us that a number of our amendments were rejected for 
technical reasons.  He explained the technical reasons for the 
rejection of these amendments.  We relied on what he said and 
not on the remarks of the legislative counsel, as the government 
House leader intimated. We relied on what the Deputy Principal 
Clerk had to say.  We followed his recommendations.  We reworked 
the amendments and resubmitted them and they were again 
rejected.  It seems there is a bit of a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the government House leader and his remarks 
oddly enough made me think of those who justified barn burnings 
as a means to fight against the sovereignist movement.  We have

will translate into a better quality of life for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about two issues.  I want to talk about health 
care and I want to talk about the specific budget provision on 
extending maternity and parental leave to a full year which was 
announced in the budget.  It is something I support very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too long ago the National Forum on Health did a two year 
comprehensive study.  Experts in the health care system of Canada 
did a study and concluded that there was enough money in the 
health care system.  They also observed that about $11 billion in 
the health care system was not being spent wisely.  They 
recommended that we need to spend more prudently and more wisely 
in terms of our valuable health care dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario Premier Mike Harris has recently gone on a tirade of 
blaming the federal government.  There were cuts which all 
Canadians took right across the board, including the federal 
government, and yes there were some cuts in health care. What was 
the response of Mike Harris?  He closed hospitals. He also 
downsized beds in other hospitals.  He spent millions of dollars 
firing nurses.  He created a crisis, just like John Snobelen who 
said, “We have to create a crisis in education. Then we can try 
to fix it and then we are going to be heroes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here it is again.  Mike Harris on the front page of the 
newspapers is blaming the federal government and saying that “If 
we do not get this fixed, and the federal government does not fix 
it, what are we going to do?  We are going to have user fees just 
like Ralph Klein”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that in the last budget $11.5 billion was increased in 
the CHST to the provinces of which $3.5 billion was available to 
the province of Ontario?  How much of the $3.5 billion has Mike 
Harris taken already that is available to him immediately?  Eight 
hundred million dollars.  He still has $2.7 billion that he has 
not even drawn down in addition to his share of the $2.5 billion 
which has just been advanced in budget 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else did he say?  He said, “We have a crisis in health 
care.  Everything is a problem and it is all the federal 
government's fault, but what are we going to do?  We are going to 
spend $4.3 billion on tax cuts and still have a deficit”. 
Deficits are financing tax cuts and everyone knows that health 
care is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the analysis of Mike Harris maybe we should suggest that 
he seek some of that health care, mental health care.  But I am 
not going to suggest that.  The reason is that he closed down 10 
mental health institutions in Ontario since he was elected as 
premier.  He cannot go to a mental health institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact 35% of the homeless in Toronto and across the country 
are people who suffer from mental health problems. He is blaming 
homelessness on the federal government yet he is the one who 
closed those institutions. He is the one who decided that health 
care was not a priority in Ontario.  He said it was tax cuts.  He 
created a crisis in health care, but the money is there. Today he 
is saying he needs money. Well, the money is there.  Mike Harris, 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to something a little more constructive, 
rather than talk about a premier who is doing a disservice to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget provides that the parental and maternity leave 
benefits under EI be extended, doubled to a full year.  This is a 
subject I have a lot of interest in because I had a private 
member's bill some time ago on the same issue. I am very pleased. 
The best outcome for a private member's bill is to have it 
adopted by the government and implemented quickly along with the 
other budget provisions. I do not want to talk about the dollars 
and the cents. I want to talk about why I wanted to see that in 
the budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to chair a committee on investing in 
children and valuing our caregivers.  I want to share some of the 
observations and some of the principles which we would like to 
follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caregiver policies should be child centred and promote the 
best interests of children to the greatest extent possible.  We 
thought we should presume that parents are the primary 
caregivers. They are in the best position to determine the best 
possible care arrangements for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also thought policies should be flexible with the right 
options and choices and make it feasible for either parent to 
provide care.  We also thought they should be inclusive and 
responsive to the social realities and circumstances of parents 
and their children.  They should be fair and equitable and 
neither penalize nor compel specific caregiving choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth 
found that 25% of Canada's children are entering adult life with 
significant emotional, behavioural, academic or social problems. 
In the words of Dr. Paul Steinhauer of Voices for Children, with 
one in four children entering adult life significantly 
handicapped, we can look forward to a society that will be less 
able to generate the economic base required to supply the social 
supports and services needed by one in four adults unable to 
carry their own weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to look at this more, so I found a research study which 
came out of a White House conference in 1997.  One of the 
principal findings was that the neurological foundations for 
rational thinking, problem solving and general reasoning appear 
to be established by age one.  It also found that at birth the 
human brain is far from fully formed and it is estimated that 
about 80% of the lifetime development of the human brain is 
complete by age three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This got me thinking that the early years of childhood 
development are extremely important. Dr. Fraser Mustard, who 
appeared before the HRD committee described the first year of 
human life as being dynamite in terms of neural development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Breast feeding is also an important implication.  I came across 
a study done in April 1998.  Dr. Christopher Ruhm of the 
University of North Carolina published a research paper entitled 
“Parental Leave and Child Health”. He studied 25 years of 
population data in nine European countries.  He found a 29% 
reduction in infant mortality where parental leave of at least 50 
weeks was taken.  This is unbelievable.  He is basically saying 
that when a child gets secure, consistent attachment with an 
engaged, committed adult during its first year, healthier 
outcomes do occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one of the reasons that the committee which I chaired 
recommended doubling the maternity and parental leave benefits. 
Parents could then have the option to provide direct parental 
care during that vital first year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To follow that up, when we had the debate in the House on 
taxation of the family, the finance minister asked the finance 
committee to review taxation of the family to determine whether 
or not there were some areas to cover.  I will not go into the 
details of the report but one of our three principal 
recommendations was to extend maternity and parental leave to a 
full year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the budget proposes that the time be doubled to one 
year.  Currently there is a two week waiting period, 15 weeks of 
maternity leave and an optional 10 weeks for parental leave. When 
this is taken altogether and an additional 35 weeks of optional 
parental leave is added, it means parents will have the 
opportunity to have one of them with their child during the vital 
first year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also took the advice of the finance subcommittee 
to reduce the number of hours from 700 to 600 of insurable hours 
to qualify and it said that if the second parent decided to take 
some of that time off, the two week waiting period would be 
waived.  This is even more of a benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking at some numbers.  People have said to me that they 
cannot afford to live if they withdraw from their jobs. They 
cannot afford to receive just the benefits with a maximum of 
about $413. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It dawned on me when I looked at when both parents are working 
and they have an infant child, they have to pay for child care 
expenses. Although there is a child care expense deduction, that 
deduction is only available to the lowest income earner of the 
two spouses. It usually means they are only getting a refund or a 
benefit of about 25 cents on the dollar federally and 
provincially combined. They also have reduced Canada child tax 
benefits because that benefit which is payable to them is 
determined on the basis of family income.  There is a gradation 
as a result of combined family income.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thought of this very interesting and important point. 
When both parents work and the woman chooses not to use a breast 
pump to get mother's milk, they have to pay for baby formula. 
Premixed baby formula can cost up to $4,000 a year, which is 
after tax money.  It is the equivalent of getting paid about an 
additional $7,000 for that family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the other side.  What if somebody withdraws from the 
paid labour force to provide direct parental care because they 
felt their child needed it?  All of a sudden there is a higher 
Canada child tax benefit.  The spousal amount comes into play as 
well.  Even if they got the full EI benefits which are taxable, 
they still have their own personal amount to offset it.  They 
will not not use it all and there will an amount transferable to 
the spouse who is in the paid labour force which means there will 
be a further reduction of income taxes. The breast feeding 
savings alone are a very significant amount and they get the EI 
benefit for a full year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue for me is not the money.  The issue is children and 
how we invest in our children so that they are physically and 
mentally healthy.  The fact remains that all of the research I 
have seen indicates that when children get the kind of care they 
need during that vital first year, they have better physical, 
mental and social health outcomes.  And when that happens, and 
the national longitudinal survey says that 25% of our children 
are entering adult life with problems, the percentage of children 
with problems goes down.  That means we have lower health care 
costs, lower educational costs, lower social program costs and 
lower justice costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we know is that many children who have 
problems, including things like fetal alcohol syndrome, run afoul 
of the laws of Canada and end up in court.  I just wrote a 
monograph on that subject. The Minister of Justice confirmed to 
me that 50% of youth in the jails in Manitoba and Saskatchewan 
have fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we invested in our children.  We can invest in our 
children by valuing our caregivers and by making sure parents 
have the very best opportunity to provide the kind of care their 
child needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to understand that all parents do not live in urban 
centres.  Child care may not be accessible.  It may not be 
affordable.  There may not be another family member, close 
friend, or neighbour who is able to provide that care for their 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision of extending parental leave is a progressive move. 
It says to Canadian families across the country that there is 
another opportunity, option or choice for them to arrange their 
affairs to ensure that their children get the best possible care 
particularly in that first year of life. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of questions for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that when the health care system began, 
this project was to be funded 50% by the provinces and 50% by the 
federal government.  I think we are now down to about 16% for the 
federal government, or somewhere around 15%, and up to 85% and 
even higher for the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that in 1993 the government took a healthy chunk out 
of the transfer payments to the provinces which maintain health 
care.  In Alberta that resulted in about a 35% decrease in 
funding to provide health care services.  It was probably a 
higher amount in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing that the member would stand and condemn those 
provinces for trying to do something about the situation that 
exists in their provinces when it is the federal government that 
has created the problem by these extremely high cuts that have 
never come close to being replaced.  I would like his comment on 
what has happened to the 50:50 help.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the member as I do, I wonder how he feels about the 
millions and millions of dollars being spent by the government on 
RCMP investigations at HRDC, and all of the spending going on at 
the heritage department for films like <I>Bubbles Galore</I> and a 
committee on seniors and sexuality.  Those are a couple of 
examples of the hundreds of absolutely stupid things on which the 
government has spent money. I say stupid because that is what 
they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how he feels about this absolutely idiotic spending 
that goes on within his government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the 
member got his information, but there was $61 billion spent last 
year by all governments on health care.  In 2000-01, $31 billion 
will be transferred from the federal government under the CHST, 
of which $17 billion will be targeted to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also know that under the CHST, although it is 
calculated under health, post-secondary education and the social 
transfer, the provinces are not bound to spend the money in all 
of those areas.  There are no strings.  They have to spend it in 
that envelope, but it all could go to health, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, $3 billion is directly spent by the federal 
government on aboriginal health and on health care for the 
forces.  Therefore, $20 billion out of the $64 billion which is 
spent on health care is funded by the federal government, which 
equates to 31 cents on the dollar.  When we add the $9.5 billion 
in equalization payments, the total federal transfer is $40 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but the member seems to have his facts wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not disagree with the member's concerns about Mike 
Harris and the direction in which he is taking the province of 
Ontario, although I must say that these days I am having a bit of 
difficulty distinguishing between the Harris Conservatives and 
the federal Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the member is so concerned, why is the federal 
government inviting Mike Harris to do more damage?  Why is the 
government creating the opportunity, as it is doing through this 
budget, to allow Mike Harris to open up the Canada Health Act to 
make further inroads in privatized health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House must excuse me for being so blunt, but when it comes 
to the National Forum on health, the member is wrong, wrong, 
wrong.  The National Forum on Health was very clear about the 
need for the country to preserve and strengthen medicare.  It 
recommended enhancing medicare by putting in place a national 
home care plan, national drug coverage and reform at the primary 
health care level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything the government is doing is in the opposite direction. 
One of the key players in the national forum, Tom Kent, said that 
the government must ensure that cash transfers rise to 25% in the 
short run and that we aim for 50-50 down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the member ignoring important policy analysts like Tom 
Kent and Monique Bégin?  Why is the government ignoring the 
National Forum on Health?  Why is the government ignoring the 
advice of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, although the member said I 
am wrong, wrong, wrong, I did not comment on the points she 
raised, so I am not exactly sure how she got there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the National Forum on Health advised 
Canadians, as well as the government, that our health care system 
had the cash but it was not being spent wisely and that it was 
necessary to get together with the provinces to start 
rationalizing our health care system to make sure we deal with it 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that there are areas in which we have to 
provide some vision with regard to the longer term because we 
have an aging society and the demands on health care will 
increase.  We have put forward another $2.5 billion in one-time 
transitional funding for the provinces so that we will have the 
time to get together with them to discuss the future of health 
care and to do it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also invested $11.5 billion in health care in the previous 
budget, the single largest investment the government has ever 
made.  That represents a 25% increase over two years.  That 
reflects the commitment of the federal government.  The total 
support for health care and education will rise by $31 billion 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get together with the provinces the Government of Canada 
will be there defending the Canada Health Act, regardless of 
people like Mike Harris and Ralph Klein.  Canada will have one 
health care system and it will be for all Canadians; not because 
they have money, but because they need health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to comment on the 
budget.  I have been commenting on the mismanagement of public 
funds by the government over the last few weeks, but that all 
ties in to the budget and I want to make some remarks today in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years, in particular under the Liberal 
government, the budget has become much less a fiscal document and 
more of a political document.  This budget was no exception.  In 
fact it continued the trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget took what I would call a shotgun approach to 
government spending.  It has thinly spread new tax money in all 
directions, with no commitment to controlling taxpayer funds and 
virtually ignoring the tax strain on middle class families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the finance minister, in spite of the 
minister's undeserved reputation for good management, have 
actually overspent the budget terribly over the last few years. 
In 1997-98 the minister exceeded his projected spending by $3 
billion.  Remember, a billion dollars is like winning a lottery 
for $1 million, or winning the <I>Who Wants to be a 
Millionaire</I> program, except that a person would have to do 
that three times every day for a whole year to have it total $1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister, the so-called good manager, overspent in 
1997-98 by $3 billion.  In other words, he said he would spend 
$105 billion and he actually spent over $108 billion.  That was 
in 1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did he do in 1998-99?  He overspent again; not by $3 
billion, but by $7 billion.  If we ran our households or 
businesses that way we would be in real trouble.  Canadians know 
that, but the finance minister had no problem overspending in 
1997-98 and 1998-99, by $3 billion and $7 billion respectively, 
and he is still calling himself a good manager.  I have to wonder 
whether he lives in the real world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999-2000 he told us he would spend $111 billion.  Lo and 
behold, we find that what he actually will spend is $115 billion. 
That is overspending by $4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has a very poor track record for staying 
within his budget.  That is one of the points we want to make 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, he has gone on a spending spree.  Not content to 
overspend year by year from what he told us he was going to 
spend, he has now decided to go on a real spending spree.  Over 
the next five years he has promised a spending spree of $86 
billion.  That is money which Canadians will have to work to 
produce to funnel into the finance minister's treasure chest so 
that he can do all of the things he finds so enjoyable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go through the list, but almost no program spending 
will receive less this year than last year.  Even the human 
resources department, which has just been found by its own audit 
to have bungled at least $1 billion in spending, will get almost 
another quarter of a billion dollars to do the same thing.  I 
have to wonder if there is any prudence or good management left 
in the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister not only is continuing to spend, he has 
been spending huge amounts.  In the next two years he will 
increase program spending by $10 billion.  The finance minister 
tries to tell Canadians that he will give them some of their 
money back because he does not need it all.  He is taking more 
than he needs, so he will give back some of it.  However, we find 
that is not the case.  What he is really doing is using $86 
billion of that money, not to pay down our terrible debt, not to 
give it back to us so that we can do something for our families; 
no, he is going to spend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government spending money on and why?  What are its 
priorities?  Over the past number of years we heard that it would 
get rid of the GST.  That was its priority.  That was dropped. 
Then we heard that health care was its priority.  Then we heard 
that children were the priority.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Really, it is very clear, and becoming clearer year by year, 
that the real priority of the government is simply to be 
re-elected and to use our money in such a way as to persuade us 
to keep voting for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Liberal record.  In 1993 the Liberals came on 
the scene, put their hands over their hearts and said that they 
would be the saviours of the Canada Health Act.  Let us look at 
what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97 they cut transfers for health care by almost $4 
billion; this at a time when health care costs were rising due to 
new innovations.  Also, our population is aging.  What was the 
result?  Not a stronger health care system, but a weakened one 
under the Liberal government.  Not only have the Liberals cut 
health care, they have not even said that they would maintain any 
of the small increases which they finally announced, under much 
pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amuses me to hear Liberals trash premiers like Premier Harris 
when they are the authors of the misfortune of the health care 
system, which they love to blame on other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, with this budget, less than $1 billion more will go 
to health care.  That is less than $30 per Canadian which the 
government has dredged up to help a floundering health care 
system, which they helped to deadly wound.  In spite of the fact 
that they will spend $86 billion more over the next five years, 
$1 billion next year will go to health care.  In fact, this $1 
billion will not be dedicated to health care alone, it will be 
dedicated to health care and education.  The provinces will have 
to decide where to spend the money.  That inevitably means that 
less than $1 billion will be spent on health care, less than $1 
billion from a government that has $86 billion more to spend over 
the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have cut almost $25 billion out of health and 
social cash transfers since they came to power.  They put only $5 
billion back in the last two years.  In other words, for every 
dollar they put back they have slashed five, so they have barely 
begun to repair the damage they have done, and yet they love to 
blame other people and misrepresent other parties' positions on 
health care when they are the ones who have given a deadly wound 
to this important program for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to examine the whole area of tax cuts.  As hon. members 
know, the Liberals have had a great deal to say about the fact 
that they would cut taxes.  Let us look at what they have 
actually done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax cuts were announced at $58 billion.  That sounds like a 
good, big figure, does it not?  Let us look at the facts of this 
$58 billion tax cut, which will happen over five years.  I point 
out that $7.5 billion is actually not a tax cut at all, but an 
increase to the child tax benefit, which is really more social 
spending.  How more social spending equals a tax cut only a 
Liberal could explain, but it is definitely not a tax cut because 
somebody will have to put that money into the finance minister's 
hands so that he can offer it as a top-up to the child tax 
benefit.  The finance minister has already lost $7.5 billion from 
his $58 billion in so-called tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we look at the $30 billion that Canadians will have to pay 
over the next five years in increased CPP premiums.  Liberals 
like to say that this is really an investment in our pension, 
that it is not really a tax.  However, the fact is that there is 
nearly $500 billion worth of debt in the CPP system.  That money 
will not go to new pensions, it will be put into the finance 
minister's hands to pay for pensions which are already being 
received.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a debt.  This is an unfunded liability.  This increase 
in CPP spending will not benefit solely the people who are 
putting the money in.  It is going to pay off the debt the 
Liberals have run up in our pension system.  That is another 
$29.5 billion off the so-called $58.5 billion of tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have a very interesting Liberal sleight of hand which 
says “if we were going to tax you but decided not to, that is a 
tax cut.  It is not less than we are taxing now, but it actually 
cancels out some of the taxes we were going to charge”, like 
bracket creep, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, $13.5 billion falls into that category.  That leaves a 
real net tax relief over five years of $7.9 billion.  Over each 
of those years there is less than a $2 billion relief.  For each 
taxpayer that amounts to just over $100 a year in real tax relief 
or almost $9 a month.  Let us have a celebration.  Each taxpayer 
will get a grand cut from the finance minister of $2 a week.  I 
hope they do not spend it all in one place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the finance minister took over his portfolio he has raised 
the yearly tax bill of Canadians by $104 billion.  Those are the 
facts.  Liberal sleight of hand and Liberal rejigging of the 
terminology do not hide the fact that they are not giving a tax 
break.  The fact of the matter is that by looking at their 
paycheques month by month and year by year Canadians will see 
there is virtually no change in their tax position in spite of 
the grand rhetoric of the finance minister and members opposite. 
It is just not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend some time on the control of government spending. 
The finance minister will spend $86 billion more over the next 
five years.  We are very interested as Canadians to see how he 
has managed the money so far because now he will be putting even 
more out the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record is not reassuring to say the very least.  This is 
what a recent audit showed on $1 billion worth of spending a 
year.  In 11% of the cases there was no description of the 
expected results of the spending.  In other words, the money was 
shovelled out the door with no clear idea at all of what it would 
achieve.  It was just “It is not my money.  There is lots where 
that came from.  Canadians pay lots of taxes.  Let us just send 
it out the door”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 15% of the cases no one had even applied for the money. Maybe 
they just went through the yellow pages and said “I think Joe 
should have a few dollars of other people's money.  Let us cut 
him a cheque”.  I do not know.  There was no application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 25% of the cases there was no description of the activities 
to be supported.  This was supposed to create jobs, but there was 
no description of exactly how that would be achieved.  I guess it 
was on blind faith: if they put money out there it will surely do 
some good.  It does not sound to me like the kind of management 
we would want for our money, but that is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 46% of the cases there was no estimate of the number of job 
participants.  They were to create jobs but they did not have any 
idea of how many people would participate in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 72% of the cases there was no cash flow forecast.  We have no 
idea what these outfits that are supposed to create jobs are 
doing with the money:  where they will get it or where they will 
spend it.  There was no financial plan at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 80% of the cases there was no financial monitoring.  In 87% 
of the cases there was no evidence of supervision. 
Money was just given out with no supervision.  We have heard day 
after day in the House of how that money has been abused, misused 
and ripped off.  It is not achieving the results the government 
either hoped it would or says it does.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 97% of the cases there was not even a background check on the 
recipients of this money, some of whom we know had very shady and 
chequered pasts.  This is how our money has been spent in the 
past.  However it appears to be of no concern to the finance 
minister.  It did not merit a single line in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine what would happen if a company had come forward 
to give its yearly report to the shareholders and there had been 
this level of massive mismanagement of the company's money and 
not a word in the report about what had happened, what were the 
consequences and what would happen to the operation as a result? 
There was not a word.  They are to spend $86 billion more in the 
same way, with the same kind of mismanagement.  That is the only 
conclusion that can be drawn, and that is a serious concern for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very serious situation in the country.  We have a 
budget that pretends to give tax relief when, if we really look 
at what is being done, the tax relief amounts to less than $2 
billion a year for the next five years.  At the same time $86 
billion in new spending is being shovelled out the door in an 
atmosphere and in circumstances where there are serious questions 
about the government's management and administration of the money 
it already has.  It is so bad in fact that there are numerous 
instances where the RCMP has had to be called in to get to the 
bottom of how public moneys have been mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are facing today in the budget which did not 
even address these serious concerns and had fake tax breaks. When 
we look at the numbers they are simply not there.  They are 
either more social spending, or they are offset by increased 
taxes for other programs, or they were simply taxes the 
government was to impose but thought the better of it.  They are 
counted as tax cuts when they are nothing of the sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are troubled times for Canadians.  I receive e-mails, 
letters and phone calls day by day.  I know other members do as 
well, even members on that side of the House.  Canadians are 
asking what is going on.  They work hard.  They pay their taxes. 
They trust the government to do the right thing with them, but it 
is becoming increasingly obvious that it is incapable and 
unworthy of that kind of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that this budget, this finance minister and this 
government are not providing the leadership to serve Canadians 
well and do not merit the support of the House or of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one could cover a lot of ground 
in commenting and rebutting the speech of the member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill.  I will not speak about the CHST transfers to 
Ontario because I know my colleague from Mississauga South is 
champing at the bit to get into that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not mention the fact that if Mike Harris in Ontario had 
reduced taxes by 25% instead of 30% on the first go-around, he 
could have topped up the transfer reductions that went to the 
province of Ontario.  I will not get into that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I will talk about the tax cuts because I think the 
member opposite has her facts wrong.  Yesterday in the House the 
Leader of the Opposition cited the example of Paul and Fran Darr, 
a retired couple with an income of $28,000.  They were 
complaining about the taxes they pay.  As I reported to the House 
yesterday, Paul and Fran Darr, wherever they are, will save with 
this budget 45.2% of their federal income taxes.  I could go on 
and on with examples.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the example of a one earner family of four with an 
income of $60,000.  Its federal income taxes will go down by 24%. 
Another example is that a one earner family of four with an 
income under $35,000 will receive more in benefits than it pays 
in taxes in the year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member opposite to contrast this with the flat 
tax proposal.  I will give two quick examples, with the 
indulgence of the House.  Under the flat tax proposal, solution 
17 as it is called, a single taxpayer earning $30,000 would 
receive a tax reduction of 12% while a similar taxpayer earning 
$200,000 would receive a tax reduction of 39%.  Is that not 
interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As another example, a two earner family of four under the flat 
tax proposal, solution 17, with an income of $75,000 would get a 
reduction of 28% in federal taxes.  A similar family with an 
income of $200,000 would benefit by 35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Calgary—Nose Hill contrast the lack of 
progressivity in the Reform tax proposal?  Would she be prepared 
to acknowledge the huge tax savings Canadians will benefit from 
with this budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could go through the 
numbers and Canadians could get their calculators out and do it 
for themselves.  Perhaps the Liberals may want to do that as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims over the next five years a $58.4 billion of 
tax relief.  Subtract from that $7.5 billion, which is actually 
not tax relief but spending on the child benefit.  Subtract a 
further $29.5 billion, which will be increased CPP premiums over 
the next five years, most of which, if not all, will go to pay 
off the unfunded liability in that program of nearly $500 
billion.  Subtract from that $13.5 billion, which were scheduled 
tax hikes that are now cancelled.  It is not a cut of existing 
taxes.  It is simply an abandonment of untenable proposed taxes. 
That gives us a grand total of $7.9 billion in real tax relief 
over five years, divided by five equals $1.58 billion.  If we 
divide that by the number of taxpayers, which I think is about 14 
million, we arrive at $107.60 per year per taxpayer in real tax 
relief.  Those are the facts.  If people want to take issue with 
those facts they should show us their numbers, but these are 
numbers from the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point the member raised was the so-called lack of 
progressivity in our own tax plan.  Our tax plan would provide 
real substantial tax relief.  I invite people to look at it.  We 
have laid out the numbers.  It is transparent.  Everyone can look 
at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking money from people who work hard to earn money is the last 
thing we want to do.  Productive people assist others.  They 
create jobs.  They are consumers and entrepreneurs.  They are the 
backbone of the economy.  Somehow Liberal members think that the 
government creates jobs.  I have news for them.  It is 
productive, hardworking, innovative people who succeed that 
create economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government would only see that, we would have a 
country that looked a lot more like Ontario and Alberta than like 
some of the other provinces that labour under the 
misapprehensions of Liberal social engineering and bad economic 
decisions.  This is exactly what the budget perpetuates. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her HRDC speech.  I did not hear too 
much about the budget presented on Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take issue with the tax reduction plan she talked 
about.  If she refers to table 4 of the five year tax reduction 
review, therein is laid out $17 billion in annual tax reduction. 
It is a combination of both tax cuts and tax relief. 
The only tax relief that is in there is $2.5 billion for the 
child tax credit.  That adds up to $58 billion.  I therefore do 
not understand the hon. member's concern about tax cuts because 
the tax cuts are there.  That does not include the EI cuts 
projected over the next five years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers the hon. member is putting forward are not 
realistic.  It is in fact $17 billion worth of tax relief.  It is 
in fact a five year tax reduction plan.  I do not understand the 
thrust of the hon. member's speech.  I also do not understand the 
thrust of the hon. member's selective failure to remember the EI 
cuts as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the hon. member and her party are somewhat 
against Santa Claus and Christmas at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess I do not expect 
a Liberal member to accept those numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite Canadians to examine the Liberal numbers and the 
numbers I put forward and make their own judgment.  At the end of 
the day it is not the hon. member's money and it not my money. It 
is not even the money of any party in the House.  It is 
Canadians' money and they have a right to have a very clear and 
thoughtful analysis of the real numbers they have to work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may accept the Liberal numbers, which I am sure the 
Liberals will defend to the death.  They may accept the numbers 
that we put forward because they are the result of a thoughtful 
and careful analysis.  I am simply putting them out in debate 
because at the end of the day we are only leading the debate. 
Canadians will have to make the decision on whether their 
interests have been well-served by the budget and by the 
government or whether there are other factors which the 
opposition is bound in duty to bring out that would lead to far 
different conclusions than what the government would like to urge 
on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the government will put the best face on its budget. Why 
would it not?  It spends a lot of time and effort writing a 
budget that sounds like we are getting the best thing since 
sliced bread.   All the opposition is saying, in as credible, 
thoughtful and sustainable a way as possible, is that there are 
other factors and other ways to characterize this that need to be 
taken into account.  At the end of the day I invite Canadians to 
make their own decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
the Canada pension plan, the hon. member will probably know that 
it was enacted in 1966 so that those people who came through the 
depression without a working career and unable to provide for 
retirement, as Canadians do today, would immediately get 
benefits. Today's workers pay for the pensioners because the 
pension was always in arrears.  The deficit and the unfunded 
liability were not because of mismanagement.  They were because 
we took care of people who did not have anything for their 
retirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's retirees get $8 out for every $1 they put in.  To 
sustain that level of equality of pension plan for all Canadians, 
changes were necessary.  This is exactly what the provinces, 
together with the federal government, came out with after 
consulting with all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With every dollar that goes in, taxpayers will get it out and 
more when they retire.  Her analysis— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Calgary—Nose 
Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I can say so kindly, 
that really is a half truth.  It is correct that there were a few 
people when the plan was put into place who had not been able to 
save for retirement.  However, in addition to that, governments 
habitually and for a long period of time charged much less for 
this program than it cost.  Since the hon. member sat on the 
committee he knows very well that people did not put in even 
enough to pay for their own pensions until very recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Younger Canadians are now being socked with that 30 years of 
mistake.  They will to have to put a lot of money into the plan. 
They will get very little out in relation to their investment and 
that is what the hon. member has not said.  This is a debate for 
another day, but I would simply say that the hon. member knows 
better than what he was just saying.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Niagara Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by apologizing to the finance minister.  I have, 
privately and publicly, described him as a tax cutting wimp.  I 
thought that was an accurate description as far as previous 
budgets, but I am wrong.  Quite clearly this budget is an 
aggressive run at tax issues that have been on the agenda for 
years and years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Publicly, I would like to apologize to the finance minister 
because he has proved me to be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to the budget speech, I was absolutely stunned at 
the breadth and magnitude of the finance minister's commitment to 
tax cuts.  Frankly, I had trouble believing that the finance 
minister reindexed the entire system and killed off bracket 
creep.  This is enormous.  This is the most important event in 
the entire budget process in the last seven years, second only to 
this government getting serious about eliminating the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of our caucus, members of the Standing Committee of 
Finance and others have talked repeatedly about the stealth tax 
that occurs in the indexation of the system and that nasty little 
surprise Canadians get when they get a modest raise which jumps 
them into a new bracket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us know that bracket creep was probably the most 
significant inequity in the tax system.  On the first occasion in 
which the finance minister could meaningfully address this issue, 
he made it the centrepiece of his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us who have laboured long and hard in this area, it 
is indeed most gratifying.  I would especially like to thank and 
acknowledge the work of the member for Durham who has spoken 
about this issue repeatedly over the past five years both in and 
out of caucus, and has spoken about it even when others were not 
speaking about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news does not stop there.  The Minister of Finance also 
took the opportunity to raise the threshold to $8,000.  The last 
time he raised the threshold we were given to understand that 
something in excess of 400,000 Canadians were taken off the tax 
rolls.  I expect this will do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simultaneously, he raised the middle threshold from $29,000 to 
$35,000, and the top threshold from $59,000 to $70,000, while 
dropping the middle rates two points, from 26% to 24% effective 
July 1 of this year, and an additional point later on in the five 
year plan.  I know this is a significant cost to the treasury and 
that it takes enormous courage on the part of a minister of 
finance to take these steps.  Any one of these steps would be a 
significant reform to the income tax system.  Cumulatively it is 
enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it does not end there.  He also mounted an attack on 
the 5% surtax after having completely eliminated the 3% surtax 
last year.  As of July 1, the 5% surtax will be completely 
eliminated on incomes up to $85,000 and phased out on incomes 
over $85,000. Taken individually, these changes to the system of 
personal taxation would be significant but collectively they are 
enormous.  I am sure that over time Canadians will start to 
realize that what they witnessed on Monday night was a radical 
remaking of the personal tax system in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the minister did not limit himself to changes to the 
personal tax system but he also started the process of business 
tax reform.  When we start talking about business tax reform we 
usually start to hear a gagging sound on the left.  The rhetoric 
starts getting cranked up about rewarding rich business cronies 
on Bay Street, et cetera.  The rhetoric gets a little childish at 
times and what gets lost is the simple truth that all businesses, 
be they large or small, must be successful.  If a business is not 
competitive it will not survive.  If that business does not 
survive it will have no employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never understood why the left wants to hobble business. 
It is like a gag reaction to any person who is successful or to 
any business that is successful. 
We seem to be compelled, it is almost in our culture, to bring 
Canadian business down to mediocrity.  Canadians seem to like to 
reach for the bronze medal but leave the rest of the medals to 
everybody else.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was therefore pleased to see that the Minister of Finance 
start to lower the tax rate on the high tech sector by 25% over 
the next five years.  Regardless of what others say, this was 
absolutely necessary.  High tech, by definition, is virtually 
borderless and can vacate a jurisdiction in a flash.  Unless the 
tax environment is competitive—and here one might just as well 
read U.S. rates—business will move there unless there is some 
other reason to keep it here.  We therefore have the strange 
anomaly of having fostered these businesses by bringing in our 
best educated people, providing the business environment with a 
good start up environment and providing research money and then, 
when it gets successful, it moves to California.  It is the worst 
of all possible worlds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not arguing that the magic of changes to a tax environment 
is the panacea to high tech business, or any other business for 
that matter, in terms of vacating the jurisdiction, but lowering 
the high tech rates generally and on small business immediately 
is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that some of our most talented people leave for 
opportunities in other jurisdictions.  It is my opinion that the 
tax environment does not drive them out of Canada rather it is 
factors such as career opportunities and research and development 
opportunities.  However, the tax environment is still a factor of 
some significance and I believe that the Government of Canada 
made a significant step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The so-called brain drain is of concern to us all.  I will point 
members in the direction of some information I came across 
recently.  It was put forward by graduates who moved to the 
United States.  It is a rank and class of graduates who moved to 
the United States for work related reasons.  For those who moved, 
42% of those graduates were in the top 10% of their classes and 
39% were in the top 25% of their class.  That cannot continue. We 
simply cannot survive in a modern industrialized economy if that 
continues to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax environment is not the be all and end all of the brain 
drain.  However, lowering the capital gains taxes so that the 
inclusion rate is now at 66% rather than 75% is a step in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Postponing taxation on stock options to when the shares are sold 
rather than when the options are exercised is a step in the right 
direction.  Increasing the amount investors can put into new 
investments by allowing a $500,000 tax rollover for qualified 
investments is a step in the right direction.  These are 
significant in and of themselves but cumulatively these are 
extremely significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the best budget in 25 years.  This is a taxpayers' 
budget.  This is a budget that addresses the fiscal reality in an 
even-handed way.  This budget is good for business.  This is 
great for personal tax filers.  I would urge hon. members to 
support the passage of this budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
must say that I would have been greatly surprised if the hon. 
member had stood to publicly denounce the Minister of Finance's 
budget. That would have been really something to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are two issues I would like to talk about briefly 
and ask the hon. member a couple of questions relating to them. 
One of course is the issue of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear hon. members across the way taking some kind of credit 
for the elimination of bracket creep.  How many years has the 
government had to eliminate this?  I do not think it has had as 
much to do with the government's decision on this as it has to do 
with the people like the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of Canada has had the elimination of bracket 
creep as a major policy principle for the last five years. 
We have been asking the government to do this for at least five 
years, and more than that outside of the House.  My first 
question to the hon. member is why in the world did it take the 
government so long to eliminate this when it knew it was bad for 
Canadian taxpayers?

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the matter of health care spending.  I am sure the 
hon. member faces the same kind of problems that I do in my 
riding with a deteriorating health care system which is 
inadequately funded.  The major culprit is the federal government 
and its plan over the last few years to gut the health care 
system by cutting back on health transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last five or six years it has taken out somewhere in 
excess of $20.5 billion.  Now it is telling us that out of the 
goodness of its heart in this age of surplus it is going to put 
back in maybe $14 billion over the next few years.  With the kind 
of mathematics I grew up with, this leaves us with a shortfall of 
$6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that $2.5 billion, $1 billion this 
year, about $30 per Canadian, is going to fix Canada's health 
care system?  Does he really think that is an adequate response 
to the deterioration of health care in this country?  I would be 
very happy to hear his responses to these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is right. 
Under no circumstances would I denounce the finance minister in 
the giving of this speech.  Maybe the member should have read my 
speech from last year when I was somewhat critical of the budget. 
As the hon. member well knows, I am not above criticizing when 
criticizing is appropriate on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there is nothing more pathetic than a question 
that asks who should take credit on the issue of bracket creep. 
The issue of bracket creep has been around since it was 
introduced by previous governments.  In fact, this is the first 
occasion that we could meaningfully address bracket creep because 
this is the first occasion that we have had a meaningful surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member's information, he should note that bracket 
creep plus the upping of the basic threshold to $8,000 is going 
to cost the government slightly less than $3 billion on an annual 
basis.  Simple math tells us that this was the first and only 
occasion the minister could have addressed that issue. That is 
the first answer to the hon. member's questions.  The essential 
issue is that we have had deficits for a long time, unless the 
hon. member has missed this.  This is the first meaningful 
surplus we have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of health care, if the hon. member will recall, the 
budget last year was in some respects the health care budget in 
which $3.5 billion was put into the health care system and 
directly into the hands of the health care ministers.  It meant a 
significant sum of money in Ontario.  Forty per cent of $3.5 
billion is a significant sum of money.  In addition, on the cap 
on CAP, the province of Ontario received a further $1 billion, a 
significant sum of money.  Does the member know how much money 
has hit the ground in my riding?  Zero.  Precisely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is this huge whine from the other premiers saying “Give 
us more money”.  What did they do with the last bit of money? 
Nothing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak in the debate on the budget.  We are on the 
right track.  Thanks to the efforts of Canadians, Canada has 
entered a new era, that of surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians, especially families with children, in all regions 
of the country will benefit from a budget that takes us to the 
future with an education system second to none, secure social 
programs and a five year plan of tax reduction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With each budget I and many fellow Canadians have seen deficit 
spending being eliminated, progress being made by paying down the 
debt, our economy flourishing and the rate of unemployment 
declining at a faster rate than we had anticipated. The 
unemployment rate is now at its lowest level in 24 years.  We 
must be doing something right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget speech the government made important announcements 
that will translate into a better quality of life for all.  While 
we continue to follow a prudent and transparent approach to 
budget planning, with this budget we have delivered important 
investments in health care, in knowledge and innovation, in 
families with children and in the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 when I was first elected to serve my constituents of 
Niagara Falls in the House of Commons, the Standing Committee on 
Finance has consulted with Canadians from all walks of life and 
acted on their views and priorities year after year. In fact, I 
am delighted to see that many of the recommendations made by way 
of written submissions to a questionnaire sent to a great number 
of my constituents or by oral presentations to town hall meetings 
saw implementation in previous budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reviews from the riding on budget 2000 are more than 
positive. One of the headlines was “Niagarans are encouraged by 
this budget”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to see that this budget as others before it is 
focused mainly on the welfare of our children, of our families, 
of our communities and of our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget took into consideration evidence which suggests that 
the early years are vital for child development and their future 
ability to learn.  It is only natural for parents to want their 
children to have the best and healthiest possible start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of budget 2000, families with children will see an 
increase in the Canada child tax benefit thanks to a boost of 
$2.5 billion.  This means that families now receiving the Canada 
child tax benefit will receive more generous payments.  More 
middle income families will qualify for this benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's objective is to raise the maximum benefit to 
$2,400 for a family's first child by the year 2004.  The benefit 
for a second child will also be raised to $2,200.  This means 
that over the next four years low income Canadian families will 
receive $6 billion, while modest and middle income families will 
receive $3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These benefits as well as personal income taxes will be fully 
indexed so that family incomes will not be eroded by inflation. 
In all, the Canada child tax benefit will help nine out of ten 
Canadian children, or about 3.8 million families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 puts forward the five year tax reduction plan that 
benefits all Canadians and families with children in particular. 
It is a plan that will put more money into the pockets of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan is secured by two fundamental changes. First, we are 
restoring full indexation of the personal income tax system. 
Second, for the first time in 12 years the middle rate will fall 
from 26% to 23%. This budget shows that it is possible to cut 
taxes and invest in the future at the same time. With this plan 
the government is providing real and lasting tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax indexation is not a new idea.  Tax indexation was introduced 
by a Liberal government.  It was later cancelled by a Tory 
government under Brian Mulroney, the same government which left 
us with a huge deficit which was eliminated not only by the good 
planning of this government but also by sacrifices made by all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With indexation the automatic tax increases caused by the 
so-called bracket creep will disappear. This will benefit a great 
number of Canadian taxpayers. 
This means that the federal benefits such as the Canada child tax 
benefit and GST credit will no longer be eroded by inflation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Indexation also means protection against inflation for seniors. 
While public pension benefits under the Canada pension plan, old 
age security and guaranteed income supplement are already fully 
indexed to inflation, the GST credit, the age credit and the OAS 
reduction threshold are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian business will also benefit from tax cuts.  This will in 
turn encourage innovation and investment and put all sectors of 
our economy on an internationally competitive footing. As a first 
step the government is lowering the tax rate paid by higher taxed 
industry mostly in the high tech and service sector from 28% to 
21%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, budget 2000 provides at least $58 billion in cumulative 
tax relief to Canadians over the next five years. We are cutting 
personal income taxes by an average of 15%.  Many will enjoy 
bigger cuts.  Low and middle income Canadians will see their 
taxes fall by at least 18% and families with children will see 
their taxes on average fall by 21%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By leaving more money in the pockets of Canadians we will see 
our economy flourish.  In turn the government will receive more 
revenue.  It will then be able to reduce taxes paid by Canadians 
even more.  This will go on and on.  The government will then be 
able to maintain funding for social services such as education, 
health and important infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other important measures of this budget, for example 
the assistance that will be provided to Canadians with 
disabilities. By building on previous budget measures the federal 
government will extend support and implement tax initiatives to 
expand opportunities for persons with disabilities.  It will help 
them and their families deal with the medical and care related 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clean air, water and healthy habitats are essential to a higher 
quality of life.  Understanding that our economy and our 
environment are closely linked is also part of the comprehensive 
strategy.  Budget 2000 commits some $700 million in funding 
between 1999-2000 and 2002-03 toward the development of new 
technologies and tools that will meet our Canadian environmental 
challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative will be well received in my riding of Niagara 
Falls. Many of my constituents dedicate much of their time and 
energy to maintain and better our environment, to preserve and 
protect species indigenous to our area and the many spectacular 
natural beauties enjoyed not only by Canadians but by so many 
visitors to our area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that our economy, especially the economy of the 
21st century, requires the proper physical infrastructure.  The 
budget proposes to work out a multi-year agreement with the 
provinces and the private sector to improve highways and 
municipal infrastructure.  This will include green infrastructure 
and affordable housing in urban and rural communities across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is a so-called border riding.  As such it will benefit 
from the action taken in the budget to strengthen and control our 
borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency will receive incremental 
funding to modernize our border management process.  This will 
allow the agency to devote more resources to enforcement 
activities that are most crucial to protect Canadian borders. 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada and the RCMP will also be 
receiving incremental funding and in this way will better ensure 
the safety of not only our borders but also of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 shows us that it is indeed possible to cut taxes and 
invest in the future at the same time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a question for my eminent colleague, who is a major wine 
producer.  But I will not mince my words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he think of the following facts, given the credibility 
of the Minister of Finance, for whom he says he speaks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barely two and a half months ago, the Minister of Finance 
presented forecasts in his economic statement.  At that time, he 
told us that the surplus for 1999-2000, that is the period ending 
March 31 of this year, would be $5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two and a half months later, he brings down his budget and, big 
surprise, the Minister of Finance—the same one, unless it was his 
brother or a clone, but they look very similar—is talking about a 
$7.5 billion surplus, a $2.5 billion increase in two and a half 
months.  What a strange coincidence:  $2.5 billion and two and a 
half months—2.5 and 2.5.  His forecast changed by 21% in two and 
a half months; this is a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the very day the budget was brought down, there was 
a copy of <I>The Fiscal Monitor</I>, a publication put out by his 
department, in the lock-up room.  In the third point of the 
second column on page two, it says that for the first nine 
months of this fiscal—in other words, the first three quarters—the 
surplus was $10.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was $5 billion two and a half months ago, $7.5 billion in the 
budget and $10.9 billion for the first three quarters of 
1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I opened the newspaper and saw another discrepancy in 
the minister's forecasts.  This morning, he said that the tax 
cuts, the Canada social transfer that he forecast in his budget 
could change, because he had taken a very pessimistic approach, 
and that we were not to worry, that the figures would change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at this:  a forecasting error of 21% in two and a half 
months, of 65% the same day—according to <I>The Fiscal Monitor</I> on 
budget day—, and, tomorrow, discrepancies of perhaps 70% between 
what he brought down in the budget and what he will actually do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What sort of credibility does the Minister of Finance have?  How 
can we view the budget brought down barely two days ago as a 
solid foundation?  How does he explain his about-face and his 
election-minded fancy footwork in response to opposition to his 
budget? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
for his question.  For years the hon. member and I have sat on 
the finance committee across from many economists.  We have 
heard, especially in the last two years, growth estimates of 2%, 
2.5% and 3%.  He knows very well that we constantly get different 
readings on how much our economy is to grow.  In the last year 
the estimate was about a 3% growth in the economy, but in the 
last couple of months we know it is over 3.5% and growing even 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows quite well, especially in the last couple of 
months with the growth in the economy, that it was possible for 
the finance minister to make those adjustments and give the 
benefits back to Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
suggest to all Canadians that in the meantime they do not buy 
more than one cup of coffee extra a week.  It does not look too 
promising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did not mention in his speech anything about the farm 
crisis and long term solutions that might be in the budget.  I 
wonder if they are there.  He never mentioned anything in his 
speech about the poverty that has been recognized by the United 
Nations on Indian reserves across the land, third world 
conditions on Indian reserves.  There has been nothing mentioned 
in the budget speech or by anyone else about what the government 
will do about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about wasteful spending?  Does the member condone wasteful 
spending like on the filming of <I>Bubbles Galore</I>, committees 
on seniors and sexuality, the hanging of dead rabbits and all 
such nonsense which amounts to millions and millions of dollars? 
That member laughs because he thinks it is funny and great.  Only 
a Liberal would laugh at anything that stupid. I wonder if he 
would like to respond.

views.  They say that the flat tax is the salvation of all, a

television called <I>The Flintstones</I>.  With a flat tax, 
nothing moves, nothing is progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want Canadians to understand that Canada is a great country to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will share my time with the hon. member for Lotbinière, but it 
does not mean that all Bloc members will do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say that I am disappointed, because there is an 
important flaw with respect to health care. If this government 
is really concerned about social justice and the future of 
Quebecers and Canadians, we would have expected it to have 
realized that the editorial writers, who represent an important 
segment of our society, are unanimously asking the federal 
government to increase transfer payments, and health transfers 
in particular, so that those who work on the front line, that is 
the provinces, can meet the particular needs of their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is contemptuous and ridiculous. Even in our wildest dreams, 
we could never have imagined that a government could be so 
insensitive to public needs. 
How can the government table such a budget when a month ago, not 
far from here, in the Hull region, all the provincial premiers, 
whether Tory or NDP, masterfully led by the Premier of Quebec 
who, as you know, runs a fair government for the people of 
Quebec, were saying “Funds have to be released to the provinces 
for health purposes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was estimated that some $4.2 billion were required. The 
Premier of Quebec said that, of this amount, $1 billion should go 
to Quebec, with $500 million going to health and $500 million to 
income security and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get a chance to come back to this, but the time is coming 
when it will be important for all Bloc Quebecois members and all 
other members in the House to come to grips with the structural 
pressures in the health system that make new investments in 
health care now imperative, or the future looks grim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be perfectly clear. The Quebec government has done 
everything it could with the resources at its command. I ask my 
hon. colleague and chairman of the health committee to pay 
attention to this. We will keep introducing motions for the 
committee to visit places where people actually experience 
problems in order to put maximum pressure on this very 
unresponsive government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister, Mrs. Marois, is always very well informed 
of what is going on in the system, and she knows what Quebecers 
want. 
Jean Charest himself said the same thing in the National 
Assembly: the first priority of Quebecers is their health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The natural increase in health care expenses is 5%. That means 
$500 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we calculate the part the Quebec government will receive from 
that miserable, shameful, insufficient and ridiculous $2.5 
billion spread over four years, we arrive at $70 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is absolutely outrageous, and it is why Pauline Marois said 
that it will not even pay for the operation of the health system 
for three days of this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will we do in Quebec with the $500 million, the figure the 
Prime Minister talked about, at the first ministers' conference 
in Hull, for health care alone—$1 billion in total, $500 million 
for health? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few specific examples, especially for the benefit 
of the members opposite. 
I know I can count on my colleagues from Longueuil, Portneuf 
and, of course, on the talented and learned member from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, who has been working on this issue for 
seven years. What would we do with $500 million? This is about a 
quarter of the operating budget of Montreal's hospitals; half of 
the budget for all the CLSCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to digress for a moment, to say that people from almost 
everywhere in America come to Quebec to find out how unique the 
CLSCs are, because such local community social service centres 
do not exist elsewhere, that is, a front line service, in some 
cases open 24 hours a day, at least to provide information by 
phone on emergency matters, and a front line network totally 
dedicated to people in key areas like seniors health and 
children's health from birth to adulthood and community groups 
as well. So, from almost everywhere in North America—I refrain 
from saying “the world”, because it could be a tiny bit 
pretentious—people come to find what CLSCs, which are unique to 
Quebec, are about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the $500 million we are out by—annually, that is—it 
represents nearly half the budget for the whole CLSC network. It 
is the equivalent of the budget allocated to home support. 
It is well known—and I address this issue in a moment—that one of 
the structural pressures in the health care system is the fact 
that never before in the history of mankind have people lived so 
long. Not only do they live longer but some—not everyone of 
course, understandably—remain in good health longer. That is why 
old age is no longer synonymous with golden age, it actually 
comes after. Chances are excellent for all members in this 
House—that is at least my wish for everyone here—to get to old 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the sharp mind of the Minister for International Trade 
at 80. I cannot think of him as one who would knit or play 
cards. I imagine him as alert and—a little like yourself, Madam 
Speaker—playing golf. 
For that to happen, it is important that the federal government 
transfer the money it owes the province.  In light of the extent 
of the cuts it imposed unilaterally, this is hardly a handout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to digress again. Is there someone in this House who 
will dare rise and say that $45 billion worth of cuts, which will 
be lowered to $33 billion by 2003, is an act of co-operative 
federalism? Did the premiers ever meet and discuss all this? 
This is beside the point, and I hope my friend the international 
trade minister will agree with me that to unilaterally impose 
cuts of this magnitude is not co-operative federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come back this structural pressure on our health care 
system from our fellow citizens living longer and longer, which 
means that we will need extremely efficient home support 
services. We do not want people to be institutionalized longer 
than they have to; we want them to be cared for in their natural 
community, by their natural caregivers. But we are short 
$500 million.

tax point transfers for health will be $31 billion.  That is an 
all time high.  I invite the hon. member, who is quite well 
versed in issues of health, to recheck the facts, recheck the 
budget documents, and take a look at exactly and precisely the 
kind of money that not only other provinces will be getting but 
Quebec as well.  Perhaps he could then advise Madam Marois of the 
good things that the federal government is doing in this very 
important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should encourage the health minister for Quebec to come to 
the main meeting with the Minister of Health at the federal level 
and his provincial counterparts to see what can be done over the 
long term.  The finance minister's budget has ensured that there 
will be a short term injection of money into the all-important 
health care system, but the main meeting will be crucial in terms 
of getting together provincial and territorial partners to ensure 
that a final, solid and long term solution is found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member, who I know has great influence in many 
areas, to do precisely that and to make sure that the health 
minister for Quebec is at the table and contributes in a very 
positive and meaningful way for a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member support the Reform Party's flat tax policy? 
Does he support what the Reform Party is up to in terms of this 
17% nonsense?   I would like to hear the hon. member's opinion. 
After all, it is the Reform Party which, in its platform, would 
have gutted health care, social programs, pensions and all the 
things which we have put in place for Canadians.  Do not take my 
word for it.  Check the Reform Party platform.  If we check its 
new fresh start program we will see the kind of nonsense for 
which the Reform Party opposite stands.  It is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Not true.  You are such a liar.  You are 
just plain and simple lying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  The question I have for the hon. member 
is quite simple.  Does he, with his social conscience which is 
really quite attuned, support the flat tax concept?  I would be 
very interested in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to the hon. member opposite, the Reformer, calling me a 
liar.  He should watch himself.  He should go back to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I know we can always count on 
your efficient leadership to prevent fights and brawls in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I warn my colleague against any attempt to divert the 
debate.  We will find another venue to discuss the Reform Party 
fiscal policy, which we do not adhere to naturally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to underestimate my colleague's influence, which 
is equal only to his kindness, so I ask him to become a voice 
within his party and to wake up the members of cabinet, whose 
lethargy is creating an injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member and all the other members who believe in 
social justice to assert clearly, as I do myself, that social 
justice starts with health and that the provinces cannot 
properly provide the services they should be giving to their 
citizens if this government does not restore the transfers it 
has cut unilaterally, without notice, off-handedly and with 
complete disregard for jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague to engage in this campaign with me; together 
we will succeed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the famous 
and long-awaited federal budget was tabled Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is characterized by two things: timing and electoral 
opportunism. As a consequence, there is nothing for the 
unemployed. The municipalities will have to wait for the 
election goodies. There is almost nothing for social housing, 
and Quebec will have a $4.3 billion shortfall in transfers for 
social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the list goes on and on: nothing for regional development; 
next to nothing for rural communities, and my friend Jacques 
Proulx of Solidarité rurale was profoundly disappointed by this; 
and agriculture was, once again, completely forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the president of the UPA, Laurent Pellerin, did not hide 
his disappointment. His remarks reflected perfectly well the 
opinion of farmers in my riding and throughout Quebec when he 
said “With its surpluses, the federal government could have 
reinvested in our farming industry, support for which has 
dropped by half over the last eight years. The UPA is asking 
that the federal government take long term restructuring 
measures to ensure that Quebec's farming industry can remain 
competitive globally”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw attention to the following statistics: OECD 
figures show that the EU and the United States are supporting 
their industry to the tune of $381 and $363 per capita, 
respectively, as compared to only $140 in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about EI now. 
With the current surpluses, the federal government could have 
helped the unemployed. There is nothing in the budget on that. 
The government wants to reduce the premiums by the year 2004, 
again trying to misappropriate funds at the expense of the 
middle class and to exclude 60% of the unemployed from the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Lotbinière, there are still two regional rates. 
The gap between the RCM of L'Érable and that of Lotbinière is 
continuing to grow by 5%. And the workers living the RCM of 
Lotbinière are hard hit. As usual, the federal government is 
doing nothing while the people are getting poorer because of 
this unfair system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now have a look at the regional development that was 
supposed to result from the restoration of the Infrastructure 
Works Program for municipalities. 
Guess what? We are going to have to wait until the year 2001. 
Wait for what? For a meagre $100 million, $25 million of which 
will go to Quebec. As for the rest, the amounts budgeted will 
increase only in the years 2002 and 2003. This opportunistic 
decision essentially motivated by electoral considerations will 
penalize our regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague just spoke at length about the health care issue. I 
will mention other statistics which, I hope, will help the 
Liberal MPs see the light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only $2.5 billion in additional funding will be given over four 
years. Consequently, with the reform announced in 1999, which 
now bases the transfers to the provinces on geographical 
considerations rather than on real costs, in 1994, the federal 
per capita contribution for health care and education amounted 
to $1,100. It will be $1,026 for this year, and $1,038 for the 
next two years. What an increase! And the MPs from Quebec have 
the nerve to say that the government is increasing the 
transfers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are laughing at the sick, the young and the poor. They are 
showing lack of respect for the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to tell you about what I call the “greening” of 
the finance minister. Listen to the political and partisan 
announcements made this week: a sustainable development 
technological support fund, a Canadian foundation for climatic 
and atmospheric sciences, a green municipal investment fund and 
so on, $15 million for the decontamination of the Great Lakes, 
but not a single penny for the St. Lawrence River. Again, Ontario 
is favoured over Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about tax relief. 
Tuesday morning, the daily <I>Le Soleil</I> ran the headline 
“Taxpayers, be Patient”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here numbers that show how ridiculously small the federal 
tax relief is. A single person earning $30,000 will get a big 
relief of $64 in 2000 and a tidy $128 in 2001. A family of four 
earning $40,000 will get $291 in 2000 and $582 in 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The needs are a lot bigger than that and the government had the 
leeway to make a real budget that would have given taxpayers a 
break and given more time to boost the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are more numbers. 
Two adults and two children with two incomes totalling $50,000 
will be entitled to a reduction of $172 in 2000 and $343 in 
2001; where the two incomes total $60,000, the reduction will be 
$251 in 2000, and $501 in 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can you expect us to take this government seriously when the 
majority of newspapers announced on their front pages big news 
items like lower taxes, family benefits and so on? This is the 
trademark of federal Liberals. The day after the budget, we read 
the press releases; journalists publish what they have heard, 
but when we take a closer look at the budget, it is over. We do 
not hear anything about it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is so interesting that opposition members do not 
even rise in the House to ask questions. 
As far as we are concerned, the Minister of Finance missed the 
boat. He tried once again, through all sorts of schemes, to show 
that he is a good finance minister. But, when you think of it, 
there is nothing for the 1999 tax return. There is hardly 
anything for 2000, and we know what to expect for 2001. We know 
that an election campaign is looming on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are very partisan and they often take advantage of 
elections. I do not have to remind my colleagues of all we have 
been hearing recently about the Department of Human Resources 
Development. There are many reasons to condemn this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by discussing the situation of social housing. 
This is an issue that upsets me even more. We are lagging 
behind. We were expecting $1.7 billion from the federal 
government this year. This would have meant about $380 million 
for Quebec. 
Imagine, we got a measly $58 million. This morning, newspapers 
all over Quebec were denouncing this lack of funding, because it 
does not meet current needs in any real way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the critic for regional development, I have to say this is a 
very important issue. We need social housing. There is a lot of 
catching up to do.

is waiting. While it is waiting, it is engaged in political and 
electoral opportunism. In the meantime, who is suffering? The 
unemployed, the students, and the sick are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by repeating that this budget is a typical 
pre-election budget, which means there is nothing for the 
unemployed, no significant tax relief this year, a pittance for 
social housing and, finally, a categorical refusal by this 
government to make the necessary payments to ensure adequate 
health care in Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to comment on the Bloc 
member's remarks. I think he did not read this budget, the 
federal government's budget for 2000-01. Perhaps he read the 
Quebec budget or some other budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote him some figures relating to transfer payments to 
Quebec. Over the five years of the budget plan, Quebec will 
receive $59 billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is $59 billion over the five years of the budget plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2000-01 the transfers to Quebec will exceed $11.5 billion. 
They will account for about 25% of the province of Quebec's 
estimated revenues.  They are expected to be about $1,566 per 
person.  That is about 18% above the national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member opposite would read the budget.  He would 
discover that there is $59 billion that will go to Quebec over 
the next five years.  In fact the province of Quebec receives 
almost $5 billion in equalization payments.  Quebec receives that 
because it is a poor province. I have said in the House before 
that there is a reason it is a poor province. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of the policies of the Parti Quebecois and the 
policies of the Bloc Quebecois. That is the reason. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding taxes, let me give a few examples because I think the 
member opposite simply has not read the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low income Canadians who pay about 1% of the net taxes collected 
by the Government of Canada will receive almost 40% of the tax 
reduction flowing from indexation. For example, a one earner 
family of four with an income of under $35,000 will receive more 
in benefits than it pays in the year 2004.  A one earner family 
of four with an income of $60,000 will see its taxes go down by 
24% in the year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the Bloc member opposite read the federal 
budget for 2000.  Did he read it? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Madam Speaker, I have read the budget, and 
I can even tell my hon. colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Finance that I took part in the lock-up. 
Therefore, I was shocked before everybody else to see that this 
budget contained absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite is forgetting one thing: all these numbers 
he is throwing around—he is like the finance minister, he is 
quoting so many different numbers, it is tough to follow; what 
he is saying is always somewhat obscure; the numbers have 
already changed over the past two days—are for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the beginning of my speech that this government is 
suffering from a serious case of procrastination; it is totally 
unable to make a decision in the year 2000, it has to wait until 
2001, 2002, 2003, 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was reading the budget, I realized that, by acting in an 
opportunistic and election-minded way, the government was 
penalizing the Quebec people as a whole. They will get what is 
coming to them, we will kick them out once again during the next 
election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
member for Etobicoke North in his question to the Bloc member 
talked about the Bloc member not reading the budget.  It is clear 
that the member for Etobicoke North did not read the budget.  Had 
he read the budget he would know that the average Canadian family 
will still pay $700 more in taxes after five years when these tax 
cuts kick in than they did when the government took office. That 
is a fact, the $83 billion in increased spending. For my 
family, my wife and I and our five children, the government 
will spend $20,000 more of my family's money that we pay out in 
tax. That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Bloc member is on agriculture spending.  I 
would like him to comment on the fact that $240 million of 
federal money will go to farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and 
none will go to any other province. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the 
hon. member for Lakeland, for his question.

budget. This is the case for the whole of eastern Canada. I am 
scandalized when I see that the bulk of Liberal MPs comes from 
Ontario and that they are unable to stand up for eastern 
farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Guelph—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the federal budget that was tabled 
earlier this week.  It is essentially a Canadian document.  It is 
not radical; it is measured, it is well paced. It is irrefutably 
a strong pro-growth document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget represents a long term strategy.  The intention is 
not to create a boom tomorrow but it will provide sustained 
benefits for Canadians well into the future. I am pleased that 
the Minister of Finance has once again provided us with 
leadership, strategic thinking and prudent investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government was first elected in 1993 this nation had a 
$42 billion deficit and an unemployment rate of 11.5%. Canadians 
elected us because they wanted leadership, strategy and action. 
We have met that commitment and prudent planning has become our 
hallmark.  Inflation is low, interest rates are low and our 
unemployment rates are at record lows. My riding of Kitchener 
Centre has an unemployment rate of only 4.6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understood in 1993 that we were between a rock and a 
hard place and that the government had to make difficult choices. 
Today the economic situation of the country has changed 
dramatically.  It is because of the sacrifices made by middle 
class Canadians that the government is now able to give back to 
its citizens through tax cuts, indexation, investments in social 
programs, research and development and support for small and 
medium size business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak with an economics 
professor from the University of Waterloo, Mr. Larry Smith.  It 
is his view that restoration of indexation has restored a sense 
of equity to our tax system.  He indicated that indexation was a 
prudent approach for stimulating our economy.  Moving too quickly 
with tax cuts would be dangerous and may cause the Bank of Canada 
to have to raise interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few moments to highlight how this budget 
will benefit my riding of Kitchener Centre.  Let me begin by 
stating that the focus of budget 2000 is the middle class.  This 
budget is for the middle class families of Kitchener.  Restoring 
full indexation to the personal income tax system protects 
against inflation. This will benefit every Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that Kitchener families receiving the Canada child 
tax benefit and GST credits will no longer see these things 
eroded by inflation.  The government has set out a plan that 
reduces personal income tax. The middle tax rate will go down to 
23% from 26%. This will cut taxes for nine million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also increased the income thresholds at which personal 
income tax rates apply.  We have increased the amount of income 
Canadians can receive tax free to at least $8,000. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On an annual basis residents of Kitchener will see personal 
income taxes reduced by an average of 15%.  Low income Canadians 
will see an 18% reduction.  For families with children, net 
personal income taxes will be reduced an average of 21%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government heard clearly from Canadians and I heard 
directly from my constituents how important the Canada child tax 
benefit is to families.  By 2004 an additional $2.5 billion 
annually will be provided to low and middle income families with 
children, bringing the investment total to $9 billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October in the Speech from the Throne the Governor General 
stated, “The government will extend and make more accessible 
employment insurance benefits for parental leave, to help parents 
take more time from work to spend with their children”. We have 
now met this commitment.  Maternity and parental leave will be 
increased to one year starting December 31, 2000.  This leave 
will be made more flexible and accessible.  This measure will 
provide additional benefits of about $900 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also fulfilling an earlier announcement to 
provide $753 million to aid in finding solutions for homeless 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also invested in programs and tax relief for disabled 
Canadians.  In Kitchener the Independent Living Centre has 
received funding from the opportunities fund.  According to 
director Paula Saunders, those in the program found full time, 
part time and self-employment opportunities with a success rate 
of 80%. The government has renewed its commitment to the 
opportunities fund, investing $30 million a year to ensure that 
groups such as the Independent Living Centre can continue this 
good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has also allocated funding to cover 75% 
of the cost of diagnostic assessments for Canadians with severe 
learning disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in the area of assisting special needs people, the 
government has expanded the disability tax credit and the medical 
expense tax credit.  In total these measures will increase tax 
assistance to persons with disabilities by an estimated $45 
million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not wasteful spending as the opposition would have us 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kitchener is a hotbed for small business and high tech industry. 
We have strong dynamic companies in our area such as GFI Control 
Systems, Research in Motion, Devtek and Intelli-Tactics.  The 
government's five year tax reduction plan will assist companies 
such as these to become more competitive. Our tax system is now 
more conducive to investment and to innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kitchener's high tech businesses will benefit from the reduction 
in corporate tax rates to 21%.  Smaller area companies will also 
benefit from the reduction on small business income between 
$200,000 and $300,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the importance of risk taking and the greater access to 
finance for small businesses.  Therefore we are responding by 
reducing the capital gains inclusion rate from three-quarters to 
two-thirds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are postponing the taxation of gains on qualifying stock 
options to when the shares are sold rather than when they are 
exercised.  Finally, we will allow a tax free rollover of capital 
gains on qualified investment from one small business to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been working hard to put in place the key 
measures to improve the economic environment for aggressive 
business growth and competition.  This exciting news should be 
good news for all Canadians, especially young Canadians. They 
want to be part of a dynamic business industry where there is 
opportunity to learn, expand and prosper.  If the economic 
climate is right and graduates see the growth of aggressive 
companies in their own backyard, such as Research in Motion, they 
will choose to stay in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our students are an extremely valuable resource and we have made 
some important commitments to them in this budget.  These 
commitments will also benefit institutions such as Conestoga 
College, Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of 
Waterloo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having met with student presidents from these schools, I have 
heard the need.  I have heard them request that we move from a 
$500 tax exemption for scholarships, fellowships and bursaries. 
Students from across the country delivered a strong message. We 
have responded by raising the tax exemption limit to $3,000. We 
have also committed to maintaining the Canada student loans 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 has allocated $900 million over five years through 
the granting councils to establish and sustain 2,000 Canadian 
research chairs by 2004-05. 
This is an important initiative that will attract world class 
researchers to Canada and it will keep world class researchers in 
Canada.

province and our municipalities, to begin to address some of our 
urgent infrastructure deficiencies such as transit and roads, 
environmental initiatives and affordable housing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truly we have set forward a plan on which Canadians can count 
and on which they can judge us by our actions.  We wrestled down 
the deficit and now we are investing in the things which 
Canadians say they want.  With a strong economy we will continue 
undoubtedly to be the best country in the world in which to live 
through the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the presentation of the member for Kitchener Centre 
with interest.  I am sure she made her comments with the best of 
intentions and believes them to be true.  However, if the budget 
is as good as she says, then I would like to ask why we are still 
waiting for the finance minister's ship to come in and start 
paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some facts on which I would like the member's response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian family at the time of the next election 
will be paying $700 more in tax than when the government took 
office.  That is a fact number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending over the next five years as a result of this budget 
will go up $2,800 for each and every Canadian.  I have five 
children.  My wife and I and our five children, assuming we are 
average Canadians, will pay $20,000 more in tax, which will be 
spent by the government.  That is fact number two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are worried about health care.  The finance minister 
seems quite content to let the billions of dollars in boondoggle 
spending continue, such as what we have seen in HRDC, rather than 
putting a stop to it and putting the money into health care. 
That is fact number three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a better option, which is Reform's solution 17.  It 
would deliver $5,000 in tax relief for each family over the next 
five years, rather than this increase of $700 from the time the 
government took office.  That is what we have to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member, who made these wonderful statements, to 
comment on these facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Madam Speaker, while I thank the 
member opposite for his questions, I despair over his 
mathematics.  I happen to know one of his Reform colleagues and I 
wonder if they could get together with a calculator to figure 
this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians get a lot in return for their tax dollars.  One thing 
which the government has made very clear is that it will not run 
deficits.  It will make sure that it is not giving tax cuts with 
borrowed money and that it will make strategic investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is at the top of the list of all Canadians and we in 
the government are trying to work with the provinces and 
territories to make sure that structurally we change how we 
deliver health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many challenges.  The problem is much more than money. 
I need to point out that it is not the intent of the government 
to make a down payment on a few hospital beds.  We are creating 
the kind of economy that will sustain a medicare system well into 
the next century, and that is what defines us as Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague across the way for her 
wonderful speech.  The reality is that the surplus which the 
government has, and is now deciding how to spend, was made on the 
backs of Canadian workers and not because the government has been 
a good fiscal manager. 
The fact is, that is where the government received its surplus 
and those Canadian workers have children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the occasion last night to meet with the student union of 
University College of Cape Breton.  As we speak, the students' 
professors are on strike because they are paid 30% less than 
other professors across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the students wanted me to ask a question of the 
government.  Why did the government not recognize the position in 
which students have been put in terms of high debt load and high 
tuition fees and why did it refuse to address that in the budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for the question.  I have two universities in my 
community and I hear from them all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last three budgets this government has addressed some of 
the concerns surrounding student debt.  Clearly, it is a topic 
that we have discussed.  There are the millennium scholarships. 
We have changed the RESPs as well as RRSPs, which can now be used 
at any time for lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that we need to work on together with the 
provinces.  While we transfer money to the provinces, we see very 
different approaches.  Quebec and Ontario have deregulated 
tuition fees, which has had an impact on students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the federal government is trying to be part of 
the solution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this very important budget 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a budget that all Canadians can and should be proud of. 
It is a balanced budget in two ways.  Not only is this our third 
consecutive balanced budget, but the promises made in this budget 
are also balanced.  We have balanced the need to deliver tax 
relief and to repay the debt with the need to maintain our valued 
social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the federal government has proven that its commitment 
to fiscal responsibility is unshakeable and that this commitment 
does not prevent us from helping Canadians in need.  On the 
contrary, it is because of this sound financial management that 
we have continued to improve the quality of life for all 
Canadians.  Like the budget says:  better finances, better lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall I conducted a prebudget survey in my riding of 
Guelph—Wellington.  I asked my constituents to identify their 
priorities for the 2000 federal budget.  Their concerns were 
health care, tax cuts, post-secondary education, the environment, 
infrastructure and children.  The government listened to our 
concerns and acted on them.  Every single one of the priorities 
identified by the constituents of Guelph—Wellington has been 
addressed in this very budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system has been a source of national pride for 
many years.  Guelph—Wellington chose health care as one of its 
top priorities and so did the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces will receive an additional $2.5 billion through 
the Canada health and social transfer.  This is the fourth 
consecutive time that we have increased funding for the CHST.  In 
the last two years alone we have increased the cash portion of 
the CHST by 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another important figure.  This year funding for the 
CHST will reach an all time high of $31 billion.  Obviously the 
federal government is committed to health care.  This is the 
highest amount ever that has been transferred to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to emphasize this point because of false 
accusations made by Ontario's provincial government that we are 
not doing enough to fund health care.  It is true that the 
federal government had to make some difficult decisions to reduce 
the deficit, but it is also true that federal transfers to the 
provinces in both cash and tax points are higher today than when 
we took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have pumped an additional $4.4 billion over five years into 
health care in Ontario since balancing the budget.  The Ontario 
government promised that every single penny of this money would 
go directly to health care.  I certainly hope that the Ontario 
government lives up to its promise, instead of doing like it has 
in the past, using federal funding to pay for its tax cuts.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is also committed to post-secondary 
education.  In addition to the $2.5 billion increase in the CHST 
funding, the federal government will increase the tax exemption 
for income, for scholarships, fellowships and bursaries from $500 
to $3,000, meaning that there will be no federal tax on the 
average $3,000 millennium scholarship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will also provide $900 million over five 
years to fund and sustain 2,000 21st century chairs for research 
excellence at Canadian universities.  Funding for the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation will increase by $900 million as well. 
Research will also be supported through $160 million for Genome 
Canada and $90 million to improve Canada's ability to regulate 
biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is great news for the University of Guelph, its 
students and its faculty.  The money is intended to help, and I 
sincerely hope that the Ontario government will use all of it for 
this purpose.  Ontario tuition rates are the highest in the 
country and Ontario also spends the least per capita on 
post-secondary education because of the provincial government. 
Ontario has also chosen to claw back the Canada millennium 
scholarships, money intended to make post-secondary education 
more accessible.  Instead of giving the money to the students in 
Ontario, it is using the money to fund its Ontario student 
opportunity grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out all of this so that we can set the 
record straight about what five years of Premier Harris' style of 
governing has done to Ontario and to his residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the last seven years under this federal 
Liberal government have been very good for Ontario and for 
Canada.  We have eliminated the deficit, balanced the budget and 
have started to pay down the debt.  In short, we have turned the 
economy around.  Thanks to the hard work of Canadians and sound 
fiscal management, we have been able to maintain our valued 
social programs and deliver tax cuts without borrowing a single 
penny, unlike the province of Ontario which chose to cut taxes 
before balancing the budget and as a result has increased its 
deficit by $14 billion.  Ontario gave a tax cut and borrowed 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 introduces the most important structural changes to 
the federal tax system in more than a decade.  These changes will 
deliver at least $54 billion in tax relief by 2004 and will 
benefit all Canadians.  Bracket creep will be eliminated by fully 
indexing the personal income tax system.  On average, Canadians 
will see their personal income taxes reduced by 15% annually. Low 
and middle income Canadians will see an annual decrease of 18% 
and families with children will see a 21% drop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax brackets have also been adjusted.  The middle tax rate now 
begins at $35,000 as opposed to $30,000, and the top rate at 
$70,000 as opposed to $65,000, and the middle income tax rate 
will be cut from 26% to 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment and entrepreneurship will be further encouraged by 
lowering the capital gains tax and decreasing corporate taxes. 
The foreign content limit for RRSPs will also be increased from 
20% to 25% and then to 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tax cuts will benefit all Canadians but especially 
families with children.  These changes will affect things like 
GST credits and the Canada child tax benefit.  We are also 
helping children by allocating another $2.5 billion to the child 
tax benefit increasing it to more than $9 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maximum benefits will reach $2,400 for a family's first child 
and $2,200 for each additional child.  Parents of children with 
disabilities will also receive additional assistance through an 
increase in the disability tax credit.  We are concerned about 
our children's future and are making concrete investments to 
ensure that every child has the best possible start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way we can do this is by protecting the environment.  To 
this end, the federal government will integrate environmental and 
economic policies through the development of new technologies and 
sustainable practices.  Budget 2000 will invest $700 million in 
such initiatives as climate change action funds, a sustainable 
development technology fund, a green municipal investment fund 
and the national strategy on species at risk. 
Guelph—Wellington has always been a leader in environmental 
technology, and we will definitely benefit from these 
initiatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is also making a significant investment 
in new physical infrastructure.  Most of this funding will be 
directed to municipal infrastructure and highways, both issues of 
interest to Guelph—Wellington.  The Guelph council and mayor 
want this infrastructure program.  They feel they have benefited 
in the past from it, and they will benefit in the future again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to Canadians and balanced the budget first 
before cutting taxes.  The first tax cuts went to those who 
needed our help the most.  In last year's budget and in this 
budget we extended those benefits to all Canadians.  This is 
responsible, fair and permanent tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the critics who say that we did not fund social programs 
enough, I remind them that health care and education are shared 
jurisdictions.  We give money to the provinces and they deliver 
the services.  In Ontario, the Harris government chooses to claw 
back this money rather than use it to help people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Minister of Finance has said that there will be more 
money for health care if the provinces are willing to come to the 
table.  We also need assurances from Premier Harris that this 
money will not be used to fund his tax cuts as it has been in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of the budget.  It is good news for 
Guelph—Wellington and for all of Canada.  We have done what we 
said we would do and we have done it well.  Together we will 
continue to improve the quality of life of each and every 
Canadian. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
just heard the member for Guelph—Wellington say wonderful things 
about the finance minister's budget.  The reality will not escape 
Canadians.  As they look at their paystubs over the next five 
years what they will find will be grizzly indeed.  That will be 
the reality check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about $58 billion in tax relief that the 
Liberals claim.  We have to take $7.5 billion from that over five 
years, which is social spending and not a tax decrease.  I am 
referring to the child benefits.  That is a social program.  That 
is an increase in social spending and not a tax decrease. That 
has to be taken off the $58 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $29.5 billion increase in the Canada pension plan tax over 
the next five years has to be taken off, as well as the $13.5 
billion which were scheduled tax increases that, according to the 
finance minister, will not be carried through.  Is a scheduled 
tax increase which has been removed actually a tax reduction? The 
Liberals say so.  I say it is not a tax reduction.  That is a 
promise of more tax which we hear from the government all the 
time that will not be carried through.  That is a nice thing, but 
it leaves as a bottom line $8 billion in tax cuts over five 
years.  That is all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that amount do for an individual?  If we take it on a 
per taxpayer basis it amounts to $107 per taxpayer per year. 
That is what the promise the finance minister put in place and 
the member for Guelph—Wellington made sound so nice translates 
into. Nine dollars per month is all average Canadian taxpayers 
will see or $2.07 a week.  It is disgusting.  All these nice 
things are deceit in the worst way.  The finance minister knows 
it and the member should know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member opposite should have better parliamentary 
decorum.  He should know that the word deceit is unacceptable. I 
would also like to point out that those people opposite with 
their soulmates, the Republican Party, are out to lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the hon. 
member is getting into debate.  Nevertheless, I caution the 
member to choose his words more judiciously.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate being 
given the opportunity to say that deceit is not acceptable in the 
House or anywhere else.  Nor is using the word, and I do 
apologize for that.  I got carried away in the heat of the 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Madam Speaker, I certainly 
accept the hon. member's apology.  He also said that I was saying 
some nice things so that balances things out.  I am okay with it. 
I want to address some of the points he talked about.  He talked 
about the child tax benefit that we are giving.  He talked about 
the environment.  He talked about knowledge, innovation and 
families.  For all of it he said “take it off, take it away”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised we hear that from the Reform Party.  There 
has never been support for any of those things from the Reform 
Party.  It has always believed that tax cuts, tax cuts and tax 
cuts are the only way of doing business, but we all know that 
many more things are important to Canadians.  Their health care 
is important to them.  It is important that they have their 
housing needs met.  It is important that they have social 
programs to support them.  It is important that we support the 
environment.  If we do not, what will be left for our children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government will absolutely continue to fund such 
programs but also in a balanced fashion cut taxes, wipe out the 
deficit, and continue on a strong fiscal path while caring for 
every Canadian.  That is what Canadians want.  That is what we 
will deliver. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the 
government's budget.  I will be splitting my time with the member 
for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the government has finally listened to the 
Reform Party of Canada.  We have been fighting since the 
inception of this party for the last 13 years to end bracket 
creep.  I am pleased to see that end.  It is good for Canadians. 
I am really pleased that the Government of Canada finally 
listened to the Reform Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get on to a bigger and more important issue, one that I 
feel very strongly about.  That is what this budget is really 
about.  Let us not make any mistakes.  The culture of the Liberal 
government is to spend, spend, spend.  For the last 40 years we 
have seen spend.  Liberals believe in bigger, bigger, bigger; 
more spending, more spending, more spending.  I will prove that 
in the House with the Minister of Finance's own numbers in a 
minute.  Let me quote from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in 
response to the budget: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget boosted overall program spending with no 
consideration of reallocating resources to higher priorities 
within an already overinflated spending envelope.  By continuing 
to apply year-end surpluses toward future spending initiatives, 
it raises the spending bar in the future indefinitely. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen an $86 billion increase in spending in the budget. 
In HRDC we have seen one of the largest scandals in decades, a 
billion dollar boondoggle.  How did the Minister of Finance 
respond?  He raised its budget by $226 million this year alone. 
That is how he responds to unaccountable, unacceptable spending. 
Grants and contributions from all departments are up $1.5 billion 
this year alone.  That is completely unacceptable.  Canadians are 
demanding some actions to bring back accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard Liberal members and even the Minister of Finance 
ask how come they are not getting any questions on the budget. 
The budget in every corporation including the Government of 
Canada is about spending every single last dime of taxpayer 
money. That is what a budget is.  That is what we have been 
responding to.  That is what the billion dollar boondoggle is. 
That is what this unaccountable spending is.  That is what the 
slush fund is.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is more interested in putting money into creating 
new hotel beds in Shawinigan than it is in putting money into 
health care and creating beds in hospitals.  It is absolutely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when spending is increased to this magnitude? Guess 
what.  We go into another deficit situation.  Let us look at the 
finance minister's numbers.  If anyone is interested, I am 
reading from page 46 of the budget book.  There is a graph with 
two lines, fiscal requirements surplus and budget requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the House know what will happen at the end of this year? 
The budget is what the government plans to spend and the 
financial requirements on its graph is the money that it will to 
take to meet those budget requirements.  Lo and behold we are in 
a downward dive like a diving goose going straight into the 
ground. It crosses zero and keeps going into the minus at the end 
of this year.  We are in a deficit situation.  If members do not 
believe me, they can look on page 46 of the finance minister's 
own document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would ask what that means.  I was in London with the Leader 
of the Opposition and my colleague from Medicine Hat listening to 
the economic statement of the Minister of Finance.  Do you know, 
Madam Speaker, what he told us there?  He said “I am going to 
cut up the credit card.  Never again will the Government of 
Canada get into deficit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has found a new gold credit card.  By his own numbers he is 
in a deficit situation at the end of this year.  It is in black 
and white.  I urge members to look at it for themselves on page 
46 of the minister's own budget.  It is right there.  The 
minister's definition of financial requirements on page 47 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important measure of the Government's finances is the 
financial requirements...the difference between cash coming into 
the Government and cash payments made for programs and public 
debt charges during the year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cash coming in to pay for these programs is not enough to 
meet the government's incestuous, crazy spending habits.  It is 
absolutely crazy.  This government is crazy about spending.  It 
is evident in its own numbers.  It is planning on taking money 
that is supposedly coming in from taxpayers next year to pay for 
this year's budget.  That is how people use a credit card.  They 
do not have the cash now, slap it on the old Visa and pay for it 
later.  That is exactly what the government has gone back into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has its spending programs.  At the same time it is ignoring 
the debt.  There is not a mention about the debt.  Yes, there is 
a $3 billion contingency fund.  If the government does not spend 
it, it may put it on the debt.  It does not mention that at all. 
To health care, which is facing the biggest crisis in the 
country, it allocates $2.5 billion over four years.  It is not 
nearly enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude right now in one sentence.  The government needs 
to reallocate the money from TAGS and other programs which are 
unaccountable, which are definitely political slush funds that go 
to the government's own insiders and its friends.  It should 
bring that money back into health care, bring back accountability 
and, for goodness sake, make sure that we do not go back into 
another deficit, as it states we will do on page 46 of the 
Minister of Finance's own book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be ashamed of itself for allowing the 
country to go back into a deficit.  It is an absolute bloody 
disgrace.
