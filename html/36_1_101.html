</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-402, an act to amend the Indian Act 
(obligations of landlords and tenants on reserve land). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla to introduce my private member's bill 
entitled an act to amend the Indian Act, obligations of landlords 
and tenants on reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past November 51 families at the Driftwood mobile home park 
located on Indian reserve land were evicted from their homes as a 
result of a failed septic system.  Most of the residents were 
forced to either relocate, sell their homes for whatever they 
could get or simply walk away from their investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tragedy clearly demonstrates the inequity that exists for 
people who rent land or residential premises on reserve land. 
Legislation is clearly lacking to define the obligations of crown 
when granting a lease authorized in section 58(3) of the Indian 
Act.  Also lacking is legislation that clearly defines the 
obligations between the landlord and tenant, in other words 
between the crown, leasee under a lease from the minister and the 
tenant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would amend the Indian Act to precisely define the 
obligations of landlords and tenants on Indian reserve land by 
making existing provincial landlord and tenancy legislation apply 
to these leases.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to

Protection Act (lead sinkers and lead jigs). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am extremely pleased today to have the 
opportunity to present my private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically this legislation is an act to amend the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not thank Mr. John Phillips and Mr. 
Robert Anderson who brought this important issue to my attention. 
The eventual passing of the bill will represent the end of a long 
road travelled by both gentlemen after having spent three years 
trying to education Canadians and Canadian governments on the 
consequences of using lead sinkers and lead jigs in our pristine 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will ensure that lead sinkers and jigs are 
banned for both use and importation. The protection of our 
environment is of primary concern to the government and I am sure 
that every member in the House will support the legislation when 
it is tabled for debate.

<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have two related petitions although they concern 
different subjects.  In the first the petitioners call the 
attention of parliament to the fact that the city of Kanata 
accepted an application for an adult entertainment parlour based 
on a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada.  They call on 
parliament to pursue changes to the legislation that would give 
municipalities the right to prohibit adult entertainment 
parlours, goods and services and to broaden the restrictions on 
existing adult entertainment parlours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  In the 
second petition, Mr. Speaker, the petitioners draw the attention 
of parliament to the fact that the Canadian Radio-Television and 
Telecommunications Commission refused to license four religious 
broadcasting services but has at the same time approved the 
pornographic Playboy channel.  They call on parliament to review 
the mandate of the CRTC and direct the CRTC to administer a new 
policy which will encourage the licensing of religious 
broadcasters.

have two petitions to present today.  The first petition is with 
regard to the Young Offenders Act.  The people in my riding from 
communities such as Merritt, Penticton and people from other 
locations in British Columbia are concerned about the Young 
Offenders Act.  They are asking that the House of Commons and the 
government deal with issue as soon as possible by lowering the 
age limit, transferring those accused of violent crimes to adult 
court. Publication of names is also important.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my second petition is related to the hepatitis C situation.  The 
petitioners ask that parliament reopen the issue of compensation 
for all victims of hepatitis C.  There are 90 petitioners 
listed from all areas of British Columbia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to table this petition from 50 of my 
constituents who state that over 90% of Canadians do not believe 
stricter gun laws are a solution to violent crime.  They also 
cite opposition from police on the streets and many provincial 
and territorial governments.  They therefore ask parliament to 
repeal Bill C-68 and instead spend the high cost it will require 
on more effective measures to cut crime and improve public 
safety.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a petition from 419 people in the city of Kanata 
and that area.  They are requesting parliament to pursue changes 
to the legislation that would give municipalities the right to 
prohibit adult entertainment parlours and broaden the 
restrictions of existing adult entertainment parlours to reduce 
the incidence of crime.  These residents are opposed to an adult 
entertainment parlour opening in their neighbourhood.  They are 
disappointed that supreme court rulings override community values 
and wishes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on October 28, 1997, I asked Question No. 33. 
There seems to be a reluctance to provide the answer to this 
question.  I cannot understand it, other than to note that the 
question has to do with a special relationship between the 
minister and the Oak Bay Marine Group and the actions of the 
minister's west coast assistant, Velma McColl.  I would like to 
know when I can expect that answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the

No. 56 on December 2, 1997.  It has to do again with the same two

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that these questions are of some importance because

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if the hon. member thinks 45 days is bad, listen to this one. 
Question No. 21 has been on the Order Paper since, believe this 
or not, October 3, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has repeatedly promised the House he

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address, on behalf of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the amendments that we are proposing to improve 
Bill C-19, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, and this is unfortunate, we will not be able to 
put forward all the amendments that we wanted to present, for 
reasons of procedure, given the nature of this bill, compared to 
that of last year's proposed legislation, which also sought to 
amend the Canada Labour Code, but which was never passed, 
seemingly for technical reasons in the Senate, and because a 
federal election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are amendments which we really wanted to propose again 
this year, but we were unable to do so for reasons of procedure, 
as I mentioned earlier. These amendments sought to have flour 
mills and other undertakings for the milling of grain come under 
provincial legislation, including the Quebec labour code, as 
opposed to being covered by the Canada Labour Code, as is 
currently the case. 
We cannot go any further for procedural reasons, as I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for federal public servants, whether they are represented by 
the Public Service Alliance of Canada or the Professional 
Institute of the Public Service of Canada, and also RCMP 
personnel, we have been defending these groups since we came to 
Ottawa, so that they too can be covered by the Canada Labour 
Code, as opposed to the Public Service Staff Relations Act, but 
unfortunately, again for reasons of procedure, we cannot table 
the appropriate amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to our amendments in Group No. 1, which address two 
issues: first, there is the role of committees, in particular 
the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the 
Status of Persons with Disabilities, to which the Department of 
Labour reports and which deals with the Canada Labour Code and, 
second, vacancies, as well as the renewal of the terms of 
members of the Labour Relations Board, recently renamed the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the committee, it is known that, historically, the Bloc 
Quebecois has defended in the House the fact that House 
committees are called upon to play a greater role in overall 
operations.  Right now, one criticism is that committees are 
required to meet without really having many powers, because the 
executive feels free to do all sorts of things without first 
seeking the opinion of members, the House and committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore suggest, for instance, that the appointment of 
members to the Canada Industrial Relations Board be by 
recommendation and that the committee be permitted to hold 
hearings, that the board submit an annual report, not just to 
the minister, but also to the committee, and that, in the case 
of appointments, the committee be involved in the entire 
process, that it perhaps even be allowed to call candidates to 
appear before it and to seek the opinion of the public with 
respect to the list of potential members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments are entirely consistent with the Bloc 
Quebecois' earlier positions calling for greater involvement by 
elected representatives in all aspects of operations in the 
interests of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to this often. The dramatic gesture by our 
colleague, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean, says a great deal not 
just about how things are done, but about what things are done. 
It is the whole operation of what we represent in democratic 
terms that is open to discussion and highly so, in my opinion. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois think that this is the sort of measure 
that will greatly strengthen the role of elected officials and 
democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, everything that concerns the committee is in 
Motions Nos. 1, 3 and 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 serves to ensure that the members of the Industrial 
Relations Board—the chairperson and the vice-chairpersons—cannot 
have their terms renewed after three or five years, as 
the case may be, to provide for an automatic turnover to provide 
the board with new blood. We consider that, by setting a time 
limit, the board will be revitalized, perhaps have new 
approaches, new influence networks and look differently at 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Motion No. 4 pertains to vacancies. The law as it 
stands provides that the chairperson is to be replaced by the 
vice-chairperson in the event he is absent or ill. 
In the event the chairperson is absent or ill, or the position 
vacant, the bill provides that the minister will choose the 
person to replace the chairperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think a vacancy, and not a temporary absence, in the position 
of chairperson should be filled by the individual chosen by a 
majority vote of the members of the board present.  We think 
that, when people know each other, it would perhaps be more 
democratic and more fair to let those who know the field appoint 
a new chairperson in the case of a vacancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how gifted this government is at finding friends when it 
counts. 
We think this would be a fine time to call a halt to this sort 
of attitude, which we have seen all too often, and ensure that 
people close to events are invited to react and take action 
accordingly, designating a new chairperson to fill the vacant 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the end of my remarks on the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before addressing the 
motions in Group No. 1, I would like to say a few words about the 
purpose of Bill C-19 and about the consultation process preceding 
its introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is the result of extensive consultations with 
representatives of labour and management and other interested 
parties in the context of a review of Part I of the Canada Labour 
Code which began in 1994.  The review included a study by an 
independent task force of industrial relations experts chaired by 
Mr. Andrew Sims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the release of the task force report entitled 
“Seeking a Balance” in February 1996, the Minister of Labour 
held cross-country consultations.  He continues to do that.  He 
has consulted and consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contents of Bill C-19 are essentially the same as its 
predecessor, the former Bill C-66, which was awaiting third 
reading in the Senate when the 35th Parliament was dissolved. 
However, in response to the concerns raised during the study of 
the former bill and during further ministerial consultations with 
interested parties last summer and fall, a number of drafting 
changes were made, again because of consultations and the fact 
that the Minister of Labour has listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is a bill which, while not meeting all the 
preferences of all parties, is a fair and balanced package of 
amendments arrived at through extensive consultations, reflecting 
considerable consensus between labour and management subject to 
Part I of the code.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw to the attention of the House that any time labour or 
management are too happy with the bill, then it is lopsided. 
Because of the feeling and the information that we have been able 
to get through the consultations we know we have a balanced 
package here which is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes important measures designed to improve the 
administration and conduct of collective bargaining in the 
federally regulated private sector.  It reflects labour and 
management support for a legislative framework which allows them 
to develop their own solutions to industrial relations problems 
without the need for government intervention or imposed third 
party solutions. I should think that we would all want to strive 
for that particular component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear relationship between a positive labour 
relations environment and a productive viable economy.  A stable 
positive labour relations climate is essential if Canada is to 
meet the competitive challenges of the new global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collective bargaining legislation should encourage and 
facilitate co-operative labour-management relationships and the 
adoption of innovative workplace practices. The government 
believes that Bill C-19 succeeds in meeting these goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn my attention now to the motions in Group 
No. 1. They refer to provisions in clause 2 of the bill which 
establishes a new Canada Industrial Relations Board to replace 
the current Canada Labour Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A working group of representatives of labour and management in 
the federally regulated private sector reached a consensus on 
this issue. The new board would have a neutral chair and 
vice-chairs and equal numbers of members representing employees 
and employers. Balance.  In all legislation we must strive to 
achieve balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions establishing the new board are designed to ensure 
that it better reflects the labour and management communities it 
serves across the country and that it operates effectively and 
cost efficiently. The Reform Party should like that.  Cost 
efficient.  This is what we have been hearing and this is what we 
are trying to deliver in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill specifically addresses issues of concern raised by the 
parties and noted by the task force in its report.  Here are a 
few of the key provisions which will improve administration of 
the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair and vice-chairs must have experience and expertise in 
industrial relations.  Surely no one in this House would object 
to experience on this board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must consult with organizations representing 
employees and employers with respect to the appointment of 
representative members.  Again it is a consultation process, 
which is extremely important to successful board appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of regionally based members will reduce travel 
costs.  The Reform Party should be delighted with this aspect in 
the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers of the chair with respect to supervision and 
management of the board's work will be clarified.  There will be 
a fair and impartial process for the review of the conduct of a 
board member. The chair or a vice-chair sitting alone will be 
able to determine certain applications instead of a three member 
panel. The board can operate more efficiently by holding 
pre-hearing conferences using teleconferencing and requiring the 
production of pertinent documents during the investigative 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board must issue decisions within a reasonable timeframe. 
The use of mediation to resolve issues will be encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill aims to ensure the effective and efficient 
administration of part I of the code by a new representational 
board composed of qualified members. I am sure that all members 
in this House will support a representational board that will be 
positive, fair and with experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am counting on my colleagues in the Chamber to help get this 
through. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very intently to the foregoing speakers both from the 
Bloc and from the government.  As I look over the motions that 
form Group No. 1, I see that my colleague from the Bloc has moved 
that the human resources committee should be the screening 
process for committee members on the Canada Industrial Relations 
Board. 
While we believe that the minister should not have broad 
autocratic sweeping powers in this area to appoint simply 
whomever he or she would like as the member has alluded to, we 
would give mild support to at least seeing the resumés of 
potential members of the Canada Industrial Relations Board.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 presented by my colleagues from the Bloc suggests 
that the vice-chair and the chair should only be limited to one 
term.  I know that the CLRB has had some bad experiences but in 
the case that we have gone through with the Canada Labour 
Relations Board we had a chairman that was appointed for a period 
of 10 years.  A period of 10 years is far too long.  As a matter 
of fact I made a representation to the Sims task force that the 
term should be limited to five years.  That is a reflection in 
the bill which I very much support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that limiting the term of the chair or the 
vice-chair to one term would have much merit. It may be a little 
difficult to find a person willing to take on the job.  I do not 
see anything wrong with reappointing a very qualified person for 
a second five year term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleague from the Bloc is concerned about a patronage 
appointment, let us take the scenario that perhaps during the 
time of a chairman's appointment his term runs out and there is a 
new government or a new minister. That would allow twice as many 
opportunities for a patronage appointment than at the present 
time.  I believe we would not support the Bloc's Motion No. 2 in 
Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill reduces the term of the members on the board from 10 
years to five years and that is supportable. A 10-year 
appointment is far too long.  The Bloc has suggested that it 
should be reduced even more to a period of three years.  I do not 
believe this is necessary. A five year term is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had cases that last for months.  There have also been 
cases which are definitely not justified and which have lasted 
for more than two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be able to agree that a five year term is a proper 
length of appointment.  I cannot understand the rationale behind 
my colleague's suggestion that they only be appointed for three 
years at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would help with continuity if the terms were staggered.  If 
everyone were to be replaced at once and all the terms expired at 
the same time, there would be a completely new board at some 
point in time.  If the terms were staggered there would be some 
experienced members and some not so experienced members.  That 
would certainly help with continuity on the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc's Motion No. 4 provides that when the office of the 
chair is vacant, the members of the board shall determine who the 
chairman shall be. 
That is not a bad system of selecting a chairman. When I was on 
municipal council the reeve of the municipality was selected in 
that way.  When you ran for a position on council, you did not 
run for the position of reeve.  You were selected from among your 
peers.  That is not too bad of a provision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear more rationale from my colleagues in the 
Bloc as far as defending their positions.  They have only given 
us cursory rationale as to why they believe we should support 
their position.  I would like to hear more on their position as 
far as the Canada Industrial Relations Board is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our hope that the government is going to keep a closer eye 
on the operations of the Canada Industrial Relations Board than 
it did on the Canada Labour Relations Board.  Aside from the very 
well publicized and documented misuse of public funds which took 
place within the previous board, there is also the fact that 
there are cases which have been before the board for more than 
two years.  That is ridiculous.  We all in the Chamber are 
familiar with the phrase that justice delayed is justice denied. 
That applies in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing which certainly has not helped in any way 
to build up the name of the previous board.  It seems that they 
could not decide on anything among themselves as far as the 
governing of themselves.  The first thing a quasi-judicial board 
should note is that it must learn to govern itself.  What I am 
talking about is that it managed to rack up something like 
$250,000 worth of legal costs in internal squabbling in regard to 
who had what jurisdiction and who had what authority.  That is 
totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department, the committee and the House of Commons should 
have a better handle on what is happening in the Canada 
Industrial Relations Board.  We should be notified as to its 
operations.  We should have a regular report to which the 
committee, parliament, Canadians and the press can react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we can say that the auditor general has oversight of this 
entire situation and he does.  The auditor general raised this 
problem time and time again.  It was only after much to do was 
raised by the Reform Party and by the press that these problems 
in the Canada Labour Relations Board were addressed.  We are very 
sorry that it took so long for these problems to be addressed. We 
hope that it does not happen like that in the future.

today in the debate on the reform of the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Trois-Rivières has submitted some amendments, 
Motions Nos. 1, 3 and 5 in particular, the essential objective 
of which is greater democratization, as you can see.  In this 
Parliament, what does “greater democratization” mean?  It means 
that the House of Commons or its committees which, being made up 
of parliamentarians, are an extension of the House, must be 
informed of the in-depth examination of matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour relations are a very important matter. When there is a 
labour conflict, there is a concern for equity, for balance 
between the parties. 
There is generally a union side and an employer side, although 
this is not always the case, and there is an assumption of 
debate, of balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, there can be no better instrument that a 
parliament for ensuring a balance.  Here we represent different 
parties.  At present, we have a majority government and several 
opposition parties.  This democratic mechanism represented by 
the House of Commons and the committees makes it possible for 
everyone's point of view to be heard and listened to.  This 
ensures that the public is better informed about the debates, 
all the ins and outs relating to the labour conflict, or the 
improvements to be made in terms of labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I want to support the hon. member for Trois-Rivières. 
I would like to point out that he has done a wonderful job.  He 
has done an excellent follow-up on all these mechanisms.  He is 
far more of an expert than I am on these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he speaks on this matter, whether in caucus or in 
discussions between colleagues, he always stresses the concept 
of balance.  One must not be prejudiced toward one side or the 
other, but rather try to strike a balance between management and 
labour.  I think that this serves the common interest, the 
interests of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore support the motions of my hon. colleague for 
Trois-Rivières.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this morning we are in the fourth stage of Bill C-19, an 
act to amend the Canada Labour Code.  Report stage really 
deals with what came out of committee examination of the bill. 
There are numerous amendments that we are considering today at 
this stage of examining the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested to hear the parliamentary secretary's remarks 
about this bill, waxing eloquent about the amount of consultation 
that had been done.  A great deal of consultation did go on with 
respect to these changes to the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what the parliamentary secretary did not mention and 
what is very unfortunate is that a lot of the results of these 
consultations were simply ignored in the final construction of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a whole lot of merit in having wide consultations, 
a long and detailed report and then having recommendations coming 
out of those consultations if the government simply goes its own 
way at the end of the day in constructing the legislation.  To a 
large degree this is what happened following the so-called 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations should be very largely reflected in the final 
result but, I would submit, that is not the case with this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary also made a rather strange and 
bizarre assertion that if no one is happy with a piece of 
legislation then it must be good.  I find this a little hard to 
credit, particularly when there are interest groups involved in 
the formation of this legislation which to my knowledge have 
never expressed themselves satisfied with any degree of 
accommodation of their wishes.  There always seems to be with 
perhaps all groups that the blue sky and the green grass is 
always a little further over the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should not be the litmus test of legislation. The litmus 
test really should be whether this bill serves the Canadian 
people and our country.  I did not hear any of that discussed by 
the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary did talk about the goals of the bill 
being a productive and viable economy.   It is certainly 
debatable and we will be debating whether this bill does anything 
to ensure and enhance a productive and viable economy. I would 
argue it does not meet this goal at all.  It will have an 
adverse, negative effect on the economy in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the talk about balance and all the talk about doing what 
gives the best balance in the competing interests involved, it is 
debatable that balance is not achieved in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first group of amendments proposed comes from the Bloc. 
Amazingly enough, some people will say Reform supports and is 
approving of the thrust of these five amendments.  We do not 
agree with every detail of them but I think these amendments were 
well considered and put forward in a very constructive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment is particularly constructive because it 
states that appointments to this board which wields a lot of 
clout in the affairs of our country, particularly in the labour 
and economic affairs regulated by the federal government, should 
be made by parliament through its committee which deals with 
these affairs, the HRD committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present legislation leaves the appointments strictly to the 
government, the cabinet and the minister.  Surely we have seen 
the repugnant effects of government patronage appointments to 
these important positions.  There are hundreds if not thousands 
of examples of how government cannot and should not be trusted 
exclusively to have the final say over these kinds of important 
designations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would strongly support all members of parliament's having a 
strong input into who fills these important positions.  I agree 
with my colleague from the Bloc who indicated this would ensure 
that all points of view are heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is serious about balance in this legislation 
surely it would welcome an amendment which would move a long way 
to ensuring the kind of balance it pretends it wants to achieve 
by making sure all points of view are heard regarding who sits on 
this important industrial relations board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second of the five amendments talks about limiting the term 
of the members of the board to one. term.  I suppose we have to 
ask ourselves as parliamentarians would we feel it would be 
appropriate if we were allowed to sit in parliament for only one 
term.  Some people would say yes.  If we have to put up with the 
rascals for one term that is plenty.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our first term we are on a steep learning curve as 
members of parliament. We gain valuable experience which allows 
us to go on with an enhanced level of competence.  If we are 
diligent and well meaning we can achieve this in our first term 
and provide a very valuable service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be members of the board who do not rise to those 
higher levels of competence and ability.  They could be weeded 
out.  But if there are extremely effective, knowledgeable and 
well informed people on the board who know what they are doing, 
who know the players and who have a great deal of insight into 
the process, they should not be turfed out after only one round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the three year term limit that has been suggested rather than 
five, three years goes pretty fast, especially the older we get. 
I had a birthday yesterday and three years does not seem like 
that long ago, nor does five years seem that long ago.  I am not 
sure that is a very substantive debate.  That has been proposed 
as the third amendment and I do not have strong feelings about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth represents changes to the legislation.  Presently if 
the chair becomes vacant, the minister will fill the vacancy. The 
legislation proposes that the board members fill the vacancy.  If 
Motion No. 1 is passed, the board members will be chosen in a 
balanced way through input from all members of parliament.  I 
presume there would be a pretty good balance on the board and it 
would have the best chance to choose a good replacement for a 
vacant chair.  Board members would know the players since they 
would have worked with them. They would undoubtedly choose 
someone who had their highest respect and whom they felt they 
could work with effectively and efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth amendment is that any report with respect to 
disciplinary or remedial measures relating to members of the 
board would not just fall silent at the minister's level but 
would be passed on to parliament through the relevant committee, 
the HRD committee.  That committee could ensure that if remedial 
or disciplinary measures were recommended, they would be properly 
followed up on.  This would lead to accountability on the board, 
something Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleagues from the Bloc for some pretty well 
thought out amendments.  I hope these comments will help members 
deciding whether they should be supported. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully and with interest to my colleagues from both 
sides of the House, especially to the parliamentary secretary.  I 
agree with many of her comments.  Although she commented in good 
faith, she gave the government's position and at times failed to 
shed sufficient light on some of the provisions of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is a very important piece of legislation.  For all 
intents and purposes it regulates the lives and work of about 
750,000 Canadians who work either directly for the federal 
government or for federally regulated companies in the banking, 
telecommunications and transportation sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is very important for the number of citizens it 
affects.  It is just as important as the Canada Labour Code. This 
kind of legislation is not amended very often.  Bill C-19 is 
probably the first major review of the rules that have regulated 
the workplace for the past 25 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The object of the bill is important because it affects the 
delicate relationship between management and the workers.  It 
affects the delicate equilibrium that ought to be maintained at 
all times between the investors, the bosses, the risk takers and 
the job creators on one hand and the workers, the people who 
bring their lives efforts to service of the enterprise on the 
other hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we must seek just and fair remuneration, working 
conditions and social benefits which create a milieu that is 
fair, just and rewarding for the workers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the motions moved by our colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois, Motion No. 1 for example provides in essence that, 
instead of being appointed by the governor in council or by 
cabinet, the chairperson and vice-chairperson of the board would 
be appointed by the minister, on the recommendation of the House 
committee dealing with matters relating to human resources 
development. This committee would have to hold public hearings 
before making a recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party will support this motion put forward by our colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois. This is something that already exists 
in Ontario. It ensures a more open appointment process. 
The public hearings should not, however, be allowed to turn into 
a circus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 of our colleague states that the five-year term of 
the chairperson and vice-chairperson shall not be renewed. I must 
say that our party will vote against this motion. It makes no 
sense not to renew their mandate if they are competent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now turning to Motion No. 3. Instead of being appointed by the 
governor in council, members of the board, whether full time or 
part time, would be appointed by the minister, on recommendation 
of the House committee dealing with matters relating to human 
resources development. The committee would have to hold public 
hearings before making a recommendation. Our party will support 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 states that if the chairperson of the board is 
absent or unable to act, a vice-chairperson designated by the 
minister shall act as chairperson. This part is similar to what 
the bill currently provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the office of chairperson is vacant, a replacement would be 
elected from within the board instead of being designated by the 
minister. We will vote against this motion. What this amendment 
is supposed to achieve is not really clear. Is it intended as a 
temporary measure? Otherwise, it contradicts the Bloc amendments 
calling for the chairperson to be appointed on the 
recommendation of the committee of the House of Commons. This 
provision seems to be pointless since it is unlikely that the 
position would remain vacant for several months. The other 
provisions of the bill seem to properly address these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 5, it provides that, when a member of the 
board is subject to an inquiry, the judge would be required to 
submit his findings to both the minister and the committee of 
the House of Commons. We will support this motion. Should a 
problem arise, the matter would be referred to the members of 
this House, who could suggest an appropriate course of action. 
This reinforces accountability to Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
recently came in from my riding, got off the plane and raced here 
to find that we missed one of our speaking opportunities.  I 
thank you for recognizing me now and giving me the chance to 
speak to the five first motions put forth for consideration to 
amend Bill C-19 and the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reviewed these five motions put forward by the member for 
Trois-Rivières.  While I fully understand the tone and content, 
and even some of the merits of what the member for Trois-Rivières 
is obviously trying to argue, I cannot support the idea of 
introducing these changes at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five motions are clustered together for obvious reasons 
because they deal with the same subject matter, the composition 
of the newly formed board and the representational qualities of 
the board, the appointment of the chair and the vice-chair, and 
their terms of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I will break them down in detail and comment on 
them one by one in that regard, except to start my remarks by 
saying how critical this part of Bill C-19 is.  The whole review 
of the board and its structure and the fact that it will be truly 
representational now is a huge leap forward for the labour 
relations climate in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say as well that the ideas stated in Bill C-19, the 
amendments to the code, are the result of exhaustive 
consultation, two years of consultation with labour and 
management all across the country.  Everybody had a kick at the 
cat.  Everybody had ample opportunity to try to make 
recommendations that would make this a better and a more 
functional labour board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Sims task force points to as its mandate, we were seeking 
a balance, some way to satisfy the interests of all the true 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all this consultation, this give and take and 
co-operation, they arrived at the changes that are called for in 
the original Bill C-19.  The minister makes the appointments. The 
terms are set.  The stakeholders recommend the other members of 
the board so that it is truly a representational board.  All 
those things are part of a fine balance and part of a larger 
package that is Bill C-19.  I would be very reluctant to alter it 
at this time for the risk of upsetting that delicate balance.  It 
would not be showing respect for the whole consultation process 
that took place in the previous two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the parties involved are very satisfied with the current 
package.  It was not just Bill C-19.  Going back to Bill C-66 
this exhaustive consultation process took place.  It went through 
the various levels of debate in the House of Commons and made it 
all the way to the Senate before the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been ample opportunities to make any changes that 
people felt were necessary or desirable at any one of those 
stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a situation now where the parties that truly 
rely on the labour code, the federally regulated employers, the 
employees who work for them and their representatives, are eager 
to see Bill C-19 moved forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The package is satisfactory.  The package does not serve all of 
our needs and certainly from labour's side there are many things 
we wish were there, many things we wish we could have convinced 
our partners in industry to adopt.  It is not always possible. It 
was a give and a take.  It was very much the type of co-operation 
that we should be looking for as a model in other forms of 
legislation.  I believe that all stakeholders put their own 
special interests aside.  They left their baggage at the door and 
did what was right to make the labour board a more practical, 
relevant and functional institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly needed review.  It needed amendment.  We had a 
terrible situation with the board where there was a huge backlog 
of cases.  I believe there were as many as 90 applications for 
certification pending.  These are very time sensitive. 
When workers have the courage to sign a union card and to 
organize themselves so that they can bargain collectively, there 
is always a backlash from the employer.  Often there are subtle 
forms of coercion, intimidation or harassment which make the 
workers rethink whether this is the right thing they are doing. 
Any delays increase the odds of that happening. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this newly constituted board I believe that case work will 
be dealt with more quickly, the backlog will be fixed up and 
these workers will have access to the justice they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the reasons we are hoping for speedy passage of 
Bill C-19 so those workers who have legitimate issues pending can 
start having them dealt with and heard by this newly constituted 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 1 through 5 seem to minimize the powers of the 
minister and add authority and powers to the committee that deals 
with human resources issues.  In other words, the minister's role 
would be minimized and the role of the standing committee would 
be augmented.  While there may be some merit in that kind of 
argument, in actual fact it would not change the balance of power 
in that the standing committee for HRDC is dominated by 
government by virtue of the number of seats that it is given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, if the minister wants a certain thing to happen, whether 
it is directly in his or her hands or in the hands of the 
committee members, the government's wishes will come about. I do 
not believe there is enough merit in this argument.  Even if we 
were convinced this was the right thing to do, I do not think it 
has enough merit to delay the passage of Bill C-19 with further 
debate and obstacles and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the official opposition will be introducing a number of 
motions designed to delay the implementation of Bill C-19.  We 
will have to deal with those when they come before us.  However, 
in this case an issue such as the composition of the board or the 
appointment of the chairs and the vice-chairs or the term of 
office in which they sit in itself is not enough to delay the 
passage of what is definitely a very worthy piece of legislation, 
a piece of legislation that will benefit working people as they 
conduct themselves in a federally regulated workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind there is nothing concrete in this package of motions 
that will make Bill C-19 any better to any degree.  We are 
dealing with minutiae here.  We are dealing with fine tuning an 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real change, the one that we should be most interested in, 
is the fact that the board will now be representational.  It will 
have a neutral chairperson, a representative from labour and a 
representative from management.  In that kind of balance I think 
we will achieve some of the mandate of the Sims task force, 
achieve a balance in Canadian labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who has been a practitioner in labour relations knows 
that is the goal.  The key objective is fairness.  Natural 
justice and fairness are the two yardsticks by which we measure 
the success or the failure of the industrial relations process, 
the quasi-judicial process of the way we conduct ourselves in the 
federally regulated workplace of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I saw anything that would substantially make Bill C-19 better 
I think I could stand here and recommend that our caucus vote for 
it.  As much as I have a great deal of respect for the member for 
Trois-Rivières—and I know he is a committed trade unionist and 
somebody who is sincere about making the environment better for 
Canadian workers—the only reason I cannot support this package 
of motions is that I do not see it making Bill C-19 substantially 
better.  Therefore the recommendation to my NDP caucus is that we 
will be voting against this package of motions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I spoke to the bill earlier this year.  One of the 
reasons I like to speak to labour legislation is that in my 
previous life pre-parliament I worked in the union certification 
climate in the forest industry. I currently represent an area 
with a very high union membership, the same area where I worked 
previously. 
It is one of the many industries that has undergone tremendous 
change over the last several years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing that on a global scale.  We are certainly seeing 
it big time in the resource industries in Canada.  We are going 
to see those kinds of changes coming to government as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there have been a lot of changes in government 
bureaucracy, but they pale in comparison to what has been going 
on in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the things that I was involved in, for example, went far 
beyond labour negotiations, union-management style negotiations. 
They went into joint training on environmental concerns, how to 
implement things like changing operating methods to meet changing 
standards in the forest practices code and all those kinds of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It blurs the lines between who belongs to management and who 
belongs to the union.  Everyone has a joint goal and it is very 
refreshing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything we can do to create an environment and an atmosphere 
where people have the same set of objectives and tend to be 
headed in the same direction would be very useful indeed.  If we 
can take the polarization out, take the confrontation out, then I 
think we have really achieved something.  There are some 
proposals on the table from the Reform Party that tend to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that does not address the specifics of this bill, but 
I thought I would put it on the table anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about today is a bill that would amend Part 
I of the Canada Labour Code to rename the Canada Labour Relations 
Board to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill died in the Senate in the last parliament when it was 
Bill C-66.  It died for good reasons and now it has been brought 
back with minor changes.  The changes that have been made still 
do not address very significant problems in the bill.  It is 
still laced with problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group of amendments that we are addressing at this time have 
all been put forward by the Bloc.  They are Bloc Motions Nos. 1 
to 5.  I might add that 30 motions have been put forward to amend 
this legislation.  Other amendments were proposed at committee. 
This gives us some idea of the significance of the desire to 
effect change within this legislative package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the amendments we will be discussing over the next 
several days came from either the official opposition as Reform 
amendments or from the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 is very similar to an amendment that Reform moved 
in committee.  It requires that candidates for the chair and 
vice-chair of the CIRB be appointed only if the parliamentary 
committee approves and it requires the parliamentary committee to 
hold hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is thought about on a larger scale, we could go beyond 
the CIRB to think about this in other contexts.  There is growing 
pressure from the populous, from anyone concerned about 
democracy, to head toward removing patronage from these positions 
to make them more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another circumstance right now where our information 
commissioner is retiring.  He is saying publicly that the last 
person we want to run the information commissioner's office is a 
career bureaucrat.  He says we want somebody who has displayed 
independent spirit, independent means and independence from 
government, someone who will lend themselves to an atmosphere 
which tends to hold government accountable as opposed to trying 
to support the bureaucracy against the best interests of society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see a quorum.  The hon. member for 
Vancouver Island North has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I finished talking about 
Motion No. 1, which can basically be summarized by saying that we 
need to appoint people based on merit, on their ability to do the 
job without being hampered by previous baggage, and to do it in a 
non-partisan fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 deals with term limits.  It limits the chair and 
vice-chair, that we previously talked about, to one term only. 
This legislation already takes the term from ten years down to 
five years without amendment.  Five years is certainly a lot 
better than ten years.  How do we hold someone accountable if 
their appointment lasts that long? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the living example is Mr. Weatherill, who was removed 
from office after great pain because of spending habits and other 
things which were considered to be far beyond what was allowed in 
terms of what was good value for money and accountability to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two sides to this issue.  We have to have a term long 
enough to create continuity, while at the same time we do not 
want such a long term that we end up with people who can 
essentially become unaccountable.  We could use this argument for 
any official, whether it is a member of Parliament, a member of 
the Senate or any other public body or institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 is a Bloc motion which would reduce appointments to 
three years.  We see some merit in reducing the appointment of 
members of the board from five years to three, but we see merit 
in continuing the five year term for the chair and vice-chair 
simply because of the continuity question.  I am not really hung 
up on the issue of three years or five years, but it is certainly 
better than ten years.  Five years is probably a bit too long for 
a regular board member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 would authorize the minister to appoint a 
vice-chair as a temporary chair.  This would be in the case of a 
vacancy. 
It would require that the appointment be determined by a majority 
vote of the members of the board as opposed to selection by the 
minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we 
heard earlier from my colleague for Calgary—Nose Hill, there are 
a lot of people who are dissatisfied with the consultations which 
took place regarding this bill.  It is the consultations that 
really bother us.  As you said earlier today, Mr. Speaker, 
holding consultations does not mean that you actually have to 
listen.  We feel that the consultations on this particular bill 
have not resulted in any meaningful changes, as is the case with 
a lot of bills on the Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
would call notice that we do not have a quorum.

North Vancouver has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the point I was making 
earlier was that there has been insufficient listening to the 
consultation on this bill.  The exercise we have just gone 
through indicates that what I said was correct.  There are no 
people listening to what is being said about this bill.  The 
consultation goes on but nobody listens. My colleague from 
Calgary—Nose Hill made that point quite strongly earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that 30 different motions are being put forward at 
report stage, as mentioned by another member a few minutes ago, 
indicates the amount of dissent there is on the bill. 
Notwithstanding the argument from one of the members of the NDP 
that it is a bill they would like to see pushed through fairly 
quickly, the fact is this is a bill with a lot that still needs 
to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of looking to the future we are going to be left with 
some outdated labour practices that will not be taking us forward 
into the future.  Those clients of the services that are covered 
by this bill will have no alternative in the event of a strike. 
The procedures contained in this bill for handling problems such 
as strikes are still outmoded and outdated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in my office one of the representatives of the 
Government of New Zealand was visiting me. We were discussing the 
never ending road work that is taking place on Wellington Street. 
It seems to go on for years and years and now they are working 
on the road outside the West Block. This is evidence of the type 
of labour climate we have. These things can go on and on for 
years and years with no resolution.  We need to inject some 
efficiency and modern practices into government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representative from the Government of New Zealand stated 
that they had suffered from these types of situations as well but 
it does not happen any more. 
It is all done by private contract with set dates and 
responsibility.  There are alternatives in the event of strikes. 
I stray a little from the topic.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the issue of appointments to the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board. The people of Canada frankly are thoroughly sick 
of the patronage which riddles every aspect of the various boards 
like the parole board, the immigration and refugee board and even 
the Senate. Mr. Speaker, you look shocked that there could be any 
patronage in the Senate and I am sorry if you had not noticed 
that it is filled with patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Club Chrétien has been more active than club Mulroney in terms 
of the rewards that the clubs to members.  An enormous number of 
failed Liberal candidates have been appointed to all manner of 
boards. We are concerned that they are going to end up on the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear a couple of members laughing on the government side 
because they know that is the truth.  We are going to end up with 
patronage appointees on this board.  Then we have to start 
wondering what are the credentials other than being Liberal.  It 
is certainly open to question. One just has to look at the list. 
It includes Liberal riding presidents, failed candidates, 
campaign workers, bagmen, ministerial assistants.  These are the 
types of people who get appointed to that type of board. I can 
give some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently André Bachand, Liberal candidate in 1988 and a long 
time Liberal president in Brome—Missisquoi was appointed to the 
National Parole Board.  Elizabeth McKall, the wife of a Liberal 
riding president in Edmonton West was appointed to the National 
Parole Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immigration and refugee board seems to be the most common 
recipient of Liberal largesse.  No less than 14 appointments of 
well-known Liberals to the immigration and refugee board occurred 
during 1997 and 1998.  To give some examples: Anita Fuoco 
Boscariol, twice defeated candidate; Lucie Blais, defeated 
candidate in 1993;  Milagros Eustaquoi, failed candidate;  Ronald 
Guerette, former riding president; Elke Homsi, former legislative 
assistant; Joan Lylian Kouri, defeated candidate; Gary McCauley, 
defeated MP; Anna Terrana, defeated MP; and Raza Naqvi, yet 
another failed candidate.  They are just some examples of the 
type of people who get appointed to these boards, nothing but 
patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mary Clancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  One of my colleagues mentioned the name of 
Mary Clancy, who was appointed to the high commission in Boston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely incredible.  We look at those sorts of 
appointments and we have to shake our heads and ask what other 
qualifications did they have other than being Liberal.  I can bet 
that we are going to end up with the Canada Industrial Relations 
Board packed with Liberal patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the role of the board and the Bloc motions that have 
been put forward, Reform actually supports the Bloc Motion No. 4 
in this regard because it injects at least a little bit of 
democracy into the board.  It actually allows the board to 
determine by a majority vote who should become the chair if it 
becomes vacant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, that is an amusing concept to you because I know 
you are very supportive of the appointment process.  The 
threatening idea that members of the board would actually elect 
their own chair, what a terrible thought.  That would be one of 
the safeguards that would perhaps remove an element of the 
patronage and control that goes into those boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reviewing the various motions that are from the Bloc in this 
group, we are quite supportive of Motion No. 1. The candidates 
for the chair and vice-chairs of the Canada Industrial Relations 
Board would be appointed only if the human resources development 
committee approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very good argument for much more transparency in 
relation to all of this patronage that goes on.  Actually I am 
sure that soon Club Chrétien is going to be running out of 
candidates to appoint to these various boards. 
Most of them must have cashed in their mileage points already.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  My colleague mentions there will be a lot 
more failed Liberal candidates but there will not be a Liberal in 
charge to appoint them to the various boards so that takes care 
of that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to Motion No. 2 put forward by the Bloc.  It 
limits the chair and vice-chairs to one term.  At first glance 
that may seem in conflict with our opposition to appointments.  If 
there is a very good chair who has been elected by the members of 
the board, we would like to see it made possible to extend that 
term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also opposing Motion No. 3.  The bill reduces the terms 
of the appointees from ten years to five years while the 
amendment reduces the term to three years for the chair, 
vice-chairs and members.  Our position is that five years should 
be the minimum for stability and continuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I refer you to Standing Order 29 which refers to quorum in the 
House.  A few minutes ago you witnessed the bells ringing for 
some eight or nine minutes to get quorum in the House.  As we 
have brought up at House leaders meetings prior to this, we 
expect the government to have its fair share of members in the 
House. I am not talking about numbers at the moment.  I am just 
asking you to hear me out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite unacceptable to us for there to be more members in 
opposition speaking to bills than government members.  I suggest 
the Chair give advice to the government.  Either the Liberals 
start matching this side of the House or we will be walking out 
of here.  We will expect them to start filling quorum in the 
House every minute of every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to 
the hon. member's comments. I want him to know that we were 
sitting in the foreign committee with the minister there.  Votes 
were to be held so we had to have a full contingent in that 
committee.  As a result of his quorum call, the opposition 
parties did not have the full opportunity to question the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I would caution him in using his quorum call in the House all 
the time.  The hon. member knows we have many committees, in 
particular on Thursdays.  We are getting near the end of the 
session.  Many ministers are coming forward to committees. 
Surely it would not be in the member's best interest to make a 
quorum call in the House when there is very important work going 
on in these committees with ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We should not get into a debate on 
this point of order.  As your Speaker I can only say that I do 
not believe a point of order has been raised.  The hon. House 
leader for the Reform Party has made his point. He has delivered 
his own message to the government and the government has heard it 
or argued against it as the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker as the presiding officer of the House is not 
concerned when there is a quorum call as to who is in the House 
from which side of the House.  The count is for the minimum 
number of 20 members. If 20 members are present the debate 
resumes.  The Speaker is disinterested as to whether it is all 
government members, all opposition members or a mixture of 
members from both sides forming the quorum.  As such the Speaker 
is not in a position to tell members from either side of the 
House who should be in his or her place or how many members 
should be available for any debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the circumstances we will leave this matter and proceed with 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in light of that nonsensical 
answer from the government benches I call quorum.

beginning with our own, which has to do with clause 6 on page 12 
of the bill.  Clause 6 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>6. The Board may decide any matter before it without holding an 
oral hearing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems excessive, to put it bluntly. We fail to see the 
validity of that provision. The information notes provided by 
the government do not convince us that this is appropriate. This 
could lead the board to take actions that might look like 
arbitration or abusive measures, and we are not at all convinced 
that this clause is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7, proposed by the Reform Party, deals with clause 
13, on page 14 of the bill, and concerns the spirit of the 
legislation. If I understand its position correctly, the Reform 
Party is very true to itself. The bill provides that scabs 
cannot take part in a vote on a union's representational 
capacity.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Reformers' motion, these replacement workers, or 
scabs, would be allowed to take part in such a vote, something 
which we strongly oppose. We must not, in any way, legitimize 
the hiring of replacement workers, whether it is before, during 
or after the fact. Therefore, we will oppose this motion by the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 deals with clause 16 on page 16 of the bill and has 
to do with employers' representatives. There is a provision with 
which we have trouble, and this is the reason for our motion. 
That provision reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4.1) On application by one or more employers of employees in 
the bargaining unit, the Board may, if it is satisfied that the 
employer representative is no longer qualified to act in that 
capacity, revoke the appointment of the employer representative 
and appoint a new representative. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision deals with employers' representation on the 
board. It provides that the employers represented on the board 
may, for reasons of their own, deem the employer representative 
no longer qualified to represent them. We respect the fact that 
these employers may repudiate—to put it bluntly—their 
representative on the board, without going any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the wording of the bill, the board may, if it is 
satisfied that the employer representative is no longer 
qualified to act in that capacity, revoke the appointment of the 
employer representative and appoint a new representative. 
We do not feel it is up to the board to interfere in such 
matters. It is up to the employers represented to proceed as 
they see fit and to designate those they see fit to designate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board's control over this aspect is a source of concern. 
Taken to the extreme, the board could decide to retain the 
representation made by a person whom the employer had indicated 
it no longer wished to be represented by.  This therefore 
confers an undue control to the board, which is why we are 
presenting this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the last motion in Group No. 2, on page 36.  This 
is probably a marked improvement, and is the reason why the 
public is so pleased, as we must admit it is, with the work of 
the Simms commission and with the Simms report, which talks 
about the balance that may have been struck. 
This mechanism is an important one, and could be described as 
modern.  It is a response to a need that is recognized in the 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is stated that the board can, despite a lack of evidence of 
majority support, certify a union when there has been unfair 
labour practice or serious infringement on the free choice of 
employees to free negotiation, to free representation. Thus, 
when the employer has obviously behaved in an unfair and abusive 
manner, when there has been intimidation or violence, the 
legislator may, via the board, authorize certification of a 
trade union, may certify it to represent a given employee group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you have seen, the Reform Party is opposed to such a thing. 
This is a societal choice, a social as opposed to purely 
economic point of view, where a deaf ear is turned regardless of 
even seriously unfair labour practices, as the government's 
explanatory notes indicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side are vehemently opposed to this.  I personally 
find it a very up to date, very generous point of view, provided 
of course that the board has set out clear guidelines.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be hoped that the board will show some wisdom, that it 
will ensure that it does not become common practice to give such 
accreditation without proper consultation or a vote.  There 
would, I assume, have to be exceptional circumstances for this 
clause to be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are, therefore, the comments I wanted to make on the four 
motions in Group No. 2. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the contents of Bill C-19 are 
largely based on the recommendations of the Sims task force in 
its report entitled “Seeking a Balance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While management and labour representatives may have wanted to 
see more in some areas and less in others depending on their 
perspective, the Sims recommendations were deemed acceptable as 
an overall balanced package.  This truly has been a bill of give 
and take and has been successful in achieving a balanced package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has put forward motions that would 
radically alter the balance of the package.  The amendment it is 
proposing to section 29 of the code would change current 
certification procedures and require the board to hold 
representation votes in all cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sims task force did not recommend such a change and major 
federally regulated employers have not asked for such a change. 
Majority support is the basis for union certification under part 
I of the code.  This would not change under Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under current code provisions where an applicant union shows 
proof of membership, signed membership cards and payment of $5 
fees, of between 35% and 50% of the employees in the bargaining 
unit, the board must hold a certification vote. Where the 
application is supported by a majority of employees, the board 
may hold a representation vote or may certify the applicant based 
on the membership evidence which is verified by board officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force found no evidence that the current system is not 
working or that it has been abused.  In fact the task force noted 
two advantages to the current system. First, it requires the 
applicant trade union to be supported by the majority of 
employees in the bargaining unit and not only the majority of 
those who vote.  Second, it reduces opportunities for 
inappropriate employer interference with the employees' choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recommended by the Sims task force, under Bill C-19 the 
board's authority to verify union support by holding a 
representation vote in any case is retained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is also seeking to remove the remedial 
certification provision.  This provision would allow the board to 
certify a trade union which has not presented evidence of 
majority support where the board is of the opinion that the union 
would have obtained such support if not for unfair labour 
practices committed by the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers are uniquely positioned to have significant influence 
over employees given their ability to profoundly affect an 
employee's continuing job security and his or her economic 
destiny. Where employees fear reprisals from their employer, they 
may not freely express their true wishes even in a secret ballot 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remedial certification provision is designed to discourage 
employers who might consider engaging in unfair labour practices 
in order to avoid a unionized workplace. It is neither a new nor 
a radical provision.  Five provincial labour boards have similar 
authority.  They use it infrequently in order to remedy the worst 
cases of employer interference or intimidation which makes it 
impossible to determine the true wishes of employees through a 
representation vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind members that the provision will be 
interpreted by the new Canada Industrial Relations Board which 
will have equal labour and management representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In commenting on this provision, a University of Toronto 
professor of law told the standing committee “The ultimate 
purpose of the provision reflects a very fundamental legal 
principle and that is that one should not profit from one's own 
wrong”. That is, the employer should not get the result it seeks 
as a consequence of violating the code. 
I agree with the professor and urge members to support this 
provision.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to briefly address the motion to delete the 
provision in Bill C-19 which authorizes the board to determine 
applications without holding an oral hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a quasi-judicial tribunal, the board is required in all cases 
to respect the rules of natural justice.  While affected parties 
have the right to make representations to a tribunal, there is no 
absolute right to an oral hearing.  In fact the board and many 
other tribunals regularly determine applications without holding 
an oral hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Board decisions are reviewable by the federal court of appeal. 
One of the reasons the court can overturn a board decision is if 
it finds that the board has failed to respect the rules of 
natural justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-19 the board would continue to decide whether or 
not an oral hearing is necessary based on the circumstances of 
each case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is currently its policy, the board will hold an oral hearing 
when one is required in order to establish facts through witness 
testimony.  This provision simply clarifies the board's authority 
to make determinations based on the written evidence and 
representations of the parties where the facts of the case are 
not in dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the board were required to hold a hearing in every case, 
administration of the code would become even slower and more 
costly.  This would not serve the interests of the parties or 
contribute to positive labour management relations.  I do not 
support such an approach.  I strongly urge members to oppose this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with respect to the other motion in this group, which 
modifies the process for the revocation of an employer 
representative in the longshoring industry, I fail to see the 
rationale for the proposed change.  The choice of an employer 
representative belongs to the employees concerned.  They should 
be able to apply to the board to change representatives and the 
board should authorize such a change if the representative no 
longer has majority support or is otherwise no longer qualified 
to act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we certainly 
had some confusion before I was allowed to speak.  I guess at one 
point I was lamenting the fact that I would not have many people 
to speak to and now we have quite a government crowd listening to 
my presentation. I am really pleased that the government is 
taking so much interest in this issue and that I have such a 
large group to speak to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about this group of motions, but it is something 
much bigger than that.  This whole Bill C-19 is something that 
all government members here should be aware of.  What we are 
really talking about is a situation that will impact on us as 
Canadians in the 21st century in an international way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows I have great interest in the international 
community and in how well Canada is doing.  We often put 
ourselves out as number one.  The United Nations ranks us as 
number one, which is all well and good, but when we travel 
extensively throughout the world we begin to realize that we are 
falling behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are falling behind the world in a number of areas. One of 
these areas relates to Bill C-19.  It is in our competitiveness, 
our transportation network and our ability for sales in something 
as valuable as grain and other commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crowd continues to build in the government ranks. Obviously 
they are very interested in what I have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the globalization of the world, three major trading blocs are 
developing:  the European Union; the Americas, and all the hope 
we have for that; and southeast Asia.  We have to look at how 
globalization relates to the actual situation of our labour and 
that valuable resource this country has.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very highly trained and skilled workforce.  We have a 
good education system.  However, as I pointed out, we are falling 
behind in the world because we are failing to compete as well. We 
are failing to be conscious of productivity, of making our 
industries the most productive they can possibly be.  We are not 
keeping up the standard of quality control that we require.  Most 
of all, we are not being seen any more as a reliable supplier of 
products such as our agricultural products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of prolonged strikes on our ability to be reliable 
marketers in the world cannot be imagined until we talk to 
Japanese merchants or Chinese purchasers that want to buy malt 
barley from us.  We start to realize the problem when Japanese 
shipowners ask how we would like to have a ship that has been 
booked for months and months sitting idle in a port for 30, 40 or 
50 days.  The ship was to make another shipment down the road yet 
it was sitting there.  It is all about transportation.  It is all 
about our ability to deliver.  It is all about reliability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to start thinking about these things.  This place must 
get off its old line of working in a vacuum, that Canada is the 
greatest, that Canada is number one, and start thinking about how 
we are to compete in the 21st century.  That is where Bill C-19 
becomes such a important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of amendments and the previous groups of amendments 
come down to democratization and what it means to Canadians. We 
need to talk about this board.  We need to ask ourselves if this 
is the modern way to approach the problems I have identified.  Is 
this the best way to deal with the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion in Group No. 7 talks about having unions involved 
only when they can get employees to sign union certification 
cards at a level of 35%.  That is not very high and that is not 
really democracy, but at least it is a long way from where we are 
now.  The amendments in Group No. 2 proposed by our party will 
help to bring democracy, accountability and to build a system 
that is transparent, acceptable and competitive to take care of 
the problem respecting our ability to deal in the global market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at this board.  We must ask who should be on it. As 
a number of previous speakers have indicated, who do we expect 
will show up on a board like this one?  If we follow the 
traditional status quo of dealing with boards we know who will be 
there.  We know they will have to be fundraisers or retired or 
defeated candidates.  They will have to be somebody with 
connections to be on this board.  Is that what gives us the 
transparent and functional board that our businessmen and farmers 
want to have in the 21st century?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell a story to point out what I mean.  I attended the 
APEC conference in Vancouver as the foreign affairs critic for 
our party.  I was at a function where most government officials 
from the various countries were present. 
At my table was a defeated Liberal candidate who had been given a 
two day junket to Vancouver as his reward for having run and been 
defeated by the Liberal Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this very important meeting there were officials from various 
countries.  At our table was a representative from New Guinea. 
Our illustrious representative of the government asked some very 
important questions of this delegate from Papua, New Guinea. He 
said “You are from Papua.  There is no such name as that.  What 
a silly name that is”.  That is where that delegate lives; that 
is his country; that is where he is from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He thought it was quite a funny name and quite silly. Then he 
went on to say “I thought this was just for people who were from 
Asia.  I did not know you could belong to APEC and not be from 
Asia.  What are you doing here?  You don't look Asian”.  Was 
this is a diplomatic thing to say to this man from Papua, New 
Guinea?  He really was not impressed at that point and looked at 
our representative and said “Canada is a member of APEC as 
well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of people the government appoints to boards. 
They end up on committees representing Canadians.  This does not 
allow us to become productive.  This does not allow us to become 
competitive.  This does nothing for us in the international 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at these motions, at Bill C-19 and the huge 
government turnout that came to hear this message, I just have to 
be impressed.  I want to close at this point and think it would 
only be fitting to ask for quorum so that some of the members who 
were not here might come in to catch the last word or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just to be clear, is 
the member for Red Deer calling quorum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Yes, I am.  I would like to call quorum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just want to put 
on record, because the hon. member indicated for the record that 
there were no Liberal members present, that there were 18 Liberal 
members here, one Reform—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I 
thank my colleague from Red Deer for raising the points that he 
did.  I would like to expand on what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was talking about the importance of the bill to international 
relations.  I would like to take that from a more local 
perspective and to pose a question.  How will passage of the bill 
help the average Canadian?  Is the average Canadian even aware of 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to do that we have to examine who the legislation 
affects directly.  It affects about 10% of Canada's workforce, 
those people who work in federally regulated industries like 
transportation, communication and all workers in the Northwest 
Territories; in other words, about 700,000 of the Canadian 
workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves what is the impact of the bill on the 
average person in Canada.  Specifically, will it improve things 
for the average person in Canada?  Does the passage of the bill 
mean that there will be an improvement in for instance the mail 
service?  No, it does not.  It does not preclude any work 
stoppages such as the one we saw in mail service last winter.  It 
has not improved those situations at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to open up the industrial relations portion of the 
Canada Labour Code, why not address some of these problems that 
mean something to the average person in Canada?  Every person in 
Canada at one point or another mails a letter or receives a 
letter.  First class mail is a monopoly of the post office.  How 
has the legislation improved mail service in Canada?  The short 
answer is that it has not improved mail service in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it has improved Canada's ability to be a reliable 
exporter of goods.  Let us look at that.  Canada has ports on 
both ends of the country, a huge country that has reliable salt 
water ports both on the west coast and east coast of the country. 
They are extremely important outlets to world markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that the industrial relations portion of the bill 
has made some improvement here.  As we examine the bill we have 
to ask ourselves what those improvements could possibly be. Would 
it mean that as a result of changes to the bill that Canadians 
can more easily get products to port, loaded on ships, out 
through the port and off to customers?  No.  As my colleague has 
pointed out, we still have the bottleneck problem of trying to 
get our goods through ports which with great regularity have some 
sort of work stoppages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, it is not always a strike.  Oftentimes it is a 
lockout.  What difference does it make to the average person on 
the street who is affected by the overall economy of Canada, the 
impact of not being able to get our goods to port and on to world 
markets?  I do not think we have improved that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have we not?  The only thing that I can see is that the 
government is unwilling to address the fact that we need to have 
some sort of dispute settlement mechanism if collective 
bargaining fails, and it has been failing; otherwise we would not 
have these work stoppages.  It works in some cases but it seems 
like when things get critical the work stoppages occur right at 
the time when we need ports the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work stoppages in the post office never occur during summer 
holidays. 
They always seem to occur around Christmas-time when the demand 
for the services of the post office is the greatest.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, work stoppages at the ports do not seem to happen in 
the spring when the farmers are busy seeding.  They always seem 
to happen in the wintertime when the farmers are cleaning out 
their granaries, trying to market their crops.  It affects a lot 
more people than just simply the farmers.  It affects the people 
on the railways.  It affects the people of Canada, in general, 
because lost sales have to be recovered somehow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not the only producer of these products.  Whether they 
are agricultural products, dehydrated alfalfa or potash, it does 
not matter.  These are products that we have to get to market in 
order to maintain our businesses.  As we are often told, and we 
concur, this is a great, prosperous country in which to live, but 
we have to pay attention to business.  We simply cannot be in a 
position where we can lose market after market and maintain a 
buoyant position in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that this bill does not do anything to help the 
average Canadian, it could be asked:  Why is the average Canadian 
not saying something?  Why are they not up in arms?  Why are they 
not telling us to make some improvements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out, this only affects about 10% of the Canadian 
workforce.  The average Canadian is so busy trying to make a 
living and paying their taxes that they do not have time to worry 
about problems like this.  That is the reason we are raising 
these problems today and trying to make some improvements to this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like very much to see products, regardless of whether 
they originate at the farmgate, at the lumber mill, or at the 
mine, to be able to reach port through a dependable 
transportation system, to be loaded onto ships and to be carried 
to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has a huge impact on the Canadian economy.  Anything that 
has a large impact on the Canadian economy has a large impact on 
individual people who, at first glance, would say “That is the 
Canada Labour Code.  That is industrial relations.  I do not work 
for the federal government.  It has no effect on me”.  But it 
does.  It affects every person in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are provisions in this bill which we consider to be less 
than democratic.  There are provisions which would enable the 
Canada Industrial Labour Board to certify a union without a 
majority indicating they would like to belong to the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we will hear from the NDP, and we have heard from the 
government, that it can only do that provided there is clear 
evidence before the board that the employer has used some sort of 
unfair labour tactics, as if implying that it is only the 
employer who can use pressure tactics on a group of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that this is undemocratic.  Certification of a union 
should take place by secret ballot.  When a person goes into the 
polling booth to cast a ballot nobody can put pressure on that 
person.  They have the security and the confidentiality of the 
secret ballot.  That is how unions should be certified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many times about how this legislation seeks a 
balance.  I would submit that if it is fair to certify a union 
without a majority, it should be fine to de-certify a union 
without a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I submit that the Canada Industrial Relations Board 
will have tremendous pressure put on it by union bosses to see 
every case brought before it as undermining the unions.  Every 
case will be pled on that basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a very important 
debate and I see a very, very pale attendance from the other 
side.  I would like a quorum call, please.

<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to do something a bit novel.  I would like to actually 
speak to one of the motions that we are dealing with currently, 
which will be a bit of a shift from the last couple of speakers. 
We heard everything from Papua, New Guinea, to international 
affairs and how the labour code is going to have a broad-sweeping 
international detrimental impact on our country's abilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with some of the specifics of why we are really here 
today, I would like to talk to Motion No. 7 put forward by the 
member for Wetaskiwin which would require that a representation 
vote be taken among employees in a unit and so on.  The member 
spoke briefly about this when he made his remarks.  He thought it 
would be a breach of democracy if there were situations in which 
a union could be granted certification if there had been unfair 
labour practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out some of the legal arguments that the board 
has to take into consideration when it makes such a rare ruling 
as granting automatic certification.  Really what it hinges on is 
the board being satisfied that it is not possible to determine 
the true wishes of the employees because there has been 
interference.  In that situation it will grant certification.  It 
will give the employees the benefit of the doubt.  Again, the 
board will only do that if the employees have demonstrated that 
without that interference the application for certification would 
actually have gone through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the actual case histories where this has happened, union 
representatives have had to show that they were well on their way 
to signing up enough cards, that they were getting close to a 
majority.  Then the onus was on the union or the representative 
of the workers to prove that there was interference to such a 
degree that holding a vote would have been irrelevant because the 
whole situation had been poisoned to the point where the true 
wishes of the employees would not be known by a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that the member made was that the privacy of the 
ballot box, the sanctity of the voting booth, is a place where no 
interference can take place.  The result of every organizing 
drive that I have been on was that the election was held at the 
place of work; in fact, in the offices of the employer.  Every 
worker who wanted to vote on the issue had to march down a 
gauntlet, walk down a hallway where all the bosses stood in the 
doors to their offices with their arms folded and glared at 
them to the point where we filed complaints.  It has been very 
much a problem in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interference happens even without speaking.  There is 
psychological interference.  It is very difficult to walk past 
the person who has control over your economic destiny and do 
something that person does not want you to do.  Most employers do 
not want a union in their workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree that there is no interference possible when it is a 
secret ballot vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made the point that he did not think if union 
representatives got 35% of the cards signed they should get a 
vote.  I think that is wrong.  I think if 35% is indicated there 
is a sufficient amount of support to test it.  If certification 
is not granted at 35%, then there will be a vote supervised by 
the labour board.  That is very fair, in my estimation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If over 50% of the cards are signed, the board will say that a 
vote is not necessary, majority support has been demonstrated and 
it should go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument is that it actually takes more of a conscious effort 
to sign a union card.  Those cards have to be written very 
specifically to say the undersigned wants this particular 
bargaining agent to represent them in all matters dealing with 
terms and conditions, wages, et cetera.  They have to read it, 
sign that they have read it, dig in their pocket and hand over 
$5.  They have to consciously indicate that they want the union 
to represent them.  It is actually more meaningful in my mind 
than walking into a ballot box, seeing yea or nay and putting an 
<I>x</I> on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having 35% of the cards signed is very meaningful to me.  It 
indicates a level of support that deserves to be tested with a 
vote.  If there is 50% plus one, then the people have spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 asks for a vote in all cases.  Even if the union 
manages to show that 100% of the cards have been signed, 
according to this motion a vote would still have to be conducted. 
People would be asked to vote twice on the same thing.  How many 
times are votes to be held?  Until they get the answer they want? 
Will people be made to vote over and over again until the desired 
effect is achieved and they can finally cap it off?  That would 
be patently unfair.  If majority support can be indicated, that 
should be satisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Automatic certification is an aspect of fairness which we are 
trying to achieve, as per the Sims task force and as per the 
whole substance of Bill C-19.  We are trying to create a balance. 
We are trying to provide people with access to representation 
without fear of coercion, intimidation or the misuse of the 
historic imbalance in the power relationship that has always 
existed between employers and employees.  We are seeking to level 
that playing field, at least for matters of labour relations, to 
make the two parties more equal.  They will not be afraid of each 
other because they will have this equalizing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 does not put too much power in the hands of working 
people and unions.  All other matters are still the exclusive 
right of management.  Every collective agreement has a management 
rights clause which states that management has the exclusive 
right to dictate the means of production, the hours of work, et 
cetera.  That is an aspect of every part of labour management 
relations.  We are only talking about fairness in terms of access 
to representation if the people want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing threatening in Bill C-19, nor in the amendments 
dealing with certification.  Adopting Motion No. 7 would be a 
huge step backwards in terms of allowing people to make their own 
choice on whether or not they want representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We are on Government Orders which has to do with 
government business.  This is a bill the government wants to put 
through.  We happen to support it, but that it beside the point. 
The point is that it is the government's responsibility to get 
its legislation through.  The purpose of quorum calls is not to 
have people poke their noses through the curtain and then leave. 
The idea is to keep a quorum so that when people are speaking to 
legislation they are actually speaking to somebody on the 
government side, so I would call quorum one more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have a call for

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Guelph—Wellington rose on a point of order 
earlier with regard to quorum calls and suggested the numerical 
values of what is on her side of the House versus this side of 
the House showed how wonderful the Liberals were.

No. 2 are the powers and activities of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is appropriate, even though it is not in this group, 
that we talk about what kind of board we have to enforce these 
powers.  If the make-up of the board is one way, then it may be 
more comfortable with a power.  If the make-up is a different 
way— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think we have 
quorum again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I will ask the clerk

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was talking about the powers 
the board is going to have, particularly the ones contained in 
Group No. 2 of the motions now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk in terms of the make-up of this board, the 
government wants to ensure the ability to put patronage 
appointments into this board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers we are discussing in Group No. 2 are the kind of 
powers we are talking about, people who are put in there by 
patronage and not necessarily by merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a situation earlier during the first term of my office as 
MP where we needed a chair of the unemployment insurance 
commission board, the board of referees in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We felt this was very important because it meant not proper 
representation for the people who have problems in their riding. 
They had to go all the way to the Okanagan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggested the names of three people to be chairs of boards. 
This will illustrate our concern under Group No. 2 regarding the 
make-up of this board.  One was the campaign manager for the 
Conservative candidate, one was a non-Liberal and one was a 
person whose party affiliation we did not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put their names in because we believed they would be good 
people.  As it happened, we got no answer from the government on 
what it was going to do and the chair remained empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day my assistant and my wife were at the local college 
speaking about politics.  There also was the assistant campaign 
manager of the failed Liberal candidate for the riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He came to my assistant and said “I hear you are concerned 
about getting a chair appointed for the board of referees”.  It 
is interesting that he would have that information because we 
only conveyed that to the government.  He said “don't worry 
about it because I'm being appointed”.  I raised that in the 
House and in the newspaper and made quite a fuss.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reporter from the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> actually went to the 
riding and interviewed this individual.  He told this individual 
that his member of parliament was questioning the fact that this 
was a patronage appointment and asked him how he would respond to 
that.  He said “Of course it is patronage.  What is wrong with 
that?  How else would we attract people to our party?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have a great concern about the make-up of this board and 
how it will be in a position to deal with some of the situations 
in this bill, particularly in Group No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 deals with the potential streamlining of the board. 
We think that perhaps the Bloc's heart was in the right place 
when it wrote this but it is a bit of overkill.  The Bloc is 
talking about having no ability whatsoever in relatively minor 
cases for the board to streamline things.  We think it is 
appropriate.  When people are waiting for the board to make a 
decision on a simple matter and fairly clear cut, we would like 
to think that the board can pick up the speed of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 is a particularly interesting one because now we 
are talking about representation.  By the sound of what the 
labour critic for the NDP said on this, I suggest that perhaps he 
has personal experience which has kind of poisoned his attitude 
to this process.  He is talking about having to march down this 
line of hostile employers who have the power to read his mind. 
Why else would he feel threatened?  He could have gone in with a 
big smile and given them a thumbs up. “Isn't that guy a good 
fellow.  Obviously he is going to vote our way”. In other words, 
he feels they can read his mind and that is what is intimidating 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe me, knowing the hon. member, I would be a little 
intimidated too if I were him and thought somebody could read my 
mind at times.  I will not even go to the natural line of that 
out of respect for the hon. member.  Even though our opinions 
differ, I do have some level of respect for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we start talking in terms of votes, the member is saying 
35% is good enough.  I will bet the Bloc would love to pass this 
one.  Imagine if the Bloc said “Wait a minute, if we can get 
popular support for this, in the next Quebec referendum we only 
need 35%”.  If we go back to what the hon. member in the NDP 
said, it is really hard to sign people up.  So 35% is good 
enough.  Can anyone imagine what the Bloc would do with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucien Bouchard may be watching this debate today saying “If 
this government says 35% is enough, I think we will adopt it in 
the next referendum.  If 35% of the population of Quebec votes to 
separate we're out of here”.  Interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals may want to think about that when they come to vote 
on that motion.  Do they really want to say that 35% represents 
the majority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Quebec referendum we heard some people over there 
suggesting that 50% is not even enough and that maybe it should 
be 60%.  Do they really want to set a precedent that states that 
35% is good enough?  I really hope they will start thinking about 
that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 8 what we are really looking at is to have 
democracy, pure and simple.  The hon. member from the NDP 
actually suggested there is no way employees could possibly have 
a fair vote and if they sign up 35% that is proof positive.  He 
says there is no way they will ever get a fair vote because they 
are intimidated by the employer.  He is perhaps forgetting the 
case with Wal-Mart where considerably less than 50% signed up. 
The union that wanted to sign them up said it was unfair 
management practice and it was interfered with.  It demanded that 
there should be certification because it was interfered with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board looked at this and agreed and so it certified them. 
The employees did not want it and now they are seeking to have 
the union decertified.  So much for the arguments from the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on considerably, as the House well knows, on 
individual parts of this.  Comments made from the Liberal side 
alone could keep me going all day I am sure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are looking at 
Group No. 2, which contains four motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of Motion No. 6 because we want to prevent the 
arbitrary appointment of replacements for representatives who 
have been duly appointed by their group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Excuse me, I realize I made a mistake.  I was in fact referring 
to Motion No. 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus particular attention on the two motions proposed 
by the hon. member of the Reform Party.  In our opinion, Motion 
No. 7 allows strikebreakers to be used, in that they could vote 
for a bargaining unit, which we find excessive and unacceptable. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois are strenuously opposed to any use of 
strikebreakers, for reasons rooted in Quebec history. 
There is a consensus on this in Quebec.  The use of scabs 
results in an escalation of violence and stirs up emotions.  All 
manner of problems arise in a labour conflict when scab labour 
is brought in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still worse, what the Reform Party is proposing is for these 
scabs to have a right to vote. As well as replacing employees, 
they could take part in union decisions.  This we find 
unacceptable.  It is not clearly set out but the possibility is 
there and we are opposed to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 30 refers to unfair labour practices by the employer. 
It weakens the importance of recognition of duly unionized 
workers and allows them to be replaced by people who are not 
accredited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am raising this point again to shed a more general light on 
this bill. In this House, two parties are opposed to the bill: 
the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois. The other parties 
support it because, in their opinion, it is a series of 
compromises acceptable to labour and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the arguments on which the Bloc Quebecois' opposition 
is based relate mainly to the possible use of scabs, which is 
unacceptable in Quebec. Reform members on the other hand, 
probably because of the type of concerns in the region of Canada 
they represent, call for the existing rules to be relaxed. They 
are asking for greater freedom than that currently provided by 
the legislation and are opposed to the bill because they feel it 
goes too far. In our opinion, it does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may use an analogy, it is somewhat reminiscent of the 
Charlottetown accord. 
Quebeckers were faced with a proposal from all of Canada's first 
ministers, including the Quebec premier, who, rather 
surprisingly and paradoxically, had agreed to compromise. This 
compromise went so far that Quebec did not go for it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the other end of the country, people felt too much power was 
being given to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not unusual in this House. There are two very important 
cultures and attitudes in this country. Compromise must be 
sought with respect to working conditions. Discussions around 
work issues are about people's livelihood and are much more down 
to earth than discussions about the Constitution as far as 
people are concerned, since they deal with their everyday labour 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are dealing with two different cultures and views of 
the work world that are hard to reconcile. I shall attempt to 
demonstrate this today by outlining the rationale behind the 
Bloc Quebecois' opposition to the Reform Party's proposals. 
We believe that allowing scabs to vote on important issues in 
the place of unionized workers is unacceptable and that is why 
we are opposed to this practice.

pleased to rise on the Group No. 2 motions before us at report 
stage of Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see you back in the chair, Mr. Speaker.  I knew 
you would be pleased that I was speaking whilst on your watch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to follow up a little more on the points raised by 
the Reform member who spoke. It would be nice if we could call 
the members here by their names.  I realize it is tradition that 
we have to call them by their riding names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something interesting happened to the New Zealand parliament 
when it switched to the MMP system of representation.  Half of 
the members do not actually having ridings.  They are selected on 
the basis of party lists.  The house was faced with the problem 
of how to identify members when they cannot be called by a riding 
name. They dispensed completely with calling people by the 
ridings and now they call each other by their names. It raises 
the question why it was even necessary to have this tradition in 
the past anyway.  But I digress as I tend to do, and I will get 
back to the point we were talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little earlier my colleague from the Kootenay area riding was 
talking about the 35% threshold for certifying a union.  It 
really puzzles me how the NDP, which claims to be the New 
Democratic Party, can argue against democracy in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reinforce the argument of my colleague.  How could you 
possibly take 35% to be representative of the majority?  As my 
colleague mentioned, if the Bloc Quebecois had that rule for 
their Quebec referendum, especially if they could argue coercion, 
that people on the way to the polling booth to vote had to walk 
through an armada of no signs, they would automatically get 
certified for separation.  It is totally ludicrous. If you have 
democracy you have democracy and that means a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the NDP support for such a concept is based on the fact 
that the workers have to compulsorily contribute to the NDP 
through their union dues.  There are plenty of workers out there 
who do not want to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Wal-Mart affair in Ontario is certainly a good example of 
that. The Canada Industrial Relations Board in its wisdom 
certified the union when 151 of the Wal-Mart employees at the 
Windsor store voted against a union and 43 voted for it.  How 
could a union possibly be certified under those circumstances? 
There were 151 against and 43 for a union and it was certified. 
Why? Because the CIRB made a random decision that the employer 
was unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the workers are organizing to decertify. I would say that 
almost certainly indicates that their will has been absolutely 
defied by the Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
It is absolutely appalling that those people on the CIRB would 
use their political bent, their ideology to force a decision upon 
unwilling workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will certainly be watching the ongoing happenings with that 
particular decertification drive. I think it will show 
conclusively that workers want control of their own destiny. They 
do not want these sorts of undemocratic laws forced upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's Motion No. 30 would fix this problem of 35%.  The bill 
as it stands allows the Canada Industrial Relations Board to 
certify a union even if there is no evidence of majority support 
if the board believes there would have been support had it not 
been for the employer's unfair labour practices. That is a really 
subjective judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The determination of what constitutes an unfair labour practice 
is left entirely up to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. The 
Wal-Mart case as I said illustrates that.  What we would like to 
see is that a union not be certified unless there is a secret 
ballot held and a majority of the workers have to support that 
idea of a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 also proposed by the Reform Party deals with the 
Canada Labour Code which states that the board may, and I 
underline may, hold a representational vote on union 
certification to satisfy itself that the workers want the union. 
The word is “may” and we would like to see that as “must”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, how can we possibly guarantee a democratic process if we 
do not allow people to vote?  The same members in this House who 
want to certify unions with 35% with all sorts of arbitrary 
procedures would never ever agree to such procedures in their own 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can laugh, Mr. Speaker. Can you imagine the situation in 
your own riding if that were to happen.  You probably would not 
be sitting there today.  All sorts of strange things could happen 
and you could be on the patronage bandwagon today, Mr. Speaker, 
looking for a position on the immigration and refugee board, or 
maybe on this Canada Industrial Relations Board.  You would 
certainly deserve it, Mr. Speaker.  You have been here long 
enough to prove that you are part of club Chrétien.  I think you 
have earned enough membership points.  You might even get to the 
Senate, I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, in this group there are two Reform motions which 
obviously we support.  There are two Bloc motions which we 
oppose.  Members before me have indicated briefly why we would do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the Bloc wants to delete the clause in the bill which 
allows the CIRB to make decisions without oral hearings in fairly 
straightforward cases.  We think it clogs the system if there is 
too much process.  Therefore we are not supporting that 
particular motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other one proposed by the Bloc has to do with the common 
practice where a group of employers will join forces to have just 
one agent represent them in negotiations.  The amendment from the 
Bloc removes the requirement that the board must satisfy itself 
that the employer representative is no longer qualified to act in 
that capacity before revoking the appointment. The Bloc amendment 
provides for the automatic removal of the employer representative 
upon receipt of an application from one or more of the employers 
in the group and the appointment of a new representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that there should be a vote of the majority of the 
members in this employer's group before such an action is taken. 
We really feel that the Bloc motion would weaken the employer's 
association position if they could just have one employer come 
along and the same sort of lack of process that we are talking 
about on the union side would suddenly be appearing on the 
employer side as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That deals with my comments on the Group No. 2 motions. I 
realize you probably need to take a break soon, Mr. Speaker, but 
I hope you are back in time for my speech on the Group No. 3 
motions.

many months have gone by.  Much work has been done.  Many

was even presented to the minister with many comments on how to 
make the Canada Labour Code fair for all parties involved, both 
labour and employers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, federal labour jurisdiction encompasses some 
very important sectors of our economy, for example, 
interprovincial transportation, aeronautics, broadcasting, banks 
and shipping. The federal government also has jurisdiction over 
labour matters involving the federal public service.  In all, 
federal labour legislation governs about 10% of the Canadian 
workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason why we as legislators must make sure changes 
that will be made to part I of the Canada Labour Code are changes 
dated 1998 and not 1965.  We must make sure that these changes 
serve today's and future generations of workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1996 Bill C-66 was introduced to parliament.  It was 
rushed through the House of Commons like we expect the government 
will want to do with Bill C-19.  Then as is the custom the Senate 
social affairs committee gave Bill C-66 careful consideration. PC 
senators outlined major flaws with the bill especially with 
respect to the privacy issue, replacement workers and 
certification as a remedy. This is the issue I wish to delve into 
at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are on May 7, 1998 speaking on many flaws that still 
exist and proposing solutions to these flaws.  As the member of 
parliament for the riding of Madawaska—Restigouche, elected 
democratically by the citizens of my great riding, I have a lot 
of difficulty with a clause which states:  “The board may 
certify a trade union despite the lack of evidence of majority 
support”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a sentence like this in a bill from a democratically 
elected House, the House of Commons of Canada, should certainly 
raise many eyebrows.  Whatever happened to democracy?  Mr. 
Speaker, do you think the Prime Minister is travelling too much 
to Cuba? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 46 states that if the employer “has failed to comply 
with section 94 and the board is of the opinion that, but for the 
unfair labour practice, the trade union could reasonably have 
been expected to have had the support of a majority of the 
employees in the unit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government consider to be unfair labour practice? 
Let me shed some light on the interpretation that was given to a 
clause much like the one before us now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated previously by an hon. member, consider the case last 
winter in which a majority of 151 to 43 employees of Wal-Mart in 
Windsor voted against unionization.  The Ontario Labour Relations 
Board ruled that the employer had engaged in unfair labour 
practices and made them all join the steelworkers union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the unfair labour practice?  What big bad deed did the 
employer practice in?  What action was so reprehensible that 
almost three-quarters of the employees voting against 
unionization had to be overturned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Managers of the store when they were asked whether the store 
would close if it were unionized followed the legal advice they 
had received and refused to comment.  They did not say anything. 
That was an unfair labour practice. What were they supposed to 
say?  A yes would almost certainly have been judged to be 
intimidation but a no might well have led to a lawsuit had higher 
labour costs would in fact put the store out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the OLRB's view, the managers' refusal to answer was such a 
grievous violation of workers rights that it invalidated not only 
that vote but any future votes as well.  Since the managers could 
not avoid unfair labour practice by saying yes, saying no, or 
saying nothing, it is reasonably clear that legislation of this 
sort draws its principal inspiration from Lewis Carroll. 
Following the Ontario decision, a similar situation was under way 
in British Columbia.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows how a bad decision can snowball.  We should take a 
stand against this attempt to void a democratic vote on a mere 
whim. It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1997 election campaign, the Progressive Conservative 
Party promised to strengthen the protection conferred by labour 
laws on workers by increasing their democratic rights.  We would 
have required a secret ballot with respect to matters involving 
union representation. 
It can therefore be argued that increasing workers' democratic 
rights includes respecting the wishes expressed in a secret 
ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of holding a vote, if it can be overturned for 
any old reason?  In support of my argument, I wish to refer to 
the conclusions of the Standing Senate Committee on Social 
Affairs, Science and Technology, which, as I said earlier, made 
an exhaustive study of Bill C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its report, the Senate committee wrote as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your committee has heard concerns that the provision in Clause 
46 which would allow the Canada Industrial Relations Board to 
certify a trade union as a remedy for employer unfair labour 
practices, runs counter to the principle that certification 
should be based solely on the majority support of the employees 
in the bargaining unit.  We strongly endorse the principle of 
majority support as a basis for certification and note that Bill 
C-66 retains the Board's authority to verify support by holding a 
representation vote in any case.  We strongly recommend that the 
Board exercise the jurisdiction it has under section 29(1) of 
the Canada Labour Code and order a representation vote as a 
matter of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the concerns that have been 
expressed to the committee on this clause are serious and urge 
the utmost caution in applying this exceptional provision. 
Though a number of provincial labour statutes include similar 
provisions, they are used by provincial labour boards in rare 
cases, where an employer commits a serious unfair labour 
practice and where a representation vote is unlikely to provide 
a true measure of the employees' wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend, 
therefore, that in interpreting and applying Section 99.1, the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board should respect the findings of 
the Sims Task Force, namely, that this is an unusual remedy 
which should be reserved for “truly intolerable conduct” by an 
employer.  Your committee has concerns about whether the recent 
use of a similar clause by the Ontario Labour Relations Board in 
the Wal-Mart case is in fact an appropriate use of such a 
measure. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its report, the Senate committee, the majority of whose 
members are Liberals, would probably have proposed an amendment 
deleting clause 46 if it had had the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore hope that members of the House will support this 
amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I hesitate to rise because I certainly do not want it to be 
thought by anyone who supports Bill C-19 that I am in any way 
supportive of the filibuster the Reform Party is performing for 
us today with respect to Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things have been said that I think should not go 
unanswered. 
The debate on Bill C-19 which has gone on at various stages—and 
we are now at report stage—has shown the profound bias that 
exists in the Reform Party against labour unions, wage earners 
and their right to organize themselves collectively to defend 
their interests in the workplace and in the economy in general.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I know a lot about the Reform Party, I have to say 
that I am shocked at the vehemence and the unfairness with which 
it advanced these arguments.  For example, a Reform member talked 
about his objection to the notion that 35% of a workforce signing 
its cards would be sufficient to create a vote on whether or not 
to certify the union in that workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did two things.  First, he tried to give the 
impression that the 35% in and of itself was enough to certify 
the union.  No one has ever said that and that is not what the 
bill says.  For the member to try to give that impression, I do 
not know whether he is as dumb as a bag of hammers or whether he 
is trying to give a false impression to the House.  The fact is 
that the bill is very clear that 35% is what causes a vote to be 
taken.  Thirty-five per cent has never been regarded sufficient 
for certification in itself. It is very interesting the member 
would be so concerned about— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  They do not like what I am saying 
because they are desperately trying to change the subject over 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting the member would dump all over the notion 
that 35% is enough.  This morning his leader had a press 
conference and announced the Reform new Canada act that has 
provision for a constitutional constituent assembly at which 
things would be decided about the constitution of the country. 
What would it take to cause this vote to take place at the 
constitutional constituent assembly?  It would take 3% of 
eligible electoral voters, but when it comes to a union 35% is 
not enough.  When it comes to a union, they will have to win the 
vote before they have the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are we trying to kid?  Only somebody who was profoundly 
anti-union could hold such a double standard that when it comes 
to unions 35% is not enough to cause a vote to take place but 
when it comes to the country 3% is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare members to look back at all the proposals that have been 
made by individual Reform MPs and by the Reform Party as to what 
would be enough to cause a referendum to take place in various 
situations.  I would bet that in none of those situations did 
they ask that it be 35% to cause a vote to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it comes to unions, when it comes to working 
people, when it comes to wage earners having the opportunity to 
vote as to who will represent them in the workplace, the Reform 
Party has an entirely different standard.  When it is a vote that 
Reformers want to take place, 3% will do, but when it comes to 
unions 35% is not enough.  Let this double standard speak for 
itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise after the member who just spoke.  That was a most 
interesting interpretation. 
I would like to read for his benefit the specific clause being 
debated and the amendment actually being proposed.  The following 
is being proposed in government legislation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>29.(1)  The Board may, for the purpose of satisfying itself as to 
whether employees in a unit wish to have a particular trade union 
represent them as their bargaining agent, order that a 
representation vote be taken among the employees in the unit 
where it is satisfied that at least thirty-five per cent of the 
employees in the unit are members of the trade unit applying for 
certification.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is proposing to leave all that in place with 
one change, that is that the word “may” be changed to the word 
“shall”.  That is the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What in the world was this gentleman who just spoke talking 
about?   What were those people over there clapping about?  What 
were they all laughing about?  They do not understand their own 
bill.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the NDP railing about things.  What the NDP member was 
actually saying is in the bill.  What is in the bill is what the 
government wants.  All we want to do is to make sure that this 
democratic principle is observed.  That is the issue.  When will 
the NDP learn what the English language actually says?  When will 
those hon. members recognize what they mean when legislation is 
put before the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  While I am sure the 
debate is very energetic, it is very difficult for the Chair to 
hear the hon. member for Kelowna who has the floor.  I am trying 
to listen, but it is exceedingly difficult to hear with all the 
enthusiastic debate going on in the Chamber.  Perhaps we could 
have a little more order so that the hon. member for Kelowna 
could resume his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I cannot hear for Reformers heckling their own member. 
I appreciate— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Speaker cannot hear for the noise 
in the Chamber and we will leave it at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful that we 
can have such a spirited discussion about democracy.  It means 
that democracy works.  It has a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move to another point.  It has to do with 
another proposal being made.  It would amend subclause 16 (4.1) 
in the proposed legislation and reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On application of one or more employers of employees in the 
bargaining unit, the Board may revoke the appointment of the 
employer representative and appoint a new representative. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very serious amendment.  It says that one person may 
determine that someone should not represent them any more.  It 
takes away any kind of secondary or objective evaluation of 
whether the individual representing a group is qualified to 
continue to be that representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not simply be one person's whim or fancy that allows 
someone to be taken out of a negotiation situation.  All they 
might say is that they do not understand or they do not agree 
with him and as a consequence want him out of there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be some protection against the kind of arbitrary 
and fanciful thinking which the motion suggests.  I would have to 
speak against it and suggest that there has to be a somewhat 
fairer system of doing it, a fairer process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to the third area I want to comment on concerning 
the business of changing one of the motions that has to do with 
the business of who may decide what is unfair labour practice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion in the bill would read that the CIRB would be 
both judge and advocate.  On the one hand, this board watches 
over the process and makes decisions about whether that is fair 
and whether it is going forward in the manner that it ought to 
proceed.  Then if one of the parties is judged to be, in the 
opinion of the CIRB, unfair or engaging in unfair labour 
practices it is not totally impartial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a commitment earlier in the process for them to work 
directly with these people.  If now it states that they are being 
unfair in the kind of labour practices that they are engaging in 
they are in fact arguing against themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this very example took place in Ontario in the 
Wal-Mart case where the employees said they did not want to be 
certified.  However, because somebody took the interpretation 
that management had engaged in unfair labour practices, we are 
now going to say they can certify.  It totally denies the 
realization that a vast majority of these people did not want the 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members might say that was in the heat of the moment, emotions 
prevailed and there were unfair labour practices.  However, 
members should notice what has happened since then. Recently we 
have the realization that the Windsor store alone voted 151 to 43 
in favour of the union's being decertified.  Is this not a clear 
indication that the earlier ruling by the CIRB was wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three reasons why we should oppose these motions in 
Group No. 2.  First, to recognize the business of having only one 
person to allow another person to be taken out of the negotiation 
procedure is wrong.  We must oppose the proposal within the 
proposed legislation that the board may deny democracy to 
operator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we in this House want to be honest with each other and want 
to be a clear debating society, then we must agree that we should 
take whatever steps we can to assure that democracy takes place 
not only here but in all the agencies and in all the ways in 
which we negotiate disagreements or where we have differences of 
opinion.  We must preserve that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also preserve the judicial procedure at least in 
principle that allows fairness and equity to take place so that 
judge and advocate cannot exist at the same time and make 
arguments against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I want to raise which has to do with the 
democracy in this place.  Could it be that the government of the 
day could actually take it into its consideration and agree that 
maybe there are times, even after it has gone through second 
reading and the committee process, that it could entertain, 
accept and agree to amendments in the legislation that make sense 
and that will guarantee the very fundamental issue on which this 
country was built, democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government does nothing else, perhaps it could see it in 
its heart and in its mind to change that particular provision in 
the bill to say the board shall guarantee that democracy operates 
with those people who want a union or who do not want a union in 
a particular area.  This has nothing to do with being pro or 
anti-union.  It means people have a right to decide how they want 
to govern themselves and how they want their relationships with 
their employers to be obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it is in the heart of all of us to allow workers as well 
as anyone else to exercise and demonstrate their democratic 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I listened to my colleague give such an eloquent speech. 
It is a real shame that there are not more here to hear that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a feeling in the House that this is an 
important debate and that there should be some close attention 
paid.  That sends a signal.  We are now speaking on changes to 
the labour code. There are four motions in Group No. 2.  I will 
make a few brief remarks to assist my colleagues in making a good 
decision with respect to these proposed amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first Bloc amendment states that the provision in the bill 
that allows the board to make decisions without oral hearings 
should be deleted.  In other words, the board must hold oral 
hearings in every case before it makes a decision.  On the face 
of this there could be some good arguments for saying that 
decisions should not be made without proper evidence being before 
the board.  So it would not be palm tree justice but there would 
be some real evidence.  There would be a balanced review of the 
evidence before making a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The background of this provision in the bill would allow the 
board to make decisions not without evidence but with written 
rather than oral evidence.  If after reviewing the written 
evidence the board feels that an oral hearing is necessary, it 
could proceed to that stage of the process. The debate on this 
amendment is whether the board should be required in all cases to 
receive oral evidence before it makes decisions or whether it can 
make decisions based only on written evidence in some cases. It 
was envisioned that this would be on minor issues although there 
would be nothing to keep the board from making major decisions 
without oral evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are arguments on both sides of the issue.  At this stage 
it might be good to give the board the flexibility to make some 
procedural and minor decisions based simply on written evidence 
in order to expedite its proceedings and to make sure there is 
not a backlog or an administrative overload on the board.  There 
could be a concern that the board might abuse that, that it might 
make decisions without receiving the proper evidence or allowing 
all the parties to have their say.  If that is a real and 
substantial concern, then the Bloc's motion makes some sense.  We 
need to weigh that carefully.  As the parliamentary secretary is 
fond of saying, we need to come out with a balance on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment was put forward by the official opposition. 
It has caused some interesting fireworks in the House due to a 
misinterpretation of this amendment by one of the NDP members, a 
member who almost never makes that kind of mistake.  I have the 
highest respect for that member and his logic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in this case the bill provides that if 35% of workers 
say that they want a representational vote, then the board may 
call a vote.  Our amendment states that if 35% of workers want a 
representational vote, then the board shall call a vote. 
In other words, democracy shall work, not may work, if the board 
decides that workers get the great gift of getting to exercise 
democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the NDP feels that having to hold a representational vote 
with only 35% of members indicating they want certification is 
not democratic, that it should be 50%, I would very strongly 
support an amendment to raise the bar from 35% to 50%.  I invite 
my friends in the NDP to make that amendment if they feel that 
there needs to be even stronger democracy in this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point we would be content to say to workers that if a 
reasonable number want union certification then there will be a 
vote as to whether that will be put into place.  If the NDP wants 
that number of workers to be raised then it can make an argument 
for doing that.  At this point the issue is not the number of 
workers who want certification, it is the fact that even if some 
workers do want certification the board may or may not choose to 
allow them to make that decision.  That totally flies in the face 
of democracy, which is something that the New Democrats I am sure 
would find absolutely repugnant.  I know they will be strongly in 
support of this democratization amendment put forward by the 
official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our country as far as I know, although I know some Liberal 
backbenchers would argue with me, we still have a democracy.  I 
know that democracy is flouted and abused and repressed, sadly, 
in procedures of the House as we perceived recently, but it is 
still a principle that even the government pays some lip service 
to. I hope we would not be denying our workers the democratic 
traditions of our country, not stripping away their democratic 
rights and replacing their ability to make free and 
self-determining decisions and having their rights replaced by 
some appointed board which decides what is best for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this dictatorship approach, this father knows best, this 
small group of elites knows best for the workers should be 
absolutely repugnant to every party in the House, most especially 
to the NDP.  I expect that this amendment will pass very easily 
because of our fervent and deep commitment to the democratic 
process in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next motion is a Bloc motion which says that if there is a 
representative of employers, a group of employers, in bargaining 
negotiations and if even one employer from that group makes an 
application then the employer representative will be turfed and 
replaced by somebody else the board chooses. What the Bloc is 
essentially saying is that unless there is unanimity an employer 
representative is going to be toast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think through the implications of this.  If there has 
to be unanimity on the part of the employers before someone can 
act on their behalf, then are we going to apply the same 
principle to workers and say there has to be unanimity among 
workers before a union can act on their behalf?  If that is the 
case there would have to be 100% vote to validate the 
certification of a union to represent workers.  Because the 
unanimity principle has been put into place for employers, in 
fairness the same principle should hold true for employees, for 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Bloc saying that its unanimity principle is the one we 
want to go on in this respect?  I do not think so.  I think the 
democratic principle is based on a majority decision.  Unless the 
block is saying there has to be unanimity across the board in the 
expression of who is going to represent both employers and 
employees, clearly it would be very inconsistent, very unfair and 
be a completely tilted playing field were we to support the Bloc 
motion. 
I appeal to my friends in the Bloc to consider how illogical this 
amendment is unless they are going to follow it up with the 
requirement of unanimity among workers before a union can be 
certified.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last amendment is a Reform amendment.  It essentially 
addresses the democracy principle as well, saying that we must 
get rid of the provision that the board can certify a union even 
if the workers say they do not want one, if the board says that 
there was an unfair labour practice. I do not have time to get 
into this.  I know that many of my colleagues will speak 
eloquently and fervently on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say that if we really believe in democracy in this

in this kind of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-19 and the second group of 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague from Wetaskiwin for 
all the work that he has put into this matter before and during 
the committee debates that have been carrying on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are looking at different groups of amendments and we 
are now debating Group No. 2.  The one I would like to dwell on 
is the democratic aspects of our amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make sure that democracy in this country can go 
through all aspects of our society.  This bill states that the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board may order a representational 
vote on union certification. That is just not good enough.  We 
would like to have our amendment brought forward which says that 
35% of the employees need to sign a card indicating they want 
union certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a recent case in Ontario. A similar provision in the 
Ontario labour relations act imposes stricter requirements on 
automatic certification.  Even under a stricter provision the 
Ontario Labour Relations Board in the recent Wal-Mart decision 
certified the steelworkers union as the bargaining agent for a 
group in a Wal-Mart store in Windsor despite the fact that 70% of 
the employees voted against the union.  The board based its 
decision on membership evidence submitted by the steelworkers 
union which showed it had support of 44% of the employees in the 
bargaining unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just goes to point out that if this bill is not treated 
properly, it can open up all kinds of strange parameters and 
undemocratic proceedings. The fact we would like to see 35% of 
employees cards signed would go a long way to stopping some of 
the problems that exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill and its predecessor, Bill C-66, are basically flawed 
for some of the reasons we are stating today. Stable labour 
relations are absolutely essential for this country to grow and 
to thrive, for people to invest in Canada and to reinvest. 
Companies that are looking to expand and to offer new services 
across Canada want stable labour relations so that they can count 
on their businesses being open and being able to supply Canadians 
with the services that they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this whole entrepreneurial aspect of our country where a 
person can come up with a good idea, promote it, develop it and 
put it in place to service Canadians, it is necessary to have in 
place the labour to fulfil these aspirations.  We would like to 
see amendments to the bill to allow that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democratic aspect of what we are promoting in the Group No. 
2 amendments is part of what we believe in. We know that the rest 
of the members of the House will develop their opinions and 
support us as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc has a motion that allows one or more employees in a 
group to appoint a new representative.  That does not follow with 
what we would like to see done so we will be opposing that 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other items my colleague from Wetaskiwin has brought 
forward to show the weakness of this bill.  One of them is access 
to offsite workers.  We will be handling that at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw a couple of years ago during the winter that we could not 
for various reasons get our products to port, and once they got 
to port we could not get them out.  This bill is to help relieve 
that situation.  It guarantees that once a product or grain gets 
to port, it will be shipped. We have a whole lot of things to 
address in the labour act to enable those products to get from 
the farm gate or from the manufacturer's gate to the port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go through the scenario of looking into the problems that 
existed two years ago that helped to almost bankrupt our 
agricultural community on the prairies, we have to make sure that 
we go back through every aspect of the labour act and put forth 
changes that will make it more acceptable and make it more 
friendly to the people who are shipping goods. That is why we 
have brought forward our amendments. We have to make sure that 
what happened in Windsor, Ontario cannot happen elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has also made some changes 
to how it is going to structure its chairs and the length of 
service.  Many aspects here need to be looked at considerably. If 
we can start with our amendment that will keep this bill 
democratic and allow members of a union to have a 
representational vote of 35%, this will help alleviate one of the 
major obstacles and will fall into place with some of the other 
amendments we are proposing in the other groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is going to have far reaching effects for years to 
come in Canada.  It is important that it be democratic.  It is 
important that it address the issues that are of concern in the 
labour industry. It is important to supply an atmosphere in 
Canada in which people will be confident in investing.  It is 
important to the producers and manufacturers that when they have 
made a commitment to somebody offshore to deliver a product in a 
timely fashion that they are able to do it. If that cannot be 
done, our reputation is harmed.  It is seriously affected and we 
lose that trust we have throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the rest of the House will support our amendments.

legislation.  These report stage amendments to Bill C-19, 
amendments to the Canada Labour Code, were brought forward by 
members of the opposition parties. In speaking to this particular 
group of amendments, it is important to highlight one of the 
fundamental flaws found in this legislation, which a number of my 
colleagues and colleagues from other parties have been addressing 
today, and that is the clause which is very undemocratic.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some of the other members speak to the fact that a 
group of workers and employees could have union certification 
despite the wishes of the majority of those same employees.  As 
some of my colleagues have stated over the past number of hours, 
that is a very serious breach in light of the fact that we 
supposedly live in a democratic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some have said, we see in this particular Chamber from time 
to time that democracy is repressed or it is flouted and put 
down.  The fact remains that we do live in a democratic country. 
For a government to bring forward these particular amendments to 
the Canada Labour Code which would see the wishes of a minority 
superimposed over those of the majority is clearly wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the Reform Motion No. 7 which is included in Group No. 
2.  The legislation as it now exists says that the board, the 
CIRB, may order a representational vote on union certification to 
satisfy itself that the workers want the union.  Our amendment 
calls for the board to hold a representational vote when 35% of 
the employees sign cards indicating that they want that union 
certification. That is a reasonable amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have risen so many times in the House both in the last 
parliament and in this parliament to speak to amendments that 
have been well thought out and put together in all sincerity by 
members from both sides of the House and by all four opposition 
parties.  The amendments are brought forward to try to improve 
legislation either at the committee level or in the Chamber at 
report stage as we are doing today and as we have seen, we cannot 
even get a quorum from time to time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, May 4 to May 
10 is national composting week and this year's theme is 
“Composting, going back to our roots”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Composting is simple to do. You just have to put all your 
organic waste in a bin, outside your house, and let time and 
nature do the work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it is that simple, only about 20% of households do 
it. Considering that a family generates some 225 kilograms of 
organic waste annually, and that one pound of such waste 
produces between and 4 and 10 cubic feet of methane, it only 
makes sense to start reducing greenhouse gases at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts of amateur composters might save our planet from 
environmental deterioration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to my father, Dr. Albert Alarie, who was a 
pioneer in this area, since he initiated composting in the 
scientific and municipal worlds, as early as in the 1950s. His 
work as an educator and an interpretive writer provided the 
foundation of all that is now being done in Quebec, in this 
area. We owe him the benefits that we are now reaping.

pursuit of justice and proper compensation for all victims of 
hepatitis C.  This government has shown contempt, not compassion, 
for the victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's efforts have helped the victims believe that 
someone in Ottawa cares about their plight.  While the Minister

and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservatives have a history of doing the right thing for 
innocent victims.  This week the Conservative government in 
Ontario came out in support of extending compensation to all 
victims.  Federally it was the previous Conservative government 
that moved unilaterally in providing compensation to all victims 
of HIV tainted blood.

the bill that the minister of public works introduced in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all to build a plant in Winnipeg does not need extra 
borrowing authority.  They have enough and the decision was made 
previous to the bill.  The bill streamlines the operations of the 
Royal Canadian Mint and also increases the amount of the 
corporation's borrowing authority since the government decided 
that the corporation has to make a profit and has to operate on a 
commercial basis.

the member can immerse himself in details from this statement or

we want to meet with them and forge a new consensus because our 
focus is on the best interests of the victims.

when they use comments designed to intimidate and inhibit—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to resume my presentation after 
the interruption for question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Get those insignificant things out of 
the way and get to the real things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  A member opposite is saying that we had to 
get something as insignificant as question period out of the way 
of my presentation.  It is too bad it had to be interrupted.  I 
am sure I would agree with the hon. member. The key, despite all 
the heckling from the opposite side, is that it is question 
period.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we well know, after having been here close to five years, it 
certainly is not answer period.  I think the people watching on 
television understand that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was interrupted by question period I was speaking about 
the need for democracy and specifically the need for democracy in 
Bill C-19.  I was using a bit of a comparison about how even in 
this Chamber sometimes we do not see democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks I was trying to assist those watching the debate 
at home to understand what all of these quorum calls mean.  When 
there is government legislation before the House, the 
responsibility rests with the government to have its members 
present to listen to the debate, to the amendments, to the 
rationale behind them and to participate in the debate as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the hon. member, I have been listening and 
unfortunately there is not much talk about the actual amendments. 
I am very interested in the points on the amendments.  However, 
the Reform Party refuses to talk about the amendments.  It talks 
about everything else but the amendments.  Can we please get 
back— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair was not 
paying close attention at that specific time; however, the Chair 
does pay close attention to debate and I am sure that if the 
necessity to bring people back to the discussion at hand arises, 
you can count on this particular chair occupant to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to prove my point, if 
you look around I do not think you will find a quorum in the 
House. We should have a quorum to listen to this speech and it 
should be the members of the government so they can enter into 
this debate in an intelligent fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have a call for 
quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Call in the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just so that everyone, not 
only those in the Chamber but the viewers at home watching the 
proceedings on television this afternoon clearly understand, do 
the House rules stipulate that when there is a quorum call the 
individuals have to be seated in the Chamber, or is it enough 
just to poke your head in the curtains that surround the Chamber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As members will 
know, this is not the first quorum call today.  The rules on 
quorum calls have been carefully considered by chair occupants. 
If the Chair can see them, they are here.  In answer to your 
question, if the Chair is able to see a member, that member is 
considered to be part of a quorum and the Chair occupant is 
considered to be one of the quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure the viewing audience 
at home this afternoon appreciates that explanation.  It is sort 
of similar to groundhog day.  As long as there is a shadow 
showing you are considered to be in the Chamber and participating 
in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the comments of the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Labour.  She has been present throughout the day, 
diligently taking notes, I am sure, as individual members of the 
opposition have actually addressed the amendments that have been 
put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I address this amendment that deals with democracy, a 
fundamental premise for the entire nation, and the fact that the 
will of the majority is supreme, I am reminded of the dilemma 
that faced our nation during the most recent Quebec referendum 
and how the official opposition and opposition members tried to 
get the Prime Minister of the country and the government of the 
day to state what they considered to be a strong enough no vote. 
Was it 50% plus one, or was it something else?  The Prime 
Minister never clearly said what he would consider to be a strong 
no vote or a legitimate yes vote.  Was it 50% plus one or not?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the legislation we see that the government, when it suits its 
needs, is quite prepared to accept 35%.  That is a problem. What 
we are saying is that if it is the will of a group of employees, 
then a secret ballot should be held.  If it is the clear will of 
the majority of those employees that a union should represent 
their interests, then that is the way it should be.  But if it is 
the will of the majority of those employees that they do not wish 
to be represented by a particular union that is trying to 
organize in their particular industry, then that should also be 
the determining factor in whether or not that union is actually 
certified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some personal experience in this.  One of the jobs I had 
as a young man many, many years ago was working for a company in 
the oil and gas industry in northeastern British Columbia, in the 
region of the country that I come from.  At that time the company 
was called West Coast Transmission.  It was in the business of 
transporting natural gas through a series of pipelines through 
northeastern British Columbia down to Vancouver and points south. 
There was quite a debate during my time of employment with that 
company about whether the needs of the employees of West Coast 
Transmission could be better met through representation by a 
union.  It never actually came to a vote because it was very 
clear that the majority of those employees, after some very 
careful deliberation, ascertained that it was not in their best 
interests and they did not wish to be represented by a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a company in the small village of Taylor, which is in 
my riding, just south of my hometown of Fort St. John.  It is a 
pulp and paper company that is non-unionized.  Those employees 
felt they did not need the representation of a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very clearly, with respect to this particular amendment, we see 
a need that democracy should reign supreme when it is time for 
workers to decide on who will or will not represent their best 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I realize that at the time 
I rose previously on a point of order there was some confusion 
because a question of privilege had just been dealt with and I 
want to thank you for allowing me this opportunity to, in fact, 
raise the same incident as a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to citation 485 of Beauchesne's, 
especially subsection (3), which refers to unparliamentary 
language as language offending against the proprieties of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 486(1) goes on to refer to unparliamentary language as 
being injurious reflections uttered in debate against a 
particular member.  I think there is no question that the comment 
to someone to speak English— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, the 
issue was raised as a question of privilege.  It was dealt with 
as a question of privilege.  The Speaker ruled that it was a 
point of debate, not a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is bringing in a point of order through the back 
door.  If it was not appropriate as a question of privilege, it 
is not appropriate as a point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate that the Speaker has ruled already on the question of 
privilege and the subsequent point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am distressed about is that the government, the Chair 
having ruled on it, continues to raise this bogus point of 
order— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will do my utmost to change the subject.  I am sure 
you are in tune with that thought process as well, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I find myself speaking on Bill C-19, the labour bill, 
which was also known as Bill C-66 in the last parliament.  This 
time I am speaking on the second set of amendments.  Earlier 
today I spoke on the first set of amendments and earlier this 
year I spoke on second reading of this bill, which is now at 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is all about industrial relations in the federal 
sector.  One thing I know, and I think all Canadians upon 
reflection would know, is that when we are talking about people 
who belong to trade unions we are talking about average Canadians 
who reflect the demographics, the characteristics, the concerns 
and all the aspirations of average Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that distinguishes this country from many 
countries of the world is the fact that we all consider ourselves 
to be living in a democracy.  That is an important principle that 
we must try to adhere to on each and every occasion when we can 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important piece of legislation because it deals 
with human endeavour.  It deals with certification of unions.  It 
deals with the negotiation process in the federal sector.  It 
deals with a whole host of things.  It deals with the ultimately 
very serious matter of who represents who.  If that somehow 
becomes corrupted, if that somehow becomes usurped, or if that 
somehow becomes a set-up that is not representative, then we 
indeed have a major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation fails the basic tests of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something very essential here which deals with the 
whole question of secret ballot voting.  It is not a requirement 
of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another circumstance which deals with remedial 
certification and we have the circumstance where a breach by the 
employer would lead to automatic certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is non-democratic.  As an example, we are all here because 
we were elected.  If any one of us had committed a minor breach 
of the Elections Act, would that mean that the person who we ran 
against would automatically win?  We all know that is incorrect, 
not appropriate, not proper and does not occur.  Why should it 
occur as a consequence of this legislation?  It is totally 
inappropriate.  It is non-democratic.  This government should not 
be doing such a thing or allowing it to happen. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill eliminates the need for unions to report on their 
financial status.  That is totally inappropriate.  If we are 
going to have bodies representing a lot of people governed by 
public legislation, there should be a reporting mechanism.  It is 
only right and proper not only for democratic purposes but also 
for accountability purposes.  The government has an obligation to 
make that happen under this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I find highly dangerous in this legislation in a 
general way before I talk to the amendments is that there are 
provisions in the bill to allow the Minister of Labour to suspend 
collective bargaining and open tenders. This takes us right back 
to all of those things we want to avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned this morning, we want to do things that will 
reduce confrontation, not increase it.  We want to do things that 
will prevent it if at all possible.  We need to change that part 
of the package as well, for everyone, for the union membership, 
for management and for society at large.  We need to bring a 
balance into this package.  That balance is not there if the 
minister is going to have that kind of discretionary authority. 
It takes us back to where we do not want to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the fact that the board will be hand picked.  We 
can make other comparisons.  We know the problems inherent in our 
justice system as a consequence of parole board appointments and 
the inappropriateness of that.  Those tend to slap us in the 
face.  This one is a little more inconspicuous but it is still 
every bit as important in its own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are leadership issues.  We look to these boards for 
leadership from time to time.  These are issues where the public 
has been sadly let down. These boards are expensive.  They are 
expensive to run and to maintain.  When they do not perform, the 
very people they are supposed to benefit are let down.  The 
people who are supposed to benefit in essence are penalized.  We 
must get this right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In virtually every endeavour these days, it does not matter 
whether we are talking about the financial world or any other 
aspect of society, there are two competing pulls and tugs going 
on.  There is a trend to globalization on the one hand and on the 
other is the necessity for action that involves local phenomena. 
One of the ways we can try and balance those two things and make 
it come together is to utilize federal institutions when there is 
no other appropriate mechanism.  This is the appropriate 
mechanism and as a consequence it is so important that we get it 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So many of the things I have described do not portend well in 
this bill on this front in order to accomplish the things we want 
to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four motions grouped.  Once again we are talking about 
Reform and Bloc amendments.  The Reform motion is very 
supportable of course. 
The legislation as it is written now states that with the 35% of 
employees signing cards indicating they want union certification, 
the minister may order this.  We are saying in tune with our 
basic commitment to democratic principles that the board must.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I will conclude my remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise in the House today to address Bill C-19, an 
act to amend the Canada Labour Code.  This bill has been hanging 
around for quite a while.  I imagine the government is getting 
tired of hearing about it in the House of Commons and would like 
to have it moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly the legislation is flawed.  I think parties on all sides 
of the House have huge problems with it that I doubt very much it 
is going to get the speedy passage the government wants it to 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are addressing Group No. 2. There are a couple of specific 
motions I would like to address.  They deal with the issue of 
democracy, as my friends have pointed out earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously in the House of Commons of all places we should be 
concerned about an issue like democracy.  It is very ironic that 
we would be dealing with an issue of democracy in the wake of the 
hepatitis C vote here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues across the way had the chance to stand up for their 
constituents and exercise their democratic right in the House of 
Commons and actually support an opposition motion that would have 
provided compensation for the victims of hepatitis C who received 
hepatitis C because of negligence on the government's behalf. But 
they did not do that.  They did not stand up when they could have 
despite the fact that many of them said they were going to do 
that and many of them said that they could make a difference in 
this place.  They could have. They had the chance but they 
dropped the ball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see that same tenuous commitment to democracy in Bill 
C-19.  I think that is a powerful reason to reject it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is trying to make some amendments.  One of the motions 
we are moving is that under the current legislation the Canada 
Labour Code states that the board may order a representational 
vote on union certification to satisfy itself that the workers 
want the union.  Our amendment calls for the board to hold a 
representational vote when at least 35% of the employees sign 
cards calling for union certification. That is what we are 
proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want this left up to the board to make those types of 
decisions.  We want to make sure that workers have a voice in all 
of this. We believe that democracy if it stands for anything 
should be reflected in legislation like this in a very clear way, 
where we state clearly that we do believe in democracy and in 
this particular case we want a vote on an issue of union 
certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that there is no guarantee under this legislation 
that people will be allowed a secret ballot which I find amazing. 
I find it amazing that we are proposing legislation that does not 
guarantee people the right to a secret ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this place when we elect the Speaker we do it by secret 
ballot.  When we are chosen as legislators we are chosen by 
secret ballot.  There are a thousand reasons for that, not the 
least of which is that people have the right to decide in private 
so that they do not have to appear before the scrutinizing eyes 
of their neighbours who in some cases may try to browbeat them to 
vote another way, or they do not want to fear consequences from 
people who have power over them if they do not vote in a 
particular way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That applies when we are talking about labour unions as well. To 
me it is a fundamental right.  I cannot understand it in a 
country where in the charter of rights and freedoms we go to 
great lengths to lay out fundamental freedoms including the right 
to democracy.  Sadly somewhere in the charter I guess we were not 
specific enough and did not suggest that we needed to have 
democracy apply at every level including when it comes to votes 
for labour unions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are stuck with a piece of legislation like this which is 
reprehensible. I am disgusted with the Liberals across the way 
for not fighting for workers who in some cases will be coerced 
into voting a particular way because if they do not vote that way 
they will feel pressure from people who have sway over them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is wrong but it is not inconsistent with the Liberals' 
actions on the hepatitis C vote.  We heard them say over and over 
again “we are going to stand up to the government, we are going 
to vote with the victims of hepatitis C”.  But when it came to 
the crunch did they bail out in a hurry, did they cast their 
principles over the side in a hurry— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I fail to understand what hepatitis C votes and Bill 
C-19 and I would ask— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motions being 
debated in Group No. 2 are Motions Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 30. They have 
to do with the voting and the representation on the board.  They 
have to do with how the 35% is determined.  I grant that it is a 
stretch.  It is a long stretch, a very long stretch, but it is 
still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I feel sorry for my 
colleagues.  Obviously their conscience has been tricked.  They 
have been stung by their own actions, and that is sad.  I regret 
that very much but it was within their power to fix the problem 
instead of being cowed into voting the way they did, and I am sad 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is important in this place. We saw in the hepatitis C 
vote that the government set in stone a philosophy that is now 
reflected in Bill C-19 which is very regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to Motion No. 30, an instance where the 
government could have stood up stronger in the name of democracy 
than it did, but here all kinds of conditions are placed on 
democracy.  I do not think conditions should be placed on 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 30 deals with part of the labour code that would 
allow the industrial relations board to certify a union, even if 
there is no evidence of majority support, if the board believes 
there would have been support had it not been for the employer's 
unfair labour practice.  Rather obviously, if the industrial 
relations board is concerned that there was some kind of unfair 
pressure being put on a particular group of workers, why would it 
not just ask them to hold another vote, a secret vote?  Why not 
do that?  Why not have another secret vote instead of leaving it 
to an appointed board to make that decision?  Why not democracy? 
What is wrong with using democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that democracy in this country is relatively new. In 
the modern world it is relatively new.  It has only been around 
for about 300 years, but surely over the last 300 years we have 
come to be able to figure out how to utilize it in all kinds of 
institutions.  Surely we should be able to figure out how to use 
it when it comes to dealing with employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing that the government is proposing to grant to the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board this extraordinary arbitrary 
power to decide whether or not it will certify a union, 
irrespective of the will of the workers.  That is ridiculous. 
That is not democracy, that is tyranny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to a situation in Windsor, Ontario which occurred not 
that long ago.  The labour relations board decided that the 
employer had used undue coercion on the workers and therefore 
overturned a vote that would have seen a union not come into 
being at a Wal-Mart store. 
Subsequent to that the employees moved for another vote to 
decertify that union. The initial vote was 151 to 43 not to have 
a union. The labour relations board said that they will have a 
union whether they like it or not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of power that has been given to the industrial 
relations board.  It is wrong.  It is anti-democratic and it 
tells me a lot about this government.  It tells me a lot about 
why backbenchers on the Liberal side voted against democracy, 
against the victims of hepatitis C and stood cowering behind 
their government.  It think it is shameful and we will never 
support that type of legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as you 
can tell, our blood has been boiling on this side of the House 
and I am sure on the other side of the House as we listen to our 
colleague, the member from the Reform Party, pretending that he 
and his party support the workers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about democracy, it was not long ago when the very same 
party had ejected one of its own just because she spoke her mind 
and because she said what she wanted to say.  She was kicked out. 
It is ironic, speaking about democracy.  These are the same 
members who when they came into this House told us and the public 
that they will allow each member of parliament to vote according 
to their conscience and as instructed by their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not yet, with the exception of a very few votes, seen the 
members over there stand up and vote according to their 
conscience or as instructed by their constituents.  They all 
stand up like hordes of sheep and vote collectively.  We rarely 
see those members stand up and vote according to their 
conscience.  I have not seen that.  Have other members seen that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about democracy, there are two faces to democracy. 
There is the Reform face to democracy and there is the other face 
to democracy.  Now they are concerned about the workers of 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to point

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I would like to mention that the member who called 
quorum call left the room immediately and he is still not in the 
room.  There are no Tories at all in the room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As the hon. member 
knows, we do not refer specifically to the presence or absence of 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is it ironic. Speaking about 
democracy and allowing people to express their views in a public 
forum, these are the very same guys who have been polarizing 
democracy.  They wanted to call themselves fathers of democracy. 
They are not even distant cousins of democracy.  They never 
heard— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
hon. member is referring to members on this side of the House as 
being guys and so on.  My understanding— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Obviously this is 
not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am trying to put things in 
the context of Bill C-19, when we speak about democracy and the 
rights of people to express themselves in a free and democratic 
way.  If we are truly concerned about the right of workers then 
we should be able to allow the workers to express themselves in a 
free way.  If that is the case, the workers of Canada from coast 
to coast have told us that what is before us is a good step.  It 
is a first step, it is an excellent step and it is something that 
is required and long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we have taken the initiative in order 
to respond to their needs.  It is not an issue of a secret ballot 
or standing up and voting.  Every day in the House we stand up. 
Compared to my colleagues on the other side, especially in the 
Reform Party, I am not afraid to express my views and say whether 
I am supporting a motion or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of 35% is nothing short of trying to establish 
whether there is an interest in establishing a movement within a 
workplace.  Once the employees establish their unions, once they 
certify themselves and become an organization, they can 
democratically, if they choose so, decertify themselves.  Nothing 
is stopping them from doing that. The underlying thing in this 
debate for my colleagues in the Reform Party is that they are 
openly opposed to the right of workers to organize themselves. 
This is their true agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity to listen to debates when public hearings 
were taking place.  Frankly, I was ashamed to see that the level 
of debate had sunk so low. 
What do we call it?  Is it sugar coated poison?  This is 
absolutely terrible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those fellows have no idea what it is to be a member of an 
organization that defends the rights of workers. They do not 
believe in it.  It is not in their philosophy.  If it is up to 
them they will decertify every union or organization in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a society that works.  Employers and their employees, 
government, unions and corporations, work hand in hand in the 
best interest of the organization, of the government and of 
society as a whole.  There is nothing wrong with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Germany is a perfect model.  In Canada over the past 100 or so 
years our experience has not really been that bad.  Unions have 
not bitten anybody's ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there this agenda of being anti-workers?  Why is it my 
colleagues in the Reform Party do not want to allow workers to 
organize themselves if they choose to do so?  I do not know what 
they think.  They think we do not know that.  Of course we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are trying to say that they are concerned about democracy. 
The bottom line of the agenda is anti-workers.  Would members 
agree?  My colleagues from Gatineau and Laval I am sure would 
agree that the agenda of the Reform is not to allow workers of 
Canada to organize themselves in a democratic fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not beat around the bush.  They should stand one by one 
and say why they are anti-workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In 
compliance with the member's wish, I would love to respond by 
pointing out the error in what he is saying.  We are the exact 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  This is obviously a 
point of debate and not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the proof is in the pudding. 
They are afraid of hearing the whole argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to enlighten them by saying that we live in a 
democracy. In a democracy the majority has the right to rule.  If 
the workers of Canada want to organize themselves why do they 
want to stop them?  At every single corner they try to block the 
people of Canada from— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Maybe this is Liberal democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Liberal democracy; I am frustrated by the 
illogical argument of my colleagues on the other side.  I want 
one of them to tell me why they are anti-workers.  I will sit 
now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am at a 
loss for words.  I am glad to make this intervention, 
particularly with you in the chair, because I know you are always 
interested to hear what I have to say.  You always listen very 
carefully unlike our friends on the other side.  That is why we 
have to keep repeating ourselves.  We are not breaking through 
yet, but we will; give it another three or four years and we will 
break through.  We certainly will be making breakthroughs at the 
polls in the next election as hon. members on the other side 
know.  That is why they are so afraid right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the synapses over there are not firing.  I am pretty sure 
that is the case because on the one hand the member says he 
believes in democracy and in the right of the majority to make a 
decision.  On the other hand he does not, because the legislation 
does not provide for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While growing up I belonged to several unions.  I belonged to 
the pulp and paper workers union when I worked in a pulp mill in 
Kitimat, British Columbia, in the mid-seventies. 
I belonged to the operating engineers as a heavy equipment 
operator during the 1970s and then I went on to become a part 
owner of a unionized construction company.  We had signed 
agreements with the tunnel and rock workers, the teamsters, 
operating engineers and carpenters.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not like I am coming out of a vacuum on this matter. In my 
life experience I have had membership in a couple of different 
unions and have been part owner of a construction company which 
had collective agreements with unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are companies that deserve unions.  There are companies so 
badly run, badly managed and that care so little for their human 
resources there is only one course of action for the employees: 
to have a union to protect themselves.  There are not many 
companies like that but they are there. I have seen them 
firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein there are also unions that are badly run and 
badly managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Which ones? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  The member did not ask me to name the 
companies that were like that.  I do not know why he would be so 
interested in having the unions named. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing my thought, noble or villainous attributes cannot be 
ascribed to humans based on their station in life.  People are 
not good or bad because they are in a union.  They are not good 
or bad because they are in management in a company.  Everybody is 
different.  Everybody is a human being.  There are good people 
and bad people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those in the union movement—and I have seen this 
firsthand—who would put the individual rights of people at a 
much lower level than the collective rights of a union.  That is 
the problem.  When the union becomes so powerful that it has a 
right to tell individual workers what they can and cannot do, I 
have a great deal of difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a great deal of sympathy for people who find 
themselves in a position of not having the right to exercise 
their individual right to decide whether or not they want to be 
in a union or out, whether or not they want to have a union 
representing them.  I also have a great deal of sympathy for 
people who are forced to accept a course of action when it is not 
what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking here about a fundamental collision between 
collective rights and individual rights.  Obviously in society we 
have both.  We have individual rights which are very important 
and we have collective rights which the union movement 
represents.  There are other collectivities as we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Reform Party and I are much more interested 
in individual rights than any other rights.  We want to promote 
the idea that the individual is the most important unit in 
society, not collective rights but individual rights, to the 
greatest extent possible.  This is the very essence of democracy. 
It is individual rights.  It is the right of the individual to 
choose.  It is the right of the individual to vote.  It is the 
right of individuals to have control over their own destiny and 
their own life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not difficult for me to see that the Liberals do not 
understand this basic concept of democracy based on their actions 
of the last few days.  It is easy to see that the Prime Minister 
does not understand that the House of Commons is supposed to be 
about democracy.  It is supposed to be about the right of 
individual MPs to come here and represent their constituents and 
to vote according to their conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said to his backbenchers that if they do not 
do his will they will pay the consequences.  That is why people 
on the other side do not understand the fundamental flaw in the 
bill before us.  They do not fully appreciate the fundamental 
concept of democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the finance committee this morning.  I was helping my 
friend from Medicine Hat who is a permanent member of that 
committee.  We were going through the budget implementation bill 
clause by clause.  During the course of debate it became apparent 
that the opposition MPs on that committee were totally frustrated 
and had found that the committee was basically nothing more than 
a side show.  From the time the Reform Party has had a presence 
on that committee, which is going back five years, not one 
opposition amendment to a budget implementation bill has ever 
been accepted by that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear members on the government benches talk about the 
wonderful work of committees, how it is a non-partisan way of 
people getting together and working in a spirit of co-operation. 
That is just a load of hooey.  I have never heard anything more 
ridiculous in my whole life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the government side do not want opposition members on 
committee to have any real influence or to have any real impact. 
No way.  The committees in parliament are nothing more than an 
opportunity to occupy backbenchers and opposition MPs, to keep 
them out of the government's hair.  This is the government's view 
of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also the government's view of democracy that the people in 
the other place should not be elected but should be appointed by 
the Prime Minister and that we should not even be able to raise 
this matter in the House of Commons.  Is it democracy if I cannot 
as a member of parliament come to the House and talk about the 
other place because I might be offending somebody? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not difficult to understand that our friends on the other 
side have not grasped the meaning of democracy.  They have not 
grasped the meaning of individual rights and how those two are 
intertwined and cannot be taken one from the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation does not provide individuals their proper and 
full individual rights when it comes to whether or not a union 
should represent them and whether or not they should be required 
or forced to join a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize there are companies that are badly managed and do 
not properly consider or care for the rights of their workers. 
They deserve to have and actually need to have unions to protect 
the interests of the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Union leaders are not always the noble people they are made out 
to be.  It is very important that individuals in every 
circumstance have the opportunity, the right, to decide whether 
or not to be in a union or to have union representation.  That 
should be based on a secret ballot.  It should be based on the 
majority in a secret ballot making that determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill clearly does not provide for that and the Reform 
amendment clearly would give workers that right.  That is what 
this set of amendments is all about.  I appreciate the indulgence 
of the House and I will let my colleagues carry on from here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
just wanted a little clarity from the member of the Reform Party. 
He made some allegations about some private companies that were 
either abusive or not taking care of their employees the way they 
should.  More important, he made some accusations about some 
unions, that some, not all, unions were not representing the 
membership but rather the collective bargaining units themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy for the Reform member to speak in generalities, 
to be very vague and to pull these things out of the air. Would 
the member name one or two of these unions?  If in fact it is 
true, all I would like is for him to name one or two of these 
unions that are not properly representing their workers.  It is 
that simple.

and has 10 minutes in which to pose the question because we are 
in debate and there are no questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair has allowed a fair degree of latitude regarding 
relevance, which is pretty evident to anyone paying attention to 
this debate today.  As this latitude has been allowed on one 
side, it is obviously to be allowed on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Simcoe—Grey has another nine minutes in 
which to speak to the motions on the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my point was purely for 
clarification.  There were some allegations made in this House 
and I simply wanted clarification on them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Ottawa Centre mentioned that Reform members 
all do their act together.  I do not know where he has been. 
Four times since this session began in September I have voted 
against my leader.  We have the right and the freedom to do so. 
The hon. member knows very well that he never had that choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that young people learn at school is how to 
vote.  When they have a vote, they count the ballots and then 
they elect somebody.  That happens even in the elementary grades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with thinking that is terribly flawed.  I want to 
say what the rest of Canadians think at times when they are 
deprived of their livelihood because of unbiased or unequal 
thinking toward an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 simply says that the Canada Labour Code “may”. 
It does not say they have to.  It does not say they will.  It 
says that they “may”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In serving my time in various capacities and in various 
positions to which I have been elected, I have never in my life 
been subject to the concept that a vote of fewer than 50% will 
make the decision.  I have never been introduced to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have chaired hundreds of meetings.  When a board has an 
opportunity to vote, the motion never carries unless it has 50% 
approval.  I have been a CEO to a board and that board 
never came down with a decision unless 50% of the board was in 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking is that Motion No. 7 be changed to indicate 
that the board “shall”.  We do not believe for one minute, 
unlike members opposite, that 35% is good enough for union 
certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government members talk about 35% they refer to management 
interference.  What is management interference?   We have labour 
on one side; we have management on the other.  We never hear 
about labour interference.  It is always management interference. 
We think it should be a balanced situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians think that way.  Ask the people across western Canada 
what they think about a handful of people being able to take away 
their livelihood.  Members opposite say it is democracy and we 
say it is deplorable.  We do not believe that 35% constitutes a 
majority.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states that when 35% of the people have signed cards 
for certification they should cast a vote.  When 35% have not 
signed cards for certification they should also cast a vote. All 
we are saying is that it should be equal.  However, this 
government does not want to do that.  It does not want to deal 
with the realities of percentage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my public life, for every single call I have had from an 
employee about manager interference, I have had 50 calls from 
employees talking about union interference.  However, those 
members never talk about that.  I am pro-democracy and that is 
what bothers these people.  They do not want to look at a 
balanced scheme for employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our committee work on transportation it has been absolutely 
enlightening in the last while to listen to how the railway 
companies have organized and streamlined the situation in Canada. 
When we talk about CN double-decking out of the port of Halifax 
and how it can beat the competition in the United States through 
Chicago, it does that with the co-operation of all the different 
unions along the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is what happens.  What is the largest 
petrochemical company in Canada?  Imperial Oil.  It has operated 
all of these years, with its largest plant being in Sarnia, 
without a union.  I have talked to Imperial's people and they 
tell me they are satisfied and do not want a union.  Why would 
anyone want to tell those people they must have a union with 35%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless a 50% majority shows up, it is in violation of our 
democratic principles.  No one in this House would allow a 50% 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is very simple.  Hon. members opposite are trying to 
move themselves into an outdated, undemocratic process of 
allowing less than 50% of the people to make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Shame on you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  No, I am not ashamed to say that.  I am 
very proud to say that I believe a democratic vote should be 
50%-plus.  Obviously the hon. member opposite does not and I hope 
everybody knows that.  I hope everybody recognizes that when 
those members feel like it they decide that 35% will be control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party do not believe that.  We believe they 
have a right to organize, to form a union and to form that union 
when their mandate states that 50% of them shall claim a union. 
However, the member does not believe that.  That is too bad 
because that is where we stand.  That is all we are asking for in 
this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can anyone dispute the fact that when 35% of the employees 
sign union cards there should be a vote to decide whether they 
will unionize?  What is wrong with that?  Obviously those members 
do not understand the principles of the democratic process that 
50% or 51% makes the majority.  They do not believe that and it 
is very difficult for us to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if this government wants to pass the bill it is going 
to pass it anyway because it has determined that it is going to 
play into the hands of a very undemocratic situation.  We do not 
believe that and that is where we differ and where we are going 
to continue to differ because we believe in democracy right 
across the board.  We also believe in individual rights right 
across the board.  We believe that a person has the right to vote 
on a secret ballot right across the board, but you people do not 
believe that.  Go ahead and not believe it.  That is your 
privilege.  We are going to stay with the 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would ask hon. 
members to address each other through the Chair.  From time to 
time people get really wound up in their debate and it tends to 
make it a little less tense if the debate is directed through the 
Chair.

the environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join in the debate at the report stage of Bill C-19. 
It seems that the debate, I guess because of the latitude allowed 
in this place, is deteriorating into some kind of debate over the 
different conceptions of democracy rather than perhaps the 
motions before us on this bill.  I guess I will have to make my 
comments as well before I get into the technicalities of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my career was spent in labour-union negotiations and 
collective bargaining.  Quite clearly, in that process there is a 
very delicate balance between the rights of the union and the 
rights of management.  It can be easily skewed one way or the 
other.  In my view this bill certainly skews the advantage to the 
union side.  I think that is a dangerous direction in which to 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members opposite stand and tell me, having been here five 
years, that I am not voting with my conscience or for my 
constituents— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No one said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Someone did say that.  The member at 
the other end of the House said exactly that.  I would ask him 
how he can judge what my conscience is or whether I am voting for 
my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, a couple of days ago the member who sits 
opposite, the member who is running off at the mouth over there, 
during a very emotional vote in this House was crying her eyes 
out simply because her party and her leader had threatened her 
and coerced her into voting the party line.  The evidence was 
pretty clear that she was not voting for her constituents, or 
with her conscience for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has a lot of flaws and a lot of problems.  The robbing 
of the democratic process is only one of them.  There are many 
other issues about replacement workers and about taking one 
particular commodity out of the process, such as protecting the 
right to load grain in the port of Vancouver while not providing 
that same protection for other commodities and causing all kinds 
of problems in a strike situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bad bill in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed motions in Group No. 2 include two motions moved by 
my hon. colleague from Wetaskiwin which would greatly improve the 
quality of the bill and go a long way in bringing back some 
democracy, some fairness and effectiveness to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I discuss the motions of my colleague from Wetaskiwin, I 
want to mention two motions that were moved by the hon. member 
for Trois-Rivières.  Motion No. 6 proposes the removal of clause 
6 from the legislation.  My colleagues and I are opposed to the 
removal of that clause.  Clause 6 allows the board to decide a 
matter without having to hold an oral hearing.  I think this 
clause is important to the process of streamlining the CIRB's 
procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole process of scheduling an oral hearing and adhering to 
the strict oral hearing procedures unnecessarily prolongs many 
board decisions.  Many decisions can simply be made by the board 
without the need for oral hearings.  Such oral hearings are 
lengthy and expensive and should be reserved only for the most 
important matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause increases the speed and efficiency with which minor 
cases are dealt by bypassing the oral hearing process.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I am opposed to Motion No. 6 which calls for the 
removal of clause 6.  I am also opposed to Motion No. 8, also 
moved by the hon. member for Trois-Rivières.  This motion removes 
a phrase in clause 16, amending it to allow the board to revoke 
the appointment of an employer representative without having to 
satisfy itself that the employer representative is no longer 
qualified to act in that capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By removing this part of the clause the government would be 
removing the employer's right to fair representation.  Typically, 
a group of employers would select one representative and if this 
representative is arbitrarily removed because as few as one 
person in the employer's group calls for it, the wishes of the 
other employers in the group are disregarded.  Again, it is a 
sleight to the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my position that there should be a vote by which the 
majority of members of the employer's group have the opportunity 
to decide what action is taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The selection of the clause requiring the board to be satisfied 
the employer representative is no longer qualified to act in that 
capacity protects the wishes of the majority.  The removal of 
this part of the clause as proposed in this motion would only 
serve to weaken the employer's association.  Therefore I think in 
good conscience I could not support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly can and do support the two motions in this group 
proposed by my hon. colleague for Wetaskiwin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 calls for the inclusion of a clause requiring that 
the board hold a representational vote on union certification 
when 35% of the employees sign cards requesting union 
certification.  Of course this is getting into the particular 
motion that has caused all the controversy this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its current form the Canada Labour Code states that the board 
may hold such a representational vote but does not bind the board 
to the vote.  This means the board could choose to ignore the 
wishes of workers in one respect or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am calling quorum because 
there is not a single government member present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that 
my speech is not so exciting that everyone in the House would 
want to stay and listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 calls for the inclusion of a clause requiring that 
the board hold a certified representational vote on union 
certification when 35% of the employees sign cards requesting 
union certification.  In its current form the Canada Labour Code 
states the board may hold such a representational vote but 
does not bind it to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the board could choose to ignore the wishes of 
workers in one respect or another.  Union certification may be 
forced on workers or denied to workers if such a democratic 
process is not in place. The proposed clause ensures that the 
wishes of the majority are heard and upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion in this group moved by the hon. member 
Wetaskiwin is Motion No. 30.  This motion has my unwavering 
support and should have the support of every other member in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 30 calls for the removal of clause 46.  Clause 46 
allows the board to certify a trade union despite lack of 
evidence of majority support.  This is the issue that has caused 
all the controversy this afternoon, the trampling of democracy 
and the lack of respect for the democratic rights of union 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable and it allows for the board to make 
assumptions about the wishes of the workers.  This clause 
suggests that it is acceptable for the board to force union 
certification on workers if it believes that it was only unfair 
labour practices that prevented workers from voting in favour of 
union certification. 
This might be acceptable if there were a concrete way to determine 
unfair labour practices.  The reality, however, as exemplified in 
the Wal-Mart case is that the board does not always know the minds 
of workers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Wal-Mart case the board assumed that Wal-Mart was using 
intimidation tactics to bully workers into voting against trade 
certification.  This was not the case and now the workers have 
launched a decertification drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause leaves it up to the CIRB to determine what 
constitutes unfair labour practices and in essence to presume to 
know the minds of the workers better than the workers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go against the wishes of the workers and to override their 
democratic right to determine the majority opinion through a 
representative vote is absolutely unacceptable.  Members from the 
other side of the House are saying this clause protects workers 
who are being intimidated by their employers.  However, if this 
is the case, that employees are afraid to vote honestly by secret 
ballot, then there is something wrong with the voting process and 
not with the way this legislation operates to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly cannot support this bill in its current form without 
other amendments being proposed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I entered politics I was a trade unionist working for the 
Nova Scotia government, unlike some of my colleagues on this side 
of the House, with respect to trade unionism and workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those years taught me everything I know about why employees need 
protection and why allowing workers to organize is an important 
part of our society.  That is why I am happy to stand here today 
and speak in favour of Bill C-19 in its present form, a bill 
modernizing the Canadian Labour Code for the first time in more 
than 20 years.  It says something for the timeliness of the House 
that it has been two decades to update this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of the changes to the workplace since 1978. Changes in 
technology have affected everyone. Changes in the global economy 
have made it easier for people and money to move from one corner 
of the world to another.  The stability our parents' generation 
grew up with has evaporated.  The days when you started a job 
when you finished school and kept that job until you retired are 
over.  The heavy industries and natural resources that generated 
so much of the nation's wealth have been downsized or wiped out 
like the east coast fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today workers have to face the prospect of changing jobs several 
times, acquiring new skills as they go.  People often move from 
coast to coast within the country and often from country to 
country.  Coming from the maritimes, we are very well accustomed 
to the citizens of the maritime provinces constantly moving to 
other provinces to seek work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many people such as my colleagues in the official opposition 
these changes to the workplace are a universally good thing and 
offer an opportunity to escape from what they see as a 
restrictive web that developed to protect workers during the 
first seven decades of the century.  They are free to erode the 
protections given to workers by saying they were specific 
regulations tied to specific industries and job sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear groups like the National Citizens Coalition, the Fraser 
Institute, the Business Council on National Issues all singing 
from the same song book of deregulation and decertification.  To 
hear them talk we would think the right of an employer to fire 
their workers at will is a right protected by the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been the problem of the last two decades, that 
businesses and workers have grown apart, that management 
increasingly sees workers and unions as obstacles to be overcome, 
speed bumps on the highway of economic progress. Unions and 
workers often with good reason look at their bosses and wonder 
why when profits are soaring and their friends and neighbours who 
work side by side with them for years are collecting welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They see corporate salaries going up at rates thousands of times 
the increases being given to people on the shop floor and in the 
offices.  They see governments responding to their bosses and the 
special interest groups that represent them, lowering taxes for 
the wealthy so they can make more and more money that will, in 
theory at least, trickle down the line. 
If anything has been trickling down from the bosses standing over 
the workers it certainly is not money.  Real wages have been 
going down in Canada while the business sector thrives and job 
security is a thing of the past for most citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important distinction that many employers and 
members of the Reform Party are failing to grasp and that is at 
the core of why this bill needs the support of the House.  It is 
a great life for someone with a specialized skill and lots of 
education to go from short term contract to short term contract, 
playing off employer against employer and getting the best deal 
for him or herself.  It is a different story for someone who has 
a grade four education and has worked for 30 years in a fish 
plant or in the woods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brave new world of global capitalism is great for the first 
group, but for the second group it means hunger for their 
children and their families and death to their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me there are few things more obscene than government funded 
consultants turning up in towns and villages that were passed by 
by globalization and lecturing people on the need to pull 
themselves up by their bootstraps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are millions of people in this country who are never given 
the skills needed to compete in the world of high finance and 
high technology.  That is a fact that no one can deny.  Those 
people need even stronger protection today than they did in past 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moral issue for me at the heart of this debate is the need 
to protect the more vulnerable members of society from 
exploitation.  It goes deeper than that, to the right of all 
people to work together in a way that will maximize the benefits 
for all involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The left in general and my party in particular have often been 
accused of being opposed to profits, opposed to the market, 
opposed to business.  This is nonsense.  While I know Reform 
members will take pleasure in attributing my party's support for 
the bill to our supposed dependence on trade unions, I am proud 
to stand in the House and say that the New Democratic Party is 
pro-business, pro-profit, totally in favour of more and more 
people earning more and more money.  Contrary to what the members 
of the opposition might think, there is no conflict between that 
position and our support for organized labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Bill C-19 is about, a reassertion of the moral 
obligation to include and empower workers in the business of 
making business work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-66 died on the order paper when parliament was 
dissolved just over a year ago, I thought the progressive changes 
we see resurrected before us today had been shuffled aside 
permanently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister deserves credit for bringing these issues and the 
bill back to the House and I hope it will receive the support of 
all right thinking members.  Specific aspects of the bill are 
worthy of special mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carrying on from my previous comments concerning changes in the 
workplace, it is good to see that the issue of disseminating 
union information will no longer be restricted to onsite workers. 
With more people commuting with computers it is critical that 
solidarity among workers be maintained and that no one be 
discriminated against because of where they work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarification surrounding strikes affecting grain shipments 
is a critical matter and all parties that contributed to the 
drafting of the legislation deserve credit for reaching a 
compromise that preserves the right to strike for all those 
involved yet preserves the tens of thousands of jobs connected to 
the industry and the vital flow of grain that feeds millions of 
people around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the new and improved Canada Labour Relations 
Board is perhaps the biggest single change that will have a 
positive impact on the life of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board's ability to arbitrate in disputes over certification 
and strike votes means a faster and fairer process that will 
hopefully reduce the already low strike rate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg Centre made mention in his remarks on 
this bill that between 95% and 97% of all labour disputes are 
resolved without strikes, lockouts or work stoppages of any kind. 
That should put paid to the fearmongering that members of the 
official opposition have engaged in.  They should be reminded 
that groups from all sectors of society have contributed to the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to ask the members of the Reform Party as an 
active trade unionist to please stop insulting the intelligence 
of workers across Canada by wanting to appear as though they are 
in true support of workers across this country. 
My experience over the last 10 months in this House has been that 
Reformers have clearly demonstrated that as trade unionists they 
are anti labour.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member from down the way as she gave her 
speech a few minutes ago.  At the end of it she talked about how 
Reformers should take note, that we put ourselves forward as 
protectors of labour.  She said that with a great deal of sarcasm 
so I am assuming she did not really mean it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to say to the member that I am not the 
member from down the way.  I am the member for Bras d'Or. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Bras d'Or has made her point.  The hon. member from the other 
end, Blackstrap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a point well taken, 
rest assured.  I meant that it was to my far left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing struck me as being odd about the member's remarks. 
About a year ago we were campaigning in the 1997 election.  One 
of the big reasons the federal New Democrats and of course the 
provincial New Democrats are so much in love with labour is that 
they get most of their election funding from that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife is a school teacher.  She belongs to the Saskatchewan 
Teachers Federation.  Her union dues to a large degree go to the 
person who ran against me in the federal campaign as a New 
Democratic. I do not know whether or not she likes that but there 
is something wrong with this whole picture.  That is a bit off 
topic and I would like to get back to the topic at hand which is 
of course Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this parliament and in the last parliament, there was a great 
deal of talk about labour, about unions, about how they are 
constructed, about how they should negotiate, how agreements 
should be made, how strikes should or could or may not happen. I 
remember in greater detail as it related to the business of 
agriculture, something which I am personally involved in, along 
with a large number of others in my province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through a series of strikes in those years.  Railways 
were on strike at one point in time or another with different 
unions. I think there are something like 27 or 29 unions that a 
bushel of grain must go through from a farmer's gate until it 
gets loaded on to a ship on the west coast, at Thunder Bay or at 
Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From firsthand experience as a farmer, that is one of the most 
frustrating areas.  A person works all year to grow grain and 
spends huge amounts of dollars and if he is lucky he may make a 
profit but it is seen at the end of the tunnel. Then there will 
be a union that will put the kibosh on that, or in some cases 
management will put the kibosh on that, because there will be a 
slowdown or stoppage in grain transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it really is doing is affecting innocent third parties far 
more than anything else.  It is the innocent producer of the 
grain who suffers most.  We have to come to a system in this 
country where we do not allow those types of things to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all in favour of negotiation and consultation between 
unions and management.  I know that without management, unions 
cannot exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Skeena mentioned a few minutes earlier, 
there certainly is a need for unions at least in some companies. 
We all have seen companies that have taken advantage of their 
employees.  There definitely needs to be some control and unions 
are a very important part of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting to the point where we are allowing groups—and I 
am not going to say special interest groups because they are not, 
they are unions—but we are getting to the point where we are 
allowing small segments of our workforce to tie up entire 
industries.  A few minutes ago I mentioned the grain 
transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a couple of years ago the Grain Services Union, 
which is the union for Sask wheat pool employees, voted to go on 
strike in September.  September in Saskatchewan is a very 
important time of year. It is harvest time and we definitely need 
our elevator agents.  It was very interesting that in this 
particular strike many of the employees refused to walk out. Many 
of the employees at the local elevator agents and in fact our 
local elevator agent Mr. Brent Hartman refused to go on strike. 
He crossed the picket lines and opened his elevator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a small town of 350 people such as I live in, to have a 
fellow stand up for the producers' rights even though he is a 
union member and a good union member, is admirable.  I take my 
hat off to these people.  It was very important and a very 
critical move by those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other half of this bill that I see as a huge negative is the 
way the democratic process is being handled.  It has been 
mentioned today how undemocratic things are not only in some 
areas of the labour process and the labour force but also in this 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We profess in this country to have one of the greatest 
democracies in the world.  Certainly I do not think anyone would 
argue that we have the best country in the world.  There is no 
question about that.  However I look across at some of the 
Liberal members who were heckling our members when democracy was 
discussed.  The fact is I have been here now for almost five 
years, some might say too long, and we have all seen in the last 
five years a good number of occasions when members on the 
opposite side were whipped into line by their whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the latest occasion was the vote on hepatitis C which 
was held last Tuesday night. I walked out of the Chamber after 
that vote was held and I ran into a couple of the Liberal 
members.  They had rather sheepish looks on their faces.  We got 
to chatting.  When I asked them what they thought, they said that 
they really had two options.  They said that they could have 
voted in favour of their constituents and in favour of our motion 
but they felt that no one would talk to them the next morning at 
caucus.  They said that they had to make that decision as to whom 
they were going to support first, their party or the people who 
elected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it comes to that serious of an issue and members of 
parliament do not have the intestinal fortitude to stand up for 
the people who elected them in the first place, they have no 
business being in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for York South—Weston had the courage to stand up 
for the people who elected him.  What happened to that member? 
Everyone knows he now sits right beside the curtain on the 
opposition side.  He is history.  Those members over there knew 
that.  They knew that if they voted for the Reform motion on 
hepatitis C there would most likely be serious retribution and 
they could end up sitting on the opposite side of the House, out 
of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more important?  Why are we here as members of 
parliament?  If we are not here to represent the people that 
elected us first, then that is a dishonest way to become and 
remain a member of parliament.  It is fraudulent to forget who 
elected us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked a lot about that in the campaign.  In fact I was 
thinking about that yesterday.  A year ago we were involved in a 
federal election campaign.  One of the issues in that campaign 
was democracy and the way MPs should represent their 
constituents.  Every member of parliament I will admit has a 
different way of representing his or her constituents and well 
that should be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the people who elect us pay us.  We owe 
that first debt of duty to them, not to the whip or the party 
leader.  Until that changes, the things we see in this bill are 
going to continue to happen.  We are not allowing for the regular 
Joe Public to have his or her input into this country's business. 
That very critical point of argument has to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not support the bill the way it stands.  That is a given. 
If members from all parties, including the New Democrat members 
who seem to think it is a pretty good piece of legislation, could 
take a step from their own political parties, they could have a 
good look at the bill and see what it really means to democracy 
and the average worker.  They may find that the bill has some 
serious shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of parliament to take that step back from 
party lines just for a second if they could.  They could think 
not about what their whip or party leader wants them to do, but 
about what their constituents may want them to do.  Ultimately, 
when we are done with this business, our constituents are the 
people we have to live with when we go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind the House 
that we are debating Group No. 2 motions.  It would not hurt if 
every once in a while members who are speaking would alight 
somewhere near the motions being discussed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on the Group No. 2 motions in 
Bill C-19.  We have all been speaking quite eloquently on Group 
No. 2 today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is instructive to look at history to see what this bill will 
do for the Canadian economy.  Everybody in this House wants to 
improve the health and welfare of Canadians.  Heaven knows that 
we have the worst structural unemployment problem of any OECD 
nation in the world.  The number is over 9%.  It is not a 
cyclical problem.  It is a structural problem.  Bill C-19 will 
only make that structural problem worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is instructive to look at two countries that had to labour 
under labour laws which would be supported by Bill C-19, Britain 
and New Zealand.  As my friends from the Liberal Party well know, 
back in the 1970s and the 1980s, New Zealand and Great Britain 
were labouring under rules and regulations that supported the 
unions and which caused a dramatic negative impact on 
unemployment. Their labour laws sought to crush their economies 
through various methods which I will get into later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 will ban replacement workers.  As the Sims report very 
clearly said, banning replacement workers will have a significant 
negative impact on our economy.  It will increase the number of 
part time workers which will cause a decrease in investment, an 
increase in union premiums and a decrease in employment, that is, 
an increase in unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It causes a decrease in the reliance of permanent workers. Who 
would like to be in the situation of working part time job to 
part time job having to continually seek for a job?  It causes an 
enormous amount of personal and economic uncertainty for 
Canadians. That is happening more.  Instead of alleviating the 
problem, Bill C-19 will make that problem worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation would also provide for union reps to 
have the names and addresses of all offsite workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an infringement on and a violation of people's 
individual rights and freedoms.  It will also cause an increase 
in union premiums and a decrease in investment.  What has been 
clearly found, when we look at the impact of unionization on 
economic performance, is that there is no change or a decrease in 
productivity within an economy with an increasing in the strength 
of union rules and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unions have done a tremendous job 
historically in providing job security, fair wages and clean and 
fair environments. But in the last few decades they have taken on an 
entirely different tone and tenure.  Some unions are engaging in 
behaviours that produce and increase their political leadership 
rather than behaving in a way that is beneficial to their 
members.  It is the members who pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If union wages are increased, if members are forced against 
their will to join a union, labour costs are increased.  If 
labour costs are increased what happens?  The employer is forced 
to increase the price it charges for goods and services.  This 
causes a decrease in the competitiveness of that business.  That 
causes a decrease in employment in that business.  Unless wage 
increases are matched with increased productivity a firm becomes 
less competitive domestically and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of bill will to decrease the competitiveness of our 
industry and will strengthen the structural unemployment problems 
we have. This is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things we can do.  It is constructive to 
look at what the United States has recently done. In many states 
right to work legislation has been introduced.  For those states 
that have adopted right to work legislation, 75% of the new 
investment in the United States has gone to those states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the individual worker better off with or without right to 
work legislation?  The last thing we would want to do is in any 
way, shape or form harm the individual worker's ability to gain 
safe and secure employment.  Facts prove that right to work 
legislation increases the amount of money that workers have in 
their pockets by almost $2,300 per person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the historical evidence from Great Britain and New 
Zealand we see very clearly that the increasing strength of 
labour laws and regulations which strengthens unions within a 
country actually crushes the economy, increases unemployment and 
impedes the ability of workers to seek what people see as a 
necessary part of living, gainful, successful, enjoyable and safe 
employment.  That is what Bill C-19 and Group 2 motions will do, 
except for the ones the Reform Party has introduced.  They will 
improve Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things we can do that are constructive.  I will 
quote some from some labour laws and regulations that have 
actually strengthened and improved workers' positions. How can we 
protect individual workers rights? One, make it unfair to dismiss 
an employee for non-membership in all circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, give union members the right not to be disciplined by their 
union for not supporting industrial action. Three, make it 
unlawful to organize or threaten industrial action to establish 
or maintain a closed shop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four, make it unlawful to refuse employment on grounds related 
to trade union membership.  Job advertisements cannot specify 
union membership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five, make unions responsible for unofficial strikes. Unofficial 
strikers can be dismissed.  There is no immunity for industrial 
action to support a dismissed striker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also do the following that was in the trade union 
employment act in Great Britain.  We could establish a 
commissioner for the protection against unlawful industrial 
action. 
We could also require unions to provide all members with annual 
statements of financial affairs, including pay and benefits of 
union leaders.  Hundreds of millions of dollars go into union 
coffers every year.  Does anybody know where that money goes?  Do 
the workers know where that money goes?  No.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They pay out a lot of money and many union workers tell me they 
wish we could find out where that money goes.  They pay a lot of 
money out of their pockets but do not know where it goes.  They 
are concerned that money goes into the pockets of the leadership 
of the unions or for the leadership of the union's benefit and 
not for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An audit of these moneys making the ultimate outcome of the 
union dues transparent to all members is a useful thing for the 
membership and would strengthen and safeguard those union leaders 
who are honourable and trying to do the best for their workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also give individuals the right to join the union of 
their choice.  Right now they do not have that choice at all. We 
could also require employers to seek an individual written 
consent to the checkoff of trade union subscriptions from pay 
every three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things could strengthen labour laws, strengthen the 
individual's position rather than strengthening the position of 
the union leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in this House, in particular members of the Reform Party, 
wants to see in any way, shape or form individual rights 
compromised.  That is why our members are working very hard to 
quash this bill or at the very least change it so that individual 
worker rights are put ahead of the rights of union leaderships. 
How can anybody argue with that?  I ask members to join us in 
producing a bill that will strengthen the position of the workers 
and not the leaders. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have not 
had the opportunity to speak on the amendments to this bill and 
so I think it is a choice opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour laws in Canada are trying to strike a balance between the 
rights of management and the rights of workers.  That balance is 
a balance that I think we all look for and all strive for. I am 
not sure that the correct balance has been struck in this bill 
and I would like to bring forth a few examples as to how I think 
it could be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are speaking on the second group of amendments.  The whole 
idea of balance is so that the workers will have a safe, secure 
environment, which is very important.  I had lots to do in my 
previous life with employment problems and non-safe working 
conditions.  I think the unions had a good part to play in making 
workplaces safer.  I endorse the work unions have done in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back through history I have found evidence where workers 
were not paid properly.  I am convinced that the unions have had 
an excellent record in terms of getting fair wages for their 
individual workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the balance is there and not tipped in favour of the 
unions, I think we have the best of both worlds in Canada. I look 
to other countries and their experiences and share some of the 
comments of the member from Juan de Fuca who talked about Britain 
and New Zealand as classical examples where the balance was 
tipped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to me that when the balance became so tipped 
Britain had the lead in national health care.  It had a system 
that was completely and totally socialized.  In Britain, as these 
things often work, the health care system deteriorated.  Most 
people know now that Britain has both a private and a public 
system. Which groups were the first ones to speak out loudly for 
the private system when the public system failed them?  It was 
the unions.  They sought private health care for their workers 
instead of the public system where the waiting time was long.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unions got together and thought the national health system 
was the answer for all the problems and then ended up pushing for 
a private system, an experience that is quite interesting and 
quite unique. I digress a little, however, from the actual topic 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This grouping of amendments deals with the democratic process 
when it relates to union activity, a democratic process where it 
does not look fair to me for 35% of the workers to vote for a 
union and for the labour board to decide that the union should 
well be certified.  It reminds me of a dictatorial process.  We 
saw such a process not so long ago in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if members opposite would reflect on the forced vote on 
hepatitis C a few days ago.  It generated media interest that was 
intense.  If the Prime Minister had not done that maybe the story 
would not have been so vigorous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw what I consider to be the harshest cartoon I have ever 
seen in a political arena relating to this.  It showed on one 
side a victim of hepatitis and asked how do you recognize a 
victim of hepatitis C.  It also detailed the sad things these 
victims have, yellow skin, jaundice, swollen liver and fatigue. 
On the other side of the panel it asked how do you recognize a 
Liberal backbencher.  It drew a person in a business suit and 
labelled them.  The labels were devastating, two faced, no heart, 
spineless, gutless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were placed in the position of being called all those 
things. Individual members I had talked to and knew did not want 
to vote that way sincerely and humbly were forced to vote against 
their conscience.  I consider that action to have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member knows it is 
improper to reflect on a vote in the House.  I invite him to move 
on in his comments and deal with the matter before the House 
today.  I know the hon. member would want to comply with that 
rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for that timely 
reminder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is democracy, voting for constituent wishes and, in 
terms of the union here, looking at how union members could be so 
far off base as to be certified when there are only 35% voting 
for a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad commentary that this legislation is coming from a 
government that has not acted in a democratic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was asked a piercing question by a journalist today as to how 
this issue of democracy in the House could have got so far away 
from where the government should be, a government of compassion, 
a government of kindness and a government of sincerity.  I could 
not answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were four or five opportunities for the government to 
change its mind on the non-democratic position it took.  I could 
list the opportunities. The latest one is where the provinces, 
which had a stand that was supposedly unified, broke ranks.  What 
a perfect opportunity for the Prime Minister to simply say they 
had made a mistake, that they would listen now reflecting on that 
error and go back to the drawing board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government dug in its heels and became aggressive 
and belligerent on behalf of a position it took, a position I am 
convinced most Canadians know is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the government get out of a position when it has been 
non-democratic?  It is really quite tough.  How does an 
individual go back to their constituents and say “when we talked 
before the vote I promised you that I would not vote for this 
package and I changed my mind”? 
I guess the cartoon that says spineless really says a lot.

they go to public events over the next few months and answer the 
questions of their constituents, will have trouble explaining to 
them why they went that route.  I feel sorry for them.  I feel in 
my heart that they did not want to do that.  I guess they can 
find some excuse to say to an individual with hepatitis C, but 
frankly it is difficult for me to explain.  I could not explain 
it to the journalist.  Maybe they could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see you getting ready with Beauchesne's.  I 
presume that means I should be moving into another area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. I am pleased that the hon. member for Macleod brought 
it to my attention, but most definitely this does not have 
anything to do with the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the Reform Party are serious about trying to make 
some amendments, would they please talk about them?  We have been 
here all day and there has been very little talk on the 
amendments.  Obviously this is not a serious— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have corrected the hon. member for 
Macleod once.  In case he wanted to know the reference. I refer 
the hon. member to citation 479 of Beauchesne's, 6th edition. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Member may not speak against or reflect upon any determination 
of the House, unless intending to conclude with a motion for 
rescinding it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is not in a position to move such a motion today 
since we are on debate on another bill.  There are motions 
already before the House concerning another bill and a motion to 
rescind the motion he was referring to earlier would be out of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks today I know he was working to draw them into 
Bill C-19, which is after all the subject of our discussion.  I 
had not noticed that he had strayed further than some other 
members had strayed from the topic in the course of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again I defer to your 
wisdom and judgment on these matters, as I recognize your 
profound experience in the rules and practices and regulations of 
the House.  It would be very unwise of me to try to argue such 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the point that I was trying to make before, 
the undemocratic nature of Bill C-19.  Members opposite have some 
difficulty understanding this principle.  I was trying to point 
out when one has not been democratic in one's own affairs it is 
difficult to be democratic in the affairs of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to have balance in labour laws.  This sort 
of balance is what Reformers seek.  We would like management and 
workers to have the proper balance.  We think it can be improved. 
We have made amendments to do so.  I would ask my colleagues to 
consider the amendments we have put forward with care and with 
sincerity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

comments made by my colleague from Maclead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Labour has sat here all day.  It is a shame that she has not been 
accompanied by too many of her government colleagues in this 
debate while listening to the concerns of the opposition parties 
to government legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless I am mistaken, the whole purpose of report stage is for 
the government to look at amendments placed on the floor by 
opposition members to try to make a better piece of legislation 
than what the government has provided.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job in this place is to hold the government accountable and 
to make sure the legislation that the government passes on behalf 
of the Canadian public is the best it can possibly be.  It is 
sometimes very disarming for us when debating to an empty House 
to try to convince an empty House that the legislation is 
inadequate, needs to be corrected and needs changes.  Today is 
just another example of what we put up with day after day in 
trying to hold the government accountable for bad legislation and 
to offer some innovative changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a genuine concern with Bill C-19 under Group No. 2. Let 
there be no mistake that I will be speaking about the lack of 
vision the government has shown in Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a province which has had labour legislation that has 
been very damaging to the economic well-being of our province and 
of employment.  We have a problem in our province with labour 
legislation.  We do not want to see as representatives of that 
province those problems compounded by labour legislation brought 
in by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a concern with the democracy that is not being supported 
in the legislation.  We are talking about legislation that would 
allow a union to come in and organize in a place of work and to 
convince some people, sometimes the ones with a lot of influence, 
to consider unionizing.  These people of influence, although they 
may be a minority, could end up placing that place of work in a 
situation where somebody declares that it will be a unionized 
shop even though the majority of workers, for very good reasons 
perhaps, feel that they are not ready to be unionized and do not 
want to be unionized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That just rubs the wrong way any Canadian who believes in 
democracy, who believes that people have a right to make 
decisions for the best of the majority in the situation.  That 
means workers and that a majority of the workforce in a 
particular work environment should feel that a union is required 
to speak on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many instances people find themselves in a union when they do 
not really want to be.  They are paying union dues when they do 
not see any benefit from it.  We even have young people who are 
union members.  They get accreditation, their journeyman 
certificates, but because of union salaries they find themselves 
too expensive and the union shops do not hire them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked with several young people who have found 
themselves unemployed for years on end because they cannot work 
outside a union shop.  The employers are being asked to pay them 
journeyman wages which they cannot afford to pay.  The young 
people find themselves in a conundrum: they cannot work because 
the union will not allow them to work and have no options open to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people are looking at unions in a different light.  A 
majority of workers should be required before a workplace decides 
to belong to a union.  I do not think we should be taking that 
right away from the average employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have with Group No. 2 is the motion the Bloc 
has put forth.  I have difficulty with it.  I like some of the 
concepts but not all of them.  This is an opportunity in the 
House of Commons for people to debate the motions in amendment 
raised by other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like the idea that we have a government which feels 
that this is a waste of time and that we should not have the 
right to be raising points on other people's motions that we feel 
may be going in the right direction but do not quite make it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Motion No. 8 talks about the automatic removal of an 
employee representative upon the receipt of an application.  This 
is when employers are being blended.  I have a problem with the 
way it is being dealt with.  I like the concept that there needs 
to be some negotiation, but who should decide which side is to 
have the employer or employee representatives when there are 
amalgamations or mergers.  There may have to be a concession that 
all of them are represented or a means of figuring that one out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the vehicle.  This is the process.  In parliamentary 
debate we debate these issues.  I resent that we have a 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour who is trying 
to say that we do not have the right or that we are wasting time 
debating these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Motion No. 7 we indicate that the wording is not quite right. 
One word can make all the difference in the world.  “May” 
rather than “shall” can make all the difference in the world to 
workers who are looking for somebody to represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is wrong for us to move a motion to say to 
government that a word is not quite right, that it can be 
interpreted in such a way that it is not representing the best 
interest of the employee, and that we feel it should use another 
word in the legislation instead of the word it has chosen to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion we are saying that the government is offering the 
labour board a choice that it may or may not call for a 
representative vote of the workers.  That should be automatic; 
that vote should be required.  It should not be conditional and 
not something the board can choose to use or not to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be naive of me after five years in this place but I would 
like to think the government is open to suggestions, that the 
government is open to having motions brought forward and debated 
pointing out the usage of words that may make a difference in the 
interpretation by the board being created by a court if it comes 
to a court situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to think that the government is open to those 
kinds of suggestions.  However my experience tells me otherwise. 
My experience tells me, no matter what the issue, that once the 
government has made up its mind it is not willing to accept that 
maybe it has made a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter whether it is in the drafting of a bill or in 
the hepatitis C debate.  We very seldom see a government that 
says that maybe it made a mistake, maybe it could do better, 
maybe it should listen to the opposition side, maybe it will make 
a change because of something suggested that offers improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than listening to the cat-calling, the hissing and the 
screaming from the other side, maybe they should be listening to 
the logical and well presented arguments from the opposition side 
to improve government legislation so that Canadians can receive 
the best possible legislation from the House.

WED and Ford-Q was $1.1 billion in terms of authorization, of 
which $999 million was spent.  One billion dollars in one year is 
a major acceleration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional development agencies were set up to do one thing and 
they are doing another.  They were set up to fill gaps in the 
financial markets that were not being filled by the financial 
institutions in the private sector.  They are now in direct 
competition with the services provided by the private sector 
financial institutions. I will show exactly how they are doing 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1996 the report of the Senate banking committee 
concluded that while the agencies are meant to fill gaps in the 
capital markets, there is no consensus on the method determining 
where those gaps exist and there is no way of analysing whether 
the gaps are being filled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regional development agencies are but one part of crown 
corporations in dealing with finances.  Among those other 
institutions the following are included:  the Business 
Development Bank of Canada, the Farm Credit Corporation, the 
Canadian Export Development Corporation, Canada Lands, Canada 
Post, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and many others 
totalling up to 50 such agencies that deal in the financial 
sector.  They were all set up to support ventures that do not 
have access to financing in the private sector.  Today those 
ventures have the same difficulty getting access to the crown 
corporations and regional development agencies as they have 
accessing agencies in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recap.  Regional development agencies spend over a 
billion dollars a year of taxpayer money.  Their purpose is to 
fill gaps in capital markets yet there is no way of determining 
where those gaps are and no way of analysing whether the agencies 
are filling those gaps.  The agencies are part of the crown 
corporate structure, of which there are 50 bodies. Crown 
corporations were established to increase access to capital but 
business today has difficulty getting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has this happened?  What has caused agencies to become 
ineffective?  The Liberal wisdom of balanced budgets is to 
maintain institutions without determining their effectiveness, to 
insist they become self-sufficient even though to do so the 
agencies will be forced to compete with the private sector, and 
they move away from their original mandate to fill gaps in the 
capital market and financing needs of the people.  This wisdom is 
costly.  It promotes inefficiency and fails to contribute to the 
growth of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform wisdom would be to eliminate these costly agencies 
which have outlived their purpose and which compete with the 
private sector.  In doing so, a Reform government would eliminate 
a significant amount of unnecessary spending and would empower 
the private sector by getting out of its way.  This would allow 
the private sector to function more effectively without 
competition from the public sector and it would stimulate growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agencies have become ineffective because of their 
inability to do the things they were set up to do.  Do we need 
further evidence?  No, we do not.  But there are additional 
issues.  For instance, a newer selling point for the regional 
agencies is that they become one stop doors to government 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two issues here.  First, if there are so many 
government programs and agencies to help small businesses that we 
need a guide to steer us through them, then there are too many 
programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A business wants access to capital.  It does not distinguish 
whether it is TPC, SBLA, FCC, WED, CANARIE, NRC, MRC, ACOA, 
FORD-Q, FedNor, BDC or CMHC.  That is just the beginning.  Each 
of these is an acronyms for a government program.  The labyrinth 
carries on.  Each dispenses billions of dollars for one purpose, 
the help small and not so small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned here only with three agencies.  The second 
issue here is that if the government is to be involved in western 
economic diversification, Atlantic Canada opportunities, the 
regional development of Quebec, and the economic initiatives in 
northern Ontario, there are other federal crown agencies that do 
exactly the same thing. Two of these are the Business Development 
Bank of Canada and the Farm Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could easily enter into debate about whether FCC and the 
BDC, the Farm Credit Corporation and the Business Development 
Bank, are doing what they were intended to do.  That is a subject 
for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is failing in its responsibility to business, to 
the marketplace and to the taxpayer.  The government continues to 
build a labyrinth of sources for capital and still is no closer 
to understanding why the gaps exist in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that it is no easier with all these government 
programs for business to gain access.  It is becoming 
increasingly difficult.  The government has not improved the 
marketplace.  Instead it competes with the private sector.  More 
important, the government has failed to analyse why we have these 
gaps in the marketplace in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking the easy way out, more spending, more 
activity but less and less effectiveness.  The people in business 
who need access to capital are not getting it.  The marketplace 
is not improving and the promised long term jobs are not 
resulting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original regional development agencies are a failure by 
anyone's standard.  It is time to eliminate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much work has been done in the past two years by the standing 
Senate committee on banking, trade and commerce.  That committee 
published a report in April 1996 which recommended “the phasing 
out of regional development agencies; they should not exist 
independent of crown financial institutions when institutions 
such as the Farm Credit Corporation and the Business Development 
Bank of Canada target the same market as the regional agencies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee goes on to say: “If there are regional economic 
development programs funded at the federal level that do not 
involve direct business related services, then provincial 
agencies are best able to deliver such programs”.  These are 
sound recommendations given the committee's findings, but the 
Liberal government ignored them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this is an indication by the Liberal government as to 
how effective the Senate could be, but that is another debate 
which we will not get into now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just that regional agencies do exactly the same as 
some of these crown financial institutions.  Other crown 
financial institutions can leverage their paid in capital and as 
such are in a much stronger position to help business because 
their financial strength is much greater than that of regional 
development agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do regional development agencies compete directly with 
the private sector, they duplicate the work done by other crown 
financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the auditor general had some concerns, lack of 
information on which programs have worked and which have not, the 
need to be cost effective, the lengthy approval times, the need 
for continued co-operation and the challenge of implementing 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the auditor general reviewed those same things and asked 
what has happened.  Here are three of the agencies he examined 
and gave a conclusion on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the auditor general's words it was still too early to 
determine whether FedNor is adequately monitoring its projects. 
Let us review the history of FedNor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was created in 1987 to address the economic disparities and 
adjustment problems of the region.  In 1992, five years later, 
all the programs were all consolidated into one program the 
FedNor business incentives program. 
In 1996 its strategy was changed again, this time to improving 
access of small business to capital, to information on markets 
and promotion of community partnerships.  Three changes in 
mandate in nine years.  The obvious question is what evaluation 
was done that resulted in the changes in mandate. Is the focus 
right now?  Will it again be changed before it can be evaluated? 
Was it wrong the first time? Was it wrong the second time?  Is it 
wrong now?  What assurances do we have that it is right now?  If 
it keeps getting changed we will never know.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why these changes are such a useful vehicle for 
patronage, disposal of money.  No one can ever pin the government 
down because before we can find out what it is really doing the 
government has changed so we never really know what its mandate 
was.  And yet it is costing money, taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must be held accountable.  How many businesses 
went bankrupt because of these grants and subsidies to these 
development agencies?  Who will ever know?  For that reason if no 
other they should be scrapped.  How can the success of a program 
be seriously valued in such a short time if the mandate changes 
constantly?  I will go on to the next thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FORD-Q is the biggest spender of them all.  The only improvement 
observed by the auditor general was: “Our review of a small 
sample of files suggests that the documentation supporting 
project funding recommendations has improved”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not see a quorum.  I see only three Reform members

Resuming debate, the hon. member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the auditor general in 
1997 also did a comparison of what happened in the two years in 
ACOA.  The main purpose for setting up ACOA was, according to the 
auditor general's report of 1995, to create employment.  That was 
its main purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the auditor general reviewed again to see what had 
happened.  He made this observation about ACOA:  “The agency 
continues to use the assumption that all of the jobs created by 
the program will last for a period of 10 years.  As in 1995 we 
were not able to find support for this assumption”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very purpose for which it was set up was not being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes beyond that and states that the objectives were 
so general they could not be measured.  The assessment process 
used by the agency was not significantly different from that 
found in the 1995 audit.  This is an abysmal failure in the way 
in which that particular agency is run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go beyond that.  How effective is another group?  The western 
economic diversification agency was set up recently to cover a 
whole lot of things.  It is supposed to do new things.  Canada 
business development centres were set up to provide access to 
various government departments through the communication network. 
They were working.  Now they are subsumed under WED. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notorious infrastructure was working, but now it is subsumed 
under WED.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community futures program was working.  It is now under WED. 
What has been the result of all of this?  In Kelowna the 
infrastructure program has never been less successful.  The 
community futures program has not brought more people into the 
marketplace and into the working field.  The business development 
centres do not distribute any more information than they did 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the results?  We have an organization.  We have staff. 
We have bureaucrats.  And the only jobs that were created on a 
permanent basis were for the bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regional development agencies are not doing what they were 
set up to do.  They are costing taxpayers billions of dollars. 
They are duplicating the work of crown corporations.  They are 
competing directly with the private sector.  They are doing the 
exact opposite of what they should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wisdom is that we should eliminate them.  If we have to fill 
the gaps that are not being met in the private sector and in the 
financial sector, let the agencies that exist outside of the 
regional development agencies, like the BDC, do the work.

and Development)(Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is obviously a fundamental difference here in 
terms of the approach to the development of the nation.  There is 
a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of development 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by thanking the hon. member for Kelowna for all of 
the good work that he has been doing with the Central Okanagan 
Community Futures Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community futures development corporations are funded in large 
part by regional agencies.  They play a very important part in 
the economic development of rural and non-rural western Canada. 
The Central Okanagan Community Futures Development Corporation is 
part of western diversification's western Canada business 
services network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since his election, the hon. member for Kelowna has continued 
his good work by meeting with management of this community 
futures development corporation to discuss the corporation's 
business plan.  He has continued by attending that community 
futures development corporation's networking evenings for small 
business.  In September 1996 he was one of the opening speakers 
at the Central Okanagan CFDC's annual meeting, where I am told 
that my hon. colleague spoke glowingly of the achievements of the 
community futures development corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member:  Good work.  Keep it up.  He knows 
that these community development futures corporations have a 
niche, that they are filling a need, that they work and that they 
do help in the creation of thousands of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I must confess that I find it strange why this 
member, who knows the benefits that the regional economic 
development agencies provide to small and medium size businesses, 
would put forward a motion to disband these agencies. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional economic development is, without a doubt, one of the 
cornerstones of our nation.  The federal government has promised 
to pursue economic development and to promote equal opportunity 
for all Canadians.  Whatever our party or background, we must 
agree that strong regions contribute to a strong Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, the industry portfolio in particular, 
plays a critical role in pooling and marshalling the resources 
that businesses in Canada need.  Canada's regional development 
agencies are largely responsible for the development and delivery 
of these resources across the country.  They exist to help 
businesses in the regions develop and grow to meet the challenges 
of the globally competitive world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be responsible for our regional agencies. 
Let me give members a few reasons for that.

other examples.

mostly larger cities. Their primary focus is small towns and 
rural areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell this House very briefly about some success 
stories.  Barbara Dale from Edmonton came to Alberta Women's 
Enterprise Initiative Association with an idea for a business in 
1996.  She received business planning help and qualified for a 
$100,000 start-up loan.  Last year her company, Labour Now 
Industrial Staffing, had sales of over $1 million and is 
forecasting $4 million for this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of WED's products and services must meet the needs of a 
specific client group, follow the agenda of the federal 
government in terms of economic development, provide key needs of 
small business, information and capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Business Service Centres, les Centres de services aux 
entreprises du Canada, are an important element in this economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WED is a managing partner in the west.  Last year these 
organizations took an average of 33,000 requests for information 
and 50,000 website hits every month. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the loans and investment fund, WD makes 
contributions to loan-loss reserves to raise capital for small 
business from financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every dollar invested by WD, financial institutions invest 
eight. As a result, $420 million was made available to small and 
medium size businesses. WD helps businesses fill in loan 
applications. Loans are administered by financial institutions 
at arm's length from WD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While still a new program, more than 240 loans totalling 
$55 million have already been approved. Also, CFDCs have granted 
more than 1,500 smaller loans, which helped create 2,500 jobs in 
rural areas in western Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at WED's efforts with aboriginal peoples: contribution of 
$950,000 given to the Aboriginal Business Development Centre in 
Winnipeg to encourage entrepreneurship among urban aboriginals; a

today in my capacity as the Bloc Quebecois critic for regional 
development on Motion M-224, presented by my colleague on the 
industry committee, the hon. member for Kelowna.  I can attest 
to how hard he works on that committee, and he often asks 
pertinent questions. 
entirely 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it would be useful to reread his motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
dissolve the regional development agencies, including ACOA, 
Ford-Q, WED, and FedNor, and redirect funds targeted for the 
agencies toward tax relief, debt retirement, and the  reduction 
of the size of the federal government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the components of this motion make sense, but there is a 
problem, I believe, when they are put together.  Then some 
clarification becomes necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would be in favour of dissolution of the 
regional development agencies, but is not opposed to investment 
in regional development.  Our Reform colleague is suggesting 
less intervention in the economy. On this point, my thoughts are 
along the same lines as the Liberal minister who has just 
spoken. 
It is certain that the rural and isolated areas need help.  They 
must be given special assistance or they and their local 
businesses will not have an equal opportunity for development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, however, the federal government is not the one 
best placed to develop the regions.  The government in Ottawa 
creates agencies right and left, but there are services in place 
at the provincial government level for this.  Such is the case 
in Quebec, with its regionalized structure made up of 16 
regional development councils.  There are local development 
councils, one in each of the MRCs, and these structures are 
characterized by representativity.  The public can run for 
membership on the board of these bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may well say “Oh yes, we do the same, we have CFDCs 
in our region”.  But this duplication of energies and of staff 
constitutes a problem. 
I am speaking for Quebec, because it is what I know best.  In 
our opinion, the federal government is not the one in the best 
position to look after this matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will be present because of its need of 
visibility.  Whether the government is Liberal or Conservative, 
it has to have its visibility.  It must at all cost show it is 
doing something even if regional development services exist in 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the logic of our statement, money for regional 
development should go to the provinces, which are in a better 
position, in our opinion, to look after such matters, or 
federal-provincial agreements should be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was long the case.  It could have been the case, for 
example, in the infrastructures program in which municipal, 
provincial and federal governments acted on a one time basis. 
Such agreements are possible, therefore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such one was renewed in the east.  Since 1994, with the 
Liberals in government, renewal of the regional development 
agreement with Quebec has been impossible.  There has been 
no agreement since 1994, and on top of that, the federal 
government continues to spend money on regional development 
without a thought to regional development council strategies or 
to the priorities and approaches of local development councils. 
It is therefore acting unilaterally, driven by its concern for 
visibility.

calling it the federal office for regional development—Quebec. 
Since early March, it has been called the Canada Economic 
Development for Quebec Regions Agency.  They have to show their 
maple leaf. 
This is for visibility. When ministers cannot make 
announcements, they send government members to do it, to cut 
ribbons, so as to always ensure the visibility of our good 
federal government, and particularly that of the Liberal 
government. Money is spent. But we need to allocate that money 
to development initiatives that reflect the priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of duplication is the $33 million spent in Quebec for 
administration purposes. There are 264 federal public servants 
who duplicate the work of provincial public servants, or of 
development officers paid by municipalities, regions or 
communities. And they seldom sit down to put their heads 
together. We must put an end to this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will admit one thing. We must recognize the work of 
the CFDC's in Quebec that are funded by the federal government. 
Over time, they developed an expertise in regional development. 
In recent days, I talked to Quebec government people involved in 
regional development, and they were saying that their government 
is willing to recognize the expertise of the CFDC people who 
have been involved, and that it would be pleased to continue to 
work with them. These people include permanent employees, but 
also many volunteers who became involved over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the federal government's participation in 
Quebec's regional development activities has considerably 
evolved toward unilateralism. Indeed, while the federal 
government used to provide financial support to activities 
determined by the Quebec government, it is now implementing its 
own programs and activities, and it funds them in a unilateral 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, no reference is made to either strategic planning 
or framework agreements between the Quebec government and the 
regions for the choice of priorities, but rather to the study 
results on which the former federal office of regional 
development based its own view of the regions of Quebec.  This 
situation does not augur well in any way, because in future the 
two governments will be taking action on parallel paths in 
regional development, so there will be still more duplication 
and overlap, thus creating an atmosphere of confusion for the 
clientele in the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, with the abolition of these agencies, the federal government 
were to convert the amounts it was already spending into 
transfer payments to the provinces, we would be in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec does not get its fair share in regional development 
funding. Looking at the per capita amounts, and comparing with 
the Atlantic provinces for instance, I would like my colleague 
from the Atlantic region to know that there is a five-to-one 
ratio, with his region getting five times as much.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparing the number of unemployed, the ratio is four-to-one.  I 
have not done an analysis for other regions, but I believe that 
if the government wants to continue paying out money and if it 
were to accept a federal-provincial agreement for doing so, it 
should at least respect the principle of fairness.  There is 
already the principle of equalization, which applies to 
transfers to the provinces.  The Minister of Finance has 
jurisdiction over this, according to certain calculation 
formulas  too complicated to go into here.  This is a system 
already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to regional development, where the focus should be 
on giving isolated regions of a province, or sub-regions, the 
same opportunities as the rest of that province, it should be up 
to the province to decide on priorities and on the mechanisms to 
be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional on such a balance, there should be transfers to the 
provinces for regional development, because we feel that the 
provinces are best placed to be responsible for this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would first like to thank my Bloc colleague for the good news 
about his comparison of the Atlantic and Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say I am not surprised to see this private members' 
motion today.  We are finally starting to see the true colours of 
the Reform Party. Bit by bit through this whole parliament we are 
going to see Reform Party members coming up with motions and 
private members' bills and they will slowly try to dismantle all 
programs in this country. They will start, as they have shown 
today, by attacking the most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have regional development agencies.  Being the 
critic for ACOA I have to say there is a need for these agencies 
but unfortunately the Reformers do not see a need. They do not 
see a need to help the unfortunate of this country.  There has 
been proof today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say I am not surprised.  I am alarmed because my fear 
of that party is coming to realization.  I hope Canadians will 
finally see through that party. It is scary when you hear some of 
the things its members say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency creates jobs.  I am not 
saying that ACOA is set up perfectly because it is not.  There 
are changes I would like to see in ACOA.  I would like to see it 
closer to the community but it does help to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could try to forget that there are provinces and regions not 
only in the Atlantic but all across the country that are less 
fortunate than others.  We could do like the Reform Party does 
and say we are going to forget about them, let us take away the 
financing they have, let us take away whatever prosperity this 
may give them. Not everybody in Atlantic Canada has big bucks to 
start small businesses.  They need help. That is what ACOA is 
there for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I am not saying that it is a perfect agency but I would 
rather see it there the way it is now than not see it at all. 
There is a need for it.  I get calls on a daily basis from people 
asking how to start up a business, what is out there to help 
them.  If we did not have agencies like this one, we would not 
have small businesses.  The self-employed create jobs in the 
Atlantic provinces.  There is a need for them.  There is the 
fixed link fund.  It might not have helped as much as we would 
have liked but it certainly helped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One criticism about ACOA is that there is not enough follow up. 
There is money to help start businesses but it lets it go too 
fast.  There is a need for follow up.  There is a need to make 
sure that the businesses are stable and can survive. That is not 
there right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the motion as one coming from a member of a 
party that wants to dismantle this program.  It is a start at 
dismantling regional development agencies.  If it could 
succeed—and I am pretty sure it could not—it would try it on 
health care, CPP and on and on.  That party believes that if one 
is not rich then tough.  It is unfortunate how it addresses the 
poor in Canada and tells them that it will relieve them of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in that bracket.  I was paying taxes and I was not making 
a whole lot of money, but when my son was sick he could go to the 
hospital and it did not cost me anything.  My daughter spent a 
week in the hospital last year and it did not cost me anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the part Reformers forget to say.  They are going to 
reduces the taxes but they forget to say that taxpayers will have 
to pay for their children in hospital or have to buy insurance if 
they can.  It is all in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has it very well laid out.  Its members know 
what to say and they know what to try to make believe to 
Canadians.  I am telling Canadians what the Reform Party would 
really do.  It is trying to do it today by trying to dismantle 
these agencies.  It is just the start of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how Reformers work.  They tell Canadians that is not 
true, that they care about the unfortunate, the poor and the 
small and medium size businesses.  However they would destroy 
them.  This would destroy the possibility of creating small and 
medium size businesses in the Atlantic provinces.  I am just 
showing their true colours.  I believe that very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I probably paid more in taxes this year than I made working the 
year before.  At least I have services.  My mom and dad have 
pensions.  They can have a half decent life.  It is all there. 
The day we start slashing and slashing, the services will be 
gone. It is very important for Canadians to remember that.  The 
motion is showing me exactly what the Reform Party wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Reformers talk about tax breaks, do they often say a tax 
break only for the very poor?  No, they do not say what kind of 
tax break they would give to the very wealthy. We do not hear 
them say that.  I wonder why. They will never say that large 
corporations do not pay enough tax. Those are their buddies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in the Liberal Party probably have quite a few buddies. 
I am sure when the Minister of Finance has supper he does not go 
to the soup kitchen.  I am sure he goes with his bank buddies and 
they tell him to keep up the great work, that he is doing just 
great.  He goes along and keeps doing what he is doing because of 
what all his buddies are saying.  That is what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of Parliament who have never experienced too much 
hardship should go to a soup kitchen for supper once in a while 
or should see the line-up at social services.  Maybe that would 
give them a reality check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to ACOA and when it comes to this motion it is 
disgusting. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say a few words in French.  ACOA is needed 
in the Atlantic regions.  I have no doubt of that.  We need help 
starting up and developing small and medium size business.  This 
agency is there.  It is not perfect, and I would certainly like 
to see some changes, but I would rather have it as it is than 
not at all.  It is my duty to work toward progressive and 
positive changes in this agency that will help develop our 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier in English, suggestions such as these calling 
for the abolition of agencies helping Canada's poorer regions 
are alarming.  This is only the beginning and it reveals the 
real Reform Party.  Its purpose is to destroy our national 
programs and to continue to help its friends, who are luckier 
than others in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I cannot blame my colleague from New Brunswick for being 
concerned, but have no fear the Tories are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure for me to rise before the House in response to 
Motion No. 224, calling upon the government to dissolve all 
regional development agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years, successive federal governments grappled with the 
problem of regional economic disparity.  In 1969 the Department 
of Regional Economic Expansion was created in an attempt to 
address the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later in 1982 the department evolved into the Department of 
Regional Industrial Expansion.  Both these endeavours failed to 
adequately address the specific problems facing the many diverse 
regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major criticisms of these two departments derives 
from its often poor focus on a centrally devised, one size fits 
all answer to regional problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wanted a greater say in developing their own programs 
to respond to their own economic problems.  They were no longer 
willing to accept Ottawa's often ill advised solutions being 
thrust upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, in 1987 the Progressive Conservative government 
disbanded DRIE and announced a new direction for regional 
economic development policy in Canada. New agencies were created 
for the western and Atlantic provinces, moving much of the 
government's regional development decision making out of Ottawa 
and closer to the people served. Western economic diversification 
was created to help expand and develop the business face of the 
economy in the western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency was given a legislative 
mandate to increase opportunity for economic development in 
Atlantic Canada and to enhance the growth of earned income and 
employment opportunities in that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>ACOA has enabled many small and medium size businesses in 
Atlantic Canada to create jobs that otherwise would not exist. 
Its involvement in the economy of the region has resulted in an 
important net positive contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its inception ACOA has had a total employment impact of 
82,000 jobs.  ACOA's investment has created $233 million annually 
in new export sales.  Each dollar invested in the business by 
ACOA, its provincial government and private sector partners 
results in $5 of benefit to the Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly the return to the government in taxes, savings and 
employment insurance payments equals $3 for every dollar invested 
by the government.  ACOA has a proven performance record in 
achieving real results in our Atlantic economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dissolving ACOA would have a devastating effect on most Atlantic 
Canadians.  Unlike the western region whose economy presently 
leads the nation, Atlantic Canada continues to struggle 
particularly with the serious downturn in the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are presently over 25,000 fishers and fish plant workers 
in Atlantic Canada who were forced from the fishery by the 
downturn in the fishery and who are subsequently awaiting word 
from the government on a new TAGS program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party was the first to champion the 
cause of tax relief for ordinary Canadians.  However, the 
cancellation of this regional development agency would provide 
little or no tax relief for these 25,000 individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment figures are still too high in Atlantic Canada.  The 
best way to confront the serious unemployment situation is to 
encourage Canadians young and old to start their own business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Figures show that 94% of all new jobs in the country are created 
by small and medium size enterprises.  We need ACOA to help 
people start and to expand their own businesses.  It has the 
ability to provide individuals with much needed capital along 
with expertise on how to begin new ventures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most chartered banks in Atlantic Canada are quite reluctant to 
support small business ventures unless they are willing to 
provide about 30% to 50% of their own equity to the project. 
Unfortunately most aspiring entrepreneurs are incapable of 
meeting this demand.  Therefore, without ACOA having taken a 
chance on individual projects, many would not have got off the 
ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada need ACOA to reduce the regional economic 
disparity that exists among provinces.  Therefore we cannot 
support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The mover of the 
motion, the hon. member for Kelowna, has five minutes to 
conclude. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
express appreciation to some of the speakers who have entered 
into the debate.  I am somewhat disappointed in some of the views 
that have been expressed because some of them left a lot of 
imagination between what was said and what the actual truth of 
the situation really was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing ought to be made very clear. The reason behind the 
motion is to eliminate inefficiencies, to eliminate duplication, 
to eliminate grants and subsidies to businesses which really 
divert funds from successful businesses and gives them to other 
businesses.  Is that to say that none of these programs have 
worked?  Of course they have worked but at a cost and 
inefficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some suggestions that we should have grants and 
subsidies.  Let me just look at a couple of things that have 
happened.  Some $11 billion of assistance was authorized over the 
last 16 years.  Some 32,000 separate grants have been given, and 
18% of them were given to 75 of the largest corporations in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are talking about helping the poor, that is not where this 
money is going.  It is not going to the poor people.  Hundreds of 
millions of dollars are going to Pratt & Whitney, De Havilland, 
Bombardier, Canadair, to Le Group Montreal Inc. and Air Ontario. 
In fact it was almost $1 billion.  What has the repayment 
schedule been?  It has been abysmal.  Very little money has been 
repaid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that some serious questions have to be 
asked.  How can parliament continue to accept that subsidies are 
cost effective when we know that the evidence clearly shows that 
they are not?   We have no way of evaluating them.  How can 
parliament continue to support regional development agencies when 
study after study shows that they are not accomplishing what they 
were set out to do?  How can parliament continue to support 
regional development agencies when they contribute significantly 
to taxpayers' burdens with so little return on the investment? 
These are serious questions that have to be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to inefficiency and overlap in particular with the BDC, 
SCC and Community Futures, now a big bureaucrat is sitting over 
top of them and saying “Look at how much more responsibility I 
have now.  I have to have a bigger budget.  I have to have more 
staff. I have to have bigger offices”.  It is bureaucratic 
entrepreneurship, and it does not build the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make all efforts to eliminate the regional development 
agencies and redirect the funds so that they will do what they 
are supposed to be doing toward tax relief, debt retirement, 
building the economy and reducing the size of government.  That 
is what this was about.  In this way we will support the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a rule for government agencies but the issue is 
duplication.  The issue is building the private sector. Taxpayers 
spend money better.  Left in their pockets they will manage their 
money better.  Business will manage money far better than any 
government agency or any government department ever dreamt of 
doing.  That is the principle here.  Government should get out of 
business and let them help those people who really need the help, 
not the big corporate welfare bums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired 
and the order is dropped from the order paper.

have been moved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE ENVIRONMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on February 23, I asked the Minister of the Environment which 
departments will be stopping hazardous waste dumping in Ontario 
sewers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I raised my concerns shared by many Canadians on 
the minister's assurances regarding the harmonization accord and 
the continuing decline of environmental protection across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response as recorded in <I>Hansard</I> included: 
“We will assure all members of this House that we are following 
through with our supervision, inspections and maintenance of 
standards”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Program review one and two led to losses in financial and human 
resources which have devastated a once respected department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The growing concerns over global warming, pollution prevention 
and community health issues are of prime concern to Canadians. The 
majority of Canadians believe more should be done to protect our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada's own internal report identified a need for 
over 300 staff to provide adequate environmental inspections, 
enforcement and protection.  Yet the minister is comfortable with 
60.  The minister defends this policy and the lack of enforcement 
and protection as sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw attention to another issue, ASD, alternate 
service delivery.  Canadians have witnessed examples of this 
failure policy through NavCan, food inspection branch and Ports 
Canada; bad ideas, poor service and Canadians at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals wish to continue this policy with components of 
the atmospheric sciences branch.  This is at a time when our 
major trading partners are increasing funding to atmospheric 
sciences.  Canadians across this country have stated time and 
time again do not close more weather stations, where are the up 
to date storm alerts, and why do they have to pay for weather 
information as taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this conscious abandonment of fiscal excuses coupled with 
the continued devolution of environment duties and 
responsibilities through ill advised harmonization accords with 
the provinces, this Liberal government approach will lead only to 
further degradation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Canadians be reassured on the protection from hazardous 
waste dumping when there is little proof that Liberals care about 
our environment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue of 
hazardous wastes, including their generation, transportation and 
disposal, is one which touches all Canadians.  It is one which 
the federal government takes seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has shown its intentions relating to the responsible 
management of hazardous wastes through the Canada-U.S. agreement 
on the transboundary movement of those wastes between our two 
countries.  As a signatory to the international Basel convention, 
Canada again indicated its commitment to environmentally sound 
transport and handling of hazardous wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of municipalities and the environmental protection 
measures they may take, municipal governments have the authority 
and bylaw making powers granted to them under provincial laws 
which create or incorporate them.  It is consistent with the 
overall Canadian experience that municipalities have demonstrated 
over the years their environmental conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases they can and do act to prevent noxious and harmful 
substances from being disposed into municipal sewers or through 
other municipal facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also addressed a number of other concerns in his 
address and one of them has to do with issues around enforcement. 
The hon. member is well aware, because he is a participant on 
the environment committee, that the committee is doing a report 
that will be given to parliament on this issue.  I believe all 
members have taken good use of committee time around the table. 
Everyone has made a very sound contribution to this very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of global warming, the government has established a 
national secretariat that will be dealing with the global warming 
challenge.  In terms of alternate service delivery for the 
weather and climatic systems across the country, the government 
is undertaking a national review. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
