    </p><a name="Para335334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This month the council approved a pilot project for local biodiesel production that involves an Owen Sound processor and a group of area canola farmers led by Meaford farmer Brian Wiley. County highways chief Gary Shaw will use locally produced biodiesel fuel in the fleet, which will be provided by local producer Greg Lougheed of Lougheed fuels. The company's is the first 100% biodiesel filling station in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that Gary Shaw and the County of Grey have been leaders in environmental issues. In 1991, the County of Grey, under the direction of Mr. Shaw, was the very first to use recycled tires to pave roads.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is doing its part for the environment with the clean air act and Gary Shaw and the County of Grey are doing their part. Together we will improve our environment.</div>

They were killed simply because they were women. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335338"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 2006 report from Statistics Canada entitled “Women in Canada 2006” states that common assaults make up the largest share of violent offences committed against women. In 2004, 53% of all women who were victims of violent offences were victims of a common assault, while the rest were victims of sexual assault, assault with a weapon causing bodily harm, criminal harassment and robbery. Women are considerably more likely than men to be victims of violent crimes and six times more likely to be victims of sexual assault.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year women in Canada should be celebrating the 25th anniversary of Canada's ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, but they are not celebrating. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has made alarming changes to Status of Women Canada, including a 40% cut to its operating budget. It has also removed the word “equality” and changed the funding rules to ban all domestic advocacy and lobbying.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women in my province will be negatively impacted by these changes. For example, the Status of Women council's multi-phase research project to alleviate poverty will no longer qualify under the new funding regime. The voices of equality-seeking women's groups that work to improve our collective quality of life will now be weakened.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the United Nations Population Fund, “Gender-based violence is perhaps the most widespread and socially tolerated of human rights violations”. Such violence affects the lives of millions of women and girls and, as one writer in <i>Livre noir de la condition féminine</i> or <i>The Black Book of Women’s Condition</i>, states, “Women are always the first victims of bullying, insecurity, conjugal violence, prostitution, criminality, unemployment and sexism”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will continue to work to eliminate all forms of violence against women, because freeing women from violence means a more civilized world.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past weekend, we heard a lot of platitudes from the Liberals about renewal. Sadly, it was nothing but a sham. We just need to look at who was elected as the new Liberal Party president, an unelected, unaccountable senator.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Canadians have a long memory. They remember the Liberal brown envelopes of cash being passed around. They remember that David Dingwall was entitled to his entitlements. They also remember Alfonso Gagliano's legacy of corruption at Public Works.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Leader of the Opposition needs to tell Canadians why he is allowing his unelected Liberal senators to block the accountability act. Unlike the Liberals, it is this Conservative government that is rebuilding the public's trust day in and day out, and that is real leadership.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, a majority of the members decided to approve a law to define marriage for civil purposes as the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others. That decision by the House had the effect of replacing the traditional definition of marriage as being the lawful union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. In short, Parliament decided that the definition of marriage should include same sex couples. </div>

    </p><a name="Para335661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since marriage is an essential foundation of our society, it is important that a fully democratic decision be taken by the House of Commons whether the institution of marriage should be changed.

</div>
    </p><a name="Para335663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By presenting today's motion for a debate and a vote in the House, the government is fulfilling the commitment we made to Canadians in the last election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the meaning of today's motion and its implications.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion itself will not change the definition of marriage. Rather, the motion asks members whether they want to reopen the debate on the definition of marriage. If the House decides to adopt this motion, the government will introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage for civil purposes. In other words, the government will present to the House a bill defining marriage as the lawful union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. It would then be up to the House to debate such a bill and to vote on whether the bill should be enacted in July.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, those who argue that the traditional definition of marriage is an essential social institution that ought to be restored and protected should vote in favour of this motion. Similarly, members who believe that there are other ways to recognize same sex unions without altering the principle tenets of one's beliefs should vote for the motion as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking personally, I support the institution of marriage as it has been comprised for centuries in our society. It is one of the basic institutions of our society and is the foundation upon which we have built our culture. This is the position I took in the previous Parliament during the debate on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> and it is the position I continue to hold.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support protecting the rights of minorities that does not mean we should alter the institution of marriage which has worked well and has been an essential part of our society for so many years. I will therefore be voting in favour of the motion as a means to restore the traditional definition of marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are debating a government motion, I point out that the government has indicated that members can vote according to their conscience. Given the deeply held views that members have on both sides of the debate, the government believes it should be up to the House to decide in a truly free vote on whether we should initiate legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote on today's motion will be a truly free vote for all members of the government's caucus, including ministers of the Crown. Unlike the previous government, our cabinet will not be whipped into voting one way or the other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105837,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105837&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister for Democratic Reform</A>, I am proud to be a member of a government that believes issues which touch on deeply felt personal beliefs should be decided by a truly free vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that members on both sides of the debate hold deeply felt personal views on this subject, we are asking members to reflect on their views and those of their constituents before deciding how to vote.

He made a lot about it being a free vote, even for his cabinet ministers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember an important motion that was put in the House not very long ago, but there was no free vote for his cabinet. A cabinet minister had to resign because he would not support it. In my mind it is the responsibility of the government, if it does not agree with the laws of the nation, to bring forward differing laws and to put a bill before the House. Then cabinet solidarity is always asked for on those bills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is disingenuous to say that there is a free vote when there is no bill. It is simply a motion before the House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the previous government brought it before the House, it did it in an honest and forthright way in the form of a bill and the parliamentary tradition of cabinet solidarity was kept at that time. I believe he is putting forward false premise to the public of Canada.</div>

I suppose in his position he wants to change the channel any way he can.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that matter came before Parliament, I was very disappointed, as I am sure many Canadians were, by the position taken by the former government. This is an issue that is deeply felt. It strikes to the very being of many Canadians and what they believe is important or the way society should be structured.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, when it became apparent that the government would whip its cabinet ministers, and I believe its parliamentary secretaries as well, they all seemed to support it. However, when I saw that one of my colleagues in the Liberal cabinet had to resign, I felt very badly for him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on an issue like this, that touches people so deeply, they should have a free vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not discouraged. A couple of days ago, the new Leader of the Opposition said, among other things, that the same sex marriage vote was a matter of fundamental rights and, therefore, he would whip his caucus. I guess that is one of the great things about debate. It looks like we are starting to get a bit of a consensus because I now heard now that they would have a free vote. It seems to me that even the members of his own party are coming to the same conclusion and they are drawing closer to what the government has been saying all along.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am proud to be a part of a party and a part of a cabinet that allows, on a subject like this, a true free vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it was a shame that was not the case back in July 2005. However, there is no reason now why that member cannot get up and support this. When the vote comes tomorrow, at about 3:00, I hope he stands up for what I believe he believes.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he agree that this is basically an issue of rights and that the Supreme Court has ruled that it is not acceptable for a Parliament to deny same-sex couples access to marriage?</div>
    </p><a name="Para335688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if one of his loved ones, his daughter, for example, came home one day and announced that she was homosexual? Would he not want his child to grow and develop in the most gay-tolerant society possible?</div>
    </p><a name="Para335689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we, as parliamentarians, are questioning decisions that strike a balance on what the Supreme Court has stated is a rights issue, then does he agree that his government is not up to the task of acting with the generosity and tolerance people have a right to expect from those who have the responsibility to govern? </div>
    </p><a name="Para335690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I invite him to really think about this. If one of his loved ones, his son or daughter, his nephew or niece, came to see him one day and he found out that person was homosexual, would he not be glad to be living in a more tolerant society? Does he not agree that parliamentarians are responsible for leading the way on this issue?</div>

    </p><a name="Para335692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indicated that the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on this and that it was conclusive on this issue. That is absolutely wrong. The Supreme Court of Canada specifically did not make a ruling on this issue. There were lower court rulings with respect to this, but it was not the Supreme Court of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge members and the hon. member is not the only one apparently under this misperception. I was watching television early this morning and one of the commentators said that this has been ruled conclusively on by the Supreme Court of Canada. That is absolutely incorrect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give those members a task that I know would be impossible to complete. They cannot table the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that is definitive on this issue. They cannot do this because it does not exist.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made this point one other time and it was said that there was a decision in one of the provincial courts or a number of provincial courts. I understand that. There have been court decisions on this, but the Supreme Court of Canada is the final court of appeal in this country and there is in fact no definitive decision.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member on another occasion will tell us how much he is against closure and so on, but his party joined with the government at that time to force this measure through by time allocation. I mentioned the fact that this was passed in July, however, we do not sit in July, but because of this so-called emergency to change the definition of marriage, that has been around for about 2,000 years at least, his party and the government wanted Parliament to sit through to the beginning of the summer break.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I throw that back to him. Why would they agree to closure? What was the crisis that we had to change it? It certainly was not, as I pointed out, the Supreme Court of Canada.</div>

I would ask the House leader this question. If this motion is defeated, would the government undertake to introduce legislation in this House to reinstate the traditional definition of marriage? It has the authority and the ability to do it. Will the government introduce a bill?</div>

    </p><a name="Para335710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say the privilege because I was proud to participate in that debate. It was a serious debate, as the hon. House leader has suggested. While it was an emotional debate, members treated one another with respect, even those who disagreed with one another profoundly on religious grounds or in other ways. In many ways, the debate in the House last time was Parliament at its best.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para335711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will always remember, for example, how the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78493,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78493&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</A> put it, as repeated today by the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A>: “—the religion of some should not become the law for others”. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para335712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I listened to the House leader today, I respectfully suggest to the House leader that this motion is different. This is an underhanded political manoeuvre. Is the House leader proud of the headline of the <i>Globe and Mail</i> editorial this morning? “[<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>]'s shoddy motion” is what the <i>Globe and Mail</i> editorial called what we are being asked to debate today in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government does not even want a real debate. It is not giving enough time. It has introduced the idea of civil unions, which as it knows is exclusively a provincial matter. It is a smokescreen. It says it is not trying to re-establish the very inequality that was struck down by our courts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wascana</A> has pointed out, this is purely a procedural motion. It is a debate about whether ultimately we should have a debate. If the government wanted to take this matter seriously, it would have introduced legislation, but it knows the composition of this House and it knows such legislation would never be passed by this House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, it resorted to a manoeuvre that takes us nowhere. It is not designed to take us anywhere. It is designed to divide the House, to divide the members of the House, and divide the Canadian population on an issue that has been settled. It is designed to divide our nation on an issue that a majority of Canadians wish to move on from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the House knows that the courts have upheld this across the country, including the Supreme Court of Canada, eight provinces and territories. I will not name them, but I respectfully disagree with the hon. House leader. It is not true that the Supreme Court of Canada did not rule on this matter. The Supreme Court of Canada specifically said in its judgment that it would not, in any way, pronounce on the matter in a way that would overrule the findings of the lower courts, and those findings were conclusively in favour of overturning the prohibition against same sex marriage, as everybody knows. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I praise the government for saying it will not use the notwithstanding clause. I say to the hon. House leader that I hope that is an undertaking that the government is making, whether it is in opposition or in the future at any time, that it would never introduce such a bill by using this notwithstanding clause. However, without the notwithstanding clause, as everyone has pointed out, this same sex debate we are having today is, in the words of the columnists and the editorial writers such as Jeffrey Simpson of The <i>Globe and Mail</i>, “a meaningless charade”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that said, let us take up the challenge. Let us remind ourselves of why we voted as we did the last time. Let us remind ourselves of our charter. Let us remind ourselves of the debates that we had in this House when we first introduced changes to the Criminal Code to protect gay and lesbian couples from being attacked on our streets, when we introduced the human rights code changes which ensured there would not be discrimination, and when we went on to ensure that people could get their pension rights and be treated equally if they had the same status as heterosexual couples that had civil unions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we saw throughout the country and through this House was a movement. We saw an evolving sense of our human rights and it came from our constituents as well, not just gay and lesbian constituents but from straight constituents, from all races and all religions. They came to us and came to a conclusion that society was enriched ultimately by treating all citizens equally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember years ago learning that a certain newspaper in Toronto, which I would not describe as a left-wing newspaper, had a policy that it would pay equal amounts to people who had same sex unions because it wanted to attract the best possible employees. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just about equality. This is about creating a society which will be a richer society when everybody can participate in it and feel equal in it.</div>

It is the same question just asked by our colleague in the NDP. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister </A>and his hon. members, who do not seem to understand the realities of the modern world in which we live, should go and take part in the gay pride parade in my city of Toronto, or elsewhere in the country. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To their great surprise, they would find grandmothers and children of all ethnic groups and representatives of multicultural organizations from all over participating enthusiastically. Why do they do this? They are taking part in something that celebrates our humanity, tolerance, respect for other people and ability to understand one another. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some members of this House think that same sex marriage spells the end of society as we know it, that it shakes society to its core. I say to these hon. members that they should ask the Canadians who take their children to gay pride parades and deliberately put them in contact with this modern reality what they think of this celebration of our common humanity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been a parliamentarian for many years and have followed all the debates about recognizing the rights of gays and lesbians, including amendments to the Criminal Code, to the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2304866,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2304866&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-23</A>, which gave equal rights to common-law spouses and entitled them to pensions. Some participants in these debates painted the most apocalyptic scenarios for our society, our children and the institution of marriage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far removed from all dogma, I believe personally that we should follow this debate with humanity and compassion, animated by a spirit of openness, inclusion and respect and with tremendous confidence in humanity’s ability to make changes to society out of deep respect for our differences. We should ponder the lessons of history. The same fears, the same dire scenarios were conjured up when interracial marriages were allowed in the United States or the Divorce Act was passed in Canada not so very long ago. We all remember that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our country’s history clearly shows that in the face of profound sociological change, Parliament has often crystallized the irreversible changes already seen in society, but has never jumped the gun. Parliament has always been able to adapt to deep-seated new movements in our society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will therefore in all humility as a parliamentarian and legislator be guided by the wisdom, tolerance and confidence expressed by our forefathers and foremothers who said yes to social progress and no to all the apocalyptic scenarios conjured up. I can only humble encourage all my parliamentary colleagues to do the same and recognize not only this reality but also the fact that Canadians accept it. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many others have spoken in the same vein saying that their identity as Quebeckers and their identity as Canadians are perfectly in harmony. We should ask ourselves whether after tomorrow's vote the gay and lesbian communities will be able to say the same? Will they say that their personal identity and their national identity are compatible and even complementary? Will they be proud to be both and proud to play a role in our society? If they feel anything less than that and less than their fellow citizens, I believe we will have failed our constituents, our country and future generations of Canadians who are asking us to continue to create this country as a place where we live with one another in respect and tolerance and show a light to the rest of the world which will enable them and us to move on to other issues of importance and move away from the traditional, I say hatreds, the traditional fears of the past. Let us move on from the past and let us move to the future in a way that is Canadian and in a way that is respectful to our charter and of our fellow citizens.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have met with members of the first nations communities, certainly in my own riding and in others, that have told me that they totally support this change and that some members of the first nations communities wish to move on as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first reaction to the hon. member's question on the issue of marriage on reserve, with off reserve, obviously, being another subject, is that it be governed by the federal law of the land because it is federal law that governs reserves and, under the Constitution, it is clearly a federal matter. I assume that what we do in this House will govern what takes place on reserves. If the hon. member consults with members of first nations he will find that they too are searching for a way that we can move into the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if I can help the hon. member with this answer, I met with some members of the first nations of Ontario who told me that they are seeking to develop laws for relationships on their reserves and are including a change to their own proposal that will specifically recognize same sex relationships. The first nations communities are moving on with this and I would suggest that we follow their example and move on with it in this House.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member mentioned his church. In my last speech in the House I mentioned that I am a member of the Anglican Church. My church has a very active debate going on about whether or not, from a religious perspective, my church would participate in such marriages. I know that other churches, like the United Church, have said that they will perform such marriages. We know that within religious groups in our country there are differing views.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would respectfully suggest to the hon. member, as was suggested in the question by his colleague, that predictions that this would be a threat to traditional marriage have not turned out to be right. The divorce rates in this country among heterosexual couples are not related to the fact that we have allowed gay and lesbian marriages. Anyone who would pretend otherwise would be absolutely crazy, any more than it can be claimed that the alarming divorce rates, some would say, are a direct result of the fact that we have recognized common-law relationships over the years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same people came to committee and said that this would do to traditional marriage what common-law relationships would do and I suggest one cannot draw that link. It is just not there.</div>

I am wondering how the hon. member can suggest that we are not allowing enough time for debate on this issue when he and his party, as well as all other parties in this place, agreed on the format and time limits for debate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are many Canadians watching this, as well as many members of the media. I do not want them to be confused on the timing of this debate and the length of time that we are dealing with this issue. Perhaps my hon. colleague could confirm that his party, along with all others, agreed to the House order that had this debate concluding at midnight tonight.</div>

It is a motion to have a debate about a debate. Of course everybody agreed that we could not take up an enormous amount of House time around that issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My original point stands. If the government had been serious about this, had really wanted to get rid of it completely and had brought in a clear law that would change the definition now established by our courts and our law, it would have given an opportunity to the House to have a debate and to actually turn it down. However, the government did not want to take that risky course. It tried to use this subterfuge instead, which is why we are in this rather unusual grey zone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I am saying to the government spokespeople is that we agree here in the House that this is it. When we have the vote tomorrow, we will live with the consequences of it and it does not come back at us. That is the point we must all understand.</div>

House leader when he made the point that the Supreme Court of Canada had not ruled. </div>
    </p><a name="Para332330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Supreme Court of Canada said in its advisory opinion was that this matter had been ruled on by eight provincial Courts of Appeal and that they had no intention in any way of suggesting that their judgment would interrupt the rights that had been conferred on Canadians by those judgments, thereby clearly saying that they agreed with those judgments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para332331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, totally disagree with the interpretation that was made by the hon. House leader, which takes us to the nub of the question asked by the hon. member. One hundred and fifty-five jurists have told us that no government could introduce any bill purporting what the government is talking about in this motion without accompanying it with the notwithstanding clause because the Supreme Court was clear in its ruling. Eight provincial Courts of Appeal and territorial judgments have been clear that we cannot possibly overrule the rights that have been conferred upon Canadians and are expressly now interpreted as being in the charter without employing the notwithstanding clause.</div>
    </p><a name="Para332332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that the government has rightly said that it will not apply the notwithstanding clause. I applaud it for that and I would assume it will stick to that. When it does, it must recognize that this motion is something that we are debating in a purely theoretical sense because it could not possibly come to fruition without such a draconian measure. In no way would it be justified to take away the rights of Canadians and use the notwithstanding clause in our charter. It was not designed for that purpose. It was not in any way designed to be used in such a matter as this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para332333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally agree with the thrust of the hon. member's question.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite unbelievable that we have been discussing these questions certainly since 1994 and even after a decision by the Supreme Court, after a vote in this House and after eight courts at various levels of jurisdiction, including of course the Supreme Court, have rendered their verdicts. It must be remembered that three appeal courts—British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario—and four other different courts in Canada have affirmed that the denial to gays and lesbians of free access to the institution of marriage constitutes a violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; that it is incompatible with section 15, which provides for equal treatment for all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not surprising that the Conservative government has chosen to reopen this debate. There is no doubt that Conservative members, as individuals, are respectable people and that they can even be quite endearing. Nevertheless, we know that, collectively, they are people who throughout their history, as long as they have been in this House, have practised an institutional policy of homophobia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homophobia does not consist solely in gay bashing or threatening gays. Homophobia is also the systematic and organized denial of rights to homosexuals. The Conservatives have always taken a hostile approach to gays and lesbians. I believe our fellow citizens should know that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not say that someone is a homophobe if he or she is not in favour of access to marriage. I know people who are rather ill at ease with that. </div>

I think that he will because he is a courageous man, but I am curious to see which way he will vote tonight. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to recall all the votes that the Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance have recorded; all the votes that they cast to collectively deny rights in matters of labour relations, hate crimes, collective agreements or on the subject of surrogate mothers in connection with new reproductive technologies or again in terms of the Criminal Code. In a systematic manner, the Conservatives have told our fellow Canadians that they do not recognize persons of homosexual orientation as citizens. It is unbelievable. It is unbelievable that a political party could act in such a way in a democracy such as Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995, I tabled a motion calling on the government to take the necessary measures to legally recognize same sex spouses. All the Conservatives—who at that time were members of the Progressive Conservative party—voted against that motion. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, in 1995, Allan Rock tabled Bill C-41 to reform sentencing, specifically, section 718, which recognizes certain aggravating circumstances when crimes are committed. The gay community mobilized in favour of anti-hate, anti-racist legislation. The government wanted to include beating someone up because of their sexual orientation as an aggravating circumstance in the Criminal Code. They voted against it. Can you imagine that? We were in a situation where people were being beaten up. In Ottawa, some people had been thrown off a bridge. Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against the addition to the Criminal Code of provisions respecting hate crimes, and they voted unanimously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1996, further to a court decision, moreover, Bill C-33, amending the Canadian Human Rights Act, proposed the addition of sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination. The Conservatives did not want sexual orientation to be recognized as a prohibited ground of discrimination. We were a long way from the question of marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I repeat, every time they have had the opportunity, the Conservatives, almost unanimously, have behaved like institutional homophobes. This alone makes them quite unfit and unworthy of forming a respectable government respected by our fellow citizens. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conservatives voted against the addition in collective agreements of rights for gays and lesbians. In 68 laws, they voted against the recognition of common-law spouses and therefore homosexual common-law spouses. They voted against the bill by our former colleague for Burnaby—Douglas, a riding now brilliantly represented by his NDP successor. They voted against the provisions concerning hate propaganda. Of course they voted against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> almost unanimously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what message is it sending? What message does it send when a government says that, whatever the circumstances, whether we are talking about education, the Criminal Code, labour relations, emotional relations or hate propaganda, it will never respect the rights of one category of citizens? What they said is that the simple fact of feeling sexual desire that is different from that of the majority makes us less entitled. That is what the Conservatives have said throughout their history. That is what is quite incredible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine what that means for someone who is 14, 15 or 16 years old and discovers that he or she is homosexual. No later than last year, we were reminded that 30% of young people who are homosexual still put an end to their lives. They commit suicide. Is it not our responsibility as parliamentarians to do something about that? This is not about promoting conversion therapies. This is not about telling heterosexuals that they should undertake to become homosexuals. That is not what we are talking about. We are speaking to our homosexual citizens. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can argue about whether it is hereditary or whether it is acquired behaviour. There is literature on this. Opinions may vary. One thing is sure, though, and that is that I will never have any respect for people who rise in the House and say that just because a man is gay or a woman is a lesbian, they do not have the same rights. That is the essence of the debate. When we are seated in Parliament, the only value that should motivate us is the right to equality. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no state religion in Canada, regardless of what people might say or think. It is not because people belong to a certain religion that they can deny the rights of other citizens. That was the judgment handed down by the Supreme Court. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous government made use of its prerogative under section 53 of the Supreme Court Act to ask the court to provide answers to certain questions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first question was whether marriage and particularly civil marriage as defined in clause 1 of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> was a federal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court said yes. I respectfully admit to my hon. colleagues, of course, that a person does not need a doctorate in law to know that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question was whether freedom of religion could give various religious denominations a right not to perform a religious marriage. The Supreme Court explained, with the supporting jurisprudence, that neither Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> nor the existing Charter of Rights and Freedoms obliged anyone, any member of the clergy, to perform a religious marriage, regardless of their religious denomination. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not want to live in a society where, because of my religious convictions, I was obliged to do things that are contrary to the tenets of my own faith. It is entirely reasonable, desirable and fortunate that the Supreme Court answered that the Charter or Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> would never oblige members of the clergy to perform marriages against their will. The Supreme Court said this, and obviously that had been confirmed by a number of expert witnesses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must remember that in 2002, the Standing Committee on Justice held hearings across Canada. We heard 467 witnesses. Obviously there were witnesses who had some expertise. It was explained to us, over and over again, that despite what was being said by the official opposition of that time and also by certain ministers, freedom of religion would never require that there be an obligation to perform marriages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Progressive Conservative Party has a record of bad faith. There is a desire to deny rights, and to sow the seeds of dissension and division. That is the purpose of the motion. Let us look at the dishonesty of the motion. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us talk about civil unions. Eight provinces, including Quebec, have enacted various legislation that has recognized various types of unions between persons of the same sex. This may take the form of civil unions or registered partnerships, but all of the existing legislation has two characteristics. It is never a religious marriage. It is therefore not marriage. People sometimes told us that civil union is marriage. Civil union is close to marriage, in terms of the rights protected. Most of the provinces have granted the same rights in respect of inheritance, access to health care and pension rights. Granted, the provinces that have legislated in relation to this have given the same rights to common law spouses, whether they are heterosexual or homosexual.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But can we understand why people want to get married? This is where what the Conservatives are saying is totally incoherent. If the institution of marriage is an institution that should be celebrated for heterosexuals, surely it should be celebrated for homosexuals. It is not true that the sole purpose of marriage is procreation. Otherwise, just like that, we would be saying that all of our fellow citizens who do not have children will be excluded and disqualified. There are people who want to get married, people who have been married for years and other people who will get married in the future, who will not have children. That is entirely their right. It takes nothing away from the legitimacy of their union.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that parenting skills have nothing to do with sexual desire. That has been documented for a number of years. How can we think that the way that an individual decides to express himself or herself sexually could qualify him or her to be a good or bad parent? If that is the case, there would never be any homosexuals in our society. In my case, my parents were heterosexuals. I was reared in a heterosexual family and I have a very heterosexual twin brother, not polygamous, but very heterosexual. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely you will understand that homosexuality is not something that is transmitted within a family. One thing is certain, however, and I will say this again, I firmly believe that when we are sitting in Parliament, we may not get up and tell people that they have fewer rights because they are different sexually. That is what the Conservatives want to do. The reference in the motion to civil unions is not appropriate, because the federal government has no responsibility for that. It is under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments and there are eight provinces that have legislated in that regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at what it says a little further on in the motion. In order to get the support of other parties, it says that not only should the government introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions, which do not have anything to do with marriage and do not concern the federal government, it adds: “while respecting existing … marriages”. Forgive me for saying it, but it would be pretty unbelievable if anyone thought we had the power as legislators to say that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know how many people got married in Canada? In November, there were precisely 12,438 people who got married. Obviously we cannot tell them to end their union. The first principle is that a law is never retroactive. We cannot say that to the 12,438 people who got married. There are some in all the provinces, even in very conservative Alberta where 409 people got married. I do not think that there were many Conservatives invited to the weddings of those 409 people. So there are some in every province, and it is pretty dishonest and pretty misleading to include in a motion that someone even thinks that they are not going to undo the unions of people who are married.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I repeat, I think that it is not to the government’s credit to reopen the file on same sex marriage. In my opinion, once and for all, we must say that as parliamentarians we believe in the most complete equality among people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time there is talk of making some social advances, I am sure that our elders will recall how some people behaved when the question of legalizing divorce came up. It used to be that getting divorced involved private legislative initiatives and was more a matter of Senate responsibility. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am convinced that people will remember how the most conservative minds reacted when the subject of establishing a lottery system arose. I am convinced that people will remember how the most conservative elements in our society behaved when there was talk of the equality of women. Seventy-five years ago, women were not even recognized as legal persons. Women had no standing in court and could not run for office. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, all these changes were made in the name of the ideals of tolerance, equality and generosity and we are all the better for them. In my opinion, the best thing that can happen in life is to fall in love because it is when we love that we desire to do things for our community. To deny individuals the right to be in love is quite shameful and I hope our citizens will remember that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former minister Martin Cauchon published a book that offered a number of options. As soon as this former minister submitted this book, there were consultations in parliamentary committee. There were some in Ottawa and in major cities: 467 witnesses came to talk about this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate has monopolized a lot of energy and taken a lot of time. It is important for us to spend time and energy on this because the concept of marriage reflects religious conviction, ethical conviction, personal conviction and public conviction. It is important to take our time in addressing these factors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the matter has been closed by the Supreme Court, eight courts, parliamentarians and a debate that has been going on since 2002, it is safe to close the debate once and for all in the name of equality. The ideal of equality should be our primary motivator when we are standing in any parliament.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand the government's stubborn determination to cause division. In fact, I do understand it. The Conservatives are doing this for their electoral base, for ideological reasons, but fortunately, our constituents, our fellow citizens, will not go down this path with them. Their past behaviour is a discredit to them if they are thinking of forming a majority government one day.</div>

The government has a responsibility, if it sees that the laws of the country need changing, to present bills to Parliament. We debate those bills, as we did in the case of civil marriage. We hear from witnesses in committee, we come to a decision and, finally, we enact the law. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government’s motives are motives of division and dissent. Legally, it is clearly to respond to an electoral base.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we held hearings in 2002, and more recently on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A>, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops came out against same-sex marriage.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the summer of 2005 in a restaurant in Stanley Park, also in Vancouver, a lesbian couple from Baltimore, Maryland in the United States stood with a marriage commissioner and made promises to each other. This couple knew no one in Vancouver but had gone there to be married because that possibility did not exist for them back home. They asked two women who happened to be having lunch in the restaurant, also as it turns out visitors from the United States, to be their witnesses. The women agreed. The brief civil service took place in the garden. When the marriage commissioner pronounced them married and they kissed for the first time as married spouses, everyone in the restaurant stood and applauded. Total strangers, randomly selected, stood and applauded this couple's making solemn, joyous promises to each other. A line formed of restaurant patrons to congratulate these strangers, this newly married couple.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A table of folks from rural Alberta had taken photos and offered an email address so they could be delivered. An elderly woman, moving slowly with a cane, waited and gave them huge warm hugs and a blessing. The American witnesses were deeply moved. That such a scene was possible in a public place made them believe that Canada was in a very real sense the promised land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel lucky to have been present when Scott and Éric were married. I am very moved by the eloquence and poetry of Anne and Laura's vows. I am also so deeply moved by the story of the marriage of the women from Baltimore in the restaurant garden and so proud of my citizens for their spontaneous outpouring of support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, these promises, these stories are what this debate is all about. It is about gay and lesbian couples making promises to each other, promises on the one hand that are not unusual because they are the same as couples have made to each other in marriage for years and years. But they are promises that are also very special because gay and lesbian couples have had to fight for the exact same right to make them in public that our heterosexual brothers and sisters have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are promises that provide a firm foundation for life-affirming relationships. They provide a firm foundation for families. These promises make our communities stronger by expanding the circle of intimate, justice seeking, loving relationships. These promises give security, security to couples, security to the children of these partnerships, security to our families and our communities. These promises lead to serious legal obligations and responsibilities that are willingly and enthusiastically engaged.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building relationships, founding families, expanding intimacy in the pursuit of justice and love, providing security, assuming responsibility: all these are foundations of a strong society, all values that contribute to a strong society, all defining aspects of the institution of marriage in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve thousand five hundred couples, 25,000 individuals, have made the same kind of commitment in Canada since marriage became possible for gay and lesbian couples. These marriages were performed by clergypersons and by secular marriage commissioners, all of whom were licensed to solemnize marriages by their provincial governments and given the civil authority to legally marry couples as defined now by the federal Civil Marriage Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These couples who chose to be married are not people who want to change the institution of marriage, but instead are people who only seek to be included in this institution, because they believe in the values that it represents and that it supports. They are people who have been raised in families and communities that hold marriage in high regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands more in Canada have stood with these couples as members of wedding parties, best men and maids of honour, as members of congregations, as family members and as witnesses. In doing so, we have pledged our support for these couples. We have witnessed their love and commitment and pledged to honour and respect those relationships. We have agreed to be part of their families.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700">(1700)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para335858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage is stronger in Canada for these thousands of commitments by gay and lesbian couples and by their witnesses. Often we have left these marriage ceremonies inspired with new respect for this institution. In so many ways, gay and lesbian couples are true marriage evangelicals in Canada. They are the people fervently advocating for this institution, an institution that has faced many challenges in recent decades. I believe that gay and lesbian couples who marry have breathed new life into this venerable institution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a very fundamental level, the marriage law was about equality for gay and lesbian Canadians. It was about our basic human rights, whether we choose to be married or not. This fact was clearly recognized in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities, even in quarters that have questions about the institution. It was about full citizenship, about clearly stating that all Canadian institutions were open to all Canadian citizens, including civil marriage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335860"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As gay and lesbian Canadians, we recognized, whether or not we sought to be married ourselves, that it was not acceptable to be told that we could not walk through the front door of a key institution of our society. We also recognized that a lesser recognition of our relationships, such as civil union, cheapened our citizenship and made us less than full citizens. Entering a key institution of our society by a side or back door or creating a separate institution to recognize our relationships is not equality and not full citizenship.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also knows that it has no jurisdiction to create a civil union possibility, so that suggestion in its motion is misleading at best. The jurisdiction for such a step lies with the provinces, and the provinces have shown no interest in such a possibility since the passage of the Civil Marriage Act and since the court decisions that preceded it and which established the right for gay and lesbian couples to marry in almost every province in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was great care paid to ensuring freedom of religion in the law that was passed. No priest, rabbi or minister will be forced to marry a couple against their will. No religious institution will be forced to perform a marriage that is against its beliefs, theology or practice. Indeed, since the law was changed, none have, and none will be. This is not new, in the same way that no divorced couple could sue or has tried and least of all succeeded to sue a church for a marriage if that was against the theology, belief or practice of that church. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to change the law now to remove the ability of gay and lesbian couples to marry will also remove the right of those churches, synagogues and temples which, on the basis of deeply held religious convictions, have decided to marry gay and lesbian couples. In many ways, the religious freedom shoe is now on the other foot. To truly protect religious freedom in Canada, we must protect the provisions of the Civil Marriage Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been said that somehow the debate on the Civil Marriage Act was deficient. As someone who was part of that debate in the last Parliament, I want to take serious issue with that position. No issue was more fully debated in the last Parliament. Hours and days of debate were held at every stage of the bill. A special legislative committee held extensive hearings and heard from dozens of witnesses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in addition to the numerous court challenges in the provinces and territories, Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Yukon, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and in the former government's reference to the Supreme Court and that court's decisions. As well, in the 37th Parliament, the Standing Committee on Justice held cross-country hearings on the matter, hearing from 467 witnesses. There have been multiple court decisions and multiple votes in the House. Hundreds of witnesses have testified and there have been hundreds of hours of debate. Due diligence was done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue has been thoroughly debated in political parties. The NDP, for its part, has been very clear on its unconditional support for the right of gay and lesbian Canadians to marry. Other parties have had significant debates. The matter has been debated in churches, temples and synagogues, in families, classrooms and bars, and on the shop floor, and it is clear that a majority of Canadians do not now want to see a change in the current law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-two years ago as a young gay man, I marvelled at the bravery of Richard North and Chris Vogel, a gay couple in Winnipeg, as they attempted to obtain a marriage licence. They did not succeed, but their relationship, their marriage, was subsequently celebrated by a Unitarian church congregation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I could not imagine doing what they had done. I could not imagine living in a society where my relationships would be respected and honoured, where I could pursue a lifelong commitment to another man whom I loved and who loved me. I thought my relationships would always face imposed limitations and therefore be less than those of my parents and grandparents.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705">(1705)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para335869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to brave couples like Richard and Chris, thanks to their example, their role modelling and their risk taking, new possibilities were opened up for me and for thousands of gay and lesbian Canadians like me. More recently, many other brave gay and lesbian couples put their relationships on the line, pursuing and ultimately securing justice in the courts and here in Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Éric and Scott, Laura and Anne, the women from Baltimore, and thousands of others have shown us that there is something of great value in the institution of marriage. They have shown us that inclusion in the institution of marriage is worth fighting for. They have demonstrated love, commitment and responsibility. These are the true traditions of marriage in Canada. These are values that truly define marriage in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all that, there is no reason to again debate marriage, no need to change the law, no need for a separate institution for gay and lesbian couples, and no need to limit access to marriage for gay and lesbian couples in the future. Instead, there is real reason to celebrate, to celebrate love, right relationships, commitment, the pursuit of justice, responsibility, and the building of relationships, families and communities, and to celebrate equality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witness of gay and lesbian married couples, the family, friends and co-workers who support them, and the Civil Marriage Act make that celebration possible. That is why New Democrats in the House will be voting against the Conservative government motion.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion that now is before the House seems to be a little different than the apparent promise during the election campaign, which was simply to open the debate. I do not know who decided that was going to be the promise and what in fact it entailed. Even today in the speech of the House leader of the government, he relayed to the House and to the public that the motion before us was simply to open the debate. That is clearly not the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue really has to do with whether or not this motion is calling on Parliament to ask the government to introduce legislation in a legislative process that in fact is unconstitutional.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have for the member is whether he could affirm to the House his understanding of the Supreme Court decision on the reference to the Supreme Court. My understanding is that the Ontario Court of Appeal said that denying same sex marriage was against the charter, that it was a violation of the equality provisions of the charter. That decision was followed by a number of provincial decisions. The Supreme Court itself ruled that it would not overturn those decisions, i.e. it effectively made it a violation of the charter and in fact unconstitutional.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that no legislation could be introduced and not be unconstitutional. I wonder if that is the member's position.</div>

I believe that there is no way to legislatively overturn gay and lesbian people's access to marriage in Canada now. I believe that it would take the application of the notwithstanding clause of the Constitution and I do not believe that even this government is prepared to use that kind of sledgehammer to attack human rights in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with him as well that this is a flawed motion. The reference about civil marriage in this motion is completely out of place, I believe, because it is very clear that civil unions are in the jurisdiction of the provinces. It is very clear that the federal government has no ability to legislate or introduce any kind of civil union regime that would have any bearing on this debate before us or any bearing on our jurisdiction as federal members of Parliament.</div>

    </p><a name="Para332464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the only thing we have seen since the passage of the Civil Marriage Act and since the court decisions is that more couples who strongly believe in the institution of marriage, who believe in the values and traditions of marriage, who believe in the commitment that marriage involves, have been able to take on those responsibilities and those commitments. They have been able to stand before their friends, families, colleagues and communities and make commitments and promises to each other. I think that should fill us all with joy and happiness. I think it is something to celebrate. I think it has been celebrated across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para332465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 12,500 gay and lesbian couples have made that kind of commitment and those kinds of promises since the laws began to change in Canada, and if they invited people to those ceremonies--and we all invite people to weddings--then thousands if not millions of other Canadians have participated in witnessing those commitments, in standing up to support those couples, and in saying that they are going to respect their relationships and nurture those relationships. Those witnesses stand in pride with them to say that this contributes to building families and contributes to our communities. I think that is a very positive thing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only observations we can make in light of the change in the law and in light of the court decisions are positive ones that will benefit our society, that will benefit our families and that will benefit the institution of marriage in the long run.</div>

It is very significant that we are talking about this and engaging in this debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not often look to someone in the media for support of a particular position I may have had, but there was an article this morning, an editorial piece in the <i>National Post</i> by Andrew Coyne, a person with whom I do not agree on any number of occasions. However, in terms of context and in terms of how this debate should proceed he framed it in a rational and civilized way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the first things I want to address. The basis for my position I have articulated in the House on a number of occasions. The last time was in March 2005. I proposed to my colleagues the religious framework for the position which I embrace, the Judeo-Christian construct which frames that discussion and it is there for people to read, March 23 or 25 of 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am not going to get into all of that tonight in the very short period of time that we have. I want to talk about the nature of the debate itself. I should add that the reference that I made to the <i>National Post</i> and the op-ed piece, is by somebody who says that they support a change in the definition of marriage. This is not someone with whom I agree on the position itself, but it is worth taking a look at in terms of framing the debate itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was disappointing, I must say in all honesty, to hear not that long ago, and not from the previous speaker but I believe from the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A> who took a very combative approach to this issue. Terminologies get thrown up, terms get tossed into this debate which really do not allow people to get into the real crux of the matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When somebody who supports the traditional definition of marriage as defined as the union between a man and a woman is called--and I have never plumbed the depths of the meaning of this word--homophobic or a “homophobe”, that does nothing to enhance the debate or encourage people to come forward or discuss it. Does that mean that somebody who wants to see the definition of marriage changed is a heterophobe? Of course not. That would be ridiculous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope that we can talk about the nature of the debate and the basic elements of the debate without it disintegrating into that kind of atmosphere. I think in most cases we have heard that so far and I hope we can keep it at that higher level.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever our opinion is of whether this is an issue of basic rights or a violation of rights, and obviously we are allowed our opinions on this, there is a fact that is clear. The Supreme Court has not declared that the definition of marriage, defined as the union between a man and a woman, is unconstitutional. It has not declared that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be someone's opinion that it has, and I reference the article in the <i>National Post</i> again this morning, not that the <i>National Post</i> is the be all and end all, but that has not been decided by the Supreme Court. It is certainly one's right to say that this is a violation of a human right, but it has not been decided by the Supreme Court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, on this question, the Supreme Court said that if there is going to be a change in the definition, Parliament should make that change. I applaud it for recognizing the purview and the jurisdiction of Parliament on that issue.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That particular member was stripped of all of her committee responsibilities. I participated on a live radio show with the leader of the NDP at about that time. He said, and we can get this out of Toronto, that he had ordered her to be quiet and he was pleased with her silence. If the hon. member does not think that is effectively de facto eliminating a member from what should be a democratic debate, he needs to take a good close look in the mirror. I am pleased that we are able to have the debate, at least with some parties, and to vote freely on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para332484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of religious freedom is also one that should be of importance to everybody, whether they claim to be people of faith or not. When we look at history in terms of the development of certain democratic freedoms, we will know that certain religious freedoms give rise to broader freedoms. The freedom to express oneself religiously is so basic to so many other freedoms that when I met with the Dalai Lama about two years ago, I asked that in his world tour promoting world peace, for which I congratulated him, that he encourage every world leader to allow freedom of religion within their jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para332485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, over half the world right now does not have freedom of religion because freedom of religion leads to freedom of speech, leads to freedom of association, leads to the freedom of expression, and the freedom to acquire property, to build mosques, temples or churches. It is basic to the freedoms we have. Anything that goes against that is very dangerous and has to be guarded jealously, again, whether a person claims to be a person of faith or not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para332486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised questions on this issue in 2005, questions which have not yet been answered, but I would take issue with some of the things that my colleague spoke on. He has greater faith, I would say, in the fact that religious institutions and religious discretion will not be diminished if there is a change, as there is, in the definition of marriage. I appreciate his faith, but I would say to myself, “O ye of little faith,” because that is not what is happening. </div>
    </p><a name="Para332487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we do know that there have been some cases where commissioners of marriage have been told they will be relieved of their duties if in fact they do not perform a marriage which is contrary to their faith, that being heterosexual marriage. That has already happened, so religious faith is being diminished there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para332488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen cases where religious institutions have faced rulings by the Human Rights Commission and incredible fines because they would not allow their property to be used for certain types of marriages. We have seen cases where individuals have expressed in newspapers, even letters to editors, their religious point of view on this issue and they have suffered severe penalties. Religious freedom is at risk here by those who do not truly understand the importance of allowing that to continue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para332489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will say in closing that I honour my parents. We have heard members speak about their parents. I honour my mother and my father, who recently passed away, for their demonstration of the importance of marriage, the importance of heterosexual marriage, and the realization that marriages are not perfect. Certainly, mine is not. My wife is, but I, personally, am not, However, the importance to maintain this institution as defined between a man and a woman is crucial.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to sponsor a bill originating in the Senate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to pay tribute to Senator Jean Lapointe who has worked all his life to improve people’s quality of life. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2404223,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2404223&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-211</A> will in fact improve people’s quality of life. Senator Lapointe has fought all his life to combat injustice. He had problems with alcohol himself and he overcame those difficulties. He has been particularly active in combating the appalling ravages of gambling. Bill S-211 is in fact a way to contain one of the most horrible plagues on our youth and on all our fellow Canadians. I am talking about video lottery terminals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are video lottery terminals in bars and in restaurants. We all have a family member, a friend or someone with a serious problem because of video lottery terminals. I was a minister in the past and I am now a member of Parliament. The role of a legislator is not merely to make speeches and answer questions. A legislator must play a meaningful role in the quality of people’s lives. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our role is precisely to make sure that we create an environment that makes it possible for our fellow citizens to have a decent quality of life. Every time we have an opportunity to do that, without managing their lives for them, we must give them guidance and an environment that will help them to prosper in society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a serious problem at present from which too many people and young people are suffering; it is called pathological gambling. The distress we see is serious. We have even heard of suicides. Video lottery terminals affect more than 90% of people who have a gambling problem. That is why this high rate of dependency must be contained. We must find a way, together, to make it possible for these people to have a better quality of life. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill amends the Criminal Code. It will give us a means to contain the ravages of something that, as I said earlier, causes countless problems for our fellow Canadians. This bill will not ban video lottery terminals, however. Whenever we try to ban something, we get into the whole question of organized crime and the black market. The purpose of this bill is to confine video lottery terminals to race courses, casinos and associated places like the Hippo Club, which are all managed, and managed only by the provincial governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could produce scores of statistics to show what a scourge compulsive gambling is and how it causes serious problems for Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his presentations on video lottery terminals, Dr. Robert Ladouceur, a psychologist at Université Laval and one of the leading researchers in the field of compulsive gambling, has stated that 95% of the people he treats for problems related to pathological gambling indicate that video lottery terminals are their preferred game of chance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Maison Claude Bilodeau, which opened in the fall of 1999 and is dedicated to helping compulsive gamblers, 94% of the requests it has received since its inception are specifically related to the use of video lottery terminals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report on gambling prepared by Harold Wynne from the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, 78% of individuals with gambling problems play video lottery terminals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friend, Senator Jean Lapointe, opened a treatment centre that bears his name. According to a recently study led by the Maison Jean Lapointe on the treatment of pathological gambling, 83% of participants who began treatment said that video lottery terminals were their preferred game of chance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Institut national de santé publique du Québec estimates that 9% of people who use video lottery terminals develop a dependency. The research consulted unanimously reports that video lottery terminals represent the primary source of problems for 80% to 90% of gamblers who seek help.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735">(1735)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para335910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a study published in the <i>Canadian Journal of Psychiatry</i>, most compulsive gamblers are addicted to video lotteries that they play every day or several times a week. They can stay close to home, therefore, and use the machines in local bars. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. David Hodgins of the University of Calgary said in his presentation to the advisory board of the Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction that in Alberta 3% were compulsive gamblers, 2% were pathological gamblers, and 86% of the people who seek help in Alberta play video lotteries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statistics alone show what a problem there is with the proximity and availability of VLTs. I am not as knowledgeable or experienced as Senator Lapointe in this regard. However, all of us as members of Parliament go door to door to see people. We walk around and meet people. How often when I go to a restaurant where there is video poker do I see people and youths putting their money into these machines? How did they get their money? Are they going to empty their wallets? Are they going to cash their social assistance cheque and put it all into this? How many times have ladies, mothers of families, come to see me because their husbands play video poker? How many fathers of families do not know which way to turn because their children also play on VLTs? </div>
    </p><a name="Para335913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a major problem and our role as members of Parliament, legislators, fellow citizens and responsible people who are supposed to improve the quality of life is to ask ourselves how we could legislate and do our work as members of Parliament to help those people. There is an adage that opportunity makes the thief. How can I ensure that these people do not have too much opportunity because VLTs are so near? </div>
    </p><a name="Para335914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some people who love to talk numbers. They say that lotteries donate billions of dollars and generate revenue and that this is about the balance of convenience. I mention the balance of convenience because every time we face this kind of scourge, every time we have a pathetic situation like this one, there is a social price to pay. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Neil Tudiver of the University of Manitoba found that a compulsive gambler costs society $56,000 per year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the numbers in Quebec. We did not make these numbers up. They were provided by the people at Loto-Québec, who are lottery experts. They say that Quebeckers account for 2% of compulsive gamblers. So, if we do a little math, we find that 140,000 Quebeckers are compulsive gamblers. Of those 140,000, an estimated 89% are addicted to video poker. That means that 124,000 Quebeckers have a video lottery problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we multiply that number, 124,000, by $56,000 in costs to society, that means the state is spending $6.9 billion per year. Those 124,000 Quebeckers who are problem gamblers with a VLT habit cost us $6.9 billion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how much revenue video lotteries generate for the Government of Quebec? Approximately $1 billion. If we do a little more simple math, we find that $1 billion in profits costs $6.9 billion in losses for the province because of compulsive gambling. I think that is a pretty convincing argument.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, people will ask us why we are getting involved because this is under provincial jurisdiction and agreements about gambling were made between 1977 and 1985. Personally, I think we have a responsibility here.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is about amending the Criminal Code, in a provincial jurisdiction. In 1985, I think, the Montreal casino did not exist, nor did video lotteries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my call to everyone today: let us make sure that, following the second reading, this bill will be studied by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights in order to make some clarifications, if necessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A> nodding his head, because he understands. In fact such a situation also exists in the Centre-Sud neighbourhood. This is not an issue affecting the poor as opposed to the rich. But we know that more people are affected in some places than in others. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After second reading, in committee, we can then ask questions having to do with the federal-provincial aspect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still we should make sure that we can play our role fully as responsible citizens. We are legislators, we are the representatives of democracy, and this is the cradle of democracy. Together we adopted a motion bearing on the recognition of the Quebec nation. What about this nation, how is it supposed to operate?</div>
    </p><a name="Para335925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I have had the opportunity, as a legislator and responsible person—which I have had as the Minister of Sport, the Minister responsible for La Francophonie and the Minister of Immigration—I have tried to find ways of ensuring a better quality of life for people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we are working on accessibility. We saw the consequences of prohibition in the 1920s. The prohibition of alcohol had a direct impact, namely, organized crime. Some people got rich that way. People got around the system and still got their drinks. And if, in a way, we regulate the way how things are done and the video lotteries are relegated to specific places, it will not be any better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill is clever in this regard. Senator Lapointe did an excellent job. We will take three years. There will be consultations; the governments will consult one another, and we will find a decent way of ensuring that there can be a transition period— for example, in Quebec, involving Loto-Québec, the bars, the Government of Quebec, and the rest. We give ourselves three years so that we can achieve our ends. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One person is already too many. I could talk today about statistics, but one person is too many. We have heard about suicides, people who are depressed, people who were not players. But when they began to play these video lotteries, they were caught up in an untenable and horrific situation, a situation that is now worrying.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a situation involving a 17 year old kid who committed suicide because of this problem. The kid started at 15 years old. He was going to that restaurant and playing many times. It became compulsive. He thought he would make some money because he played it so often, but it became a disease. One has to wonder if he stole to get the money. Did he have a Shylock or some individual involved in organized crime who passed him the money? If he did not win money, he would still have to reimburse that individual, at an interest rate of 30% or 40%. He was 17 years old. He did not see the light at the end of the tunnel. What was he going to do? He killed himself. </div>

The one concern I have is that we may be infringing on the territoriality of the provinces by way of agreements that we have had with them starting back in maybe the late 1980s and the decision for the provinces to determine whether this type of gambling equipment would be usable in each of the provinces.

That was before the time of casinos and video poker at that level. We might have something there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate went through the three readings and had its share of discussion on it, which is why it should be sent to the justice committee where it can have that kind of discussion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a balance between the legality and the legitimacy of it. We know we will need to amend the Criminal Code. We can frame the issue by addressing the fact that it is under the Criminal Code, which is federal jurisdiction. On the other hand, the fact is that there is a period of transition of three years where we need to consult with the provinces. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that those who do not have the problem in some provinces or territories are fully in agreement. The other provinces do have some doubts and questions because of the constitutionality. However, I would say that it is like the environment. It is a shared issue that we must address among ourselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By having that kind of profound, in-depth debate within the justice committee we should have all the legal framework attached to it. Frankly, with the role we play as legislators and since it is under the Criminal Code, I am not sure it would jeopardize the actual agreement that already exists but we will need to discuss those kinds of things, which is why we are hoping to make those kinds of clarifications during the debate. Since we agree in principle, I truly believe that it is a must to have that kind of debate. </div>

We may be in politics but we must be pragmatic. I feel that if we prohibit it, organized crime will take over. If we were to confine it to specific territories, it would still be available but under government institutions and regulated. We would have a better chance of addressing the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said at the beginning that one of the main problems with this issue is that availability. If a kid or other people like a machine they are playing they can become addicted to it. Therefore, if we confine these machines to a casino, people will have to go there. The experts have been pretty clear in saying that is what helped us to confine the situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this is a doable, practical and pragmatic approach that will help us to provide better tools for the experts and the people in the field to confine that problem, which is truly a major problem. If we prohibit it, we will have the same thing happen as what happened with the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do disagree with the bill's approach of stripping the provinces and territories and their residents of their current ability to make local decisions locally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all want to end gambling addictions and its attendant economic misery, family hardship, employee theft and suicide. However, there is a very basic choice that Parliament must make, in light of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2404223,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2404223&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-211</A>, on the subject and, as we all know, when it comes to federal, provincial and territorial relations it is the delicate subject of decision-making relating to gambling and any other activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the federal government play big brother and take away the decision-making that the provinces and territories now have under the Criminal Code with respect to provincial government lottery schemes, or will local decision-making be left to the provinces and territories? It is as simple and yet as complex as that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general scheme in the gambling provisions of the Criminal Code is to prohibit all forms of gambling except those that are specifically permitted by the code. In 1969, Parliament expanded the legalized gambling provisions of the Criminal Code. A parliamentary joint committee had examined this topic, along with others, in the mid-1950s and recommended some expansion of legalized gambling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time that Parliament was considering gambling amendments to the Criminal Code in the 1960s, some states in the U.S. had already amended their state constitutions, in some cases, in order to legalize a state lottery that could benefit the state economically. When Parliament amended the Criminal Code in 1969 to expand the forms of legalized gambling alongside the recommendations from joint committee reports of the 1950s, Canadian legislators of the day added permission for the provincial and federal governments to conduct a lottery scheme and permission for provincial government to license certain lottery schemes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, in a 1976 federal-provincial-territorial agreement, Canada agreed not to use its permission to conduct a federal lottery scheme and the provinces agreed to make an annual payment to Canada that now amounts, in current dollars, to some $60 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1983, Parliament enacted permission for the federal government to conduct pool betting operations and provinces went to court arguing that these looked very much like lottery schemes that the federal government in 1976 had agreed not to pursue. The federal government, for its part, commenced litigation against certain provinces for operating schemes that it saw as illegal pool betting operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The litigation was resolved in 1985 with a new federal-provincial-territorial agreement that required the federal government to use its best efforts to place a bill before Parliament to remove from the Criminal Code the permission for the federal government to operate a lottery scheme. The provinces and territories agreed to pay to Canada $100 million to be used for the 1988 Calgary Olympics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985, a bill was tabled and passed that removed the permission in the Criminal Code for the federal government to operate a lottery scheme. It also clarified that a province or territory could itself operate a lottery scheme on or through a slot machine and a video lottery terminal, or VLT, a form of a slot machine, but a province or territory could no license to others to operate a lottery scheme on or through a slot machine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of play, games and internal computerization is essentially the same for what we traditionally think of as slot machines, which pay out by coin, and what we think of as VLTs, which pay out by a printout. Also, both traditional slot machines and VLTs meet the definition of a slot machine in subsection 198(3) of the Criminal Code:</div>

    </p><a name="Para335965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether this would be a good idea or a bad idea is a matter for debate certainly, but what the government is saying is that we should maintain the existing Criminal Code approach that permits a provincial or territorial government to make that decision about where VLTs will be placed, if the province or territory chooses to operate any at all.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2404223,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2404223&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-211</A> would eliminate the possibility for provinces to place VLTs in locations other than racetracks or casinos. It is not just a matter of saying that Canada will pay any losses by provinces in moving provincial government VLTs from bars to racetracks and casinos. Clearly, this would affect federal-provincial-territorial relations even with provinces and territories that, to date, have chosen not to place VLTs in bars. None of the three territories place VLT terminals in bars and Ontario and British Columbia do not place VLT terminals in bars. Quebec, the Prairie provinces and the Atlantic provinces do place VLTs in bars which, of course, are age controlled premises that by law are not permitted to cater to minors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Prairie provinces have held municipal referenda to remove VLTs from bars. They have respected those votes and removed VLTs from such establishments in those municipalities. A few years ago in New Brunswick there was a provincial referendum on whether to remove video lottery terminals from bars and the decision was to keep them. In fact, some Prairie and Atlantic provinces and Quebec have taken decisions to reduce or cap the number of VLTs that will be placed at bars in the province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice that we have with this bill is to keep the jurisdiction for the video lottery schemes where it is currently with the provinces and territories or to take that back into the federal realm. The government's position is that we will leave that to the provinces and territories, which will allow for local decision making. Ultimately, residents of a province or territory are free to make their provincial or territorial government accountable for its decisions at the polls. Also, there is ample room for public debate on VLTs in the assemblies and legislatures of the provinces and territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I just said, those debates and those referenda in some provinces and in individual municipalities are taking place, they have taken place and they will take place. It is at that level that individuals can have input into their own communities. There is no need for the federal government to change the existing provisions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I urge members of this House to vote against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2404223,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2404223&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-211</A> and to leave provinces and territories the ability to make local decisions with respect to where they will place their provincial or territorial VLTs.

In our work, it is important not to always put institutions first. Sometimes people have to be a priority. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Lapointe is known in Quebec for his brilliant career as an actor. I have watched his performance in the <i>Duplessis</i> series many times—not that I have any admiration for Duplessis, but this show is indeed part of our television anthology.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to commend the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79018,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79018&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bourassa</A> for sponsoring the bill here in this House. The Bloc Québécois very much hopes that the bill will reach second reading, that it will be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and that we can manage to reconcile two objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first objective is to give some tools to those who have a gambling addiction. The location of video lottery terminals, VLTs, is part of the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second objective involves respecting jurisdictions. No one can deny that an agreement was reached in 1979 and renewed in 1985, under which the provinces pay $50 million. The federal government said it would withdraw from this jurisdiction. The provinces can therefore take care of it and it is clear that the Bloc Québécois will definitely be quite anxious about matters of respecting jurisdictions. We are trying to find a way to reconcile these two objectives and the appearance of witnesses in committee can certainly allow us to achieve these objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambling addiction destroys families, creates major problems, makes individuals miserable, breaks up relationships and causes real harm in communities. The Bloc Québécois wants to see Senator Lapointe's bill as a way of helping people resolve their addiction problems. Of course, more needs to be done and a certain number of issues will have to be taken into consideration during the debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Loto-Québec established the Société des loteries vidéo du Québec in 1993. Quebec then was responsible for making a certain number of terminals available in the province. At present, there are just under 14,000 terminals in Quebec bars, pubs and restaurants. There is an entire licensing and permit system for these terminals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that our citizens can go to various licensed establishments to play these 13,870 terminals, which require a permit and are authorized. Of these, only 430 are located at racetracks. Senator Lapointe is right to state that in the majority of cases and for the most part, certainly in the case of video lottery terminals, they are available in places other than racet-courses, casinos and betting theatres.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also ask the question because what is of concern to us is that there also must be state controls. We do not wish to return to a system like the one that existed before government licensing of video lotteries. At that time there was the problem of underworld control. I have been provided with statistics on this matter. Prior to 1993, the state had lost control of between 30,000 and 40,000 terminals. Therefore, not only had the government lost control of the resources generated by this underground industry, an industry controlled by organized crime, but it was also prevented from intervening on other fronts. I remember that several years ago Loto-Québec developed a program that would help compulsive gamblers. I could provide some examples in this regard.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805">(1805)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para335982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Loto-Québec, through its subsidiary, the Société des loteries vidéo du Québec, has begun to reduce the number of video lottery terminals. The plan calls for a 31% reduction, over four years, in the number of VLTs in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loto-Québec and the Government of Quebec are already taking a number of measures. It is interesting to note that in Quebec's National Assembly, the minister with responsibility for the video lottery system and the support program for compulsive gamblers is not the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>, Mr. Marcoux, but the Minister for Youth Protection and Rehabilitation, a member from Quebec City, Margaret Delisle. She is responsible for it. There is a whole program for compulsive gamblers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this should not prevent us from taking action of our own, in line with Senator Lapointe's proposal. But our jurisdictional concerns must be addressed, and we need guarantees that provincial jurisdictions will be respected, because we would not want to set any precedents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sympathize with what the senators have done. Of course, we think the Senate should be elected. I do not know whether, in a sovereign Quebec, there will be an upper chamber. That will be debated in due course. But one thing is certain. If, tomorrow morning, for example—</div>
    </p><a name="Para335986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Oh, oh!</div>
    </p><a name="Para335987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard:</b> I have attracted the attention of the member for Bourassa. I do not know whether he wants to reply. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Denis Coderre:</b> I thought it was another parody of Mr. Boisclair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Real Ménard:</b> Mr. Boisclair is a great leader. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79018,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79018&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bourassa</A> and I have witnessed victories and defeats in leadership contests. That is a fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more serious note, what I wanted to say is that if, tomorrow morning, a senator were to stand up in the other place and propose changes in education, for example, in the curriculum of school boards and schools, that might be a good idea. If a senator were to stand up in the Senate and say that Canadian history should be a mandatory subject, we would no doubt approve. But I am not convinced that we would agree that that initiative should come from the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we support Senator Lapointe's bill. We hope that the bill will pass second reading. We will vote for it at second reading and we will be looking for an amendment to be introduced in due course, either in committee or during third reading—we will see—to ensure complete respect for Quebec's jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I want to explain that the National Assembly has already passed a certain number of measures relating to gambling addiction. For example, VLTs are located in places off-limits to those under 18. Posters proclaiming that gambling should just be a game are put up in every establishment that has VLTs. Brochures to raise awareness are placed near the machines and messages promoting moderation appear on or near them. There are a number of mechanisms in place to make people aware that excessive gambling is not healthy for the people who do it and is certainly not healthy for families that have to deal with the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important financial issue because, as the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79018,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79018&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bourassa</A> said, gambling brings in $1.3 billion for the government, though not necessarily all of that is profit, which is more like $809 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, there are problems, considerations and financial issues we need to keep in mind. But we cannot make decisions based on those factors alone. The most important consideration is the health of individuals and targeting the harmful nature of problem gambling. </div>
    </p><a name="Para335995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to congratulate Senator Lapointe once again. I hope that we will be able to hear witnesses in the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. We will see where this issue places in the committee's list of priorities, which is long.</div>

    </p><a name="Para335998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is attempting, and I think to some degree successfully so, although I have some reservations, to look at a specific problem in the gaming industry. In particular, although it addresses the use of video lottery terminals and slot machines, the major problem we have is with the video lottery terminals, the VLTs. I have been involved in this issue for quite some time. Windsor, my home riding, had the first casino in Ontario. In fact I sat on the first provincial board in the province back in the early and mid 1990s.</div>
    </p><a name="Para335999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that period of time it became an issue as to whether the VLTs would be allowed into Ontario. Before I go on with that, I want to take a bit of an issue because I am not sure the major point has been addressed. What happened through the 1980s and into the early 1990s in Canada was that the federal government, by way of legislation in the House and agreements with the provinces, in effect permitted the provinces to move into the gaming industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Criminal Code all the gaming in the country in effect is prohibited and is only allowed when there is legislation exempting the provinces or other operators from entering into the field. What has happened historically is the federal government has allowed that by way of exemptions from the Criminal Code, a law that goes back 400 or 500 years in common law and legislation, but the provinces do require those exemptions. Those exemptions have been granted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Ontario, as we received those exemptions, the Ontario government of whatever shade on various occasions had to make a determination as to what type of gaming would be allowed in the province. We have seen a similar pattern in a number of other provinces, I think all of the other provinces now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Ontario has done, and it will have no problem with the scheme that is established under this proposed legislation, is exactly what the legislation contemplates which is that it would limit the use of this gaming equipment to casinos. In Ontario it is both casinos that are run directly by the province and in some cases managed privately but owned and operated directly by the province, and then what we call charity casinos that are operated by charities in various locations around the province. In addition Ontario has allowed gaming equipment in the form of slot machines into a number of the race tracks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fits exactly into the pattern that is proposed in this legislation, with the exception that when we did the analysis under the NDP government in the early 1990s, we determined that the VLTs were so addictive, from experiences that we had studied in a number of other jurisdictions, that we never allowed them into Ontario. I believe that continues to the present time. They are not allowed in the casinos, they are not allowed at the race tracks and they certainly were never allowed in the bars, restaurants and other private establishments. That has always been a prohibition in Ontario. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the pattern elsewhere in the country. We know we have a particular problem in at least two of the maritime provinces and I believe one of the prairie provinces, where in fact the use of the VLTs has been permitted by the provincial governments in private enterprises, some in a number of those jurisdictions in corner stores, variety stores, bars and restaurants. We never allowed them in Ontario because of their addictive nature. They are much more addictive than the traditional slot machine, in ratios of 10:1 to 20:1 more addictive. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815">(1815)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard all sorts of horror stories. The Senate heard a number of horror stories about people with modest incomes becoming addicted and spending a hundred dollars to several hundreds of dollars a day until they ran out of money. They exhausted all their savings and assets and ultimately bankrupted themselves and other family members. That has been a real pattern with VLTs. This is primarily what Senator Lapointe is trying to address in this bill. It is a laudable experience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By giving provinces this authority, we have allowed them to become dependent on the revenues that they generate from these machines. An article in October's <i>Walrus </i> magazine detailed how much revenue was derived by private enterprises and provincial governments. They are used to receiving this revenue. In a serious proportion of cases, it is ill-gotten revenue because of the fact that it comes from people who are addicted to these machines, and it should be stopped.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is such an important issue, I will be supporting the bill going to the justice committee, although the last thing the justice committee needs is another bill thanks to the intemperate approach by the Conservative government of sending all kinds of crime bills in patches to it. As we heard from the member for the Bloc, we will look at making amendments to ensure that provincial jurisdiction is protected and that the provinces are on side. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take away the right of provinces to have video lottery terminals and slot machines in private enterprises, then at the very least we need to give them time to adjust to that loss of revenue because in some cases it is quite significant. They will need a timeline to move away from their dependency on this revenue. This will be one of the amendments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern of mine is we may get into a legal constitutional conflict between the federal government and the provinces based on the legislation we passed previously, allowing them to get into this industry. This will have to be addressed. I assume the Senate has addressed this to some degree, but I will be looking for a review on this to see if we are not crossing a constitutional boundary and going in a direction we should not be going.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can safely say that this is a crisis, especially with regard to VLTs. It should be addressed. It may ultimately be more appropriate that it be addressed at the provincial level, so it may not be possible to support the legislation at third reading, but we have a responsibility to investigate this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be supporting it. It will be a free vote in my party. Hopefully, with the support of the House, the bill will go to justice committee where we can conduct an investigation to determine whether amendments can be made that will bring it into line with the needs of the provinces.</div>

I want to thank Senator Lapointe, who is the sponsor of this bill. His courage, his determination and his perseverance have enabled him to overcome the many obstacles in his path.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill amends a provision in the Criminal Code on lotteries. This amendment to the Criminal Code would limit the location of video lottery terminals to race-courses, casinos and betting theatres.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective is to remove VLTs from bars and restaurants. Let us be clear: the goal is not to ban VLTs, but to limit their location to casinos, race-courses and betting theatres.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a study by the program <i>The Fifth Estate</i>, in 2004 there were 38,652 video lottery terminals in 8,309 different locations in Canada. When the bill is passed and comes into effect over a period of three years, there will be no more than 206 locations in Canada where a person could gamble at a VLT.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my hon. colleagues will raise the spectre of sharing jurisdictions between the federal and provincial governments. This debate is on a highly serious social issue that affects the entire Canadian population where VLTs are found. It is in Quebec where we find the greatest number of these machines. Although the government has cut the number of these machines, there are still too many of them and we would be burying our heads in the sand if we avoided talking about it because this issue might upset the provinces.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill has come to us from the Senate under the authorship of Senator Lapointe, a senator who has won the respect and admiration of Quebeckers and Canadians. This bill strikes at the heart of a major social problem: video lottery terminals. This bill would not prohibit VLTs; rather, it would restrict them to specific locations. Gambling is still legal, but it needs to be better controlled. We are particularly concerned about the accessibility of slot machines, which are often located in poor neighbourhoods. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I was talking about young children and families who suffer because of gamblers' bad habits. For most of the people who engage in this type of gambling, it is very like a drug. Once they start playing VLTs or slot machines, it is just like a drug. People go back to it again and again and develop an addiction. Sadly, I have seen people lose entire paycheques to these machines.<i></i></div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we remember that last week one member of cabinet could not vote with the government on a motion, not even a bill but a motion, and had to resign from cabinet.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the minister can explain it to us. Are they whipped bills or is it that everybody thinks exactly the same way on that side of the House?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fact that a former federal leader would have kicked somebody out of his cabinet on that particular issue when the man just wanted to say that he believed in defining marriage as between a man and a woman, we have people in our cabinet who have taken a different view from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> on this.

    </p><a name="Para336048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that our Prime Minister believes in democracy and is allowing a free vote on this. The new leader of the Liberals came out very strongly and said he was not going to allow a free vote. He appears to be a man who is able to listen to reason. He changed his mind on that just recently and I am pleased at that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are just the facts of the matter. I think it is a travesty of democracy on such an important issue. It should be noted that on this particular issue there is no monolithic view in any one particular community. In the heterosexual community, there are those who think the definition of marriage should be retained as between a man and a woman, but there are also others in the heterosexual community who do not think that. </div>

A significant number of Canadians have enjoyed the right to same sex marriage. However, if a bill were to result from this motion, the legality of their marriage would be based on whether it occurred before or after the arrival of the Conservative government. This would create a serious inequality between two equivalent categories of Canadians.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to address some of the issues raised by my right hon. colleague across the way and not preach to the converted. He has urged us to address each other in a civil manner and I certainly want to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address some of the arguments made by those who are in favour of the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has always been this contention: why can gay couples not be satisfied with equality of rights under civil unions? Just leave us, us heterosexuals, the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman, people say, and we will allow them the civil equality of civil unions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point very simply is that equality of civil unions and equality in civil unions withholds the right to call oneself “married”, and that right to call oneself a married person is of intense importance in terms of respect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respect seems to me to be what is fundamental here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We care about equality of marriage rights because we care about equality of respect and because we believe we want to confer equality of respect on all our fellow citizens, some of whom are our neighbours, our friends and our colleagues. I cannot see how we confer equality of respect to our fellow citizens unless we accord them full equality of marriage rights.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the second question that then follows, and it follows directly from the comments made by my right hon. colleague, is that if we are according respect to one side of the debate, should we not accord equal respect to the other side of the debate, to those who believe that the definition of marriage should be restricted to a man and a woman?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe emphatically that equality of respect is called for here. I believe that this side of the House and those of us who support full equality rights to marriage for persons of the same sex do not want to withhold respect from the other side of the debate in any shape or form. Moreover, that respect, the basic respect to people we disagree with, is mandated by rights, freedom of expression and freedom of religion, rights which I value I think as much as any other member of the House and certainly I value in exactly the same way that those who disagree with me value them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the question becomes, if both sides of this proposition must be treated with equality and have equality of respect and equality rights, then the difficult question, the core question, is, which rights must prevail? That is the question to which my side of the argument or this side of the argument must give a clear answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposition we would make is that those demanding equality of marriage rights should prevail because the loss of their claim is a real loss: they cannot call their union a marriage in law. Whereas those who oppose that definition lose nothing: their right to oppose remains intact and their right, the religious right, to withhold the solemnization of marriage is protected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, those religious groups who do not want to solemnize marriages between people of the same sex retain the right to withhold that solemnization. Their rights are respected. The people who lose in a situation in which we withhold full equality of marriage rights to our fellow citizens are gay couples who deeply value the respect that that accords them as Canadian citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sense of this issue is that we are talking in fact about how to manage disagreement in our society. I think that is a common theme in this discussion. I feel that we have to manage respect by respecting the rights of those who disagree, but we cannot take action which withholds the practising of respect from any groups of citizens in our country. I feel that the attempt to restrict marriage to a man and a woman withholds a fundamental form of human respect and a fundamental human right from a category of our citizens. For that reason, I will vote against it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also disagree profoundly with the intentions behind this motion, because instead of uniting Canadians on what I believe is now a settled question for most Canadians, this motion will set one group of Canadians against another. I feel in that sense that it is playing politics. We play politics in this House every day of the week and politics is a very respectable profession, but there is a way of playing politics, and there I am going as far as I can. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1840"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840">(1840)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are politicians and we play politics, but there are some things, I would conclude, that should go beyond politics. Among them is the right of all Canadians to full equality, both in rights and in respect. That should, in my judgment, go beyond politics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am committed to that proposition above all, I think, that we are in politics to accord full respect to all Canadians regardless of sexual orientation, and that to deny that puts us in a situation where we begin to play politics with rights in a manner that we will come to regret, simply because it brings the process and processes of politics which we practise in this House into disrespect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on those grounds, I will vote against the motion.</div>

No doubt he is aware of the fact that in another country, and in fact the country in which the Liberal leader also has citizenship, the country of France no less--he has citizenship here, he has citizenship there--there is what is called a pacte de solidarité. France did not change the meaning of marriage. It did not tamper with that, but it had this other registration that could be done for people in a homosexual relationship and for people in various other relationships as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France drew some rather different conclusions and came to a rather different acceptable result, honouring and safeguarding the rights of all French citizens, so I would ask respectfully if the member agrees with that approach, the approach taken by a country that is near and dear to the hearts of many people in this place, a country of which the Liberal leader, the member's colleague, is a citizen as well.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view of that matter is simple. The claim the gay citizens of our country are making is that they cannot have full entitlement to respect and they cannot consider themselves fully equal citizens of this country unless they have a right to marriage, pure and simple, and that anything that creates a pacte de solidarité or a civil union does not meet the test of full equality and full respect. I accept that claim.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I respect the point being made here, but I think it does not meet the claim. It does not meet the demand of our fellow citizens to equality of respect and equality of rights.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to ask him, though, about some of his arguments. He talked about same sex marriage being a fundamental human right and he talked about fundamental human respect. He wants full equality and full respect, but then he also says that religious communities will have or do have rights, presumably under section 2 of the charter, to not solemnize same sex marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the member's argument about it being a fundamental human right with fundamental human respect, I do not see, if we accept that argument, how religious communities can be assured that it will not be used to override the right of religious faiths to not solemnize same sex marriages.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member to address that on the human right side. If we follow the logical extension of his argument, I think the concern is that this would in fact override the rights of religious communities to not solemnize same sex marriages.</div>

I am trying to describe a respectful position in which we take very seriously the religious rights of groups who feel they cannot, in accordance with their conscience and in accordance with holy law and in accordance with whatever they choose, solemnize marriage. To the degree that it is a question about my personal opinion, I would stand very strongly against any attempt to coerce or deny that right to a religious group.</div>
    </p><a name="Para332674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in a response to an earlier comment, this is about how Canadian society manages disagreement on ultimate questions. Any serious politics of human rights has to give very clear grounds as to why one set of rights might trump over another. I have tried to say that the equality claims of gay citizens is so important that they must have the right to claim equality in marriage. I am very strongly of the opinion that if that is true, it is extremely important for fellow citizens of an opposing opinion, especially those in religious communities, to be able to withhold solemnization of marriage and that the law should never be used to coerce them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para332675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the degree that this is a personal opinion, and we are talking about deeply held moral views, it is vital to the civility and harmony of our society that no coercion be exercised against a religious group that as a matter of conscience and religious doctrine does not want to solemnize marriage. In other words, my position is an attempt to find a balance of principles, an equilibrium of principles, that would allow us to manage disagreement in our society in a civil manner.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336081"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para336082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians must be wondering why it is important to consult this House again on this issue. After all, less than two years ago, this issue was debated and voted on in this House, in the form of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38, the Civil Marriage Act</A>. At that time, Parliament passed a law defining marriage as follows:</div>
    </p><a name="Para336083"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Marriage, for civil purposes, is the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para336084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This definition of marriage includes same-sex unions. As I had not yet been elected at that point, I can express my opinion on this issue today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to say a few words about the motion itself. It is important to point out that the motion will not change the definition of marriage. It seeks simply to ask members whether they want to reopen the debate in order to develop a bill to restore the traditional definition of marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of this House have two choices when they vote this week on this motion. For those who support the traditional definition of marriage—the union between a man and a woman, which excludes all same-sex couples—the choice is to vote for the motion. For those who believe that the definition of marriage goes beyond the traditional definition and includes same-sex couples, the choice is to respect the existing law on civil marriage and vote against this motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to respect the current law, which is in line with my personal values and protects the fundamental rights of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that we do not have to amend this law, because it still respects the traditional definition of marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, myself, have been married for more than 25 years. I am the mother of three children and I believe that this act in no way undermines the importance of my union and the solidity of my family. I sincerely believe that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Civil Marriage Act</A> continues to enable all heterosexual couples to marry, as they have done for a long time. The current legislation enables same sex couples to benefit from the same right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real question that needs to be asked is this: does the government have the moral authority to decide whether two people, a man and a woman, or same sex partners, can be legally united? In my opinion, the answer is clear and simple: two people who want to live together within a civil marriage, regardless of their sexual orientation, must be able to do so without the interference of the State. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am one of those who firmly believe in the separation of church and state. In my view, one person’s religion must not become another person’s law. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the debate deals with a motion that was tabled by the government, I want to emphasize that the government has taken no position on this question. Unlike the previous government, all members on this side of the House, including ministers, are free to vote according to their conscience. In that regard, I must severely criticize the Liberal government for having presented that legislation to the House without allowing a truly free vote on such a sensitive issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am proud to belong to a government that believes that matters of personal conviction should be decided by a truly free vote. As a minister in this government, I feel privileged to be able to express my views on this issue and to vote freely on the motion tabled by this same government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In closing, I congratulate the government for allowing members of this House to express their points of view of in a spirit of mutual respect. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take this opportunity to inform the House that I do not wish to reopen the debate, that I intend to respect the current legislation on civil marriage and, consequently, I will be voting against this motion. </div>

The Conservative Party did not agree with it when it was put before the House. There were a few very courageous people on the Conservative side who voted with the Liberal government at that time to pass the bill. The Conservatives did not agree with it. They know, as I do, that it is very difficult to change. Rather than have the courage to do what the government should do and propose a bill, the Conservatives have proposed a motion. </div>

    </p><a name="Para336109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary responsibility of a government is to put before the House a bill that is constitutionally valid. The Conservatives know that they could never get the Department of Justice to recommend that a bill which reinstates the traditional definition of marriage without using the notwithstanding clause is constitutionally valid. They would have to fire everyone and hire again. They are not above that, but I do not think they will. They will not do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that reopening the debate would change the outcome. The process would be harmful to many. The House has spoken. This issue has been debated at length and Canadians have made up their minds on this matter. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative motion is disrespectful of the democratic process and undermines the charter, the very principles upon which our political system operates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation to amend civil marriage has been before Parliament since 2003. It has been considered by parliamentarians since 2002. Draft legislation was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, I believe in 2003. The matter was debated at length in the House of Commons and was sent to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, where we heard countless hours of testimony from expert witnesses on all sides of the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentarians had the opportunity to speak at length on this issue. We have had a full, open and honest debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2005 I voted in favour of the current law at third reading. My decision to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> was not made lightly. This has been a very difficult issue for many Canadians, involving deeply held personal and religious beliefs and convictions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made my decision after hearing from many of my constituents on both sides of this issue and participating in hours of debate here in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my earliest concerns, echoed by many of my constituents, was that the same sex marriage bill would compel religious officials to perform marriage ceremonies that are contrary to their beliefs. Our current legislation affirms the charter guarantee of religious freedom and has been guided by the ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court has declared unanimously that the guarantee of religious freedom in section 2(a) of the charter is broad enough to protect religious officials from being compelled by the state to perform civil or religious same sex marriages that are contrary to their religious beliefs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious leaders who preside over civil and religious marriage ceremonies must and will be guided by their own beliefs. If they do not wish to perform marriages for same sex couples, it is their right to refuse to do so, plain and simple.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336119"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter is one of rights, but it is also one of freedoms. Ours is a secular society and the separation of church and state is the strongest protection of our freedom of religion. The government does not dictate the terms of our beliefs, nor does it attempt to control religion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current same sex legislation is about civil rights, not religious marriage. The same sex civil marriage law is accepted as law in eight jurisdictions across Canada. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1900"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1900"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1900">(1900)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My job as a parliamentarian and legislator is to protect the rights of each and every Canadian and defend the charter in its entirety. The charter was enshrined to ensure that the rights of minorities, regardless of their numbers, were never subjected to the will of the majority. We must not shirk that responsibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, on the other hand, has demonstrated that equality rights are not a top priority for his government. When the Conservatives eliminated the court challenges program, they stripped minority groups of the ability to challenge legislation that infringed on their rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court challenges program provided financial assistance to individuals and groups who were pursuing legal action to advance language and equality rights under the Constitution. The right to same sex marriage is one of the issues that have been brought before the Supreme Court thanks to this valuable program. People objecting or seeking their rights under religious beliefs had the same access to that program when it was funded. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have sent a message that financial resources are a factor in determining the extension of charter rights. This is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2004 the Supreme Court ruled that same sex couples have the same right to civil marriage as do opposite sex couples. The current government wishes to reinstate the traditional definition of marriage, but it would serve no purpose to legislate a definition of marriage that is not consistent with the charter, because it would be overturned by the courts.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, this is a disingenuous motion aimed at keeping an election promise to Conservative supporters. I have said to my constituents, and I will repeat it here, that the only time I would support in such a matter the use of the notwithstanding clause would be to defend the rights of the independence of the church, should they ever be attacked. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is again pandering to his base. We saw it this fall with the $2 billion cuts to our valued social programs. Even worse, he is using a deeply sensitive and divisive issue to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that the definition of marriage has already been changed. It is now a matter of overriding a right that is guaranteed by the charter, a right that is already in place. The issue is not whether rights are to be granted; it is whether they should be taken away. Our rights cannot be subject to political whim. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 12,000 gay couples have wed in Canada since same sex marriage was legalized last year. Furthermore, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> made universal across Canada a law that is already accepted as law in eight jurisdictions, including my home province of Nova Scotia. In September 2004 the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that same sex civil marriage was legal in our province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter is a living document and must evolve and reflect the changing nature of society. As we are well aware, it was not until 1929 that women were finally declared persons under the law in Canada. This historic decision established a principle of understanding that justice requires judges to consider an evolving social context when interpreting the law. Lord Sankey of the Privy Council said it best:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a progressive and inclusive country that values the rights of individuals. Our laws must reflect equality as we understand it today and not as we understood it decades or centuries ago. Canadians have spoken on this issue and democracy has prevailed.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue with which my colleague ended his speech, talking about creating divisions, most of my colleagues disagree with me on this question.

I believe the issue of traditional marriage is of crucial importance to all Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my election to office in January, there has been no other topic that has generated such a constant flow of mail, email, telephone calls and face to face dialogue as the issue of marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am relieved to say that finally the voices of Kitchener—Conestoga will be heard. The people in my riding have spoken clearly. I am proud to finally be the voice of Kitchener—Conestoga. In the spirit of being that voice, let me take some time to speak from my heart. Let me share some of my deeply personal beliefs and convictions about the merits of reopening the debate on traditional marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people would want us to believe that traditional marriage is something about which Canadians have forgotten. That is simply not true. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Canadians care deeply about this issue. It may be an issue that members of Parliament would like to put behind them. It may be an issue about which special lobby groups would like to see us forget. However, let me clear, it is an issue Canadians are not going to abandon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been serving as an MP for less than a year. In that time over 1,000 constituents have taken the time to write me a letter, or pick up the phone, or stop me on the street, and they say quite clearly, “I care about traditional marriage”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been asked about this issue by young married couples who are raising children. These families are deeply concerned about their children and future grandchildren if the traditional family is abandoned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have personally met with young people. These are teenagers and young adults. They are contemplating marriage and have taken the time to come to me and tell me that they are concerned about the future of our country. They come to my office and thank me for not turning my back on them. They thank me for giving them a voice. These young people want to see the definition of marriage protected as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. Young people of Canada know this: strong communities are built on strong families and a strong Canada is built on strong families. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not very long ago that a resolution came to the House on the issue of marriage. And it was in this very House less than eight years ago in June of 1999 that we agreed that marriage would be defined as “one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others”. The vast majority of members in this House voted in favour of that resolution. In fact, I can look across the floor into the eyes of my colleagues who stood up and said that marriage should be defined as one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as members will know, in June 2005 there was a hasty adoption of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A>. It is my deeply held personal belief that many members decided to turn their back on that previous commitment. They turned their back on their constituents and they turned their back on the Canadian people. Bill C-38 was rushed into law, but the bill did not have the benefit of complete debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights had conducted hearings across Canada, meeting with hundreds of Canadians from coast to coast. The committee spent untold hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, 465 witnesses appeared, 250 briefs were presented and thousands of letters were received. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, all that work and effort was ignored. All that input was never compiled into a report and presented to Parliament. In other words, the committee hearings were nothing more than a sham and they deceived Canadians by allowing them to think that they were part of an important national debate. If democracy is to be well served on a matter of such fundamental importance as marriage, then we need to know the views of Canadian citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue before us today and the vote tomorrow is not a vote on traditional marriage, but it is a vote to allow debate on traditional marriage. While I personally continue to favour a traditional definition of marriage, I think it is a travesty that we could turn our back on having an open debate on this subject. Democracy deserves no less.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My request, and the request of millions of Canadians, is for Parliament to reopen this debate so the report can be tabled and Canadians can all have real input on this important matter. Thousands of taxpayer dollars were spent conducting these hearings. Therefore, in the interest of wise stewardship alone, we owe it to all Canadians to have this work completed. However, there is much more at stake than simply getting good value for money in having this report tabled.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1915"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1915"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1915">(1915)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key factor to consider is the fact that many members were not given their free vote on this important issue. If my current information is accurate, it appears that the so-called New Democratic Party will not allow democracy within their own ranks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over, Canadians have been given a hollow promise that their individual rights will not be trampled and that no one will be forced to act against their own conscience or religious beliefs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it not seem ironic that in the very place where those hollow assurances originate, in the House of Commons of Canada, that this core individual right is denied to individual members of Parliament? How can we reassure Canadians that their values, their individual rights and their religious convictions will not similarly be trampled?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> was enacted into law, but does it follow that this law is never open to further scrutiny? I know every member of the House understands that the practice of periodic review of legislation is simply good government practice. I believe any governing body has an obligation to review and revise its policies from time to time. Do we not owe it to our constituents to ensure that the law of the land is achieving its intended goal? Do we not have an obligation to allow parliamentarians to vote in a way that truly reflects the spirit of leadership we bring to this position? If Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> introduced worthy legislation, why would we not allow a full and open debate? Let the law be examined on its merits, good or bad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are simply too many factors that were overlooked and ignored in the previous government's haste to rush this legislation. There are too many questions that still face the House. Yes, we can choose to ignore those questions again, but just because we choose to turn our back on them does not make them go away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are questions that remain unanswered. Have other jurisdictions experienced any negative consequences from implementing similar legislation? If we turn our back on this debate, we will never know. Did we consider the potential consequences for all segments of society in our haste to change thousands of years of traditional marriage? Did we overlook the needs of the most vulnerable among us, young children? Unless we have a full debate, we will never know. We have an obligation to examine the facts before we make decisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of human rights has been raised as the reason that we cannot deny same sex couples the right to marry. If we are to speak of rights in the House, we need to include the rights of children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN Declaration on Human Rights specifically states that the rights of children must take priority over the rights of adults because they are more vulnerable and require the support of the state.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple studies have taken a good hard look at the impact of traditional marriage on childhood development. Yet, unless we vote to reopen debate on this issue, the House will never have an opportunity to consider what those studies say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate over traditional marriage should be a debate about rights, I agree. However, in the blind dash to put a patchwork of rights together, have we ignored the rights of children? Again, let me make a direct appeal to my fellow parliamentarians. For the sake of future generations, for the sake of our country, let us remember the children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to stand in the House and have young people come to me in 10 or 15 years and say, “You turned your back on us”. I cannot allow that to happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility of any elected official is to represent the views of their constituents. The people of Kitchener—Conestoga have spoken very clearly. They have spoken repeatedly. They want to open the debate on traditional marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I walk through the streets of Breslau, New Hamburg, Wellesley or St. Jacobs, constituents come to me and thank me for finally giving them a voice. As I sit in my constituency office in Kitchener, people will call me or drop in just to express their support of traditional marriage. As their elected representative I am asking: let us have an open and honest debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians expect an open and honest debate, followed by a truly democratic vote, not a whipped vote by an autocratic party leader determined to satisfy special interests. The House of Commons, the highest pinnacle of democracy, deserves nothing less.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a debate to review the impact, not just on people who wish to marry but one that also reviews the impact of that decision on the most vulnerable among us, our children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, my request is simple and clear. For the sake of democracy, for the sake of our children, for the sake of future generations and for the sake of the future of our country, let us have a full, open and honest debate.</div>

I speak with confidence when I say that I doubt anyone here would even consider such a discussion valid or tolerable. Indeed, no such topic would ever be tolerable for debates anywhere in this country, and rightfully so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard won liberties of so many Canadians are enshrined within our laws and engraved into the hearts and souls of our great country and yet today the government has chosen to return to a debate that should have long since ended and a reconsideration of rights not only hard won but even late in coming to gays and lesbians in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 1, 2005, our former Liberal prime minister, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, introduced a bill to extend to gays and lesbians the right to marry. In so doing, he, along with my colleagues and I in the Liberal government, began the final steps in what had been a very long journey for those seeking full and equal rights in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could be more fundamental than to have the right to marry someone who we love and care for and someone with whom we wish to share our lives? All the gay and lesbian community asked for was that the state recognize their union as it does the union of their fellow citizens. The answer is that nothing could be more fundamental than having the government send a clear message that its laws are a recognition of the importance of a stable and committed same sex relationship.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This equal marriage act was tantamount to declaring from the very heights of Parliament Hill, the very centre of our country, that no form of bigotry or intolerance would be considered acceptable toward any citizen of Canada for any reason.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para336190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, before Bill C-38 on same sex marriage was adopted, gays and lesbians had to fight in court to have their right to equality respected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Liberal government made a reference to the Supreme Court, the latter ruled that measures had to be taken to ensure that gays and lesbians be given the same treatment as other Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with courage, conviction and a deep sense of justice that the Liberal government and many members of the House of Commons took these measures in accordance with the opinion of the highest court of the land.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para336193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important and fair to recognize that as a result of court decisions some provinces were already embracing equality and allowing equal marriage. Eight of our provinces and one of our territories saw the reality of equal marriage even before the equal marriage act was passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In revisiting equal marriage, the government is not only casting an eye backward, it is attempting to move in a direction that is completely out of turn with the movement toward equality that has begun to take hold around the world. In bringing the motion before the House, the government is attempting to create two classes of citizens with two different sets of rights. It is clearly an affront to our democratic and equality based traditions as a country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Netherlands to Belgium, from Spain to South Africa and, more recently, in judicial decisions in Israel, people across the world are beginning to deal with the injustice of laws that preclude equal marriage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charter of Rights and Freedoms enshrined in our Constitution clearly identifies all Canadians as equal under the law. These are inalienable rights that simply cannot be sacrificed upon the altar of political expediency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to equal marriage now woven into the very fabric of our nation's identity is not simply a concept to be negotiated between those fortunate enough to sit in this chamber. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We who share the same moment of life are called upon not to languish in the drudgery of petty debates about the equality of others but to rise to the soaring pinnacle that is wide enough for all of us to rest upon and then to cast our gaze across the beautiful landscape of human equality and the fullness of our human potential.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equal marriage act was about fairness. It was and is about allowing all citizens to stand before their peers in equality. No citizen of this country should feel less than his or her fellow Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who would grab hold of the hands of time that have already marched forward and wrestled them back ought to summon even the most minute speck of empathy and, in so doing, bring a glowing light to illuminate the way forward for them and for us all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My community is not unlike most of the communities that we here are honoured and privileged to represent in this House. There are those who in good conscience support equal marriage and those who have difficulty with the concept.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe very strongly that most of those I represent recognize the importance of the grand ideals in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They know, as I do, that the rights of those who seek same sex marriage need to be respected, as do the rights of those who, through religious convictions, do not wish to participate or support equal marriage. Our Charter of Rights and Freedoms also protects their religious beliefs and I can assure the House that I respect and demand for them the same protections under our laws that I call upon for gays and lesbians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equal marriage act was a milestone in the path toward full equality for gays and lesbians. It was a line in the sand drawn across the landscape of our history that announced to all Canadians and to the world that intolerance and discrimination based on sexual orientation was now a part of our history where it so clearly belonged.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our votes in support of equal marriage were very much more than an act to allow gays and lesbians to marry. When we supported the equal marriage act, we engraved into the essence of our country's soul a beautiful equality for those who had for so long been the target of marginalization, persecution and outrageous injustice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality of the equal marriage act is that all Canadians have the right to have their loving relationships formally recognized. My partner of 12 years and I deserve the same rights as all other members of this House and all other Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that “every individual is equal before and under the law...”. It is my right and it is a right we all have and deserve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bringing forward this debate once again, the government rekindles the embers of inequality that have, for gays and lesbians, burned through their hearts and souls for far too long. I call upon my colleagues of all parties in this House to put out the fires of injustice, to extinguish the flames of intolerance and to bury the unseemly glow of inequality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the light that shines forth from this House today be one of a warm embrace. Let us extend a welcome to all citizens of this great country to join together in equality and unity.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun finally sets on our individual lives, today will be remembered as an important day.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is absolutely right in what he said but I would like to go a little further. We did debate this issue and every member of the House who wanted to speak had an opportunity to speak.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there has been much said from the official opposition that somehow we should not have this debate, that somehow, simply because there is a piece of legislation passed, Parliament has no right nor obligation nor responsibility ever to look at that issue again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be of the mind frame that would rather we did not open this issue. I am not ashamed to say that. I quite believe in what I say. At the same time, for my colleagues who share my point of view, I would urge them to debate this issue on the merits of the issue, not on trying to characterize one party as being ideologically to one side or the other, or one party being right and one party being wrong but to actually debate the merits of the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we debate the issue? Of course we can. We have the responsibility as parliamentarians to have a free, open and respectful debate in this House. I believe, quite frankly, we could do that if we strive to do that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, the issue of same sex civil marriage is settled. It has been settled by the courts and it has been settled by the Parliament of Canada. It was publicly debated for two and a half years and in 2003 our justice committee from the Parliament of Canada held nationwide hearings. We debated this issue to the limit of tolerance in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to this debate, our provincial courts, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, the Supreme Court of Ontario, the Supreme Court of Quebec and Yukon Territory had already recognized same gender civil marriage. Eight provinces and one territory in this country recognized same gender civil marriage before Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> was passed by the Parliament of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament of Canada had a responsibility either to recognize same gender civil marriage or challenge the lower court hearings at the Supreme Court. It chose not to challenge. The provinces did not challenge it. There was no reason to challenge it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, with respect, that Canadians have already made their minds up on this debate. I believe Canadians are a generous and open society. I believe that at the beginning of this debate there was a lot of division. There was a lot of ignorance. There was a lot of intolerance. The good thing about this debate is that it has absolutely shelved a lot of that. It has allowed people of common spirit and good will to find a cooperative approach to this issue, to recognize the value in one another's points of view, and quite frankly, to move on in a positive way.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only Conservative voters had been polled, I think we would have found a discrepancy. Perhaps the majority of Conservative voters were actually opposed to same gender civil marriage. However, if those same voters were polled today, as has been done, in Atlantic Canada in particular but in the country as a whole, it is now fifty-fifty. There are 47% of voters for and 47% of voters against same gender civil marriage. I would conclude that has changed. Through this bill, the debate and discussion around same gender civil marriage has become more open, more inclusive and more tolerant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look in particular at Atlantic Canadians, 69% of them are opposed to re-opening this debate. That is from an Environics poll. That is not a poll that someone made up. That is a legitimate, open and important poll that has to be put on the record in this debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to be clear on a couple of issues. I keep hearing about the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. What does the Charter of Rights and Freedoms say? Subparagraph 2(a) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives extremely clear and unambiguous protection for religious freedom. People who say differently, I would concur are using scare tactics. Churches, mosques, synagogues and temples in Canada will decide their own futures on religious marriage, as they should and as they have up to this point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extremely important to mention that we have already had same gender religious marriage prior to passing Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2536904,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2536904&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> in Canada. There has been same gender religious marriage for years in the United Church of Canada and in some of the Anglican Churches in Canada. Parliament had an obligation to extend the same right that was protected by the right of religion to civil unions or civil marriages, and it did that as it had that responsibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous bill was timely and warranted. Not only that but it was a responsibility that Parliament had. I was surprised at the time. I have seen a lot of Liberal legislation come through the House and for the first time we had a bill that had real clarity of language, lacked ambiguity, and opened the door to an extension of tolerance enjoyed by all Canadians to a certain group in society when we recognized same gender marriage. Most importantly, at the same time there was clear protection for religious marriage because of the protection of the charter. We have moved forward in an important way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing I would like to say that I cannot agree that this motion would restore the traditional definition of marriage because, quite frankly, the so-called traditional definition of marriage is not, has not, and will not be threatened. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if this motion were to pass, it would immediately lead to a court challenge that would put this issue on the table for years. What are we going to do with the 12,000 gay and lesbian couples who have already married in this country? How can we take a right away from them or provide a right to others that we cannot extend to gay and lesbian couples? It is very problematic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know firsthand the entrenched views of many people who would deny the right of civil marriage to same gender couples. Yet, I know there is a lot of tolerance in this country. Often I hear there is less tolerance in rural Canada and I frankly disagree with that. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think rural Canada is even more tolerant than the rest of the country. We have a long and proud history of being tolerant of our neighbours and of other points of view. I will say in this place that we should extend that tolerance to all people in Canada.</div>

He was one of the few members of his party who supported gay and lesbian marriage. I do hope he has more company this time around in the ranks of his fellow Conservative members when we vote tomorrow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is very little for me to quibble with in his speech, but at the beginning of his remarks he said that it was not inappropriate for there to be review of legislation, that it was appropriate for Parliament to undertake a review. I want to take him on a bit about that because I wonder why it is necessary now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From my perspective, I do not see any crisis in marriage which would lead me to believe that kind of review is necessary. Also, I do not think it is something that we regularly do, especially when we have rulings and have made decisions on important equality rights and important human rights issues in this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I do not think we ever undertook a major review in this place of women's rights, nor do I think that would be appropriate. I do not think we did a major review of interracial marriage rights, nor do I think that would be appropriate. I do not think we did a major review of divorce legislation, for that matter, nor do I think that would be appropriate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the member why he might concede that this kind of review is appropriate when it comes to my rights as a gay person in this country, when it comes to my right marry the person I love. Why does he think this kind of review is appropriate so quickly after we made that decision in the House?</div>

    </p><a name="Para336256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is fair to say that pretty well everyone here is suffering from debate fatigue. I have been in Parliament since 1997 and this issue has been bubbling up in one form or another since then. It appeared in resolutions. It appeared on pension rights. I was part of the justice committee that travelled across the country and got our report usurped by the decision made by the Court of Appeal. Then, of course, it culminated in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue does keep coming up over and over again. The votes have been, to varying degrees, whipped votes. That in some respects has skewed the results, leaving those who see marriage as I do, as being between a man and a woman, somewhat dissatisfied. Had the votes not been whipped, I would suggest that possibly the results might have been different.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason that this debate comes up over and over again is a resentment on the part of a lot of citizens, including my constituents, in that they do not like the courts taking unilateral decisions and in effect usurping parliamentary authority on a rights-based analysis in what is ultimately a very complex societal issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I respectfully submit that this is not the way in which to get societal consensus. Since over the last 10 years we have been trying to get societal consensus on this--and possibly there is some movement--I respectfully suggest that whipping votes and having courts inappropriately usurp parliamentary authority is not the way to get societal consensus.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that other countries, those that have adopted same sex marriage, in fact have moved legislatively. They have not had to respond to particular court decisions, so it has been the initiative of the legislatures rather than the courts. I suggest that a fear of what the people might say or think is always a bad thing in a democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to turn to the motion itself. I would describe this motion as a bit of a false hope motion. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> made an election promise, or more accurately a half-promise, during the last election and got himself into a bit of a jam. He was repeatedly asked whether he would use the notwithstanding clause. An honest response would have been, of course, to say that he would, because in order to effect any real change, to effect an override on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A>, we are going to have to use the notwithstanding clause. If there is anyone who has a legal opinion to the contrary, I would be interested in hearing it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless there is in the motion itself a commitment on the part of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> to use the notwithstanding clause, I would respectfully suggest that this is a debate that really is largely a rhetorical debate, with much sound and fury signifying not too much at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously we have heard from a lot of people who are wrapping themselves in the charter. Generally they are the people who oppose the motion. My only comment to those who oppose the motion while wrapping themselves in the charter is that part of the charter is the notwithstanding clause. The framers of the Constitution, the framers of the charter, felt that there was a necessary override at times. That is the only way and the only basis on which those framers would allow a charter to come forward. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially we have a debate between those who conveniently ignore the notwithstanding clause and a <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> who will not say whether he will use it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to frame my views somewhat differently, though. As we know, a lot of politicians get criticized for being less than forthright, for constantly bobbing and weaving and taking somewhat different positions, and I can see why that is, because to take a clear and unequivocal position on an issue such as this is simply to be held up to public ridicule, in part, and no one likes to be ridiculed publicly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at the risk of painting a target on my head, here is what I believe. I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, period. I do not think I can make it any shorter or clearer than that. I may have to be taken out to re-education camp, but nevertheless I still believe that.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1955"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1955"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1950"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1955">(1955)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman and it is the central institution in society by which society perpetuates itself. That is the core reason for marriage. It is the central bridging institution. It bridges between the genders and it bridges back into previous generations and it bridges into future generations. I take those as self-evident truths. That is the core reason for marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is why society effectively builds up a legal, a cultural and even a religious net around the couple: because it has to. The laws and norms that are around the institution of marriage between a man and a woman exist to protect particularly the women and the children, who are products of that marriage or who enter into marriage, during their vulnerabilities and their dependency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effectively, the laws and the cultural norms, and even the religious norms, mean that a man cannot walk away from a marriage relationship without having the law and the culture impose this web of obligations and responsibilities on him. Similarly, we could say the same thing for a woman walking away from a marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core purpose of marriage is societal perpetuation, and if marriage did not exist, we would have to invent it. Every society that survives in fact creates a strong web of laws and obligations, and societies survive only if they do so. If marriage is just about a couple, then we simply would not need this net of cultural and legal obligations and norms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to turn now to the exceptions, because I know that of course some marriages do not have children. They are childless. That still does not detract from the core purpose of marriage. It is simply an exception to the norm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course common law relationships produce children, but I respectfully submit that common law relationships are statistically not as stable as marriage, for all its flaws, and they are more difficult particularly for women and produce inferior outcomes for children. There are notable exceptions, and I do not want my email to be busted overnight with people who say, “But my kid is perfectly fine and we had a great relationship in a common law relationship”. As a statistical truth, this is true.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, single people produce children, but as we know, parenting is a tough slog when two people are raising a child. When it is one person raising a child, it is tougher again by some exponential factor. Society reacts by stepping into the breach, albeit, how shall we say it, inadequately, and in some manner replacing either the missing mother or father.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I go back to my central point that marriage, for all its faults and all its failures, is the best institution for crossing the gender barrier and for the continuity of society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proponents of same sex marriage have been successful, however, in limiting the debate to simply a rights analysis only. Their argument starts with a conclusion. The conclusion is that marriage is simply a relationship between two people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it follows, as we back up through the argument, that if it is merely that--and I do not believe that, as I hope I have demonstrated--if it is merely a relationship between two people, then it matters not what gender the people are. And therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that it is discriminatory to have a situation in which marriage is only between men and women and that it can be between any gender if we follow the logic of that analysis. I respectfully suggest that this is in fact dubious logic and it guts the core reason for marriage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be consequences. We cannot renovate the institution with nothing happening or expecting that nothing will happen. I expect the first consequence will be that heterosexuals will accelerate their detachment from marriage. There is a trend that is already there. We see more and more couples living together. We see more and more couples living together and then getting married. In both cases, there is less stability in those relationships.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, and more troubling, consequence is that we will need to redefine parenthood and limit children's rights. We already see the same sex couples, who are inherently sterile, asking courts to declare that their child, conceived by whatever means, is in fact their child, regardless of the biological rights. As Margaret Somerville has said, “society to become complicit in intentionally depriving children of their rights with respect to their biological family”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach by those who advocate for same sex marriage has been to simply gut the rationale for marriage and turn it into a relationship between two people.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say traditional marriage, I mean the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. It is important to note that marriage is an institution dating back to the dawn of humanity that has existed in all civilizations.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of my colleagues noted, by changing the definition of marriage, the previous Liberal government undertook a radical social experiment whose consequences for children, for social stability, for freedom of religion and for civil society are completely unknown. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1999 Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of the sanctity of marriage as being the union of one man and one women to the exclusion of all others. The then Liberal justice minister, Anne McLellan, stated:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage is unique in its essence; that is, its opposite sex nature. Through this essence, marriage embodies the complementarity of the two human sexes, playing a fundamental role in Canadian society.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let me state again for the record that the government has no intention of changing the definition of marriage or of legislating same sex marriages”. Those were the exact words of the Liberal justice minister during the 1999 debate. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have now seen that the last Liberal prime minister and justice minister double-crossed them.

He, with the previous prime minister, rammed it through committee, were antagonistic toward committee witnesses favouring traditional marriage, cut short debate and then forced their cabinet ministers and parliamentary secretaries to vote in favour of their bill, with no regard to the personal consciences of these MPs or to the will of their constituents.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now speak on the impact of marriage on the most valuable and yet the most vulnerable members of our society, our children. I believe children thrive in families and families are based on marriage. While the essence of this debate concerns adult relationships, we must recognize that the debate on marriage has a direct impact on the welfare of our children. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is the goal of the government to protect its citizens, particularly its most vulnerable citizens, it is, indeed, appalling that the previous government turned its back on the most important and fundamental component of our country, our children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be clear, defending the traditional definition of marriage is also about defending the rights of children and of defending their best interests. Our children are entitled to the best possible circumstances in which to be raised. Studies have demonstrated that this best possible circumstance is the family, consisting of a mother and a father in a continuous and stable relationship.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canadian Parliament voted to change the definition of marriage, I believe it did so without giving any consideration whatsoever to the rights of children. There is no mention of children in the Liberal government's reference to the Supreme Court and none in the reply. The rights of children and the impact of changing the definition of marriage on children were completely ignored.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Canada signed in 1991, states that every child has the right to know and be raised by his natural mother and father whenever possible. Article 3 of the same UN Convention states:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By failing to recognize the special nature of marriage as a union based on mutual commitment between a man and a woman, which is the only relationship that can produce a child and protect that child's right to know its mother and father, Canada is putting the rights of adults ahead of the rights of children. That is unacceptable. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children have been ignored within this debate. We have focused on adults to live as they so choose, but we have forgotten our children.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children of same sex couples are deprived of the right to be raised by both a mother and a father. They do not have role models in the home to teach them and to show them how to be wives and mothers, husbands and fathers and they do not have the opportunity to experience how a man and a woman live out their married life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that defending traditional marriage is about doing what is right, what is good and what is best for our children. Therefore, marriage between a male and a female must hold the priority of place for the raising of children and must be maintained in order to safeguard the rights of children.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that France's parliament recently undertook a thorough study of same-sex marriage and published a report on the subject in January 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A French commission studied the impact of same-sex marriage on children and found that the best interest of the child must supersede the freedoms of the adult, including parents' lifestyle choices. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major good of marriage between a man and a woman is procreation, that of bringing new life into the world.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remind my fellow MPs that our time as an MP is short, even when we think it is long, and when we cease to be MPs, sadly, we will likely be forgotten by our fellow man, but not by God, who knows each of us intimately.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that we are faced with a judiciary which in the Ontario Court of Appeal decision basically discredited the family and said it was discriminatory to deny same sex couples equal access to marriage.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it leaves us with this predicament that this motion is asking Parliament to call on the government to introduce a piece of legislation to reinstate the traditional definition of marriage.

I have delivered the children of lesbians who have carried the child to full term just like any heterosexual woman. I have delivered the children of gay couples. This is exactly about children. This is about giving all children in Canada the equal right to be legal under the law, to have the legality of marriage which currently they are being denied.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More to the point, this does concern children, and children have a right to a father and a mother. The rights of children take priority over the rights of adults in the way that they want to live or the way that they would choose to live. </div>

    </p><a name="Para336345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn the attention of the House back to a vote we held in the last Parliament on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38, An Act respecting certain aspects of legal capacity for marriage for civil purposes</A> While this bill contained some proposals that I agreed with, it also sought to do something that I fundamentally disagree with, namely to change the traditional definition of marriage. When that bill came before the House, I voted against it. I voted against it for a fundamental reason, namely, I believe in the traditional definition of marriage, marriage as defined between a man and a woman. For me, this is a matter of my own personal faith and conscience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as both a parliamentarian and a lawyer, I believe in the equality of citizenship of all Canadians. This includes providing same gender relationships with the same legal protection and the same benefits under the law as all other Canadians enjoy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in the separation of church and state.

I fundamentally believe that churches and other religious institutions alone should define marriage. Government, on the other hand, should simply register these relationships or unions. These were some of the reasons that I voted against the legislation in 2004. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Conservative motion we are debating is one which I find to be seriously flawed. As parliamentarians we have to make responsible decisions for our constituents and with our constituents. We have to know what we are voting for and with this motion we do not know. This motion does not define what the government classifies as a civil union for example. It fails to define what rights and protections would be guaranteed in these relationships. If on the one hand the House is voting on a motion to produce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage, how can the proposed law at the same time respect existing same sex marriages?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a clear and irresponsible contradiction which I cannot and I will not support. We are all equal before the law. The proposed legislation that the motion calls for would create three classes of citizens in Canada and this is simply unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were serious about this issue and not simply playing politics, it would have prepared legislation so that we could study the implications of voting on this motion. It has not done so. This too is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly we have come to expect this type of underhanded approach from the government. It is a government that is dividing the country, pitting one region of the country against another, pitting one group of Canadians against the other. It is a government that is far more interested in crafting policy based on right-wing ideology than on what is best for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it sad that the government is playing politics with an issue that has been so divisive for Canadians. I believe that the role of the federal government is to unite Canadians from all over the country, not to pit one group of Canadians against the other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion that the government has presented to the House of Commons is divisive. It is vague. It is misleading. Frankly, it is unconstitutional and legally unenforceable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear in conclusion.

The first part of the resolution states, “That this House call on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage”. If the government had stopped at that point, that might have been palatable to all members, but it goes on to state, “without affecting civil unions”. I read the right hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister's</A> platform and he specifically did not make reference to civil unions. The motion goes on to state “respecting existing same-sex marriages”.

    </p><a name="Para336370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is proceeding with a free vote on the definition of marriage, which is exactly what did not occur during the last debate on this matter. I wish I could be making this speech under better circumstances, but since that is not possible, I am going to present before the House, my constituents and this nation the unfortunate truth of the matter. The truth is the following.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Parliament is being compromised in its democratic principles. The House of Commons of the 39th Parliament in truth would vote in favour of restoring the definition of marriage to its traditional form if an actual free vote was held. Among those who believe in restoring marriage are members from all parties. I know this because I have spent much time over the last nine months speaking with members from all parties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have done my research in an exhaustive manner and the unfortunate tragedy is that the true score may not be the final tally when the votes are counted tomorrow. This is because in our day, at a time of supposed intellectual freedom and open minds on a foundational issue of such importance and consequence, members of Parliament are at this very moment being pressured, either by outright and open oppression by their leaders or through hidden but powerful political pressure by these very same people, to vote against their conscience and against the will of their constituents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are enough members in the House, composed of both men and women, who are personally and intellectually convicted that marriage should be restored to its traditional form. I believe these members represent the will of Canadians across our country, but many in this majority that I believe exists have been suppressed into silence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this vote fails, it will be for this reason and the traditional family will be further damaged in a time when it has been constantly under assault. So, it is with disappointment that I say that unless leaders relent or members are inspired to stand against this intellectual suppression tomorrow, the voted will of the Canadian people may in fact be thwarted again and democracy will suffer another blow as seems to have often happened on pro-family issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the eleventh hour, I would like to take the opportunity to make a two-fold plea. First, I plead with opposition party leaders. Each of them hold democratic ideals. They believe in freedom of thought, honesty and integrity, which are essential ingredients for a healthy Parliament. These things they have championed in Quebec and Canada during every election campaign. Yet, at this crucial moment in Canadian history, they are either openly or discreetly attempting to seal closed the intellects and tape shut the mouths of those who oppose them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are seeking to impose their own will upon Canada in a manner that betrays the very founding principles of our democracy and society. They are also violating the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The first and most fundamental freedom listed in the Canadian charter states that each person has the freedom of conscience and religion and, second, the freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media communications. How can it be that in our Parliament, the heart of our nation, members are being forced to express and vote the very opposite of that which they believe and think?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a partisan speech. I do not believe that this should be a partisan issue. I do not care at all for winning political points on this matter. How can any of us play politics with the family? On my part, I refuse. I have worked with members from all parties in the House and encouraged them on this important matter. I have found friends and allies in all parties who have fought with me in defence of traditional marriage and the family. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these many allies, I am fortunate that I am allowed the freedom to speak my mind on this issue and to vote as my intellect bids. I feel that we must all be allowed to do the same and so it is with trust, hope and goodness that I now make my plea. I would ask leaders of the opposition to please encourage their members to vote in accord with the way they really think. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make another plea. I plea to every member in the House. I know that throughout the year politics and partisanship unfortunately take up much time in the House and issues sometimes suffer because of it. Today we should put that aside.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2040"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2040">(2040)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can speak for no one but myself, though I am sure many others share my thoughts. I would like to suggest that when members cast their votes tomorrow, they should cast it as free persons, for the good of Canada, and based on their own intellect and how their conscience instructs them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would also like members to consider freedom of culture. As an aboriginal Canadian, I would like to point out that most within my community are in fact the most traditional, family-oriented people in the country. It is a requirement within my culture to consult one's elders on important matters such as this. My elders have clearly told me that small, isolated aboriginal communities must continue to teach their children that marriage is between a man and a woman. One elder told me, “What message would we be giving our communities if we did not teach our children the importance of traditional marriage?”</div>
    </p><a name="Para336382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another gave me a powerful example. She said, “Consider the colour orange. You could define it as being a combination of both red and yellow. If someone decided that orange should now also be defined as a combination of red and red or a combination of yellow and yellow, what would orange mean to you? The word would be without meaning and you would have to create an illusion in your mind to reconcile this deception”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell members that people from all backgrounds are starting to realize the brave new world that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> brought us into. It is an undefined path with unknown consequences. One thing that has been demonstrated by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> is that Parliament, through its elected members, has the ability to change the legal definition of marriage. It has already done so just last year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, Parliament may also choose to alter this definition, based on the will of the people or the courts. Who can predict what future rulings the courts might impose on marriage?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Parliament has a majority of MPs who may in fact vote in favour of restoring the definition of marriage, though some will not be allowed to vote the way they want to. Tomorrow, I will be able to vote freely, with honesty and integrity. I hope that my colleagues in this House will be allowed to join me. If it is permitted and if democracy works tomorrow, then this House will move that marriage be restored in its traditional form and Canadians will prevail.</div>

Not only is our federal government involved with marriage according to our Constitution but, very significantly, each province issues marriage licences that enable people to become married. In fact, when we dealt with that issue and voted on it, we found that many provinces, Ontario being the lead, were offering marriage licences and people of the same sex were being united in matrimony. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that with changing seats in the House there are new individuals who have entered into this place who are very much alongside on this issue in terms of their traditional views. I believe that, unfortunately, members from the Bloc have also had a whip on this vote. There has been an active campaign to bring in the 28 or so Liberals that remain in this House to vote against this motion. Unfortunately, if we had those numbers in place this motion would pass. Nonetheless, that campaign is on and all I can do is simply attempt to appeal to those individuals and ask them to change their mind.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one is a regular citizen, one has a right not to have a public opinion, to remain quiet, to say “I do not know”, to be unsure enough to decide even not to make up one's own mind, let alone influence others. As a member of Parliament, I lose that right. I have to stand and be counted because a decision must be made, yes or no, and the public has the right to know what I decide so they can decide about me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring no special expertise to the issue of same sex marriage. I went to church as a child. I loved hymns and, at times, the feeling of church, the quiet and community of it, the getting dressed up, the family together and the niceness of it. I did not read the Bible except to memorize a few parts for Sunday school. I found the 10 commandments interesting for what was included and what was not. I thought the name “The Golden Rule” pushed a little hard and yet I am not sure I have heard 11 such simple, non-pushy words, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”, that offer a better personal or societal path to life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many years ago, I decided to read the Bible from beginning to end. The experience only confirmed what I had vaguely felt for most of my life, that the Bible offered the best thinking and understandings of a time, a place and people. It reflected how people explained to themselves the world, how the world worked, how people should behave and what would happen if they did not. Much of the wisdom of the Bible has held up in different times and places for different people, but to me no wisdom is timeless. Each is challenged by a new time. Some pieces of wisdom last, some do not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thinking about same sex marriage, I have only the experiences of my own life to go on. I am not sure when I first heard the playground words kids used for homosexuals. It was certainly many years before I knew what they meant. The words were intended to punish, to hurt. They said, “You are weak”, “You are not a man”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I knew better what they meant, I do not think I ever believed that anyone I knew really was one. There were rumours and whispers intended to put down somebody someone wanted to put down. Somebody somewhere surely must be one, I knew, but nobody in my world. I have since come to know that kids I knew very well, kids in my own class, were gay or lesbian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have thought how impossibly hard it must have been for them. As teenagers, all of us had to struggle so hard to figure out what was going on in our own bodies and minds, having strange things begin to happen to us, which surely were not normal and must make us bad. What would the other kids think if they knew? What would our parents think? There must be something wrong with me, darkly, dirtily wrong, and we were the lucky ones, the ones who never had to confront the possibility that we were going in the unthinkably wrong direction. We had only to find a way to do acceptably what was acceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What must it have been like for the others? How often must they have thought themselves hideous and unspeakable?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more recent decades, I have seen what this exclusion has done to people. I have seen them forced to twist and contort themselves to hide and pretend just to get the chance to do the things they wanted to do in life, having about them one big fact that to others completely defines them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think now about the untold lives this has directed and shaped and the untold lives it has destroyed. This is so far from being right, it is outrageous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up knowing that marriage was something that involved a man and a women. Kids eventually seemed to be a part of marriage because that is how life worked, but they did not have to be, as many very good marriages did not produce kids. I thought marriage was something that people did when they loved one another so much that they could not stop themselves from committing to each other privately, and then in a public ceremony, vowing that they wanted to be with each other forever.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2050"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2050">(2050)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never thought of marriage as something that could involve a man and a man or a woman and a woman. I never thought about a man and a man or a woman and a woman loving each other in a marriage way. I have thought about this question more in recent years. How do I feel? Like most people I think, not entirely comfortable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is hard, even when we live on the majority side of things, of race, language, culture, religion, sexuality. Our biggest challenge as human beings is to get along, to learn about each other, to accept differences, to give the same chance to others to live their lives as we would like them to give to us and to allow others to share fully and completely in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also hard to have to think again in a different way about something we had always experienced differently, like marriage. I think the great majority of Canadians on either side of the same sex marriage debate are not 100% sure or comfortable. That is important to know. In the midst of this often heated debate, it is hard not to be swayed, usually in the reverse direction, by the words and tone of the advocates who scream their certainty, who tell the rest of us that we must surely be stupid or at least depraved if we are not as certain as they are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is okay to be 60-40 or 70-30 on this. As the debate more and more attempts to polarize us, it is important to know that on one side of the question or the other, most of us have more in common than it seems. It is important to know because it will help us immensely to get along again, as we must, when all this is done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these decades later, with the vote ahead of me, where am I? For me, man and woman, man and man or woman and woman, marriage is for two people who love each other, who want to be with each other and who privately and publicly commit to each other. I support same sex marriage and I will vote against the government's motion.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental foundation of government in Canada is democracy. Ultimately, we elected officials are responsible to our constituents. In June 2005, democracy was betrayed by the former Government of Canada, in part because it did not allow a free vote in caucus and in part because it felt the need to rush the debate and move closure on the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in Canada were left both disillusioned by the former government's handling of the situation and angry that the government saw fit to redefine marriage as opposed to simply enshrining and extending equal rights and benefits to same sex couples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument often used by those who profess to be people of faith and who voted in favour of redefining marriage is that there is a separation between church and state. I would humbly submit that, to begin with, that is an American principle. Second, the separation of church and state was set up to protect the church from the state, not the state from the church. The state has no business in the churches of the nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a Charter of Rights and Freedoms issue. The charter reads:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para336436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage in the charter specifically indicates that ultimately faith influences how this House makes law, as the supremacy of God will ultimately dictate how the laws of the land are crafted by parliamentarians.</div>

From marriage, through the family, flow love, charity and the basis of good citizenship dedicated to the common good. All great civilizations have had their beginnings and derived their strength from recognition of the key role of marriage and the family. </small></td>

The process by which this was done was flawed in a number of ways, not the least of which was the fact that our elected representatives were not allowed in all cases to vote in accordance with their consciences. This time, as Members of Parliament consider such a crucially important issue, their vote must be a free one.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter of rights does not speak of a right to marriage. Marriage is not an inherent right. Even churches do not marry all heterosexual couples who enter their doors. The churches can and do deny the marriage of some couples who come forward to them. There is no right to marriage, but there is a right to equality in Canada, and I would be among the first in this House to defend that right if it were ever challenged.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries have looked at this issue. Indeed, the United Kingdom recently passed a civil partnership act, an act that specifically extended the rights of marriage to same sex couples. Perhaps some of the members of this House witnessed the ceremony of Sir Elton John not that long ago. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which the United Kingdom dealt with this issue was respectful to all citizens. It respected the churches. It respected tradition. It respected the rights of gay and lesbian citizens. It respected the democratic majority that opposed redefining marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In France, the government is no longer involved in marriage. There, couples must first obtain a civil union from the state and then, if they wish, they may seek a religious or faith based marriage subsequent to obtaining their civil union.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Canada more progressive than the United Kingdom or France? Are we onto something that the overwhelming majority of nations have yet to figure out? I do not believe so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received thousands and thousands of letters from my constituents asking, if not demanding, that I vote to restore traditional marriage at the soonest possible opportunity. In fact, I would venture to bet that every member in this House has been overwhelmed by the same requests. I ask members to set aside their partisanship and restore Canadians' faith in democracy, I call on all parties, their leaders and their whips to allow their members to vote freely. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would the New Democratic Party choose to be the least democratic party in the House? Its founding leader, the late Pastor Tommy Douglas, a Baptist minister, must be turning in his grave. His staunch beliefs would certainly not have allowed him to sit as a member of the NDP today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is about faith. It is about tradition and democracy betrayed. Parliament can enshrine equality for same sex couples and it should, but Parliament had no right to change the definition of marriage. I call on all members of the House to support the motion before them.</div>

I am going to talk for a minute about voting one's conscience. When I first came to the House in 1993, we heard the Reform Party say before every vote that its members were going to vote a certain way except when told by their constituents to do otherwise. We had a vote on the Québécois as a nation and every one of the government members was whipped to vote for it or at least abstain. If they voted against it, they were going to be kicked out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have news for the members opposite. I have voted my conscience against a three-line whip because I believed the legislation was wrong. I did it on the Citizenship Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the anti-terrorism legislation. I am a person of free will. There are no guns and no rifles. We are not going to be hung if we vote our conscience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really do not appreciate a member on the other side, who has yet to stand up against his government, lecturing other members who have voted against a three-line whip. I think this is a total canard. I wish the member would find a different type of argument and tell us why he did not vote his conscience on the last piece of legislation when he was told to--</div>

    </p><a name="Para336471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may surprise everyone in this House to know that I am fully aware of what the interpretation was of the quote of Christ that I just made, but it was not meant to be singly with regard to taxation. It was meant to divide the issues of church from state. If we think of the political institutions within which Christ was functioning at the time, the state of Rome was occupying his land at the time, but we will not get into that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may surprise many in this House to know that I was brought up a Catholic. I managed to get straight As in every single one of my religious studies and I thought I would become a nun when I was around age 18, so this has absolutely nothing to do with religious belief. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a physician, I came to understand when I saw patients in my office that there was one group in this country that was discriminated against under the law purely because of sexual orientation. Those people were denied access to medical care. They were denied access to pharmacy care. They were denied access to benefits. They were indeed the last group in this country who were treated unequally under the law. I made a vow when I ran for Parliament that I would change that. I learned as a physician that I must put aside my own personal feelings and morality and beliefs because if I become a physician I believe in the charter and the charter is here to speak about equality of rights. This is about equality under the law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court clearly said in answer to the questions we gave it, to give gays and lesbians equal rights to marriage under the law was purely a right of this Parliament and a right of the federal government to define marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People here talk a lot about civil unions. Civil unions are a jurisdiction of the provinces. The federal government cannot grant civil unions. It could only do one thing and that was to be responsible for the definition of marriage. That is why it brought about a change in the definition of marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go over those age-old arguments that I made in this House on every occasion I had an opportunity to do, but I will not do that. I want to speak against this motion as it stands for three reasons. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this motion is doing something that I consider to be absolutely abhorrent by a government. It is taking away a right already granted by Parliament under law. It is taking away the rights from a minority group. The only reason I believe that a state should remove a right already given is if that group is a danger to society, so someone has to prove to me that gays and lesbians getting married is a danger to society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason a right should be taken away is if that right harms and prevents others from having that same right. No heterosexual marriage has been denied as a result of same sex marriage. To remove a right purely because of political will is a slippery slope that concerns me greatly, especially when I attach that to other things the government is doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has removed the court challenges program, the program for those in our society who are unable to afford access under the law to claim their rights under the charter. It was there for those who are vulnerable and those who do not have the money or the ability to speak for themselves. The Conservative government has taken that away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask ourselves, if the government takes away rights from people with whom it does not agree ideologically or morally, who is going to be next? What other minority group either by virtue of its ethnicity, race or religion will the government see fit to remove that group's rights if the government disagrees with that group's way of life, culture or manner of worship? This I consider to be an extremely dangerous thing because it is ideological to the extent that it is very, very dangerous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a second reason I will vote against this motion. The Conservatives have argued that there was too little debate. I was on the justice committee which travelled around this country for months speaking to Canadians everywhere about this issue. At the end of that journey, we all came back here and came up with the recommendation to the Government of Canada to change the definition of marriage to the one we have today that we call civil marriage.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2115">(2115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Canada spoke to the committee as it travelled around. This issue was debated three or four times in the House every moment that we could debate it. Finally, Parliament agreed. Whether it was a slim majority or not, Parliament voted and it agreed to grant this right under law to same sex couples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I see here is the government is disrespecting the will of Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I even heard some people here say, “Well, we are new here and therefore we did not get a chance to vote. Or we just got re-elected and therefore, we should now vote on something new”. Does this mean that the government will bring back every single law that has been passed in Parliament because some members are new and want to vote on them? What are we talking about here? What is happening to this place into which we are voted and in which we believe that when a law is passed the law is there and cannot be revoked unless circumstances have changed? No one has shown me that circumstances have changed to revoke civil marriage. That concerns me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine provinces are now allowing civil marriage. The courts have spoken in each one of the provinces of Quebec, B.C. and Ontario with regard to this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we go again. The government not only disrespects Parliament's will but it disrespects the will of the provinces. It disrespects the will of the courts in those provinces. The government has absolutely no respect for the institutions of this nation. This concerns me greatly because here is a government that is beginning to believe that it is a dictatorship, that it can make the decisions it wishes to make because it does not agree with anyone else and it will keep going and going until it can change those decisions, until it can have its own way. This is what concerns me about this whole issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about dividing this country. There have been so many things that have been brought down since the Conservative government has been in power that have divided people in this country. Here is one that is dividing again. Let us look at the scenario. Over the past year and a half there are same sex couples who have married. They are legally married under the law. The government has agreed to grandfather those. Now the government has divided a minority group. Within that group there are those who can marry legally and then there are those who will never be able to marry legally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone asked what that means? It means that the charter would strike this down, because we cannot have one set of rights for some within a group and then deny others in that same group those rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see here is the worst kind of political gamesmanship. It has been typical in this Parliament with the Conservative government. It has always been political gamesmanship, a one-upmanship and a gotcha kind of mentality so the Conservatives can satisfy their own groups that wish them to bring this back and then, with the worst kind of cynicism, knowing it will fail, they can turn to the groups and say, “Okay, we did it and it failed. We cannot do anything more”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the integrity of this place? What happened to respect not only for the law but for this Parliament and this House? </div>
    </p><a name="Para336491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have created a democracy in this country that is more than merely the rights of the majority. Under the charter, we have permitted a unique democracy in the world, where minority rights are upheld under that charter, where groups that are too small to have a voice have one, where groups that feel they might be second class citizens in this country do not have to be. This has created the greatest order and social cohesion in a diverse nation. This is at risk. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fundamentally disagree not only with this motion but with all of the slippery slope that it entails. If we look carefully at what is happening here, it is not only disrespect, it is disrespect for the law, it is disrespect for Parliament. It is in fact a very cynical move by this government as it moves forward to deny minority rights to those who ideologically it does not believe should have rights because it does not fit into the Conservatives' nice little vision of the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be voting against this motion and it will be with my conscience fully and completely intact.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we truly value children in the House, then we must understand, as one of the hon. members spoke about children, that this is about the rights of the child, regardless of what their parents do, do not do or who they are. That is precisely what we are talking about here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are same sex couples who have children. Lesbians carry children to term and I have personally delivered them. Are we going to divide this country into those children who are children of certain couples and children who are not? Are we going to say that some children have more rights than others? Are we going to create second class children in this country based on an ideology that we believe some children are not worthy and others are? That is precisely what is being said here and I abhor it.</div>

In marriages with families there is a responsibility to the children, to bring them up in love and to give them the things that they need.

I also rise today for my constituents who have overwhelmingly communicated to me that they support our government's efforts in re-opening this debate. I must say that I also have the pleasure of personally sharing the same view as the majority of my constituents. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot stress enough how passionate the constituents of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78665,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78665&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Lambton—Kent—Middlesex</A> feel about this issue. Of the thousands of letters, calls and emails that I have received from my constituents on this issue, they have voiced their displeasure in the changing of the definition of marriage. I have also received numerous petitions from my constituents calling on our government to revisit this debate and restore the traditional definition of marriage. Every day more of my constituents come forward to express their disapproval of the changes in the definition of marriage, changes that were made without the free will of Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage has been an honoured institution that has stood the test of time and is one of the key foundations on which our society has been built. For thousands of years marriage has been recognized as the union of one man and one woman. Since Confederation and until recently marriage in Canadian law has been defined as the voluntary union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I along with the majority of my constituents believe that the traditional Canadian marriage debate needs to be revisited and eventually agreed upon by a free and democratic vote in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also mention that I hold the view that same sex couples deserve the same rights as those involved in traditional union. I believe that same sex couples should have the same financial, property and other forms of rights as traditional couples, and that the meaning of the term marriage be preserved as the union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe in denying certain groups their rights while enhancing the rights of others. I would find it difficult to support any legislation that would impose on the freedoms that Canadians enjoy. I feel that religious institutions have been denied a full say in this debate and in turn have seen their religious freedoms put at risk. I find it worrisome that priests and ministers can be disciplined in refusing to marry same sex couples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year France rejected the marriage of same sex couples because of the effect that same sex marriages have on children. The French published a report that raised many important questions. In the report the commission said that the child represents the future of society. The commission also asked French legislators to ensure that children confronted with alterations in family models be taken into account and not suffer from situations imposed upon them by adults. It added that the interest of the child must take precedence over the lifestyle choices of adults.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a stern reminder that children have rights, rights that need to be taken into account. It is a reminder that our personal lifestyle preferences should never take precedence over those of our children.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this party we support a member's democratic right to vote with his or her conscience. Unfortunately, this right was not supported by the previous leadership of the Liberal Party. Hopefully, the new Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition, along with the leaders of the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Québécois will right this wrong and allow their caucuses to practise their democratic right and allow a free vote on this issue.</div>

Democracy has not had such an opportunity to live and to grow in this country for quite some time.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will repeat what the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78713,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78713&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Centre</A> said when she talked about how we fight hatred and exclusion with the weapons of mass inclusion. That is very important, and it is a very significant statement. I hope her statement gets written in the lexicon of Canada and we keep it in mind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up during the desegregation fight in the United States of America. Politicians in the states made a political career out of fighting against desegregation. They were governors of various southern states and they stayed in office for a long time. I am talking about people like Lester Maddox and George Wallace. Black children were killed trying to desegregate schools.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring this up because there was a time when it was okay to discriminate against someone because of their colour or their race. I look to the states in that respect because the most dramatic pictures were presented to me as one growing up in the late fifties and the sixties. We saw dogs going after blacks. We saw police and horses trample blacks. It was okay at that time. There was a long struggle. Civil rights leaders aroused a lot of emotion, Martin Luther King being just one. He paid for his struggles with his life. His speech “I Have a Dream” is very famous. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an incredible amount of discrimination in Canada. First nations are an example. It was not until the sixties and seventies that they were allowed to even vote, to have the franchise. We know what happened to Canadians of Chinese and Asian origin. We know about the people from the Ukraine, people who were interned. We know what happened to the Jews and the policy of none was too many. We had a blatant racist immigration policy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was all these things put together that resulted in Canada's recognition of the fact that we are a collection of minorities. There is no majority in our country. It was at that time when there was the realization that if one minority's right could be attacked one day, another minority's right could be attacked some other day. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April 17, 1982, was a very historic day, when Canada got its Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is an important guiding document for us. It acknowledges and it is an answer to the injustices that happened to many people in the past. It gives us guidance for the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamental rights are spelled out in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is a living, breathing document. One of the sections in the charter is the equality section. For members who are having trouble understanding the charter, it is the job of the courts to interpret it. The reason for that is very simple. When it comes to basic human rights, we do not want to trust that to the whims of the capriciously elected politicians who will at times exploit it for all the wrong reasons. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very disconcerted as to why we are having the debate. We have dealt with this issue. Why are we debating it again?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will provide a bit of my interpretation, and I alert whatever viewers there are to visit a website, which is dawn.thot.net/harperstiestousa/american_right_report.pdf. It talks about a Conservative movement in the United States and how it wants to control the political process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that George Bush got elected in the last presidential election because he was able to exploit the whole issue of same sex marriage by trying to pass wrong constitutional amendments on that issue. Lo and behold, he happened to win the state of Ohio without which he would not have been President.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a very good book that I would recommend to my colleagues in the House, particularly on the other side, but mostly to the viewers of this debate. In particular, I want to draw attention to a person who was an employee in the Bush White House. His name was David Kuo. He was working with religious based organizations that were very much assisting the Republicans in the United States to get the vote out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote a book called <i>Tempting Faith: An Inside Story of Political Seduction</i>. It talks about the way the Bush administration referred to the Christian organizations working within the White House as nuts, goofy and people who are to be exploited for political gain. I recommend that book to all members of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the reason we are debating this issue today is not because the Conservative Party thinks it can change history or overturn the legislation. It is not going to happen. It might come as a surprise to the party that most members in the House happen to believe in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that human rights and civil liberties should not be left to the capriciously elected. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a free vote in the Liberal caucus. If members of the House at any time feel strongly that in their conscience they cannot support a vote, even if they are whipped, they have the right to stand in the House to vote against it and vote their conscience. I need no lectures from the members of the Conservative Party on having the right to vote my conscience. On issues I strongly believe in, I do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another piece of news for members of the Conservative Party. I supported this when I was in the minority, but the majority of Canadians support the legislation and, further, are proud of the legislation. If the Conservatives ever talk about following the wishes of their constituents, which they always bring up, they should understand that their position now is a minority one. Just like the leader who walked with dinosaurs, that is where those folks are going.</div>

There are many more important issues for us to tackle here in Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we even contemplating taking away the rights of anyone, the right to love and to make a lifelong commitment, the right to share the challenges, joys and commitments of marriage? What do the hon. members who say they are defenders of traditional marriage think they are trying to prove? </div>
    </p><a name="Para336564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in this House to serve the people and to protect the charters and Canadian ideals of equality. We are in this House to serve and to fight injustice. We are not in this House to limit the rights of any citizen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gays and lesbians have the right to serve this country. They have the right to serve in the military. They have the right to serve the public as members of Parliament. They have that right, as they should, as they all should. They are not second-class citizens. This is a country that attracts visitors from around the world because we believe there are no second-class citizens. We believe that everyone can lead a life of respect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would any member of the House dishonour Canada's greatest quality and demean this country by calling for second-class citizenship for anyone? </div>
    </p><a name="Para336567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my own wedding two decades ago, my partner and I called out for recognition of same sex marriage. We could not understand why our gay and lesbian friends could not find the joy of expression, that freedom of expression that we had that day. We did not see same sex marriage as a threat to our marriage or anyone else's. We saw it simply as an affirmation of love.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, we have had the privilege of seeing Canada take the lead in the world. We have taken the lead in this truest test of a society; the dignity and respect we accord all citizens. We have taken the lead and that should fill every member of the House with joy and pride.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the pride and joy of attending many same sex weddings, from the very first one which was performed at Toronto's city hall when I was a city councillor. It was the marriage of Michael and Michael, followed by Alison and her partner. There were tears of joy, of relief and of celebration that finally the couple could stand tall in front of their families, friends, neighbours and the communities and they recognized the respect for the commitment with each other. What a moment it was, the smiles on everyone's faces, radiant to all participants and even to bystanders who happened to walk by. It warmed everyone's heart. How could it possibly be wrong when there is so much love involved?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of Parliament used the UN declaration of rights of children as an example that somehow this is wrong. The UN declaration for the rights of children said that there needs to be housing, food and shelter and the right to be respected. Yes, the right to be respected. Every kid's parents, whether it is mom and mom or dad and dad, should be respected. Children need to feel proud of who they are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about another occasion at Toronto city hall when many Americans came to Canada to get married. It was a joyous and amazing occasion for them to finally have a chance to fulfil their lifelong dream. At one moment someone stood up and started singing O Canada. It just spread. There was that sense of pride among Canadians that finally Canada was standing up for equality. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish every member of the House, all the Conservatives and some Liberals, who seem to think that same sex marriage is somehow wrong, would join me in standing up for equality and sharing that love. I ask them to open their eyes, their minds and their hearts because the joyful expression of love and commitment harms no one. It is a positive force.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate demeans this House. We must put this matter to rest, as Parliament already decided two years ago and as the courts decided. Instead of taking the time of this House to try to stigmatize loving people, we need to get to work on fighting injustices in our world and stopping pollution. We should not tolerate intolerance. We must remember that if we take the rights of someone else, we jeopardize our own.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must keep moving Canada forward, not backward. Let us celebrate loving commitments, not demonize them. Let us move on.</div>

        <div><b><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78987,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78987&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mr. Chris Warkentin (Peace River, CPC)</A>: </b>&nbsp;<span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1823885"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_right.gif" border="0" alt="next intervention"></a></span></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks by commending all Canadians who have had the courage and the diligence to speak to or write their member of Parliament on this particular very important issue. Regardless of their views, their responsible and diligent involvement is vital to the survival of our democracy. It is our duty as parliamentarians to give full consideration to the concerns of those who have sent us to this House to represent them. I thank the many people from Peace River who have contacted me on this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I recognize that what is popular certainly is not always what is right. Moreover, the fundamental human rights of an individual or a minority cannot be subject to the whims or the discretion of the majority or the vocal or powerful lobby groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As parliamentarians, we have a duty to seek what is true and what is just. For that, our constituents expect us to look not only to them for direction but also to the collective wisdom of those outside this brief and narrow intersection of time and space that our lives and our current culture represent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be said that while older traditions provide good guidance, we cannot follow them blindly, and with this I am in full agreement. However, as a society amazed by the speed of our own technological advancement, the greater risk is that we succumb to the naive or vain assumption that revolutionary changes necessarily lead to progress.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decadence and the decline of previous civilizations in the midst of great material prosperity should always stand as a warning to us. If we dig deep into their histories, we often find beneath the veneer of material prosperity a hollow core, the inner life having gone away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the major world religions that still speak to the human spirit, we find that they share teachings of respect for human life and dignity and a sense of self-transcendence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have to share in these religions' premises or beliefs in order to acknowledge that many of the values they encourage and the wealth of the human experience they contain are valuable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we cannot impose a moral or legal code derived exclusively from a particular religious faith, neither can we dismiss reasonable ethical considerations simply because their conclusions happen to be shared by religious faiths or because the people who bring them forward are from those religions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these considerations, I also wish to commend those of my colleagues on both sides of this House and on both sides of this debate who have been diligent, have asked themselves what is right, and have had the humility to seek the best advice and the courage to stand up for the best answer they have found regardless of their political or personal consequence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also say shame on any of us who put our own political and personal interests ahead of those of our fellow citizens, especially those who are the most vulnerable: our children and our children's children. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shame on any of us who denigrate or dismiss the contribution of our fellow citizens on either side of this issue simply because they are guided in their consideration by their religious faith. If the reasons they put forward are reasonable, let us listen to them, whether we share their religious faith or not. To do otherwise would clearly demonstrate a lack of objectivity, if not radical bigotry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of my colleagues whose opinion differs from mine, I wish to briefly outline why I consider it vital that we give full consideration to this matter and further reconsideration to the issue of marriage, despite the divisiveness that it might bring.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, however, I should note that this would not be the first time the House has reconsidered this issue. On June 8, 1999, the House voted overwhelmingly, 216 to 55, to maintain the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2205"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2205">(2205)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I should add that this is not necessarily the last time that our society will consider this issue. Within months of Parliament's 1999 vote, lower court rulings extended the definition of marriage to include same sex relationships, but in 2003 the government of the day decided to stop the appeals process on the issue, essentially tying the hands of Parliament and the Supreme Court of Canada on being able to reinforce the 1999 decision in the House. Although the justice committee conducted cross-Canada hearings on the issue in 2003, it never reported those findings back to the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When consultations were cut short, the Canadian Parliament voted to change the definition of marriage. In that vote, many members of the House were forced to follow a party line. Moreover, many members of the House made decisions and still maintain their positions based on a mistaken assumption that the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of same sex marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even this week, I have heard the same misleading references to the need for the use of the notwithstanding clause should the current legislation be revisited. The Supreme Court has never stated that preserving marriage as a union between one man and one woman contravenes the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. While lower courts have made rulings on this matter, these rulings have never been tested at the Supreme Court level. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important, none of the lower court rulings have considered children's rights. Moreover, there was no mention of children in the previous government's reference to the Supreme Court and none in the reply. Thus, the marriage law was changed without giving any consideration whatsoever to the rights of children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stark contrast, the French National Assembly studied this matter at great length and published a 450 page report in January of this year that took a position opposite to Canada's. It did so exclusively to protect the rights of children. It cited the UN convention on the rights of children, signed by Canada in 1991, which clearly states that, to the extent possible, every child has the right to know and be raised by its mother and its father.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer, something happened to me that changed my life. I became a father. I am sure that I do not have to tell members that when a new life comes into one's home, everything changes. Suddenly the most important thing in my life is the protection of my daughter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that any parent in this chamber tonight can relate to the fact that when we bring a new child home from the hospital, the main preoccupation of any new parents is to protect that child from any harm, real or imagined. I have to say that for the first number of weeks I was a little nuts. There was no question that my daughter was my pride and my joy and any thought that she might come into harm's way ripped my heart out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, as a new member of Parliament who was not here for the last debate, I cannot believe that the previous government never considered the effects that this decision might have on our nation's children. In its haste to push the issue through, the previous government forgot to consider the impact that this change might have on our children. There was no study done. There were no meetings held. No experts were called as far our children and the rights of children were concerned. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mind if hon. members call me a paranoid new father, but I strongly believe that we have a responsibility to the most vulnerable and the most valuable citizens to at least consider what is in their best interests. There has to be a collective desire. Where is our collective desire to ask the questions that need to be asked? Other countries have done so. Why cannot we?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask my fellow parliamentarians, my colleagues who are also parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, to join with me and ponder why we do not have the time to consider our children. I am not asking for a divisive debate. I am not asking for long and drawn-out consideration. I am simply asking for a chance for our children to be represented in the discussion. It was missed the last time this issue was brought to the House for debate. We have to rectify that by opening up this issue, like France did, and examining the impact that this change may have on future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same way that my heart is dedicated to ensuring that my child is protected, our collective heart should be set on ensuring that our nation's children are given a voice in this debate.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are going to pick and choose the children that we give rights to, then we do not really care about children as a whole. We only care about the kinds of children who come from the kinds of parents that we think are worthy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are we to decide what children are worthy? Either we believe in children and we love children or we do not believe in children and love children, all children. Every single child in this country deserves the right to be equal under the law and deserves the right to know that his or her parents can be married. When I hear about children, I become very concerned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the marriages of those people who cannot have children? What about heterosexuals who do not have the ability to have children? Should their marriages be annulled? I would like to ask the hon. member that question.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. member knows, we have a few members in our own party who have made the decision, for a variety of reasons, to vote against this motion. Tomorrow they will vote against it, but what will happen after that is what illustrates the key difference between us and the other parties in this House on this important issue. Cabinet ministers will not be forced to resign, as it was in the Liberal Party. Our colleagues will not be run down in nominations, as Bev Desjarlais was in the NDP the last time around.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one question for the member. How legitimate would this vote be tomorrow if we whipped our members to vote with the rest of the party, especially in light of the absolute sham of a vote imposed on this House the last time around?</div>

    </p><a name="Para336611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly I believe that is one of the issues that was certainly neglected in the past, but there was also the issue of the whipped vote. I believe that this is an issue on which Canadians must be represented. From my constituency, I have hundreds and hundreds of letters, if not thousands, that have asked me to vote in favour of this motion to reopen the definition of marriage and to bring back the traditional definition of marriage. Certainly I believe that it is important for all members of Parliament to respond to their constituents and represent them on this issue.</div>

Each and every decision was that there was discrimination in terms of the equality provision of the charter, but that section 1 was an override. That section 1 override said that it was demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until July 2002 and the case of Halpern v. Canada. The Ontario Supreme Court heard this case on the existing definition of marriage. Only a year earlier a same sex case had come before a B.C. court, which was before this Ontario court case. One said it was demonstrably justified and that the discrimination was justified.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember being at Canadian Forces Greenwood in Nova Scotia on a parliamentary exchange and I was in my bed reading the decision in the Halpern case and it was very difficult to read. Effectively, the case discredited heterosexual marriage by citing divorce rates and growth in common law relationships. It also dismissed the importance of the ability to procreate, citing the availability of reproductive technology, such as artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, surrogacy and adoption, just to name a few.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the flavour of the court, the case and the arguments being made, all of a sudden we were challenging what happened in the B.C. court decision by looking at marriage and the distinctive characteristics of marriage and trying to discredit them to the point where it might tip the balance in terms of the section 1 analysis in the charter, in other words the section 1 analysis which allows one to discriminate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 10, 2003 the court concluded that the existing legal framework was discriminatory since it failed to provide fair public recognition of gay and lesbian unions. The decision also stated that the infringement could not be demonstrably justified under section 1 of the charter, citing that the exclusion of same sex couples from the right to marry served no identifiable, pressing or legitimate government objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view this view summarily dismisses the relevance of marriage to any aspect of social well-being of Canadians, which in fact is one of the reasons that we are here. It is to protect the health and well-being of all Canadians, especially our children, so I would absolutely disagree with the decision in Halpern which was the tipping point. Members will know that subsequent to that Ontario Court of Appeal decision, eight other provinces went along with copycat decisions basically making it discriminatory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how we got here. As a consequence of that, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> came to the House, but it was not an action of a government; it was a reaction of a government to judicial proceedings and to judicial decisions. There is no question that we were faced with a situation that the definition of marriage was deemed to be discriminatory and the section 1 analysis did not save it in that particular case.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before the House is:</div>

            <td><small>That this House call on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages.</small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para336621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ontario Court of Appeal decision that denied marriage to same sex persons was in violation of the equality provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This decision was also reached in another eight provinces. In the reference to the Supreme Court, the important aspect here is that the court concurred with the conclusions of the lower courts. It absolutely concurred. In fact, the Supreme Court decided and it made a decision in the reasons for judgment that it would not overturn the decision in those courts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of a sudden it was the law in Canada that the government could not discriminate by excluding same sex persons from being married. It is the law today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To introduce a new bill, which this motion proposes, to reinstate the traditional definition would not in fact be charter-proof. It would not be charter-proof and it would be challenged by the courts not only federally, but in the nine provinces where it is law today. This is the opinion of over 150 eminent constitutional authorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that these cases would take seven to 10 years to work their way through the courts. This thing would be with us forever and this is just not acceptable.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2220"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2220">(2220)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only would such a bill be unconstitutional, but the motion deals with civil unions which are a provincial jurisdiction. In addition, it would create two classes of same sex couples, those who could marry and those who could not. Their children could not marry but the children's parents or their guardians would have been married. It is a very awkward situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a legislator, not as an individual who wants to just take care of my own values and my own issues, but as a parliamentarian, I have to vote against the motion. The reason I have to vote against it is clear. The motion is improper. It is asking Parliament to undertake a legislative process which is unconstitutional. It also asks us to deal with something that is beyond federal jurisdiction. Technically it is wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say a prayer when we start here in the morning that we are here to make good laws and wise decisions. We cannot. As a matter of fact, if the motion were simply as was promised during the election campaign by the Conservative Party to reopen the debate on the definition of marriage, I could vote for it. But this motion was a little clever by a half and it spoiled it for a lot of people. The motion now before us really is disingenuous and it really is only to satisfy an election promise and would surely fail in its present form. The government knew that. That is my view. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today during the debate on the motion, I asked the government House leader if he would just simply forget this motion and table a piece of legislation to reinstate the traditional definition of marriage. The question was not answered and yet the Conservative Party form the government. It does not need the approval of this place to table a piece of legislation. I say table it if it can. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitutional experts have said that a piece of legislation cannot be tabled that would summarily change the definition back because it would be constitutionally invalid. It is not charter-proof. The only way, and I said this when I gave my speech on February 21, 2005, is to invoke the notwithstanding clause.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that it is straightforward in the laws of Canada now, in the charter, that one cannot discriminate or treat Canadians unequally. The only way around that is to change the charter and there is no party in the House of Commons that wants to do that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree fully with my colleague's analysis of this particular motion. In fact, I was thinking of asking the Speaker to rule it out of order for the same reason in that the motion asks to do something which has already been proven by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy is that had the former Liberal government properly consulted with Canadians on this issue, we would not have to have this debate tonight. The Liberal performance on this highly contentious issue has been appalling. Rather than listening carefully to Canadians and then allowing a completely free vote by members of this House, the Liberals instead rammed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> through in order to avoid any further scrutiny.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more appalling is that the prime minister of the day, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, forced his cabinet and parliamentary secretaries to vote against their consciences and against the wishes of their constituents. Shame. Sadly, it appears that nothing has changed. There is a new Liberal leadership, but still the same bullying tactics. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the new leader from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A> voted in favour of the traditional definition of marriage just seven years ago. In 2005, he voted against the definition of marriage. Yesterday, he implied that all Liberals would have to vote against the traditional definition of marriage. Today, he says they will not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is embarrassing, not only to the Liberal leader and his party but also to Canadians as a whole. Canadians demand transparency. They demand clarity. They demand freedom of conscience and they demand a democratic process, things they were not getting from the previous government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, under a new Conservative government, we are delivering on a promise which we made to Canadians during the last federal election. We promised a truly free vote on the definition of marriage and today we are delivering on that promise. It is indeed sad that a number of the opposition parties have refused to allow the same thing for their members of Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any Canadian who respects the democratic process, this vote is absolutely necessary and perhaps the crux of this is respect. That is why we are having this debate tonight. The previous government lacked respect for the strongly held convictions of millions of Canadians. There was a lack of respect for beliefs held by people of faith all across Canada. There was no need to change the definition of marriage in order for gays and lesbians to establish meaningful, long term relationships that are recognized in law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the previous government decided to move ahead anyway without consulting Canadians in a meaningful way. In the process it has divided the country when it was totally unnecessary to do so. By redefining the term “marriage” we tell people of faith from all religions that their opinions, their freedom of conscience and speech, and their strong convictions are not important in the public debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate tonight is about respect. We are not asking to re-open this debate because it polarizes Canadians. We are asking to re-open this debate because the issue was not settled by Canadians, it was dictated to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an issue of protecting charter rights. This motion is very clear. It recognizes the traditional definition of marriage while at the same time respecting the rights of all Canadians to enter into legally protected same sex relationships if they so choose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the previous vote on June 29, 2005, our government has proclaimed that this vote on marriage will be a free vote to all government members, including cabinet ministers and parliamentary secretaries, but the freedom that prevails in the Conservative Party has not unfortunately been afforded to everyone in this House. That is the tragedy of tonight's debate. Something as important as defining one of the cornerstones of our society, namely the definition of marriage, will not receive the consideration that it is entitled to.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not present in this House when this issue was last debated. I have read some of the speeches and statements made on both sides of the issue. I believe that all of the reasons against changing the definition of marriage were well articulated by many of our members while Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> was debated and I do not think I need to recapitulate all of those reasons here tonight, but I do want to say a little about my own community of Abbotsford, British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbotsford is a multi-ethnic and multi-faith community, incredibly diverse and incredibly tolerant. This is a community that has temples and churches. It has communities of all faiths. I carried out a survey in my community. In the survey that I conducted, an overwhelming majority of my constituents believed that this was a very important issue, and they let me know in no uncertain terms that they believed we should return to the traditional definition of marriage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election, I made my position and my support for the traditional definition of marriage very clear to the people of Abbotsford. That is why I am completely at peace when voting in support of this motion which is to reconsider the issue of redefining marriage, to return that definition to the union of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the previous government did not want to listen to people who did not share its thoughts on marriage. It showed a lack of respect and a lack of respect for people of faith. That is why we are debating this matter tonight because, for most Canadians, especially those who embrace religious convictions, this issue is not closed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same sex couples may enter into whatever manner of relationship, arrangement or situation that they may desire, but they should not call it marriage because that is a concept that has been clearly understood for millennia. Same sex couples, whether as a couple or as individuals, possess the same democratic and economic rights as any other Canadians in our society. In fact, given the high level of tolerance and acceptance in our society, gays and lesbians can hardly be considered disadvantaged or lacking any of the rights and freedoms that all Canadians take for granted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the liberty of reviewing the same sex reference case, which was a Supreme Court of Canada decision on this very issue. My friend across the way suggested that it is now established law that we must redefine marriage as including same sex relationships. I studied that decision very carefully and the member across the floor will know that the Supreme Court was asked four questions. It answered three of those, one of them being whether it would be against the charter to actually redefine marriage as including same sex relationships. However, the third question the Supreme Court of Canada deliberately chose not to answer, and that was, if we retain the traditional definition of marriage, is that a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? The Supreme Court could have ruled on that. It had the opportunity. In fact, it chose not to, clearly referring the matter back to this House of Commons, the duly elected representatives of this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is on that basis that I can fully support this motion. I believe in the traditional definition of marriage, that we can retain that without violating the charter, provided that we have legislation in place which also protects the rights of same sex couples to enter into civil unions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been here since around 5:30 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. I have listened as best I could to all the folks who made interventions tonight, well thought out presentations. I was very impressed with the sincerity of all the presentations. I compliment every member of the House who made a presentation here tonight because of their interest, their input and particularly the sincerity with which they talked. I think they all deserve a great round of thanks.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constituents of Thunder Bay—Superior North, as well as myself, support the traditional definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1585203,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1585203&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-38</A> became an act respecting certain aspects of the legal capacity for marriage for civil purposes. It was passed in June 2005. I happened to not be in favour of that legislation and I voted against it. However, the fact of the matter is the majority of the people in the House voted for that legislation and it became the law of the land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many times and many occasions that we sit in the House and wish it would go some place else, but it will not. The final determination and the role of all members of Parliament is we have to accept those occasions where our wishes are not looked at with the degree of sincerity that we think they should be, but we live with the majority ruling of the House. Today we are faced with the law of the land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the motion in front of us, and I have asked this question several times, asks the permission of the House to bring in a particular piece of legislation. It is the first time, in all the years I have sat here, I have seen a government ask for permission to bring in legislation, although I stand corrected on this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always thought the government, if it were truly intent on getting something properly passed, would bring in the legislation, it would be debated, it would go to committee, it would come to second reading, it would go back, it would come back for third reading, like all legislation should. I say this and I stand perhaps corrected, but I have never seen this happen before, and I wonder as to the wisdom of this type of motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as we debated the motion, I found out that it did not allow for any amendments. I cannot understand why, when people in the House come together and debate as we have tonight, we do not have the opportunity to make some amendments to get a reconciliation of our thoughts so we can come down to good legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> You guys agreed to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Joe Comuzzi:</b> I heard that remark, Mr. Speaker, but I do not recall ever being told about amendments. As a result, that was why I made the observation about being unable to bring amendments to this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all tired, it is almost 11:00 p.m., and I think a lot of us have not had the opportunity to leave. Therefore, I leave two issues. First, it is the first time I have ever heard of a motion asking for permission to bring in legislation. Second, we do not have the ability to bring in amendments to a motion that should pass.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me close by saying that the constituents I represent in Thunder Bay—Superior North, as well as myself, still support the traditional definition of marriage as between a man a woman. However, for the reasons that I stated, there is political opportunism here that I do not think should be counselled by the chamber and I would hope members would reconsider their position on putting forward this motion tomorrow.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also challenge the member. If this motion is defeated, it basically shuts the door.

It is part of our Constitution. What we are debating today in the general sense would be unconstitutional. It would be illegal .</div>
    </p><a name="Para336708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As passionate as people feel on any side of this, there is no use in debating it as it would be breaking the law. It would be unconstitutional under the present Constitution, of which many, if not all, parliamentarians are very proud. Certainly our party will stand by and defend the rights of the people of Canada as defined by the Constitution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two particular rights in the charter that are pertinent to the discussion we are having tonight. One is the right of religious freedom. My colleague from the NDP referred to it. However, on the other side of the coin, the Supreme Court has always protected freedom of religion. Churches can choose not perform same sex marriages, and that gives respect to the right of religious freedom.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side there is the right of equality. All Canadians have to be treated equally. That is a right under the Constitution, so we cannot make a law that denigrates that right by treating Canadians differently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one way to achieve that is to amend the Constitution. It is parliamentarians and not judges who make the law. Parliamentarians wrote the charter and the Constitution, and those can be amended. That is open to any party to propose in the House of Commons. At any time, any Parliament could move to change that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite proud that all the parties in this Parliament, in the House of Commons, have said they refuse to do that. They refuse to change the Charter of Rights and Freedoms because all Canadians should be treated equally. I am proud members of Parliament have made that decision on the charter. For that reason, this debate should not proceed because it could not result in a legal outcome.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I am proud of parliamentarians from all parties for refusing to override the rights of small groups and minorities or the rights of any Canadian to be equal. I will stand by that as my input to the debate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard him repeat again what we have heard before in this chamber on this issue, and that is that somehow it is against the Charter of Rights to leave the definition of marriage as being the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks about the opinions he and his party have received. Is he aware that there are numerous eminent constitutional scholars who disagree with them quite vehemently. They have actually stated that retaining the traditional definition of marriage is no such violation of the Charter of Rights provided there is substantial legislation to preserve the rights of same sex couples to be united in a civil union?</div>
    </p><a name="Para336717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind him that different groups in our society have special rights, where there is not an equality of rights. I look at our first nations. They have the food ceremonial and social right to fish. We do not scream bloody murder about that. We do not say that is a violation of the Charter of Rights. It is constitutional. There are many other instances like that, so there is legal opinion on the other side of the debate.</div>

However, it is a huge balancing act when we have two separate rights, the right of religious freedom and the right of equality. It is almost inevitable that there will be some clashes of these rights and overlap. It will require the good and sensitive judgment of Canadians. Canadians have a great history of coming up with solutions to difficult problems. As much as possible, each right must be given the respect it deserves. We will leave that to the leaders of this country. Hopefully they can keep making the decisions as they have been and not lead to problems.</div>

    </p><a name="Para336743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a new member, as are many of the members here. When I first sought election in 2004 this issue was one which my constituents were really not aware of. There was some indication that there would be a vote. At that time the member of Parliament in my riding indicated that he would vote with traditional marriage, but that was not the case. As a result, in the next election there was an incredible surge from my constituents, an incredible uprising of people who felt that they had been deceived and had been let down by their member of Parliament. I think largely as a result of that, I am here today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say that bar no other issue, this has been the number one reason that people write to me and people talk to me. Let us not kid ourselves, this is a big event.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a surprise that we as a party promised during the last election campaign that we would revisit this issue, so here we are today. The Conservative Party has done what it said it would do. We have brought forward a motion that gives an opportunity to those who are on the other side from all parties to vote with their conscience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can argue until the cows come home whether or not this is constitutional, but we all know there is a large segment of the population, our constituents, who are telling us that they want this issue revisited. They want us to look at this again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our leader, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, offered this very simple motion. It is something on which we can all agree. Let us look at this issue again and debate it. Let us give this a proper place in the House, so that all our constituents can feel at ease with whatever decision is made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay the challenge out to my colleagues on the opposite side. I understand there are pressures and we all have these pressures to do the right thing. We have heard from members on the other side. I understand there are conflicting views. It has been said and it bears repeating that this is an institution which for a millennium has been the same. There has never been a question. We have provided means for those who want to live another lifestyle. This is a free country and we understand that. Yet this institution, this basic building block of our society is being challenged. It is that question we are faced with today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all at the threshold of a decision tomorrow. Where will we go? Will we duck under constitutional amendments and will this hold up in the charter, or will we do what our constituents have asked us to do, to look at this issue again and say, “Yes, let us revisit it”. Let us be fair about this. I am going to have my opportunity, as are other members, and let us bring this out one more time and let us talk about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge and urge members to listen to their constituents, as I am going to listen to my constituents. Again it bears repeating that every day I receive letters asking me to please revisit this. I am sure other members are finding the same thing. I ask members to do the right thing tomorrow and give their constituents the voice that they expected to be given.</div>

The previous member mentioned that there was a whipped vote the last time with three rows of ministers and parliamentary secretaries. That is not true.

If the member can say that the majority of his people have said do not revisit this again, then the member is doing what he said he would do.

    </p><a name="Para336763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been involved in this issue for the last 13 years, because pretty well over that whole length of time this issue has come before the House from time to time. As part of my academic work, I have taken the time to do a lot of reading about what marriage actually means. I have read a number of articles and books in which the real meaning of marriage is delineated, defined and set out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it very clear that some of the charges we sometimes get that we are not tolerant are just simply untrue. As a matter of fact, I want to illustrate that by indicating that there are several members of the House who have declared themselves as being non-heterosexual. On several occasions when I have had an opportunity, I have tried in a very real way to befriend them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one of them stayed in the same hotel that I stayed in. He came out of the hotel at the same time that I did and had neither coat nor umbrella, but I had a car and I offered him a ride. We had a nice little chat. I am not prejudiced against these individuals. In fact, and I will say it in the true sense of the word, I truly love them. I think we ought to reach out to them in the same way we do to anyone else. There is no thought there of being discriminatory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it comes to the issue of family and marriage, it is a tradition, one that has withstood the test of time over centuries, that family is comprised of a mother and father and usually, but not necessarily, children. I think that parents have the obligation to raise their children and I think the children have the right to know who their parents are. This is one very important thing that I have not heard being debated here today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para336767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are some situations where children grow up with foster parents or adoptive parents and do not know until sometimes later in life and sometimes never what their biological roots are. As a member of Parliament, I have had several individuals come to me and ask for help in finding their biological parents. I do not know what it is about them, but somehow there is an innate need for them to know who their mom is and who their dad is. There is no such thing as an anonymous parent, not to these individuals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege of listening to a young lady speak not very long ago who made the statement very explicitly. She is one who was born through the use of technology. She was not able to find out who her father was. It became almost an obsession with her. I think we have the obligation to go to the best level and that is to make sure that when children grow up they have the knowledge of and the right to know who their parents are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to assure the members of the House that when they vote in favour of this motion they are doing the right thing. This is a motion which simply asks the House to express itself as to whether or not it is the members' desire to call on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage. That is what the question is. It is very explicit. It has a couple of add-ons: “without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages”. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T2325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2325"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2325">(2325)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para336770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true, but the nub of the question is whether we should call on the government to introduce legislation. At that stage, let the government work through the constitutionality, the legality and all of those other details. I believe it can be done. I believe so strongly in it that I am going to vote for this motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge all members who have even the slightest idea that they want to maintain the definition of marriage that we have known and understood for so long to vote in favour of this so that the government can act on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336772"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para336774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he said that we have to reach out to these people. I am just wondering if he could elaborate on why we have to reach out to these people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he said he had done a study on marriage, an academic study, which I am very happy about. I know that he is a very studious member of Parliament. I wonder if he has done any study of equality and I wonder what he found out.</div>

I remember a speech distinctly since I heard her say it. I have read it. I have a copy on my computer and I can get a copy to anyone who wishes to have it. In fact, I distributed many copies of this speech when I was asked about this issue over the last five or six years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speech I am referring to is the one by the then minister of justice, the Honourable Anne McLellan, who said, and I think I can quote it from memory fairly accurately, that we can address the issue of “equality” without “changing the definition of marriage”. I believe that is almost an exact quote, and that is from the Liberal minister of justice of the day in 1999.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, when this issue has come before the courts, until pre-1999 or thereabouts the courts were consistent in saying that to maintain the definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others was not unconstitutional and did not violate any rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we say the Supreme Court is infallible when, after five years, it has changed its mind, presumably? Although I do not believe it has: it is quite clear to me, when I read the reference that was given to it, that the Supreme Court said it was up to Parliament to define it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to equality, I think we also need to address the fact that it is not necessary to offend large groups of people in this country in order to achieve the results of equality. I believe that it is not necessary to offend them. We heard today from the natives of our country. We have had a number of people of different ethnic backgrounds and a number of different religious groups who are unanimous in saying, “Let us keep the definition of marriage”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para336781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, of course, we want to make sure that those who are otherwise persuaded are not discriminated against, and that is a sense of equality, which I also support. I think that is the answer that member needs to hear.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a motion before us that calls on the government to introduce legislation.

    </p><a name="Para336787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason this question is before the House is that we honestly want to ask the members of this House whether they want this government to introduce legislation to address this issue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that member is just hiding behind a smokescreen on the constitutional issue. If it were unconstitutional, why would the Supreme Court have put it back into our court in referring it to Parliament?</div>
