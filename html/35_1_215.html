<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MEMBERSOFPARLIAMENTRETIRINGALLOWANCESACT">MEMBERS  OF  PARLIAMENT  RETIRING 
ALLOWANCES  ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 8 consideration of Bill C-85, 
an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain provision, as 
reported (without amendment) from the committee; and on 
Motions Nos. 1 to 7.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to debate Bill C-85, the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act, and the amendments the government 
proposes. I am doing it in the short time that remains, given the 
closure and time allocation tactics of the government.
<P>
	The amendments to the bill submitted under my name and 
under the name of the member for Calgary Centre have four 
main functions. First, to bring the members of Parliament 
pension plan into line with the private sector, both for MPs and 
Senators. Second, to allow MPs in this and in all future 
Parliaments to fully opt out of the pension plan. Third, to impose 
a Canadian citizenship requirement on all plan members. 
Fourth, to subject members pensions to the same clawback 
provisions that exist to old age security, something the Liberal 
government had opposed when it was in opposition but now 
seems to believe is fully acceptable for ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	We are debating the first set of motions. Motion No. 4 
provides that if a province separated, members of Parliament 
from that province would not automatically draw a pension from 
the Canadian government. This is the effect of proposing a 
citizenship requirement. We will be very interested to see 
whether it is the intention of the government to guarantee 
pensions to members who eventually may not be citizens of the 
country.
<P>
	I have heard some comments from members of the separatist 
party in the House that they do not care what is happening in the 
House because they will not be here in the fall anyway. I happen 
to think they are wrong and they may be here much longer. In 
any case this raises an interesting question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is because the members of the Bloc Quebecois are insisting 
that Quebec is going to separate in the coming year, I suppose.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> This amendment in fact reveals 
the strength of their convictions on this objective.
<P>
	Bloc members' intention to guarantee their own Canadian 
pension or participate in this retirement pension plan indicates a 
lack of confidence in the possibility of separation. I suppose 
there is an element of sacrifice in the sovereignty project. 
Interestingly enough, the Bloc Quebecois is proposing putting 
Quebecers in a position to lose the benefits of Confederation, 
including pension benefits, but is pushing here for the adoption 
of the Parliament's pension plan.
<P>
	I would suggest that one way to show their good faith in the 
matter would be to vote for this amendment and to support the 
idea that things like pensions need to be negotiated, if, by 
chance, Quebec should really separate after the referendum.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It will be interesting. I doubt the Bloc will be prepared to take 
such a daring step in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The effect of Motions Nos. 1 and 6 are to change the opting 
out provisions so members of future Parliaments can make a one 
time decision to opt in or out of the plan during the first 60 days 
the House sits after they are elected. Reform MPs will save 
taxpayers over $38 million by opting out and clearly in the 
absence of substantive changes to the plan future 
parliamentarians must have this option as well.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	We will keep in mind that the failures of the government are 
starting to add up. While it may reject some of the populist 
measures used by my party I expect the next federal election to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13514"> 13514 </A></B>
<P>
be very much a referendum on issues like MP pensions. I do not 
believe by any means this issue will go away even if government 
members defeat this amendment.
<P>
	We will see as in the Ontario election this is a hot issue and 
will still be a hot issue in the next federal election. Voters will 
ask for members to cut their pensions without any increase in 
pay, a suggestion which I think is perfectly reasonable.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 2 and 3 change the bill so that a member who 
dies before the expiry of the 60-day decision period is assumed 
not to have opted in. Bill C-85 automatically opts these people 
in. I guess Reformers would rather assume the best of people 
than the worst of people.
<P>
	It seems strange the government would make the default 
option here an assumption of action of opting in. I understand a 
lot of pressure is being placed on backbench Liberals to opt into 
this plan so the driving forces of the plan, the Prime Minister 
and the Deputy Prime Minister, do not look too bad. Forcing 
dead MPs to opt into the pension plan is taking the idea of party 
discipline to new heights or to new depths even for the Liberal 
Party.
<P>
	We know who will bear the brunt of the public backlash of this 
in the next election. It will be the Liberal backbenchers who did 
not really support the plan, who were told to participate and who 
if they lose the election will lose all pension in any case. This is 
really a remarkable coincidence of both lack of intelligence and 
lack of integrity coming together on an issue.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 5 and 7 change the bill to allow all members to 
opt out completely. Under Bill C-85 MPs who as of October 
1993 already had six years of service could only opt out of 
benefits earned after the last federal election, thus creating the 
terms trough regular and trough light which we like to refer to, 
the two tier system.
<P>
	We have talked already about how this inability for longer 
serving MPs to completely opt out of Bill C-85 creates the two 
tier system. However, this is a minor issue in my opinion. The 
real issue is the two tier system between MP pensions and what 
is available to other Canadians.
<P>
	One of the witnesses who testified before the committee 
which studied this bill, and I use the term studied very loosely, 
Mr. Brian Corbishley of Edmonton, testified the pension 
proposed under Bill C-85 is about seven times more generous 
than a typical public sector plan and four times more generous 
than a typical private sector plan. Mr. Corbishley's testimony 
and others should be listened to much more carefully and much 
more seriously than some of the government members seem to 
take this issue.
<P>
	In Alberta Mr. Corbishley's firm, Peat Marwick, proposed a 
pension scheme for MLAs much less generous than that which 
existed in Alberta at the time. The plan in Alberta at the time was 
almost identical to what the government is now proposing.
<P>
	In the heat of the pre-election build up in Alberta the 
government refused to significantly alter that plan to deal with 
the objections of taxpayers and citizens and it was increasingly 
looking like that government would face defeat in the election. 
Ultimately Mr. Klein ended up abolishing the plan, a major 
factor in his winning the election and doing some of the good 
things in Alberta he is now trying to do.
<P>
	What is interesting about this, and I urge Liberal members to 
consider it very carefully, is ultimately a half hearted attempt to 
reform the MLA pension plan in Alberta resulted in MLAs in 
Alberta having no pension plan whatsoever, a situation which I 
do not think is ideal but which will result if the government 
follows the course it is on.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	I urge members once again to consider some of these 
amendments. They will significantly alter the bill to make it 
more acceptable to the public. Ultimately the public will find 
this bill unacceptable. We know the MP pension plan will die 
because of the unreasonable form it is in today. It will die in any 
form and there will be no increase in compensation that the 
members on the other side so earnestly desire and do not 
deserve.
<P>
	In any case, I ask them to consider these amendments and I 
thank them for their patience.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make a few points with respect to the 
amendments put forward by the hon. member for Calgary West 
because they deserve some comment.
<P>
	They are clearly amendments-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You already gave your comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> No, I have not spoken on the bill. This is the 
first time I have spoken to the bill at this stage in the House. The 
hon. member should be pleased that he is getting a balanced 
approach to the bill instead of the twisted rhetoric that the 
Reform Party is engaging in.
<P>
	I want to point out a couple of things that are important to the 
Canadian public in viewing the bill. We are hearing a great deal 
from members of the Reform Party about wanting to abolish the 
pension altogether. They say that if we get rid of these pensions 
then everything would come up roses and we would solve the 
problem.
<P>
	I want to point out first of all that some members of the House 
were elected at a time when there was not significant discussion 
in the House or in the country about abolition of these pensions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13515"> 13515 </A></B>
<P>
	I draw the hon. member's attention to the 1988 election. He 
was a Tory then and was working for a Tory member of 
Parliament who was seeking re-election and who was going to 
earn a pension. He may have already qualified for all I know. 
I do not know who he was working for in those days but he was 
very supportive of the whole thing. There was no public debate 
about pensions in 1988.
<P>
	Many members who were elected at that time in good faith 
left their employment, took a reduction in the earnings they had 
on the basis of a certain salary that was stated to be the salary for 
members of Parliament plus the possibility of earning a pension 
at the conclusion of their term of service in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	The pension was generous. It is generous and remains 
generous. That is true. However the members of Parliament who 
entered the lists, as it were, for the election in 1988 and in all 
previous elections did so on the basis that at the end of their term 
of office they would be compensated in some way that was 
generous but was designed to make up for the loss of income 
they suffered in being elected to Parliament in the first place.
<P>
	The hon. member is now saying that those people had 
expectations that were out of line, that they do not qualify to 
receive the pension to which they are entitled under the law. 
These people in the Reform Party want to change the law to 
prevent those persons from receiving those pensions.
<P>
	I can understand their approach when only one of them has 
qualified for a pension, when only one of them was a successful 
candidate in 1988. In fact she lost in 1988 and then got elected in 
a subsequent byelection. There was not a single one of them in 
1988 and they were not talking pensions big time during that 
election. It was a non-issue.
<P>
	It was a non-issue for me in 1993. Nevertheless, the members 
of the Reform Party insist that members who were elected 
before are somehow pigs at the trough because they were elected 
under a system of remuneration which they are now accepting.
<P>
	Most people enter a career looking at the remuneration 
package and seeing what it is like. When they are successful in 
either choosing the job or in this case getting elected to the job, 
they are then told by Reformers who come along later, Johnny 
come latelys if ever there were any, that somehow they are pigs 
at the trough because the remuneration package that they 
accepted when they started the employment is unacceptable to 
the new group.
<P>
	First of all, that is a stupid argument. It is wrong. The 
members of the House who were duly elected on the basis of a 
package are entitled to receive the package they obtained.
<P>
	What has the government done? It made two promises in 1993 
to change that package. One was to prohibit double dipping and 
the second one was to put a  minimum age in place so that 
members would not draw a pension at an unduly young age.
<P>
	The bill fully complies with those promises. The age change 
is there and the double dipping prohibition is there. The 
government went beyond that and reduced the rate at which the 
pension accrues which means members of Parliament who are 
elected on a certain remuneration package will in fact get less. 
That is a very significant change which is totally unappreciated 
by the members of the Reform Party for one good reason. They 
are all going to opt out.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	I suggest the electorate will opt them out of the pension 
scheme. They will not qualify anyway. The only one that has 
qualified is the member for Beaver River. I suggest none of the 
others would qualify anyway.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River has been on a rant on this issue 
for one good reason. She has been cheated out of her pension by 
her colleagues who have muzzled her, beaten her into the ground 
and forced her to opt out of the pension scheme so she can join 
their ranks. They will be taken away by the electorate anyway in 
the next election. They will not qualify but they have muzzled 
her into opting out so she is in a fit of rage.
<P>
	She is the one, with her leader who asked for the opting out 
clause and now wants it taken out of this bill. She wants it 
removed from this bill because she wants her pension. She is 
having a fit because she cannot get her pension. I hear she is 
taking wrestling lessons in Calgary this weekend because she 
needs to be able to deal with her caucus colleagues. She is being 
wrestled to the ground.
<P>
	I want to turn to one other aspect. We keep hearing we should 
cut the pension more. We have not gone far enough. However, 
we do not hear from the Reform Party that we should change the 
double dipping scheme more by preventing double dipping not 
just by people who take federal appointments but by those who 
are receiving another pension from another source. Why is that? 
Because there are at least three members on the other side who 
are earning substantial pensions from the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Federal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Yes, three of them are federal. They are getting 
big, fat military pensions and maybe others. They are pocketing 
that money while they sit in the House earning a salary. They do 
not talk about extending double dipping because their 
colleagues will feel it in the pocketbook. They should have more 
sympathy for the hon. member for Beaver River and let her 
express her own opinions without wrestling her into the ground 
on this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13516"> 13516 </A></B>
<P>
	Look at the other pensions they are getting. When hon. 
members opposite stand up and say they are not taking their 
pensions, why do they not also stand up and say: ``The reason 
I am not taking my MPs' pension is because I am already 
getting a pension from another source''. Why do they not come 
clean and tell us about that? I do not have a pension from 
another source, but some of the hon. members opposite I know 
do have one.
<P>
	Why do those members not stand up and say: ``I'm getting a 
pension from another source, so I don't need an MPs' pension. 
I'm happy to opt out''. I know why. They would be embarrassed 
if they were caught double dipping later. It is amazing the 
members that are double dipping now are not confessing to it. 
We do not hear any talk about that. Why does the hon. member 
for Calgary West, in his white knight charger set of 
amendments, not propose the kind of amendments that will cut 
out the double dippers in his own party? Why will he not do that? 
I know why he will not. Because his leader told him not to.
<P>
	His leader knows all about pensions and the way to collect 
pensions. His father was in the Senate which is a pension haven. 
Everybody knows that. His leader's father was a senator for 
years.
<P>
	It is quite unbelievable that members of the Reform Party who 
speak on one side saying that we have to cut the pension will not 
speak on the other and say that we should cut double dipping 
more. Why will they not? They know all about double dipping. 
They are pros at double dipping. They know how to get big, fat 
pensions from other sources. I will not mention names but hon. 
members opposite know who I mean when I say there are people 
sitting there who are getting fat cat pensions of $40,000, 
$50,000, $60,000 a year and they are earning their salary here as 
MPs at the same time.
<P>
	In many cases those pensions are paid out of public funds. 
They may not be paid in every case by the federal government 
but they are paid out of taxpayers' funds.
<P>
	We do not hear a word about it either from the Reform Party or 
from their friend David Somerville and the National Citizens' 
Coalition who is a mouthpiece for the Reform Party on this 
issue. The two of them have been in bed together for years.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary West and the National Citizens' 
Coalition conspired together to defeat the former Tory member 
because of his views on the pension and on electoral reform. He 
knows that. He knows they have been working together to do 
this. The Reform Party members in the House and their 
performance in calling other members names, calling other 
members who have earned their pensions in good faith pigs, are 
absolutely disgracing this House. They should be ashamed of 
their conduct. The hon. member for Beaver River after her 
performance yesterday, threatening to beat up members of the 
House, should also be ashamed of her performance also.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In 
reference to the member's remarks during his intervention, 
where he accused a member of beating someone up, if he is 
accusing her of doing that in the House I wonder if he could 
retract that statement. It is absolute nonsense and he knows it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I have had 
the benefit of being in the chair for the better part, if not the 
entire portion, of this debate. I am well seized of the fact that it 
has been a very vigorous debate. I would say respectfully to the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley East that his point of order is a 
matter of debate. It is not a point of order according to our 
standing orders, our own rules in this House.
<P>
	I would urge members on both sides participating in this 
debate to be judicious and to continue to be respectful of one 
another, and certainly of the collectivity of this institution, the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like my colleagues I rise to speak on Bill C-85 with a 
heavy heart and a sense of despondency.
<P>
	Yesterday we were again reminded that there is no respect for 
the democratic process on the government benches. Once again 
they have not once, not twice, but three times invoked time 
allocation, thus stifling honest parliamentary debate on matters 
of great importance to Canadians.
<P>
	It is perhaps appropriate that I speak after the parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader because I am one of 
the people who he referred to as drawing a pension from the 
military. I have no trouble admitting that. I served for over 36 
years in the military. I paid into a pension fund 7.5 per cent of 
my pay for 35 of those years, which was the maximum that I 
could qualify for. The fund from which I draw my pension is 
now $30 billion and growing as people continue to contribute to 
it. Therefore, the idea that the taxpayer is paying my pension is 
absolutely ludicrous.
<P>
	I have no regrets about it. Double dipping has been adequately 
defined as the retirement of a member of Parliament who has 
been appointed to a government job and continues to draw his 
pension and his salary at the same time.
<P>
	I earned my place here. The people who elected me knew that 
I was drawing a military pension and they knew that I would be 
keeping that pension once I was elected. I feel there is no 
problem, but I have some doubts about the honesty and 
impartiality of the parliamentary secretary in this instance.
<P>
	The Reform Party is placing before the House 35 amendments 
to Bill C-85. First, if implemented, these amendments would 
bring the MPs pension scheme into line with the private sector 
for both MPs and senators, and failing that, second, the 
amendments would change the opting out provisions so that 
newly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13517"> 13517 </A></B>
<P>
elected members  would have a choice to opt out of the plan to 
allow all MPs to withdraw from participation in the plan. Third, 
Motion No. 4 would ensure that all members of the plan are 
Canadian citizens. Fourth, Motion No. 34 is based on the private 
member's bill of the hon. member for Yellowhead, which would 
make provisions to recover former senators and MPs pensions 
on the same basis as other income received by a former member, 
if that former member was in that year entitled to receive old age 
security.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	These 35 motions are important for Parliament and for the 
Canadian taxpayer. Unhappily, it appears that presentation of 
these motions is a futile parliamentary exercise as it becomes 
increasingly evident that the government has made up its mind 
and will move ahead with the legislation as it stands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have 
been listening with interest to my friend from Saanich-Gulf 
Islands. I believe him to be a man of integrity. I do not think he 
meant to say it but he did say it quite directly. He questioned the 
honesty of the member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	Under the rules, you will be aware, Mr. Speaker, it is not 
permitted to cast aspersions on the integrity of an individual. I 
would ask that you ask him to withdraw that aspersion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In listening to the 
member's intervention I suppose what I should do and will do is 
review the blues for verification of the wording and possibly the 
spirit of what was said.
<P>
	I take the member's point of order with great seriousness and, 
if necessary, I will report back to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no hesitation to withdraw the 
comments the member for Burin-St. George's referred to. 
They were uttered inadvertently. I did not intend to cast 
aspersions on the parliamentary secretary's integrity or his 
honesty.
<P>
	The House has heard many arguments as to why the proposed 
revisions to the MP pension plan are still too generous. 
Committee members have received repeated testimony from 
highly qualified witnesses who confirm that the plan is still far 
too rich and is basically poor public policy.
<P>
	Let me quote Paul McCrossan, a former member of 
Parliament and now an actuary for Eckler Partners Ltd., who 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My conclusion is that the bill is bad for you as members, bad for Parliament as 
an institution and bad for Canada because, having acted on this bill, you will 
hamstring this Parliament in dealing effectively with the most urgent challenges 
it faces, namely redesigning Canada's national retirement income and medical 
care systems to reflect the financial realities of Canada as well as Canada's 
rapidly aging population.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is exactly what is now happening. Parliament is 
hamstrung from dealing with important issues of the day: our 
increasing deficit and debt, social program reform and building 
a stronger economy which will produce more jobs for 
Canadians, to name just a few key problems.
<P>
	Despite the apparent futility of our efforts, Reform members 
cannot, with good conscience, allow the legislation to slip by 
without resistance. Perhaps those large pink pigs placed on the 
front lawn of Parliament to protest this pension scheme last 
week say it best. Surely there is no other place in this great 
nation where people are authorized to legislate the amount of 
their own benefits and salaries.
<P>
	I would agree with those who contend that the basic pay of 
members of Parliament is insufficient when the responsibility 
and workload are considered. However, this pension benefit 
cannot be justified and continues to leave a foul taste in the 
mouths of all taxpayers.
<P>
	Is our government blind to what is right? Why, rather than 
paying lip service, has it not undertaken realistic pension 
reform? Certainly there have been enough good suggestions 
given both in the House and in representations to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	The Reform member for Beaver River will refuse her million 
dollar payout and, under the deliberately planned punitive 
opting out provisions, will lose any government contributions 
made to that plan.
<P>
	Members will know that normal pension plans see the 
employer matching employee contributions. Even with the 
revisions to the pension plan instituted by the government, the 
taxpayer will be contributing an excessive $3.60 for every dollar 
members of Parliament contribute.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	The government made the opting out provision punitive 
because it very much wanted the member for Beaver River to opt 
into the plan so that during the next election it could point the 
finger at members of Reform Party and say that we were no 
different from the others.
<P>
	But we are different. We fought for these very principles 
during the last election. The parliamentary secretary's reference 
to the fact that it is Reformers who are bringing these measures 
to Parliament is absolutely wrong. Yes, we are transmitting it, 
but we are bringing the message from all Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Unhappily, despite the wishes of the parliamentary secretary, 
it would appear that the same issue will be around again in the 
next election.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13518"> 13518 </A></B>
<P>
	I return to Paul McCrossan's testimony before the committee 
about the legislation. Referring to the legislation he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It does nothing to develop a sensible compensation package for members and 
may actually impede redesign. It entrenches your benefits at a level higher than 
those available to general taxpayers. At the same time it reduces the cost of your 
compensation package.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So when you come to redo a compensation package, you will be left with 
having then to increase it from the level you have reduced it to and it is going to 
make it much more difficult to do it in two steps rather than one.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It reduces compensation for future service but leaves benefits substantially 
above the private sector and, indeed, public sector permissible levels.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is just this that members from this side of the House have 
been saying. The benefits go well beyond anything in the public 
realm.
<P>
	Some time in the future MPs will again decide that the 
compensation package is not adequate and adjustments will be 
made.
<P>
	Many take great pride in pointing out that MPs have curtailed 
their salaries in seven of the fourteen years since the present 
pension scheme was adopted in 1981. Are the salaries kept low 
in exchange for generous benefits? That question has been 
raised many times in the House and in committee.
<P>
	The study by Sabeco, Ernst and Young called for a 37 per cent 
increase in MP salaries, accompanied by a reduction in pension 
benefits, also recommending that they should be limited to 
retirees who are at least 60 years of age.
<P>
	The report further suggests that when the parliamentary wage 
freeze is lifted in 1996 the MP basic annual salary be increased 
to $75,000, and that prior to the next election Parliament be 
urged to pass legislation to increase MPs' salaries to $86,000 to 
take effect on the first day of the 36th Parliament.
<P>
	Given the political climate, the ever present debt and deficit 
and this ineffective pseudo pension reform, I do not believe the 
government has the political will to make these badly needed 
appropriate changes to current MP compensation and pension 
arrangements.
<P>
	Once again let me go back to Paul McCrossan who said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that legislating preferred treatment for yourselves, even if it is 
reduced preferred treatment, as proposed under this bill-will continue to foster 
cynicism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Each of us holds a very privileged position and thus must 
make every effort to avoid abuse of that position.
<P>
	As long as Parliament holds the power to set members own 
salaries, perks and pensions, the job will clearly not be 
effectively achieved. Politics will come into play as they have in 
this instance and longstanding MPs will resist every effort to 
make appropriate changes to the pension plan.
<P>
	Even in the Progressive Conservative government Wilson 
budget of 1986 provisions were made to lower MP pensions to 
private sector levels. We could wonder why this had not 
happened but the answer is clear. Decisions such as this cannot 
be left in the hands of Parliament. Rather, a competent, 
independent body must be assigned to ensure appropriate 
compensation and pension reforms are implemented.
<P>
	It is not too late even at this report stage to make some 
important changes. The proposed reductions make only a small 
dent in the cost to the taxpayer. Treasury Board officials have 
indicated that most of the savings will result from actuarial 
factors rather than legislated changes.
<P>
	For my own part, unless the government makes real changes 
which bring the MP pension scheme into line with that of other 
Canadians, I will be signifying my intention not to opt into the 
proposed plan.
<P>
	I call on government to go back to the drawing board, heed the 
very clear direction given by its own constituents and make 
meaningful, realistic changes to Bill C-85. I call on rank and file 
members of the government to press for these changes. They 
know what is right and proper. They know that Bill C-85 does 
not meet this need, and they should know that a concerted effort 
on their part could influence the changes needed to fulfil at least 
one of the promises made in the red book.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me deal with the point 
of order raised by the hon. member for Burin-St. George's. I 
express my appreciation and respect for the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands for his withdrawal. I am not recognizing 
or ruling that it was necessary, but I welcome his initiative. I 
will not be reviewing the blues and consider the matter closed.
<P>
	I should like to return momentarily to the point of order raised 
previously by the member for Fraser Valley East. I ruled that it 
was not a point of order and I continue to believe that to be the 
case. The issue which occurred yesterday between two hon. 
members is presently before the Speaker for a ruling. I would 
deem any allusion to the incident inappropriate at this time.
<P>
	Vigorous debate certainly will not be curtailed by myself 
while I am in the chair, but I would ask that respect be extended 
particularly to the institution and more specifically to the two 
members involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was a member of the committee that studied the 
bill. I also participated in second reading debate on the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, I am again going to take a few minutes of the House's 
time to give my opinion on this bill. I support the comments of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13519"> 13519 </A></B>
<P>
one of my colleagues, who said yesterday that she had no qualms 
about accepting her paycheque and the benefits of being a 
member of Parliament, and neither do I. I consider that I work 
and  that I do the job expected of me. If the voters in my riding 
consider this no longer to be the case at some point, I would 
encourage them strongly to replace me, rather than lower the 
salary and benefits of parliamentarians, thus probably reducing 
the calibre of those who stand for public office.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I take exception to something the member for Calgary said a 
little earlier today about members of the Bloc retiring and their 
MPs pension. I am paraphrasing his remarks when he said that if 
they lived in another country they should not receive their MPs 
pension. I for one hope the country never separates. I pray it 
does not. In the unlikely event that it would, the logic of the hon. 
member would be absolutely disastrous to my constituents.
<P>
	I have people in my riding who work in Quebec and live in 
Ontario. Does that mean they would be denied the Quebec 
pension plan, their employers' pension plans and so on? We can 
see how stupid that kind of reasoning can be if applied. I 
dissociate myself as a staunch federalist from the comments of 
the hon. member. They are wrong and they further create and 
augment the kind of division which he and others say should not 
exist in the country. He is appealing to the lowest common 
denominator in trying to get his point across.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are grasping at straws.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I am not grasping at straws. The unity of the 
country is not straw. It is a strong principle. To try to run 
roughshod over the benefits of my constituents is not grasping at 
straws. It may be in the minds of some members across the way. 
We know what they stand for.
<P>
	Before getting into the issue of MPs' pensions let me talk 
about the lack of understanding toward one another. Mr. Speaker 
has made a judgment on one incident and I will not refer to that 
one.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	There is another incident that happened yesterday in which 
members across, in the same party, said something as follows.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They said the Liberal and the Bloc members were conniving 
in some sort of treason-that is what they said-because the 
three bills will be adopted by the House by June 23. In support of 
their remarks, they said that the reason was in order to celebrate 
the Saint-Jean-Baptiste holiday. First, as we know, the holiday 
falls on a Saturday, this year. Second, if it fell during the week, 
the House would not sit that day. So, that is wrong. Third, and 
most important, as my hon. colleague for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine has just said, celebrating 
the Saint-Jean-Baptiste holiday is not treasonous.
<P>
	The members opposite have no sense of our country's culture. 
They should learn about it. People in my riding celebrate the 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste holiday, and, this year, they will be 
celebrating in the village of Cheney. Thousands will be there, 
and they are not traitors. The members opposite who describe 
them as such are mistaken. They should apologize to the House 
and, more importantly, to all French speaking Canadians for 
having made such stupid remarks about our fellow citizens. This 
is what is important. Once again, the Reform Party members 
stooped as low as they could to support their remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They are using the same kind of thing now in the MPs pension 
issue. The people in the third party across-it was them I was 
referring to, not to any other colleague-talk selectively about 
what they say is the unfair compensation MPs receive.
<P>
	We had a member here making comments while he is 
receiving a lucrative pension from the federal government, 
claiming that he has a right to receive such a pension but that 
nobody else does, and saying that with a straight face.
<P>
	Other hon. members have said that they would not refer to the 
MPs who were receiving some of these double dipping pensions. 
As they say in the province of my hon. colleague from 
Newfoundland, ``What is good for Goose Bay is good for 
Gander''. So I do not mind raising some of these things.
<P>
	It has been said that the Deputy Prime Minister, were she to 
retire today-and not that she will, she will be an hon. member 
of this House for decades to come-would receive a pension. 
What is the difference then from the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, a Reform MP, who receives a pension as 
a former military officer? He has a right to receive it. That is not 
the point. Why does he think that nobody else does? What makes 
him that god-like creature he thinks he is? What about the hon. 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, a general, who says that he 
can receive a pension but others should not were they to retire in 
the future?
<P>
	What about the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke, a 
former federal government employee? What about retired 
teachers across the way? What about retired MLAs who are 
receiving an MLA pension from a legislature across this 
country? They stand up in this House and say they are not going 
to get an MP pension. Do members know why? Because they are 
getting one from elsewhere already from the public purse. That 
is the truth. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13520"> 13520 </A></B>
<P>
No matter how they try to camouflage and wrap that truth, the 
truth will always be the truth. We know. That is not grasping at 
straws, that is stating fact. Fact sometimes gets in the way of 
Reform Party policy.
<P>
	Reform Party MPs have said that the taxpayers of Canada 
contribute these huge amounts toward MPs' pensions. I have 
here the document tabled by the President of the Treasury 
Board. It is a report on the administration of the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. There is not one year since 
1952 in which the contributions to the plan were less than the 
money going out of the plan in pensions-not one year.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will give you examples of various years. For 
instance, the total receipts for the year 1990-91 were $7 million 
to the plan and the disbursements were $6 million. The 
disbursements in 1989-90 were $7 million, with $6.3 million in 
withdrawals, and so on-total receipts, total disbursements.
<P>
	When some members opposite claim that the amount creates a 
huge debt of some sort, that is factually incorrect and they know 
it. This report was tabled in the House by an officer of the 
government. It was designed to show these numbers. But they 
refuse to listen to that. They invent, they concoct numbers of 
their own, supported by the likes of David Somerville, whose 
claim to fame is to draw little pigs in newspapers. That is all they 
have to support their argument.
<P>
	Between that and the nonsense we heard today that only some 
MPs should be entitled to a pension and others who have 
different political views, such as Bloc members, are not entitled, 
and that members should be able to get a military pension and an 
MP's salary but that other people should not get a pension, that 
is the kind of logic that works for Reform thinking but not for 
logical thinking.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is time to inject an element of intellectual honesty into this 
debate. I am not ashamed of my salary as a member of 
Parliament, I earn it. If the voters of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell do not think I am worth this 
salary, they should not lower it, they should find someone who 
can do the job better, if that is what is required some day or 
other.
<P>
	I say to the members opposite that, if they do not think they 
are earning their pay, they should work harder and not claim that 
salaries should be cut. If they are embarrassed about their lack 
of ability, they should improve their skills. If they are ashamed 
because they are not working hard enough, let them work a little 
harder for the voters who sent them here. I was elected by the 
voters in my riding to do my best, and that is what I intend to do 
so long as I am here.
<P>
	That is what the members opposite should do instead of 
continuing to make Canadians believe things that are the 
opposite of the truth, to say the least.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought it 
might not be necessary for me to speak to this bill on the 
parliamentarians' pension plan.
<P>
	I have been a member of this House since 1984. I did not go 
into politics because of the pension but because I had a vision of 
the future. I did not run for Parliament because of the salary; I 
did not even know how much members made until after I was 
elected. So you can see, my first concern was not about salary 
and pension. It was to defend the public interest, the interests of 
the people of Longueuil, as well as my party's policies, which I 
believe in.
<P>
	Since the Reform Party says that Bloc members should not 
receive a pension from the federal government if Quebec ever 
becomes sovereign, I wish to reiterate what I said on several 
occasions in response to English speaking journalists. I asked 
them if someone now working for a U.S. company, who has 
contributed to this company's pension fund for 10 or 15 years, 
will not be entitled to receive his pension from a U.S. company 
because he is Canadian.
<P>
	I think that is the major issue in this case. I have been working 
for the Canadian government for 11 years. We as members are 
not employers, but we still work for the Canadian state, and the 
day Quebec becomes sovereign, I will have made my own 
contribution to a pension fund. I do not see how anyone can say 
today that I would not have the right to receive what I paid into 
this plan.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	That is why I think that such statements are totally disloyal 
and a little twisted coming as they do from the Reform Party, and 
from some journalists who have often argued that it would not be 
legitimate for us to receive a pension should Quebec achieve 
sovereignty.
<P>
	I am feeling very legitimate and very comfortable, because I 
have contributed to this pension fund and I am simply entitled to 
it, whether it comes from an American or Canadian company or 
from the Canadian government. I am entitled to it because I have 
already contributed to this fund for 11 years.
<P>
	Whenever I hear talk of a gold-plated pension plan, I think 
that, as far as I know, the majority of people who go into politics 
do not come here for the fat pension we receive after we leave. 
Most politicians, at least those I know, did not go into politics 
for the pension fund; they came here to further the interests of 
their party and put forward what it stands for.
<P>
	Such arguments do not seem valid to me, and I do not think 
that the Reform Party will score very many points by trying to 
give the public the impression that members of Parliament are 
overpaid and that their pensions are too generous. I think that 
this is of little concern to the people of Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13521"> 13521 </A></B>
<P>
	All they want is, first and foremost, to have jobs and healthy 
businesses that can create more jobs. Canadians want the kind 
of climate that will be conducive to a sound economy that will 
lead to job creation. I think that is what they want. Whether 
MPs make $64,400, $64,00 or $75,000, they really do not care, 
but they care about their member's performance. They also 
want their MP to fulfil their aspirations in many respects. In 
any case, people of my riding of Longueuil have seldom told 
me that I was making too much money. Their comments had 
more to do about whether they felt I was doing a good job or 
not or representing them well or not.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said 
earlier, the reason why constituents complain about their MPs is 
not because they are making too much money but rather because 
they are not paying enough attention to fulfilling their wishes. 
That is the spirit in which this bill, which seems reasonable to 
me, should be supported.
<P>
	The government has come a long way, and if there is one 
aspect that I might have questioned myself, it is the fact that 
pensions are paid as soon as MPs leave public life one way or the 
other, but this bill provides for pensions to start when MPs reach 
the age of 55, and that sounds reasonable to me. Reducing 
slightly pension benefits, which may have been on the high side, 
also seems reasonable to me.
<P>
	For these reasons, I support the bill on pensions.
<P>

Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the chemical weapons convention opened for 
ratification in January 1993 and will become law when ratified 
by a minimum of 65 states. According to authoritative doctrine, 
it codifies the general principles of the international law of war 
already recognized in customary international law from at least 
the time of the Geneva protocol of 1925.

attention an example of discrimination against Canadians that 
should not be tolerated by this government.
<P>
	It seems that when Canadians of Taiwanese origin apply for 
visas to China their visa applications are refused. We know what 
the policy of China toward Taiwan is. There probably is not a lot 
the Canadian government can do about that. However, when 
Canadian citizens are discriminated against overseas because of 
the country of birth they list in their passports, then it is 
incumbent on our government to get involved. This is not an 
issue of two countries disagreeing over sovereignty. This is a 
matter of the fair treatment of Canadians around the world.
<P>
	I call on this government to get involved and to use its 
newfound influence in China. We must not put trade above the 
fair and just treatment of citizens of Canada. We must defend 
what is right and attack what is wrong. End the unfair treatment 
of Taiwanese Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River,

time to recall the historical role played by transportation in the 
prairie provinces.
<P>
	We understand the importance of an efficient and cost 
effective transportation system. We live surrounded by immense 
distances. At one time in our history we relied completely on the 
railway to link us with the rest of the country. Now we are served 
by air and road as well as by rail. What is needed is an efficient 
and cost effective national transportation system, not subsidies.
<P>
	Western grain producers are ready to compete with the world. 
With the repeal of the WGTA and the proposed amendments to 
the National Transportation Act regarding efficiency measures, 
we believe they will be even better prepared for the challenges 
of the global economy.
<P>
	The theme of this year's National Transportation Week is 
``Careers in Transportation: Opportunities, Training and 
Skills''. It should remind us that the future holds opportunities 
as well as challenges.
<P>
	If Canada is to have the transportation system it needs, we 
will need to start now to recruit, educate and train those who will 
keep the country moving in the years to come.

<P>
	St. Brieux is an extraordinary town. It is 90 minutes northeast 
of Saskatoon with a vigorous farm equipment manufacturing 
plant, lots of employment, business opportunities, schools and 
is bilingual. The gateway to the northern lakes, it has golf, 
hockey and no crime. So ran the ad in the <I>Toronto</I> <I>Sun</I> about two

$48,000.
<P>
	If it is quality of life they are seeking, Torontonians will soon 
be flocking to St. Brieux, especially after last night's election

yesterday the importance of discussing these matters, the

	Could it be that the personal opinions of the Minister of 
Justice might prevent Parliament from looking at these sensitive 
issues in the near future? Let us not forget that the minister 
already stated his opposition to legalizing euthanasia and 
assisted suicide at the 1994 convention of the Liberal Party of

the citizens of Ontario to vote Liberal in the provincial election. 
Their pleadings were to no avail.
<P>
	Ontario has spoken and told those opposite they do not believe 
Liberals will provide justice for victims of crime. The people of 
Ontario have chosen instead the Reform ideal of putting victims 
first. They voted for mandated discipline and structure in the 
lives of young offenders as the best policy for preventing further 
youth crime. The people have chosen the Reform principle of 
holding criminals accountable for their crimes and that the best 
form of deterrence is swift sure punishment for criminal 
activity.

them perish in the line of duty while making our communities

occasions. I am proud to say that we have one of the finest police

new American style smear campaigning reflects the Reform 
Party's underlying approach: no principles unless they are 
politically expedient for the moment.
<P>
	The Reform Party sends different messages to different 
regions of the country on issues of importance to Canadians. 
Take for example the recent comments by the Reform member 
for Fraser Valley West who has been telling the people of 
Atlantic Canada that the  Reform Party opposes tolls on 
highways. However, his boss, the leader of the third party, in 
speeches delivered as recently as May 25 in New York City, said 
that the rebuilding of roads will include everything from 
privatization of publicly owned infrastructure to user pay

issues, so dear to the heart of the Liberal government, are being 
sidetracked.
<P>
	When the members of the party in power formed the official 
opposition, they called for a stricter code of political conduct 
and an end to Conservative patronage. However, now that their 
party is in power, the government has been quick to adopt the 
system cherished with such enthusiasm by its predecessors. 
Unlike the Conservative government, however, the Prime 
Minister did not ask his Minister of Canadian Heritage to resign 
and he turned a blind eye to the minister's benefit dinners, 
attended by guests who a few months later just happened to be 
awarded major contracts.
<P>

<P>
	The Prime Minister will not admit that the lobbyist and

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for

importance of direct parental care for preschool children.
<P>
	Research done by the Canadian Institute for Advanced 
Research and the National Foundation for Family Research and 
Education has shown clearly that poor quality care means a 
higher likelihood of problems in the health, social and criminal 
justice areas.
<P>
	In 1961, 65 per cent of families with preschool children had 
one parent in the home. That figure reduced to only 12 per cent 
in 1991. What is the impact of reduced parental care? One 
example is that the suicide rate for youth between the ages of 15 
and 19 has increased by 600 per cent over the same period of 
time.

their high quality commodities to market. Therefore it is crucial 
that shippers from Dauphin-Swan River and across the prairies 
have access to a rail system that moves their commodity quickly 
and at competitive rates.
<P>
	It is fitting that National Transportation Week comes at a time 
when the Liberal government is making massive improvements 
to our national rail system. These measures will increase 
competition and lead to greater efficiency. It is crucial that these 
efficiencies are passed along to prairie farmers, the highest 
volume shippers in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last night the Liberals got yet another taste of how 
quickly they can go from the top of the heap to official 
opposition. Despite a commanding lead at the beginning of the 
campaign, Ontario Liberals finished a distant second. That 
makes three provinces which have provincially stated: ``We do 
not like the example the federal Liberals are giving us''.
<P>
	As for the resurgence of the PCs, look at the federal Tory 
policies and then look at the Reform policies. Tell me whose 
platform Ralph Klein and Mike Harris are really following.
<P>
	On the subject of mergers, the leader of the federal PCs should 
merge not with Reform but with the Liberals with whom he has 
much more in common, especially since Liberal cabinet 
ministers started to follow the corrupt patronage practices of the 
former Tory government.
<P>
	I am not one to wish my life away, but I am looking forward to 
1997.

last Saturday I had the great pleasure of manning the telephones 
for two hours to raise money for the Children's Hospital of 
Eastern Ontario. Once again the people of this region proved 
their generosity as volunteers and hundreds came out.
<P>
	This year they were helped by a marvellous group of young

volunteering for the telethon for the Children's Hospital of

<P>
	I had the great pleasure of having one of them bring me a

from another two pages down there answering phones and 
scribbling out pledge forms.
<P>
	On behalf of all the people of this region, I thank the pages 
who come to our community, often from far away, and who start 
fitting right in and making a contribution.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
stated that during the referendum campaign in Quebec, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13525"> 13525 </A></B>
<P>
federal government would comply with Quebec's referendum 
legislation as it did in 1980, which is not very reassuring, when 
we consider the contempt  shown for this legislation by the 
Trudeau government and its Quebec lieutenant, the present 
Prime Minister of Canada, who spent millions of dollars and 
ignored the spending limits imposed on the ``yes''and ``no'' 
umbrella committees.
<P>
	Are we to conclude from yesterday's statements by the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs that in 1995, the federal 
Liberals, like Trudeau did in 1980, intend to ignore the letter and 
the intent of Quebec's referendum legislation, which sets 
democratic rules for all such campaigns in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday I made it very clear that we complied 
with the legislation in 1980 and intend to comply with the letter 
and the intent of the legislation in 1995.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the following figures will illustrate the extent of this 
compliance. In 1980, the federal government spent at least $17 
million, although the spending ceiling for umbrella committees 
was set at $2.7 million. It was slightly out of line here. And 
according to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the 
federal government intends to repeat this exercise during the 
next referendum campaign.
<P>
	Should we conclude that the Trudeau government's behaviour 
during the 1980 campaign was a model of good faith and 
transparency, which the present federal government intends to 
follow during the next referendum campaign in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, speaking of compliance, I may remind the 
members of the opposition that they made a promise there would 
be a referendum, and they should keep that promise.
<P>
	They promised it would be held in the first half of 1995, in 
May or June, but they did not keep their promise. Now they 
promise it will be in the fall. I hope that promise will be kept.
<P>
	When I look at the money their big brother, the Parti 
Quebecois, spends on regional commissions to sell sovereignty, 
I think they should show some respect for the democratic system 
in the province and for the spirit of the law, in addition to 
making people abide by this legislation, which in fact we do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we said it would be in 1995. For the minister's 
information, there are twelve months in 1995, and the year ends 
on December 31.
<P>
	Speaking of big brothers, what about those subsidies to big 
brother, to Power Corporation, the real big brother of the Liberal 
Party?
<P>
	While the Government of Quebec acts openly, the federal 
government acts behind the scenes by handing out subsidies that 
are directly related to the referendum campaign. A few 
examples: $35 million for tourism advertising, in addition to the 
$15 million already budgeted; $6 million for the unity 
operation; $1.1 million to celebrate the 30th birthday of the 
Canadian flag; $2.2 million for the Charles Bronfman 
Foundation, friends of the government. This plus the other 
hidden costs.
<P>
	Is that what the federal government means by complying with 
the spirit of Quebec's referendum legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I think that we on this side will refrain from 
mentioning the advertising in the Montreal subway, the 
Commission on Quebec's sovereignty and the regional 
commissions.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	We will refrain, because we already abide by the law and 
intend to comply with the spirit of the referendum legislation. 
However, what this country needs is for the referendum to be 
held as soon as possible, with a clear question, so that we will be 
able to deal with this problem once and for all and can start 
dealing with the real issues: creating jobs in Canada, including 
Quebec, and reducing poverty in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Revenue. The federal 
government gave $32 million to the Council for Canadian Unity 
last year for its prereferendum campaign and the government 
has pledged funding again for the coming year. In addition, the 
Department of National Revenue has granted it charitable 
status, and its number is 0333054-59.
<P>
	Can the minister explain to us how the Council for Canadian 
Unity can be considered a charity?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have explained to the House a number of 
times how the charitable status for organizations is given out. It 
is given out on the basis of court decisions. There is no 
legislation. It is not decision of the minister but a series of court 
decisions which has determined that various areas of activity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13526"> 13526 </A></B>
<P>
considered to be in the public interest should be permitted 
charitable status to encourage that. It has resulted in substantial  
improvements in Canadian living standards, in health and in all 
sorts of other areas.
<P>
	I am afraid, however, with respect to the specifics of the hon. 
member's question I do not have in my hand the number he gave 
out. If he would like to give it to me I could check out that 
number.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the Minister of National Revenue justify that big businesses 
get a tax deduction for their contributions to the Council for 
Canadian Unity, when charitable status is usually granted on the 
basis of the following criteria: relief of poverty, promotion of 
education or religion and other efforts to the benefit of the 
community like the relief of suffering or sickness?
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again with respect to companies as 
opposed to individuals the rules are quite clear. A company can 
make expenditures and provide money to organizations but the 
final line in terms of determining this, which again is in the 
courts and not in the hands of the department, is whether it 
advances the business interests of the company involved.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MINISTEROFCANADIANHERITAGE">MINISTER OF CANADIAN HERITAGE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government cannot seem to get its story straight over the 
heritage minister's contract for dollars dinner.
<P>
	Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister stated there was no 
breach of ethics and therefore there was no need for the ethics 
counsellor to investigate this paid access to the minister. 
However, today we learn the ethics counsellor is investigating 
the matter. It appears Mr. Wilson feels there is more to this affair 
than meets the government's eye.
<P>
	Is the ethics counsellor conducting an open investigation into 
the minister of heritage's dinner? Will Mr. Wilson's report be 
made public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
informed the House two days ago that he had consulted Mr. 
Wilson about the question. I spoke to the Prime Minister at 
approximately 10.45 a.m. and he advised me, as he has stated 
publicly in the House many times, that if there are questions 
about the ethics of the government the ultimate arbiter of those 
questions is not a bureaucrat, it is the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess 
that is a question mark.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the 
heritage minister have suggested all the information on this 
matter has been made public. However, the heritage minister 
refuses to provide the House with a list of the people invited and 
those who contributed to the dinner.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	With the latest revelation that Guylaine Saucier donated 
$1,000 to the minister's debt fund and was appointed chairman 
of the CBC six months later, we have to wonder who did not get a 
contract from the minister's private dinner.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister appointed Guylaine Saucier as 
chairman of the CBC, did he know she had contributed $1,000 to 
the heritage minister's debt fund?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Guylaine Saucier 
happens to be the first woman to be president of the Quebec 
Chamber of Commerce. She has served on several boards 
including the board of the Bank of Montreal, the board of Bell 
Canada, the board of Petro-Canada. She has been active in a 
number of community events including the University of 
Montreal, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Hôtel-Dieu de 
Montréal. She was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1989 by a 
government that was not Liberal.
<P>
	Madam Saucier has said she has contributed to numerous 
political parties. She is a federalist and supports the role of 
federal political parties in Canada.
<P>
	If the member has a problem with the appointment of Madam 
Saucier, then let him so state in the House because her 
credentials speak for themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, her 
credentials were not questioned in any way. I asked if the Prime 
Minister was aware that a donation had been made to that fund 
before the appointment was made. The question was not 
answered.
<P>
	Canadians want ethical and honest government. The success 
of Mike Harris' populous grassroots campaign proves that. 
Instead of honesty and ethics, the Liberals are giving Canadians 
the same old Mulroney style government they had from the 
Progressive Conservatives.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage specifically targeted 
clients of his department, invited them to a dinner to pay off his 
campaign debts and then rewarded all of them, every single one, 
with grants, contracts and chairmanships. This is a direct 
conflict of interest and it is about time the government 
recognized this.
<P>
	What is this government afraid of? Why will it not release the 
invitation list of those who contributed to the dinner? Why will 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage not do the honourable thing 
and resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I challenge the 
member to review his first question. Implicit in the question was 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13527"> 13527 </A></B>
<P>
suggestion that somehow  Madam Saucier bought her position in 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I pointed out, as she 
has publicly pointed out, she has contributed to several political 
parties over a great number of years.
<P>
	Every political party has the responsibility of collecting 
funds. I refer the member to an article he might have missed: 
``The Reform Party will soon be knocking on corporate doors in 
Nova Scotia in search of political donations for its election war 
chest. Nationally the party says it-has banked $2.4 million to 
bankroll the next vote where it will be running candidates in 295 
ridings. If you have an extra $125 and you would like to break 
bread with Preston Manning, you are in luck. Reform's chief 
will be in Halifax-for a fundraising dinner''.
<P>
	Political parties raise money. I am sure the member would 
agree with me that it would not be reasonable to exclude every 
Canadian who donates to a political party from ever serving in a 
capacity with the Government of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs demonstrated 
Canada's lack of leadership in the Bosnian crisis by refusing to 
publicly state Canada's position on the rapid reaction force, 
while at the same time, behind closed doors, the Minister of 
National Defence supported the initiative at a NATO meeting.
<P>
	Now that we know, thanks to the media and the Minister of 
National Defence, that Canada supports the creation of a rapid 
reaction force in the former Yugoslavia, and the UN's leadership 
of it, will the Deputy Prime Minister tell us whether the 
government intends to contribute troops or to contribute 
logistically to this rapid reaction force?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	As he knows, there are activities under way by other allied 
countries participating in Bosnia to look at a rapid reaction 
force.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stated in the House earlier in the week 
that we are aware of the plans being made but at that time 
Canada was not part of that activity. As I stand in the House 
today I have to say the same thing. Canada is not part of that 
activity and the decision has not yet been made.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at a 
time when the United States' reaction to the rapid reaction force 
is lukewarm, which is seriously hampering the effort of the 
international community to consolidate the peacekeeping forces 
in Bosnia, will the Deputy Prime Minister tell us whether she 
shares the opinion of the British secretary to the Foreign Office 
that, if the rapid reaction force does not get up and running, the 
only other option will be to withdraw the peacekeepers from 
Bosnia?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, there are 35 countries

has asked me questions about other countries, but I can only 
answer the question for Canada. I have answered that question 
and I can do no more.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
almost since this House began sitting early in 1994, the 
government has been attempting to redo the redistribution of 
boundaries in the House of Commons. This latest bill, C-69, 
which has been bouncing back and forth, is coming back to this 
House. It will increase the size of the House and add $6 million 
in redistribution costs. We saw last night in Ontario that the 
people of Canada do not want to spend this kind of money on the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	I would ask the government House leader if he would now 
consider doing the right thing by withdrawing Bill C-69, saving 
$6 million, and allowing the redistribution to go ahead?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member in his question is reflecting adversely 
and unfairly on the work of members of this House who for the 
first time under the rules of parliamentary reform actually 
brought in and drafted a bill. Instead of his unwarranted 
criticism, he should be recognizing this good work and urging 
his friends in the Senate to respect the wishes of the elected 
people of this House and let this bill go through.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am not sure how many friends I have in the Senate.
<P>
	In the Ontario election last night premier-elect Harris 
defeated the Liberals partly by proposing that there be a 25 per 
cent reduction to the number of seats in the Ontario legislature. 
If the government is not willing to at least let the redistribution 
go 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13528"> 13528 </A></B>
<P>
ahead, would it consider combining the redistribution with the 
modest 10 per cent  reduction to the number of seats that the 
Reform Party has proposed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the increase in seats that would come into effect, not 
just in the bill he is talking about but in the redistribution 
process that was interrupted by it, is provided for in a formula in 
the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
	This government does not propose opening a new round of 
constitutional discussions. I am surprised my hon. friend wants 
to take up the time of the country with a new round of 
constitutional discussions. I am sure the people of Ontario and 
British Columbia would be most displeased and disheartened to 
learn that he does not want them to have fair representation in 
the Parliament of Canada.

for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	In response to the Official Opposition's questions in the 
House regarding the fraudulent use of the growth hormone 
somatotropin, the Minister of Agriculture announced close to a 
month ago that he would investigate dairy producers and single 
out the ones that are guilty of fraud.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us whether, as part of his inquiry, he 
requested and obtained the collaboration of producers' 
associations, Canada Customs officers and Health Canada 
inspectors, and will he reveal to us the fruit of his research?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can inform the hon. member 
that no further information has been drawn to my attention since 
the issue was first raised a number of days ago in the House.
<P>
	The issue is obviously one, as he implies in his question, that 
would involve co-operation among a number of departments, 
most particularly the two departments he referred to, the 
Department of Health and the customs department.
<P>
	If and when there is further pertinent material that is drawn to

waiting for the results.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us whether, as a follow up to his inquiry, 
he intends to pursue this issue further and to take legal action

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	All the polls and pundits have indicated that a major reason 
behind Mike Harris' victory last night in Ontario was due to his 
position on employment equity. He was not messing around; he 
said he was going to scrap the employment equity plan.
<P>
	On this side of the House we are very interested to know if the 
federal government is going to take a lesson from this victory 
last night. I realize that the Charest-Mulroney gang brought in 
employment equity, but is this government going to stop now 
trying to bring in an expanded employment equity plan? Will it 
withdraw its plans on Bill C-64?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member had better 
make up his mind. His colleagues were running around saying 
that the victory was as a result of gun control.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, just to remind you very gently, 
when we refer to each other in the House, sitting members, we 
refer to our ridings as opposed to our names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suppose there are quite a few Reform policies that got the Mike 
Harris government elected.
<P>
	The director of communications for the Prime Minister's 
office said that the federal Liberals would be helping the Ontario 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13529"> 13529 </A></B>
<P>
Liberals in their campaigns. The quote is: ``They helped us, we 
help them. A Liberal is a Liberal is a Liberal.'' I am sure Lyn 
McLeod is saying to herself this morning, ``With friends like 
this, who needs enemies?''
<P>
	Since the voters of Ontario totally rejected the Liberal 
concept of employment equity, will the minister listen to the 
voters and back down on the government's own employment 
equity plans, its plans to expand employment equity, or is it 
going to take a federal election defeat for the Liberals before 
they listen to the people and understand that employment equity 
is not wanted?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Unlike the Reform Party, we 
actually believe in employment equity, and unlike the Reform 
Party, we actually believe in political democracy.
<P>
	Unlike the Reform Party, we did not put the jackboots to 
provincial Reformers who wanted to run in the Ontario 
provincial election. We allow and encourage everybody to

<P>
	Although the studies on the impact of somatotropin on human 
and animal health are not yet complete, Quebec and Canadian 
consumers are finding this hormone in dairy products they 
purchase, since, despite the Health Canada prohibition, certain 
producers are not afraid to use it, particularly since the Minister 
of Agriculture seems in no hurry to do a serious investigation.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Health tell us what measures she has 
taken to ensure that somatotropin, the sale of which is prohibited 
by her department, is not found in dairy products?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I indicated in reply to the 
earlier question, the issue that has been raised relates to the 
jurisdictional responsibilities of several ministers, including the 
Minister of Health, the Minister of National Revenue, with his 
responsibility for customs, and agriculture with its obvious 
interest in the dairy industry. All of us are endeavouring to be as 
vigilant as we can to ensure that the laws of Canada are fully and 
faithfully respected.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	It is very important that the government lead by example in all 
things, including environmental matters. One of the most 
visible symbols of government is the national capital region. 
Our national capital is beautiful at this time of year, but I ask the 
Minister of the Environment what she is doing to ensure that it is 
and remains truly green.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the intention of the 
Government of Canada is to ensure that every part of Canada is 
green. Obviously one of those very important parts is the 
national capital region.
<P>
	We believe that some of the recently announced policies on 
issues like the Commission for Sustainable Development and 
also the very excellent initiative of Bill S-7 by Senator Colin 
Kenny, which will begin to create a market for alternative fuels 
in this country, will get smog out of the air and keep those tulips 
growing and make sure that all urban areas of the country also 
benefit from a cleaner environment, which is something we owe 
our kids.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the justice 
minister first claimed that his gun control legislation would cost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13530"> 13530 </A></B>
<P>
the taxpayers no more than $85 million. Estimates the justice 
minister tabled later with the standing committee revealed the 
cost to be $118.9  million. These estimates did not include the 
cost for the gun inspectors who will now have to be hired and 
trained to ensure compliance with the Firearms Act.
<P>
	I ask the justice minister, how much will the hiring and 
training of these new gun inspectors add to the cost of the gun 
legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the entire cost of the 
program was put before the committee, of which the hon. 
member was an active and hard-working member. The 
committee examined the cost estimates and for weeks heard 70 
witnesses discussing costs, among other things.
<P>
	I conclude from the committee's work and its report to the 
House, which is due next week, that it found that the estimates 
presented by the government were indeed accurate and 
complete.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if that 
were true then I would not be standing here asking about the cost 
of the program.
<P>
	I have been told by the justice minister that he will not even 
reply to requests from some authorities in areas of the country 
regarding the failure of the federal government to reimburse 
them for the cost to administer the present gun control 
legislation.
<P>
	Did the justice minister discuss with the provinces and the 
territories the additional cost of hiring and training the required 
gun inspectors before he imposed these conditions on them 
through his amendments to his gun control legislation?
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the the hon. member 
knows, we have told the provinces and territories the cost of 
establishing, implementing and designing the registration 
system will be borne by the federal government. We have also 
told them the cost of administering the registration system will 
be paid by revenues generated through the reasonable fees that 
will be charged.
<P>
	Based on the figures we put before the committee and the very 
reliable estimates we produced, there is no basis in cost to 
oppose the registration of firearms.
<P>
	I wish the hon. member would put aside the details he is trying 
to raise which have been fully explored in committee, and 
explain to the House and the country why he is opposing 
something the police forces in his own province, and by a 
margin of two out of three, the people in his own province want 
to see the House put in place.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. The Minister of Health 
must be aware that the European Community has declared a 
seven-year moratorium on the use of recombinant bovine 
somatotropin because this product is a health hazard to both 
humans and animals.
<P>
	Given that Health Canada has not yet completed its studies 
and that the voluntary moratorium expires in 22 days, does the 
minister intend to take action by imposing a real moratorium?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, Health Canada's role is to determine if a product is safe 
and does what it is supposed to do. The moratorium that has been 
in effect for a year was arrived at through negotiations between 
Agriculture Canada and the producers, with the approval of 
Health Canada. Health Canada's only responsibility is to ensure 
that the product is safe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier, 
my colleagues reminded this House of the illegalities committed 
during this voluntary moratorium. How can the minister 
condone the use of a product that is banned in Canada, when her 
department does not even enforce the legislation? Will she allow 
the lifting of the moratorium? Is this what she calls taking 
action?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after consultations with officials in Quebec, with 
Customs Canada, with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, we 
have not found any evidence that the product is being used 
illegally in Canada.
<P>
	If the hon. member has any evidence of that nature please 
bring it forward. It is not being sold in Canada nor is it about to 
be sold unless Health Canada proves it is safe and effective and 
that has not happened.
<P>
	It was a voluntary moratorium arrived at through negotiations 
with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the producers of 
the product. If there is going to be an extension of the 
moratorium I believe it has to be negotiated again between 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the producers of BST.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	In my riding of Peace River some farmers have diversified 
and are now growing organically grown wheat. This is a special-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13531"> 13531 </A></B>
<P>
ty product which the Canadian Wheat Board simply cannot 
handle. Organic farmers have had to find their own markets, yet 
the wheat board insists these farmers go through all its costly red 
tape.
<P>
	The fine for bypassing the Canadian Wheat Board on this 
issue is $12,000 and two years in jail.
<P>
	Will the minister allow organic farmers to sell their product 
without jumping through all the wheat board hoops necessary?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the last number of months 
the Canadian Wheat Board has made a substantial effort to find 
the appropriate regulatory and other means to accommodate the 
needs of organic producers.
<P>
	It is my view, which I think is shared by the board, that in the 
future organic production, whether of wheat or potentially a 
great many other commodities, will be able to find very 
significant and valuable niche markets that may over time grow 
to be much more than just niches in terms of the future 
marketing potential.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member may rest assured that we will be 
endeavouring by all possible means to promote the maximum 
marketing opportunities because those opportunities are 
valuable not only to the individual producers of the organic 
product but also to the entire grains economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	As he knows, the current system is simply not working. It is 
penalizing farmers who are struggling to diversify. It is ironic 
that at a time when the federal government has spent millions of 
dollars on western diversification, the wheat board is standing in 
the way of those farmers who have already found their markets 
and simply want to market their grain.
<P>
	Will the minister at least amend the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act to remove organic crops from wheat board jurisdiction and 
allow this industry to develop?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. gentleman knows, 
there is a substantial division of opinion in western Canada on 
the issue he has just raised.
<P>
	It is important for all producers, whether they be organic 
producers or others, to have the opportunity to examine the 
marketing system and all the various options, all the pros and the 
cons, all the benefits and the consequences, to understand 
completely what is involved in the marketing decisions that 
need to be made in the future.
<P>
	The opportunity for that kind of dialogue and discussion 
among farmers and farm organizations will be forthcoming very 
soon.

<P>
	Over the last number of years Canada has lost a large part of 
its tourism business from all over the world, but in particular, 
from the United States.
<P>
	Is the current campaign having any effect on our tourist 
business and at what cost?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first let me stress for the hon. member the importance 
of the tourism sector to the government's jobs and growth 
agenda.
<P>
	I am pleased to tell him the $50 million commitment that the 
government made to the Canadian Tourism Commission has 
already leveraged an addition $30 million from the private 
sector, no strings attached.
<P>
	The campaigns are under way, both on television as well as in 
newspapers. The responses are formidable. I would like to 
mention to the House that in the first quarter of 1995, we already 
have very encouraging numbers.
<P>
	Travel receipts are up by 19.5 per cent and the travel deficit 
figures for the same period are down by 11.3 per cent. Tourism is 
jobs for Canadians in all parts of the country. It is jobs and

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1990, the Canadian government banned 
the export of PCBs to the United States without prior 
authorization by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency, 
which systematically refused PCB shipments, thus making any 
PCB export virtually impossible.
<P>
	This created an opportunity for a fledgling PCB destruction 
industry to develop in Canada and Quebec. In the spirit of the 
Basel convention, Canada now tends to look after the disposal of 
its own hazardous wastes, thereby avoiding the serious 
problems associated with long haul shipping of these products.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of the Environment. Is she 
prepared to make a public commitment to maintain the policy 
position that Canada must manage its own waste, no matter what 
decisions the EPA may make in the future, and does she 
undertake to press the U.S to do the same?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13532"> 13532 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the regulations 
proposed by the former environment minister, the hon. member 
for Lac-Saint-Jean, were designed to govern PCB exports, but 
these were never approved. This is what the minister proposed 
but it was never confirmed in the legislation.
<P>
	That said, we have taken the position at the EPA hearings 
currently going on in Washington that we would rather see to the 
disposal of our PCBs ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given that the situation has evolved since 
1990, does the minister undertake to amend the PCB Waste 
Export Regulations to prevent once and for all Canada from 
being tempted in the future to dispose of its PCBs by shipping 
them to the U.S., which would compromise the development of 
emerging industries in Canada and Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat in 
English what I said in French. The former Minister of the 
Environment promised to ban the export of PCBs in 1990. It was 
announced but never proclaimed. Therefore, it is not currently 
the law that PCBs cannot be exported.
<P>
	However, it has been the policy of Canada, despite the fact 
that the minister of the day did not follow through on his 
commitment to make it illegal. It is still the position of the 
government that the handling of PCBs should be done in Canada 
by Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the agriculture minister.
<P>
	Farmers have notified the minister of their deep concern over 
the questionable activities of the Canadian Wheat Board. Very 
simply, when will the minister take these people seriously and 
address their concerns about the grain marketing system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I presume the question relates 
to the discussion which has been ongoing in western Canada for 
some time about the appropriate jurisdiction of the Canadian 
Wheat Board and the issue that some have referred to as dual 
marketing or other types of marketing options.
<P>
	As I indicated in reply to an earlier question with respect to 
organic crops, it is important for farmers and all of the 
stakeholders in the Canadian grains industry to have the 
opportunity to examine the issue of their preferred marketing 
options and marketing systems in a fully informed, fully 
comprehensive and rational manner.
<P>
	I undertook some time ago to provide a forum within which 
that dialogue could take place. As I said in response to the 
previous question, that forum will be forthcoming very shortly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not just about dual marketing or whatever system. 
It is about mismanagement.
<P>
	It is reported today that the Canadian Wheat Board is hauling 
barley to be shipped to Japan by rail from Thunder Bay to 
California at a cost of $82 Canadian a ton.  This is $9 a ton more 
than the farmer gets for it initially, plus they have to pay the 
freight to Thunder Bay.
<P>
	When will the minister start acting like a minister of 
agriculture and look after the concerns of western farmers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had been 
following closely the developments with respect to barley sales 
and marketing over the course of the last number of weeks and 
months, he would have known that the Canadian Wheat Board 
has had considerable challenges before it in enticing the right 
kind of barley into the system to meet the sales opportunities we 
do have.
<P>
	The board is obviously, in the circumstances referred to by the 
hon. gentleman, going to some extraordinary lengths to make 
sure that Canada meets the marketing opportunities it has before 
it. The wheat board would not be engaging in that pattern of 
marketing unless it was convinced it was in the best interest of 
farmers in making money for farmers.

<P>
	Would the Minister for International Trade please bring the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister some months ago raised 
the question of closer economic ties between Europe and North 
America, including the possibility of an eventual free trade 
agreement. He did so because on this side of the House we 
recognize that in the post cold war period, the era of the cold war 
having past, the security emphasis is no longer so central to our

economic ties.
<P>

	In addition, we are a government that recognizes the 
possibilities of going beyond the commitments we made in the

who cannot be given permanent residency in Canada. They 
cannot get permanent residency because they came to Canada 
with no identity documents and we have no idea who they are or 
what crimes they may have committed. We do know that most 
came from a country that was ripped apart by bloody civil war 
and terrible violent crime.
<P>

granting residency to one single individual if we do not know the 
full background and complete history of the person?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

consideration. There is a concern that a number of individuals 
have accepted refugee status from the Immigration and Refugee 
Board. On their application for landing, according to law, they 
clearly have to demonstrate documentation.
<P>
	A number of individuals are in this catch-22 situation. They 
come from countries where there is not only no government but 
no valid documentation to obtain. It is not an easy black or white 
situation. The government and the department are seriously 
looking at this file to try to come up with a solution which will 
clearly protect the Canadian community and also try to benefit

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this motion is a normal proposal at this 
time of year. The standing orders anticipate that there will 
usually be a backlog of business before the House in June. 
Therefore, as part of what might be called a trade off in the rules 
which provide for an automatic summer adjournment beginning 
on June 23, there is a provision for an extension of sitting hours 
during the two weeks prior to that date, the intention being that 
the additional time be used to complete business that the public 
interest requires.
<P>
	When the House resumed the session last September, there 
were five government bills on the Order Paper and seven in 
committee. Fifty-two more government bills have been 
introduced since that time. We have passed 34 of the bills and 
have made progress on 20 more, but we are now at that point of 
the parliamentary calendar when the rules I mentioned were 
designed to come into effect to facilitate a special effort to help 
complete the legislative agenda.
<P>
	I should like to outline for the House the business the 
government would like to see done by June 23, which I repeat is 
the date of adjournment for the summer period specified by the 
rules.
<P>
	It is our intention to seek completion of all remaining stages 
of Bill C-68, the firearms bill; Bill C-41, the sentencing 
legislation; Bill C-85, the parliamentary retiring allowances 
<P>

<P>
bill; and Bill C-72, dealing with the defence of criminal 
intoxication.
<P>
	We also will give similarly high priority to the completion of 
the debate on the motion for a special joint committee of the 
House and Senate to consider an update of a code of conduct for 
parliamentarians, that is, both members of Parliament and 
senators.
<P>
	We also would consider it a high priority to deal with, if 
necessary, any messages from the Senate concerning Bill C-22 
regarding Pearson airport and Bill C-69 concerning electoral 
boundaries.
<P>
	There are a number of other bills to which it would be very 
much in the public interest for the House to give third reading 
before we adjourn on June 23. Some of these are bills which 
have an impact on the fiscal position of the government or on 
economic development for the country. These include: Bill 
C-70, amending the Income Tax Act; Bill C-82, regarding the 
Royal Canadian Mint; Bill C-86, concerning the Canadian 
Dairy Commission; Bill C-88, regarding the removal of internal 
trade barriers; Bill C-89, the CNR commercialization 
legislation; Bill C-91, regarding the business development 
bank; Bill C-92, regarding the Canadian Wheat Board; and Bill 
C-94, regarding the fuel additive MMT.
<P>
	There is also an international commitment which Canada has 
for quick passage of Bill C-87 regarding chemical weapons.
<P>
	In addition, there are a number of bills that have been before 
the House for some time which ought to have their report stage 
and third reading completed so they can be moved on to the 
Senate very soon. I am speaking about Bill C-45, to update our 
parole and corrections system; Bill C-52, reorganizing the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services; Bill

Canada pension plan systems; and Bill C-65, to reorganize or

<P>
	We would also like to send to the appropriate parliamentary 
committee for consideration before second reading two rather 
complicated bills, Bill C-62 regarding regulatory reform and 
Bill C-84 also concerning regulations.
<P>
	This is a rather heavy legislative agenda. It is for this reason 
that we are proposing extensive additional sitting hours for the 
next two weeks, that is until June 23, the normal date of 
adjournment for the summer provided for to come into place 
automatically under the rules.
<P>
	Our proposal is for the House to sit until 11.30 p.m. with an 
additional half hour for the adjournment debate Monday through 
Thursday, and until 5 p.m. on Friday. We have opted for later 
hours than in the past because of the heavy agenda, but we are 
prepared to be flexible on a day to day basis.
<P>
	To conclude, I want to say accordingly it is our hope to be able 
to work with the opposition in the detailed scheduling of the 
business I have outlined with a view to serving the public 
interest, the interests of all Canadians. Therefore we seek the 
co-operation of all members of this House. I make special

Unless I am mistaken there are only nine working days in which 
we are supposed to be putting the 22 items through.
<P>
	He speaks in grandiose terms about serving the public 
interest. Truly in this House of Commons as members of 
Parliament we come here to serve the best interests of the people 
of Canada. I have to ask the solicitor general, how does it 
possibly serve the public interest when he comes to this House 
two weeks before the time when he wants to end this particular 
session, two weeks, nine working days, and gives the House 22 
items? To any reasonable minded Canadian reading <I>Hansard</I> or 
watching this debate on television, does it not give the 
appearance that this government is treating the House of 
Commons like a rubber stamp?
<P>

my judgment is irresponsible. Would the solicitor general care 
to comment on that?
<P>

	Why would the hon. member want to hold up for months more 
Bill C-45, to update our parole and corrections system? I 
thought that would be something the Reform Party would want 
to see in effect. Why is it backing down on something like this? 
This is the kind of thing we want to make progress on. We are 
providing extensive additional hours of debate.
<P>
	There are some measures that we are simply asking to be the 
subject of motions and referred to committee for more detailed 
study. Almost without exception we are talking about measures 
that have already had very extensive debate in this House and in 
committee. We are only asking that the final stages of debate, 
report stage and third reading, be proceeded with. We have 
extensive additional hours, which we hope all members of the 
House will be willing to use to complete these stages.
<P>

<P>
D (1215) 
<P>
	That is the answer to my hon. friend's question. Again, I hope 
we will have his and his party's co-operation in making progress 
on these bills in the overall public interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the House leader. The Reform 
Party is alleging this list was provided to it just now in an effort 
to adjourn the House, according to what the member says is the 
House leader's wish, on June 23.
<P>
	Is it not true that opposition parties have been consulted about 
the agenda on a weekly basis and that the list provided today or 
something close to it was submitted to the opposition many 
times before? Is it not also true that the rule provides that we can 
start using this mechanism of extending hours only next 
Monday? Finally, is it not also true that when we tried to extend 
hours in the past, very often the same people have refused to 
extend the hours when we wanted to complete the particular bill 
that day?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, we ordinarily do not discuss before 
the House consultations we have with other parties outside the 
House with respect to the business of the House. Under the 
circumstances, I can only agree with what the hon. member has 
said.
<P>
	We have shared this list or one very similar to it with 
opposition parties, not today in my speech for the first time but a 
number of days ago. We have sought co-operation-I point 
especially to the Reform Party-on working out the schedule to 
get this set of measures completed.
<P>
	The attitude of the Reform Party speaks for itself as to the 
degree of co-operation it has offered. I would not like to say the 
degree of co-operation it has offered can be characterized by the 
word zilch because I am not sure the word zilch is 
parliamentary; if it is not, I will withdraw it. If it is all right I 
will leave it on the record and everybody will know what I mean.
<P>
	It is quite correct that under the rules we could not move this 
motion for extended hours until today. There have been other 
occasions, I have been reminded by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, when efforts have been made to 
extend hours on individual measures, and opposition members, 
especially Reform members, have always blocked that. They 
could easily have had additional time to consider some of these 
measures individually in the past, and I am informed they 
blocked efforts to do this.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell has 
raised some interesting points. I hope my comments have shed 
some light on these matters.
<P>
	I further add that contrary to what was suggested by the leader 
of the Reform Party in some quite unwarranted remarks I saw 
reported in the press this morning, the date of June 23 is the date 
for the adjournment of the House for a summer break, which  
comes into place automatically under the rules of this House and 
has been part of the rules for some time. This should be borne in 
mind in assessing measures being taken to facilitate the business 
of the House in the days leading up to June 23.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when Bill 
C-68 came before this House everyone knew it was a very 
contentious bill. Yet all members were denied the opportunity to 
express the concerns of their constituents on that very extensive 
bill.
<P>
	Then the bill was rushed into committee and a deadline was 
set for the committee hearings. I did not object to that. I was 
only concerned that we were able to get the necessary witnesses 
before the committee in order to consider their testimony. Then 
we were rushed into clause by clause on this committee.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I ask the solicitor general why that we are in such a rush to 
move such a huge bill through the House in such a hurry when it 
is not going to become mandatory until 2003. What is the rush? 
Why could we not at least allow that bill to be set over until this 
fall, when everyone would have an opportunity to examine the 
large number of amendments that will be tabled before this 
House on that bill?
<P>
	I understand that there are well over 100 amendments. Yet 
time allocation is being imposed. Why is Bill C-68, many 
portions of which will not become mandatory for eight years, 
being looked at with such urgency? Why could we not relieve 
the demands upon the government, upon this House, and upon 
the members by simply allowing that bill to be moved and taken 
up when we resume sitting in the fall? I do not understand that. 
Would the solicitor general care to comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I should remind the hon. member that 
Bill C-68, the bill to which he refers, was debated for days and 
days in this House. It was then studied for weeks and weeks in 
committee.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of 100 amendments. Most of them 
are his party's amendments. I can ask why the amendments of 
his party were not proposed in the parliamentary committee, 
which is the normal time and place for amendments. Is the 
purpose of the hon. member at this time to use the device of 
proposing amendments simply to engage in what amounts to a 
filibuster? That is a question the majority of Canadians, who 
want this legislation, can validly ask the Reform Party, although 
the majority of Canadians who support this legislation already 
know the answer.
<P>
	The hon. member should be aware that in our parliamentary 
system the other place still has to consider this measure. That is 
its right and duty under our Constitution. If the hon. member 
does not want to see this bill and its implementation delayed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13536"> 13536 </A></B>
<P>
even longer than the date provided for in the statute, and if he 
wants to have adequate time for its orderly and fair 
implementation, then rather than urging that there be  further 
delay until the fall for the consideration of this bill in this House 
of Commons, he will be applauding our efforts to have it voted 
on before June 23.
<P>
	In my view, this is a fair and reasonable step to make sure that 
the bill is not only law but is adopted and implemented in a fair 
and reasonable way to serve the overall public interest when it 
comes to protecting Canadians from improper and unlawful use 
of firearms, which the majority of Canadians indicate over and 
over again in public opinion polls that they want from this 
Parliament.
<P>
	I am surprised that my hon. friend, interested as he says his 
party is in listening to people, refuses to listen to them on this 
important issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, the period for 
questions and comments has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to speak on behalf of the 
official opposition on the motion to extend the sitting hours in 
the House of Commons for the next two weeks.
<P>
	I would first like to clarify a few points concerning our party's 
position regarding extending the hours of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	In the past, the Bloc Quebecois has never objected, far from it, 
to extended sittings in the House of Commons, because it 
wanted to ensure that the parliamentary machine ran in a calm, 
democratic and efficient way. Each time it was proposed to 
extend the House's sitting hours, we have always replied ``count 
us in''.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	For example, during the last debate on the railway conflict, 
our members came to the House in great numbers over the 
week-end, Saturday and Sunday, which was quite 
exceptional-apparently these hours of sitting were 
unprecedented-to discuss the measure proposed by the 
government, whereas our colleagues of other political stripes 
were less diligent in this regard.
<P>
	The same thing will apply this time, but do not think that the 
Bloc Quebecois will support the government's motion 
lightheartedly. In fact, the sore point in this case is the timing of 
the government's decision to impose extended hours on the 
House. First of all, we must ask ourselves why the federal 
government waited until now, just before the session adjourns, 
to extend the hours of sitting in the House.
<P>
	Why did the government not extend the hours in a more 
balanced manner, in the weeks preceding the usual end of the 
Parliamentary session? There are several possible explanations, 
but the most plausible is that the government has again been laid 
low by two ills that have dogged it since it was elected, and by 
which, it would seem, it continues to be dogged. They are 
amateurism and improvisation.
<P>
	The amateurism is nothing new. As one example among many, 
we had the federal government calling an emergency debate 
with less than 24 hours' notice to discuss whether or not the 
peacekeepers should remain in the former Yugoslavia, just as 
their mandate was about to expire. Then, we were treated to a 
technical presentation by the Department of National Defence 
and the Department of Foreign Affairs only two hours before 
debate began. As they say, incredible but true.
<P>
	And yet, more recently, this same government had to be 
pushed to hold an emergency debate on whether our troops 
should remain in the former Yugoslavia, following the dramatic 
and tragic events that took place in that country not so long ago. 
Amateurism and improvisation still characterize the actions of 
this government now, for if it truly wanted to see its legislative 
menu passed before the summer, it should have known, it should 
have seen that at the rate things were proceeding, it was going to 
be virtually impossible to complete all business before the 
present session was adjourned.
<P>
	With all the resources at its disposal, the federal government 
should have foreseen that, in the present context, the House was 
going to have to extend the hours sooner or later. Although all 
the signs were there, the government preferred to stick its head 
in the sand, which has led to the present situation in which we 
must rush through a number of important bills. Unfortunately 
for the people of Quebec and Canadians in general, the proposed 
extension of the hours of sitting until late at night from Monday 
until Thursday will make it more difficult to follow the 
proceedings of the House of Commons on television.
<P>
	Similarly, the extremely heavy legislative agenda the 
government wants to ram through over the coming weeks could 
well compromise significantly the quality of debate in this 
House. The normal democratic process will thus be negatively 
affected. I mentioned earlier that a number of reasons could 
underlie the government's decision to extend the hours of work 
of the House of Commons beyond the usual times.
<P>
	I have just pointed out that the most plausible reason is the 
amateurish and improvisational approach of the government, 
which prevents it from planning its legislative agenda. 
However, I would like to come back to the point that, by 
extending the hours of work of the House beyond the normal 
times set out in the Standing Orders, the federal government will 
use the opportunity to push through major legislation that will 
hit Quebec's interests hard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13537"> 13537 </A></B>
<P>
	In this regard, and unfortunately for Quebec, the federal 
government has already used its majority in the House to have 
a number of bills passed, which have hurt Quebec's interests 
significantly. I refer to Bill C-76, among others, which 
concerns the budget provisions for the 1995-96 fiscal year and 
which implemented the provisions on the reduction in transfer 
payments to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps you will also permit me to say a few words on this 
bill, which is now before the Senate, in view of the extent of the 
damage it is causing to Quebec interests.
<P>
	Bill C-76 is nothing less than the implementation of the latest 
disastrous decisions in the federal government's most recent 
budget. This is the budget in which, need I remind you, the 
government made the unacceptable decision to transfer $7 
billion of its own deficit to the provinces. You will agree with 
me, Mr. Speaker, that $7 billion will likely make a substantial 
hole in the provinces' budget.
<P>
	Unable to properly manage the money of taxpayers in Quebec 
and Canada, this minor league government, through Bill C-76, 
is shirking its responsibilities by transferring to the provinces 
$7 billion out of its deficit.
<P>
	It goes without saying that Quebec will receive its share of 
this poisoned gift, which will directly affect its own public 
finances in the years to come. However, unlike the federal 
government, the Quebec government has already indicated in its 
last budget that it did not intend to offload its own deficit onto 
the municipalities. In doing so, Quebec has shown that it can 
take its responsibilities in public finance management, despite 
the blow it just took from the federal government.
<P>
	The federal government will merge into a single program, 
called the Canadian social transfer, two of the three transfer 
payments to the provinces, namely the Canada assistance plan 
and established programs financing. In 1996-97, after merging 
these two programs, Ottawa will cut $2.5 billion from transfer 
payments to the provinces.
<P>
	In the following fiscal year, the federal government will cut 
by $4.5 billion the Canada social transfer to the provinces. 
These unfortunate actions by the federal government will 
translate into a $650 million shortfall for Quebec in 1996-97. 
And, in 1997-98, this shortfall could go up to $1.9 billion.
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-76 helps us understand better the federal 
government's talk about cost-effective federalism. What could 
be more cost-effective for Ottawa than cutting the funds to be 
transferred to the provinces, when it is unable to manage its own 
finances? That is the cost-effective, flexible federalism they 
have been harping on about for several months.
<P>
	The federal government's actions with regard to Bill C-76 
hide a problem that is more serious than simply shovelling the 
Canadian deficit into the provinces' backyards, although this is 
indeed a major problem.
<P>
	Canada is facing a fiscal crisis, and transferring the federal 
deficit to the provinces is only the beginning of the central 
government's inevitable process to withdraw from its 
obligations.
<P>
	In this regard, we must remember that, in 1980, during the 
first referendum on sovereignty, the federal debt amounted to 
roughly $90 billion. Fifteen years later, the federal debt is nearly 
$550 billion. At this rate, according to the available estimates, 
the public debt accumulated in Canada will push its way past the 
$800 billion mark by the year 2000. You will agree with me that 
there is cause for concern and that these figures are telling us 
something.
<P>
	Bill C-76 is clear proof of the fact that, unlike Canada, 
Quebec is already able to take charge of its own public finances 
and would do well take full responsibility for them as a 
sovereign State. Also, Bill C-76 is underhanded in that it 
provides for the establishment of new national standards. While 
cutting back transfers to the provinces, the federal government 
will not only maintain national standards for health but also 
introduce additional national standards for social assistance and 
post-secondary education, areas which, must we be reminded, 
both come under exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	This means that, under clause 48 of this bill, Ottawa will be 
able to interfere in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
With the federal government holding the purse's string, Quebec 
would be exposing itself to being cut off by the federal 
government any time it failed to comply with these federal 
national standards.
<P>
	Moreover, in an area as important as education, one can 
wonder how Canadian standards can possibly meet the 
aspirations and expectations of Quebecers in that area, when 
Canada cannot even recognize Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
	As we say where I come from, you can see just by looking. We 
did not need a constitutional agreement to see-it is clear as 
day-that Quebec is a distinct society. Given that even this 
obvious fact could not be recognized, what can we hope to get 
from this system?
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-76 gives a free hand to the federal government 
to regard post-secondary as a social program. From now on, 
Ottawa will be able to enforce national standards in this area of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. If Quebec rejected the stan-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13538"> 13538 </A></B>
<P>
dards and refused or failed to comply with them, the federal 
government would be authorized to stop all transfers, even 
though this money is our own money, money coming straight out 
of Quebec taxpayers's pockets.
<P>
	Similarly, there is nothing in this bill to force the federal 
government to look for a consensus amongst the provinces 
before putting these new national standards in place. Indeed, 
while the federal government must consult the provinces, at 
least in theory, it is not required to get their unanimous consent 
before going ahead and implementing new national standards.
<P>
	Moreover, Quebec and the other provinces could, at any time, 
be the victims of new federal rules, since Ottawa has the 
authority to unilaterally amend the legislation.
<P>
	I want to say a word on the government's legislative agenda, 
assuming of course that it has one. Not long ago, the federal 
government informed the official opposition of its intention to 
pass, in the next two weeks, several important bills, including 
Bill C-88 on internal trade.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-88 is to implement the Agreement on 
Internal Trade. As shown during the debates on NAFTA and on 
the Uruguay Round agreements establishing the World Trade 
Organization, the Bloc Quebecois has always been in favour of 
trade liberalization and it supports the principle underlying that 
bill. It is common knowledge that Quebec is a free trader, and 
has been one for a long time.
<P>
	However, the wording of some provisions, particularly clause 
9, poses some problems. Clause 9, in particular, provides for a 
wider interpretation which could allow the federal government 
to intervene and impose retaliatory measures even when it is not 
involved in the dispute. The federal government is giving itself 
very important powers.
<P>
	Then there is Bill C-91, which concerns the Federal Business 
Development Bank. That bill, which is a new attempt by the 
federal to centralize, will again result in useless and costly 
duplication which will increase the government's deficit.
<P>
	While the trend, at least in Quebec, is toward regionalization, 
the federal government pursues its secular centralizing 
tradition. This is mind-boggling. I can only hope that Quebec's 
interests will not suffer too much when these bills are reviewed. 
This is doubtful though, considering what happened with Bill 
C-76.
<P>
	Should this government hurt Quebec's interests with these 
bills, as it usually does, it will find us in its way, like it has since 
October 1993. We will vigorously and tenaciously defend 
Quebec's interests, as we have done since we were elected.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The contempt shown toward Quebecers will only last for so 
long. Soon, with the referendum, the federal government will 
realize the price to be paid for constantly attacking Quebec's 
interests and basic values.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. member's speech, 
and you will not be surprised to learn that I am not entirely in 
agreement with some of the things he said because, of course, 
the Government of Canada, and the Liberal Party in particular, 
has made it a habit of defending Quebec's interests and that is 
what the Government of Canada will continue to do with the 
same level of interest as it has shown in the past and that is what 
it will continue to do in a prosperous and united Canada.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to look at his own track record and 
that of his party regarding the number of times they have 
supported attempts to extend hours in order to increase the 
number of bills which could be voted on by the hon. members in 
the past, before accusing the government of not moving fast 
enough to get certain bills through. We have appealed to them 
many times. Will he tell us how many times his party came out in 
favour of this? I think that the answer is zero.
<P>
	Will he also tell us whether he is aware that Standing Order 24 
and Standing Order 28 in particular provide for the 
Parliamentary calendar, and whether he is aware of Standing 
Order 27, which stipulates that we could not propose before 
today a systematic extension of sitting hours for the coming 
weeks? Since it is the first day and the first hour of the first day, 
how could we possibly have proposed a systematic extension of 
hours before today? After all, it is the first day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on some 
of the things the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said. He says the federal 
government has always made a point of defending the interests 
of Quebec. I have my doubts about that.
<P>
	If ever a government chose to ignore the interests of Quebec, 
it is the Liberal government. Or should I say governments, to be 
as specific as the hon. member for Louis-Hébert, the successive 
governments under the Liberals.
<P>
	People tell us: You have good representation in Ottawa, you 
have ministers from Quebec, you have a Prime Minister from 
Quebec. For more than 20 years, Canada's Prime Ministers have 
been Quebecers. The word window dressing comes to mind 
because, basically, has it done Quebec any good to have a prime 
minister or powerful cabinet ministers from Quebec in Ottawa? 
Did it prevent the implementation of the War Measures Act in 
1970? Did it prevent the unilateral patriation of the Constitution 
in 1982? Did it prevent the demise of Meech Lake? What does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13539"> 13539 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec have to show for the  fact that a number of federal 
cabinet ministers and prime ministers were from Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> An illusion!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> An illusion, as the hon. member for 
Louis-Hébert said. It was the illusion of French power. We have 
realized since then it was only an illusion, and Quebecers have 
realized this as well and will act accordingly this fall.
<P>
	That being said, the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell talked about a prosperous and 
united country. United it still is, at least theoretically, under the 
constitution. We will see about that this fall. But prosperous is 
something else. Prosperous, I am not so sure. I talked about this 
in my speech, and if the hon. member had listened carefully, he 
would have noticed that this country is not as prosperous as he 
says it is.
<P>
	But first of all, to answer his question, I wonder why the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell asked me a question 
in the House when he already knows the answer; in fact he gave 
the answer himself.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I said we had always shown we were ready and willing when 
asked to sit for extended hours, especially during that one 
weekend when we debated the government's outrageous 
proposal to deal with the railway dispute. Many of us were here 
when the House sat throughout the weekend to express our 
objections to the federal government's proposals. I said earlier 
that some of our colleagues did not show the same stamina, but 
that is not the point.
<P>
	As for the other question about Standing Order 27, I may 
remind the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
who says he listened to my speech, that basically, my point was 
not that the government had failed to extend the sitting hours of 
the House before. I said that because of the government's poor 
planning, now, towards the end of the session, we have a kind of 
bottleneck and will have to pass a number of bills at breakneck 
speed, which will not improve the quality of debate in this 
House.
<P>
	That was the point I was trying to make in my speech. The 
hon. member should listen more carefully next time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
always unfortunate that when a Bloc member speaks, we end up 
dropping into this whole us versus them; Canada, Quebec 
discussion and so on and so forth. The real issue here, as far as 
this motion is concerned, has more to do with the management 
of the affairs of the government.
<P>
	I wonder if my friend from the Bloc might not agree that what 
is going on here is the government has purposely backed up 
legislation to the point that it will be able to put pressure on 
certain issues and certainly on certain people in its back bench 
by bringing in time allocation on some of the so-called hotter 
issues.
<P>
	I would suggest-Mr. Speaker, you will have to correct me 
because I got away with this word the other day-that it is 
legislation by stealth. It is unfortunate that in Canada, where we 
live in a democracy, that the government would bring in time 
allocation, or closure by any other name, and then go forward 
with this knowing full well that we are coming to the 23rd. It is 
no surprise to the government any more than it is a surprise to 
my leader or any of the members in the House that we are 
coming to this point and yet we have this backlog.
<P>
	I wonder if the member from the Bloc would not agree with 
me that the motion we are talking about really goes to the whole 
core issue of the lack of management on the part of the 
government or, in the alternative, that the government is 
attempting to bring in legislation and treating members of the 
House as though they were rubber stamps.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
Kootenay East for his question. I thank him, because he is 
allowing me to drive home my message. I agree with him 
entirely. This is exactly what I was saying in my speech and in 
my response to my colleague for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. I said that, with its motion 
today, the government is behaving with unprecedented 
amateurism and lack of foresight.
<P>
	I agree entirely with my colleague when he says there is a 
complete lack of planning on the part of the government. My 
remarks were in fact intended to point out the government's bad 
planning of its activities, leaving us at the end of the session 
with a bottleneck of bills to consider and adopt in a very short 
period of time. This will affect the quality of debate and the 
quality of speeches, particularly, I would say, for my colleagues 
in the Reform Party in connection with the bill on gun control. I 
imagine they would have liked to say more about it, although I 
think a perfectly reasonable amount of time has been accorded 
it. I expect it is a concern for them.
<P>
	Our concern is for other bills, which will have to be debated in 
great haste and which perhaps could have been debated longer, 
in our view. The government, however, decided to submit a 
series of bills at the last minute, and so here we are with all these 
bills to consider, debate and adopt within two weeks.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	So it is a planning problem. It has nothing to do, as my 
colleague for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell explained earlier, 
with the fact that the hours of debate should have been extended 
earlier in the session. It has to do with the fact that the 
legislation now before the House should have been tabled 
earlier.

	In my question to the House leader I asked how it could be that 
we have 22 items that are supposed to be jammed through the 
House in nine days. I suggest now, as I suggested in my question 
to my colleague, that I cannot help but believe the government 
purposely and intentionally backed up the legislation to the 
point that when we come to debate these bills, the quality of 
debate will not be there because it will not be extensive enough.
<P>
	I can speak for myself on the issue of Bill C-68. As revenue 
critic I had an opportunity to speak on an amendment we had 
brought and discuss the question of how the revenue minister 
and the customs department were not going to be able to enforce 
the provisions in the bill. However I have not had an opportunity 
to express to the House, to these members, to Canada the 
concerns people have in my constituency over the issues that 
have arisen on the issues in Bill C-68.
<P>
	Reform has tried to encourage the government to deal with 
issues Canadians really care about, namely the deficit and debt. 
Bring in legislation, bring forward motions that deal with the 
whole issue of deficit and debt. Instead, on Tuesday night we 
came to the House and again worked like rubber stamps because 
that is the way the system works.
<P>
	Why are we not discussing how the system is going to be 
changed so that the members, as the representatives of the 
people of Canada, can regain control or even gain control over 
some aspects of the expenditures of the government?
<P>
	We should be here talking about tax reductions. We should be 
here talking about the issue of crime, not the paper thin way the 
government has come forward with its amendments, for 
example on the Young Offenders Act, but something with some 
real teeth.
<P>
	We should be talking about referendums, citizen's initiatives 
and free votes. We should be doing things that are going to make 
a change for Canadians. What has the government done? ``Oh, 
we are going to have a big change. We're going to bring Bill 
C-68'', which I submit is nothing more than a warm fuzzy. It 
makes people feel good.
<P>
	People are not dumb. Canadians have looked at that 
legislation. While many of the people who may want to see 
registration may say that they register cars and they register this 
and that. But when they are asked if they think registration will 
make any difference to society, to violence on the streets, they 
say that it will not make any difference but that it will make 
them feel better.
<P>
	The government is bringing forward things like affirmative 
action which was repudiated by the people of Ontario last night. 
The members know one of the major things Mike Harris won on 
was the issue of employment equity or quotas which the 
government is trying to bring forward and to strengthen. Come 
on.
<P>
	The government is also talking about bringing forward a 
toonie, which is the duplicate of a loonie. Why are we worried 
about $2 coins? Why are we not worried about making sure the 
coins get to stay in Canadians' pockets? Why are we worried 
about those kinds of things? Of course the government is going 
to say that the Reform Party is just trying to be obstructionist, to 
block things.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> True.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> The member says true, that is exactly what they 
are trying to do.
<P>
	The people in my constituency and I suspect anybody in a 
coffee shop anywhere in Canada is starting to become familiar 
with the word ``spin''. What kind of spin is the government 
going to put on an issue? It is really unfortunate that there are 
times when the spins are done in such an intentionally dishonest 
way.
<P>
	For example, I read in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> an article with the 
name of my leader mentioned which talks of treason in a closure 
deal. ``The Reform leader charged that the federal Liberals made 
a deal close to treasonist with the Bloc to close down the House 
of Commons for the summer by June 23 to allow separatists to 
begin campaigning for Quebec sovereignty on St. Jean Baptiste 
Day''.
<P>
	I find this next part really very unfortunate because there is 
spin and then there is unfortunate spin. It says that the Reform 
Party leader's accusation became distorted before it even got off 
Parliament Hill: ``To pretend the celebration of St. Jean Baptiste 
Day is somehow associated with treason is I think an insult to all 
French Canadians'', said the government whip. That is what he 
told reporters.
<P>
	We had some fun the other evening during the votes when the 
Reform Party whip stood and complimented the government 
whip, saying what an intelligent person he was. There was a bit 
of bickering and some fun over that compliment.
<P>
	I will say again that as with all members the government whip 
is an intelligent person. Therefore I have to ask if he was not 
intentionally distorting the words of the leader of the Reform 
Party when he was referring to the fact that the government had 
done a deal with the devil so that the House would be able to rise 
on June 23. This would allow Bloc members to get involved in 
all their separatist games on St. Jean Baptiste Day.
<P>
	That is exactly what my leader said. Unless the member has 
been misquoted, let us assume that Terrance Wills from the 
<I>Gazette</I> Ottawa Bureau misheard what the government whip 
said. However, for him to pretend that the celebration of St. Jean 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13541"> 13541 </A></B>
<P>
Baptiste Day is somehow associated with treason is an insult to 
all French Canadians. That is just an absolute total distortion of 
anything even remotely close to reason.
<P>
	Why do we have this kind of pressure situation right at this 
moment? Let us take a look at some of the bills that the 
government thinks are so important.
<P>
	When Reformers came to the House, unlike most of the 
government members, we had been listening to the concerns of 
Canadians with respect to the porky pension plan that MPs have. 
When we arrived here, for an extended period of time, almost 
three and a half months, we hammered and hammered at the 
Prime Minister: ``Will you do something about these pensions? 
Will you get them revised? Will you open the door so that we, as 
members of Parliament, can say: ``No, we do not consider 
ourselves a special group a people. We are not on a special 
plateau''. Will the Prime Minister do something about this?''
<P>
	That went on through the spring of 1994. The Prime Minister 
said: ``Well, you know there will be an election in 1997. Nobody 
will have to worry about pensions until 1997. We will get around 
to it. Sooner or later it will happen. There is lots of time''.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Then out of the clear blue sky the President of the Treasury 
Board introduced Bill C-85. Interestingly, he just happened to 
choose a Friday afternoon. It was a very slow Friday afternoon. 
Because the Tory convention was happening over in Hull that 
afternoon, there was no attention in the news media to the fact 
that Bill C-85, the little bit of fine tuning the government was 
doing on the porky pension plan, was being introduced.
<P>
	Then the Liberals brought it back to the House and with a 
number of different procedures attempted to get it out of the 
House. Reform Party members, to a person, have stated it is 
unconscionable that members of Parliament would put 
themselves on a different level from other Canadians. As a 
consequence, we stood  against it. We stood and we stood until, 
oh, my goodness, we suddenly have it in committee.
<P>
	So government members could understand the frustration 
Canadians feel, I have suggested it might have been a good idea 
to expose that bill to Canadians so that Canadians could have 
some input on it. But no, the Liberals decided they were going to 
have their very own hand chosen experts. I would suggest to 
their embarrassment the vast majority of their hand chosen 
experts really did not come forward with the kind of 
recommendations or testimony they were looking for in order to 
fit into their little porky plan.
<P>
	When the Reform member for Calgary West got up and left 
the room at the end of the testimony, in disgust I might add, the 
members opposite did the clause by clause study on Bill C-85 in 
12 minutes. It is called lightning speed, the speed of light. All of 
us know that the whole parliamentary system and a glacier have 
a lot in common. To get something through in 12 minutes makes 
me think that maybe it was sliding along on pig fat it went so 
fast.
<P>
	What we are looking at in the whole issue of legislation is the 
issue of exposure to the Canadian people. I use a three legged 
analogy when I speak to students. I enjoy speaking to students 
because I want them to appreciate the wonderful democracy we 
have. In spite of some of the things the government does, we still 
do live in a democracy.
<P>
	There are three legs to the stool of democracy in order for it to 
work. The first leg is the people. The people become involved. 
The second leg is the politicians. The politicians come forward 
with proper, sound, right thinking legislation. The third leg is 
the press. If we did not have the press, and if we did not have 
what the politicians are doing exposed to the people by the press, 
we would not have a three legged stool. We would have 
something that would not stand.
<P>
	With the issue of Bill C-85, the government, knowing that the 
press is not necessarily going to run and jump on this issue all 
that quickly, wants to get it in and out of the House as quickly as 
it possibly can. The government tries to destroy that one leg and 
the whole process of democracy ends up falling over.
<P>
	The government House leader raised a number of interesting 
bills. For example I cite Bill C-72. As a matter of fact, my 
colleague from Wild Rose was trying to get the government to 
move forward so we could have vote on this bill weeks ago.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	We were prepared to put Bill C-72 through the House in one 
day. What is the bill about? It has to do with the self-induced 
intoxication defence. This defence cannot stand. This is wrong. 
Students and other people in my community have asked me what 
the government is going to do. To its credit, the government has 
come forward with Bill C-72. If we, and I do not doubt for a 
second, the Bloc were prepared to put it through in one day, why  
now is he raising issues like this and saying that we must hit the 
June 23 deadline?
<P>
	The hon. member for Wild Rose has also brought to the 
attention of the House the issue of the admissibility of DNA 
testing in criminal cases. We have absolutely tragic situations, 
hearings pending in court where DNA evidence will not be 
permissible. If the government wants to sit all night long, the 
Reform Party will be here to put through the legislation so that 
DNA evidence can be admissible in court. That is a commitment 
I know I can make on behalf of the members of my party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13542"> 13542 </A></B>
<P>
	The issue is not that we are trying to stop legislation. In fact, 
we are trying to get the government to move on things like 
self-induced intoxication, DNA and fiscal issues. We are trying 
to get the government to move. For it to turn around and suggest 
we are trying to be obstructionist is an awful stretch of the truth.
<P>
	Let us look at Bill C-41, the much desired bill. Is this the bill 
which all Canadians are clambering for? I think not. Bill C-41 
has to do with sentencing. As many people in Canada know, 
there is one clause in particular which is singularly troublesome. 
That clause in the judgment of the Reform Party basically 
creates categories of victims. We believe that all Canadians are 
equal regardless of race, language, creed, colour, religion or 
gender. For us to be applying a test, to be applying a shopping 
list to create categories of victims is a step backward. It puts 
people who do not fall into that shopping list at a disadvantage.
<P>
	We would be voting against that bill on the basis of that clause 
alone as it presently stands. The most difficult part of that clause 
is putting the undefined term of sexual orientation into the 
shopping list. I believe that at least 80 per cent of Canadians are 
opposed to the inclusion of the undefined term of sexual 
orientation, yet the government is prepared to go ahead against 
the wishes of Canadians and against the wishes of many of its 
own backbenchers. Government backbenchers know there is a 
problem.
<P>
	Another thing which has happened is that there has been the 
passage under pressure of Bill C-76, the bill which got our 
friend from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce into so much trouble. The 
whip will be turfing him off his committee, trying to get 
everybody whipped into line. I guess that is why he is called the 
whip. The hon. member I just mentioned, although I absolutely 
disagree with his position, nonetheless is a person of principle 
who is prepared to stand and say that the Liberal Party does not 
have a mandate to go ahead with Bill C-76 and that he is not 
about to support it.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	The red book promised openness, protection of health. I 
suggest that the government is prepared to ram things through 
the House, to treat the House like a rubber stamp. I suggest if it 
walks like a pig, if it grunts like a pig, if it smells like a pig, it is 
probably a pig. If the government is trying to jam things through 
the House of  Commons with closure, time allocation and with 
extended hours, it is legislation by stealth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
like most members I would like to get on with the business of the 
House. However since the member thought to take up 20 
minutes of House time to babble on about a number of things 
which he obviously knows nothing about, I want to question him 
on a couple of matters.
<P>
	First, the member said that the House should be talking about 
matters such as tax reductions. Why is it that his party when it 
proposed its budget to the House did not include any tax 
reductions in its plans and simply cut social programs?
<P>
	Another reason I think the member knows nothing about what 
he was talking about is his comments to do with the proposal for 
a $2 coin. He somehow trivialized the proposal for the $2 coin. 
The member ought to know because it has been presented and 
debated in this House that the introduction of a $2 coin will save 
Canada $250 million over a 20-year period, simply because of 
the savings on reprinting $2 bills which erode. It is a very simple 
reason.
<P>
	The impact to the Canadian economy, to small business 
people who operate coin vending machines, is also going to be 
very substantial. The member has trivialized a move that will 
save Canadians $250 million. He has trivialized the impact on 
small business, all for partisan and opportunistic purposes. This 
member should explain himself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very happy to explain 
myself.
<P>
	On the issue of tax reductions, anybody who knows anything, 
and I know this member has an accounting background, would 
know that the biggest single problem Canada is faced with today 
is that the government refuses to acknowledge that we are 
spending $1,800 per second more than we are taking in right 
now. The problem is expenditures.
<P>
	We can come forward with tax reductions when we reach the 
point that this or any other government is prepared to bite the 
bullet and tell the people the truth. As the member for 
Willowdale, who is the chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Finance said the other day, until this government realizes that 
there must be cuts in the area of social spending under its CHST, 
there cannot be any balancing of the budget. Until there is a 
balancing of the budget, there cannot be tax reductions.
<P>
	On the matter of the toonie, what we are really coming down 
to is a question that has never been asked to the best of my 
knowledge, which is whether or not we need a $2 denomination. 
If the hon. member is talking about saving $250 million by 
replacing a $2 bill with a $2 loonie or whatever it is going to be 
called, I wonder how many dollars would be saved if we just did 
away with the $2 denomination. I want to make my position 
clear. I am not suggesting that nor am I recommending that. I am  
saying we should be looking at that before the bill comes before 
the House. I do not believe there has been any study done on 
that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13543"> 13543 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to speak against extending the 
hours.
<P>
	It seems to me that we have a contradiction on the basis of 
what happened yesterday. We have the government invoking 
closure three times so that it can ram through some very 
unpopular legislation. On the one hand, time allocation or 
closure is being forced on the House. On the other hand, we are 
talking about extending the hours.
<P>
	If the government were serious about quality discussion and 
quality debate on any of the bills, the last thing it should be 
looking at is closure so that we cannot have a full airing and 
debate of issues that are important to the Canadian people.
<P>
	In view of what happened in this place yesterday and what 
happened in the province of Ontario, it is interesting that closure 
was being rammed through the House on three very contentious 
bills. At the same time voters in Ontario went to the polls and 
rejected the bills, the government is attempting to ram through 
the House of Commons. It is unbelievable.
<P>
	It raises the suspicion that perhaps that was the agenda, that 
some very unpopular bills were not to be allowed to remain in 
the public arena for further exposure because things are starting 
to fall apart and they have to be rammed through. The wheels are 
falling off. MP pension plans, gun control and undefined sexual 
orientation are three issues that were overwhelmingly defeated 
in the Ontario provincial election.
<P>
	The government talks about zilch co-operation coming from 
the opposition. In my experience there has been zilch shown by 
the government in the way in which it has organized its agenda 
and brought to the Canadian people very important issues that 
need to be discussed.
<P>
	Two other things were very big factors in the Ontario election. 
One was that the common sense revolution was very much 
opposed to employment equity or hiring quotas based on race 
and sex, another bill the government is determined to put 
through in spite of the fact that it has been rejected by the people 
of the province of Ontario.
<P>
	I should like to talk a bit about the three bills because they are 
key to closure and trying to ram through legislation. I will start 
with the MPs pension plan. While it does not represent a whole 
lot of dollars, it is the flashpoint with the Canadian voter.
<P>
	We have seen it in Alberta where the premier of that province 
started out a campaign being less than double digit in the 
opinion polls. He started to listen to the people and realized that 
a gold plated pension plan was not supported in any way by 
them. Therefore he did  away with it in Alberta. As a result he 
gained some credibility and the people started listening to him. 
It was leadership by example. Somebody was showing real 
concern for the problem of overspending and debt by doing 
something about a gold plated pension plan.
<P>
	Let us move into Ontario. Mr. Harris stood and said that the 
gold plated pension plan was gone. That was a big part of his 
platform. It was the part of his platform that gave Mr. Harris the 
credibility he needed when he addressed other issues. Two 
provinces have addressed the concern and because of it have 
been rewarded by tremendous support by the voters. It is 
unbelievable that the message has not reached the House. The 
government thinks the bit of tinkering done on the bill will 
satisfy Canadian voters. It is an absolute sham.
<P>
	When I was campaigning and after I was elected I cannot 
think of a public meeting where questions and comments were 
invited at which the issue of the MPs pension plan did not come 
up. Voter after voter said to get rid of it, and I agree. It is an 
abuse of our office. We want fair compensation. There is no 
argument about that, but the pension plan is not fair. It should be 
made more in line with what is available in the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Here we have an issue of high profile that touches all 
Canadian voters. Many of our citizens would love to have 
pension plans. Some do not have them. Some are struggling 
without work. Many people are unemployed. Indeed many 
young people are underemployed. Because the government is 
showing no leadership in attacking that serious problem the 
dilemma continues.
<P>
	The MPs pension plan is nothing more than another broken 
red book promise. I know the red book was loosely worded. I 
have suggested that perhaps it should have started out with: 
``Once upon a time''. The problem with loose wording is that 
while it may get us off the hook by saying that we did not exactly 
say this or this is what we meant to say, the voters will make the 
same interpretation and say that they think this is what was said. 
When we do not follow through it is indeed a broken promise to 
voters.
<P>
	The comment made by my colleague from Calgary Centre 
about the $150,000 compensation has been referred to many 
times by the opposition. The point that was missed and 
continues to be missed by the government was that whatever our 
compensation the total package should be up front and on the 
table with no special deals and no tax exempt expense accounts. 
That was the point he was making regardless of the number. 
Perhaps he used the wrong number, but the main point he was 
making was that whatever we were to be paid should be up front 
and fair and we should make sure that all Canadian people know 
exactly what we are being paid.
<P>
	It goes back to the heart of credibility. Because of the failure 
of the government to attack and do something about the gold 
plated pension plan it lost all credibility  on the deficit and the 
debt. How can we go to Canadian voters and ask them to accept 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13544"> 13544 </A></B>
<P>
spending cuts when we are not prepared to show some 
leadership by example in making some sacrifice?
<P>
	The thing that continues to mystify me on the pension plan is 
that poll after poll clearly indicates Canadian people 
overwhelmingly want the plan changed. It is not even close. 
When a poll is broken down by party affiliation, the Liberal 
supporters also show overwhelming support for having it 
changed.
<P>
	We might have a problem with what is known as selective 
hearing. We hear what we want to hear and we ignore what the 
Canadian people are really saying.
<P>
	Money should never be the motivating factor for coming to 
this place. I do not think it is with many members. When I came 
to this place I had no idea of what the total package was and 
frankly I could care less. I was more concerned about the issues 
and bringing some fiscal sanity to this place. Compensation was 
secondary. We do not dispute there should be fair compensation. 
That is all Canadian people are asking for.
<P>
	The arrogance and the contempt for Parliament shown 
yesterday in the House have to be coming from the inflated 
popularity opinion poll numbers that are coming out. Liberals 
think they can do no wrong and the people love them. We saw 
what happened in Ontario to a Liberal party that thought it was 
up in the polls and could no wrong. It said: ``We will do nothing. 
We won't rock the boat. We will just ride this out''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> The same thing happened in Manitoba.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> That is right. The same thing 
in Manitoba.
<P>
	On the basis of inflated opinion polls that have no depth and 
when the rubber hits the road as it did in Ontario and Manitoba, 
the real poll comes out and the voters respond to politicians who 
are not listening to them. I am proud to say I opted out of the 
pension plan and all my Reform colleagues have opted out of it. 
I am looking forward to the next federal election. I am looking 
forward to a debate on MPs pension plans, anytime, anywhere, 
anyplace. I would relish it.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I have mixed emotions when I deal with the matter. While I 
want change on the one hand, I am absolutely convinced the 
Liberals are digging a hole they will never get out of. They are 
ensuring a Reform victory in 1997. There is no question about it. 
They do not understand. They are not listening.
<P>
	They think they won the election. They did not win the 
election. The Conservatives lost it. The Conservatives were 
thrown out. The Liberals just happened to be there. Canadian 
voters were very sure of what they did not want. They were not 
too sure who they should vote for but the message was that 
Canadian voters were voting on the issues. They are watching 
the politicians. They are watching the promises being made and 
for integrity. Not  following through on the promises made will 
cost them very dearly in the next election. So many of the 
promises in the red book have been broken at this point that I 
cannot see how the Liberals can possibly survive.
<P>
	We just had an indication of how good the red book is because 
the daughter of red book that was used in Ontario did them 
absolutely no good at all. It destroyed them.
<P>
	So much for pensions. I dealt with pensions because even 
though it is not a whole lot of dollars it is a major issue with the 
Canadian voter. It was in 1993 and it will be even bigger in 1997. 
There is no question about it because our financial position will 
have worsened, absolutely. There is no doubt about that. With 
the road the government is taking us down our debt situation will 
be far worse than it is today. We will be $600 billion in debt. We 
will still be overspending by $25 billion and we will have 
interest payments of $50 billion a year. When we try to balance 
the books to accommodate $50 billion in interest payments it is a 
real challenge for any government. The Liberals are not meeting 
their target.
<P>
	Let us talk about the gun control bill, one of the three being 
rammed through the House so that we do not have quality debate 
and we as the opposition do not get an opportunity to fully air all 
concerns. The gun control bill is a red herring. It is a smoke 
screen. It is an attempt to make the government look like a 
government in action. If we asked Canadian people what the 10 
most important issues are in Canada today, gun control would 
not make 11. Here we are wasting all this time and all this 
discussion on a bill that will do absolutely nothing to clean up 
the problems it is supposed to address: unsafe homes, unsafe 
streets and unsafe communities. It will do absolutely nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> It will not come into effect for eight years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> It will not come into effect for 
eight years. The Liberals have made a major issue of something 
that is not a major issue. They have not been dealing with major 
issues like the deficit and debt, the criminal justice system and 
creating jobs. Those are the issues Canadian people want 
addressed and they are not being addressed. Gun control was 
just a sham to make the government look like a government in 
action.
<P>
	When we talk about the gun control bill I hear comments from 
the other side indicating that it is supported by the people. That 
support is diminishing. When we ask people whether they 
support gun control they answer: ``Yes, we do''. When we ask 
them whether they think it will achieve a reduction in crime they 
answer: ``No, we do not''. They support gun control and admitat the same time that it will not do what the government says itwill do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13545"> 13545 </A></B>
<P>
	How do we adjust to that? Why would the government not 
respond to that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> They will spend money anyway.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> They say: ``Let's spend it 
because we said we were going to. It does not matter what the 
voter wants. Let's give it to them. We know what is best. Never 
mind the mindless masses out there. The government knows 
what is best''. Members are told: ``Don't listen to your people. 
We know what is best for them''. Do ot let them fool you. They 
really do not understand; we do. We have some kind of superior 
intelligence here and we know what is best out there''.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Mulroney thought that and he found out to his sorrow that 
when politicians do not listen to the Canadian people, as his 
government did not, they pay very dearly when they go back to 
the voters at the next election.
<P>
	During the Ontario election, Mr. Harris said he was opposed 
to gun registration. That is the other part about the bill which 
makes no sense. It is almost like it was an intentional deception. 
We are mixing apples and oranges in the bill. It is unbelievable. 
It is mixing law-abiding citizens with the criminals. It makes 
absolutely no sense.
<P>
	We made an attempt to have the bill split. There is 100 per 
cent support, I am sure in all parties and in all parts of Canada, 
for getting tough with the criminal misuse of firearms. That is 
where the problem is. That is where we have to address our 
attention. That will contribute to making our homes safer, our 
streets safer and our communities safer. No, we had to have the 
whole package. We had to have the harassment of the legitimate 
gun owner and combined with that the spending of all the tax 
dollars we do not have to accomplish nothing.
<P>
	Poll after poll has indicated the bill will not do what the 
government has said it will do. Time after time polls have shown 
that. It is a charade and the voters will see through it. The 
government is not listening. It is not paying attention. Perhaps it 
is selective hearing.
<P>
	On hate crimes, Ontario voters said they do not want the 
undefined phrase sexual orientation in there. Mr. Harris won on 
that. Here again we have the government pushing through one of 
three bills which nobody wants. The voters do not want them. I 
cannot believe the government does not the message. It is not 
listening. It does not want to hear. It will dearly; one term 
members. I am looking forward to the next election.
<P>
	The deficit and the debt is the issue we should be dealing with. 
We wasted all of this time on other bills which are not on the 
main agenda. We will extend hours to debate bills secondary in 
importance to the majority of Canadians. The number one issue, 
the burning issue, is the deficit and the debt, and we continue to 
fiddle while Rome burns. It is unbelievable.
<P>
	Unfortunately the first part of the budget did absolutely 
nothing. It is amazing the government took office after being in 
opposition for as long as it had and did not know what the major 
problem in Canada was and or know how to deal with it. We 
heard: ``Give us a year. We did not realize how serious the 
situation was. We need some time to have a look at it and see if 
we can do something about it''. It wasted a whole year. The 
government had been in opposition supposedly preparing to take 
office.
<P>
	Then we hear the government inherited the problem. At first 
the government would not even admit that it was a problem. 
What we heard about the deficit was: ``Do not be too concerned 
about it. Be happy. It is all right. Take an Aspirin, go to bed, 
wake up in the morning and you will be fine''.
<P>
	We were honest with the Canadian voters. We said this is a 
serious problem when we were campaigning. We were the only 
party to put in writing a plan to eliminate the deficit in three 
years with no new or increased taxes. We are the only party that 
had the courage to do that. We produced a document which 
actually had some numbers in it, not a red book full of rhetoric; a 
masterpiece of writing, an absolute fairy tale.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	We did worse than waste a year in the first budget. In that first 
year we gave away what it said was to be $350 million when we 
gave in to the smugglers. The government said it would cost 
only $350 million; $350 million when we were in debt to the 
point that we were is unbelievable. However, we found out later 
the government's numbers were wrong. It underestimated by 
about $500 million-only $500 million.
<P>
	In effect we gave away almost a billion dollars to the 
smugglers when we were so deep in debt and in overspending it 
was absolutely unbelievable. That is typical. It is avoidance of 
this issue and here again is where the gun control bill comes in, 
smoke and mirrors, let us hide the fact that we are not dealing 
with the real problem.
<P>
	I am looking forward to the next election because what 
happened in the House yesterday has absolutely ensured a 
victory for the only party listening to the Canadian voter and 
that will respond to the concerns we are hearing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member said something I agree with and that I think all members 
agree with. When we ran to become the elected representatives 
of our constituents and to serve in this place we did so because 
we wanted to make a contribution. We wanted to do what we 
could to make Canada a better place.
<P>
	The hon. member discussed what he felt was a number of 
deficiencies. Gun control came up, that registration will do 
nothing. I will share examples of how registration will help to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13546"> 13546 </A></B>
<P>
reduce crime. Some 47 per cent of crimes  involving firearms in 
Canada are committed with long arms, as reported by the 
Canadian chiefs of police.
<P>
	Today we have registration of handguns and this piece of 
legislation will now bring all firearms under registration. A 
specific example has to do with imported guns. Today a 
legitimate importer does not have to register the guns. In a case 
recently in Toronto guns imported were then turned around and 
black marketed to the criminal element.
<P>
	Under this legislation imported guns must be registered at the 
time of importation. As a result those weapons now cannot be 
very easily sold to the criminal element and used in criminal 
activity. That registration element alone will help to reduce the 
number of weapons getting out of the hands of law-abiding 
citizens.
<P>
	The member also made reference to Bill C-41. He referred to 
it as the sexual orientation bill and the hate bill when he knows 
full well it is a sentencing bill. There are some important things 
in that bill. I have a motion at report stage, which I hope all 
members will support, concerning sentencing provisions as they 
relate to aggravating circumstances. There are two 
circumstances, first where bias, prejudice or hate is involved 
and second where there is an abuse of trust or authority 
relationships. The motion I have raised with all parties and all 
members is to provide stiffer sentences for spousal abusers.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	This is an important element of the bill and I have asked all 
members and particularly this member for support on a very 
important issue. Bill C-41 is not about one issue. It is a 
sentencing bill, an extremely important bill that will help deal 
with crime in Canada.
<P>
	The member referred to the member for Calgary Centre's 
saying we should eliminate all forms of alternative 
compensation for members of Parliament and that members of 
Parliament should be paid $150,000 a year instead. This 
unacceptable.
<P>
	The member also said he may have used the wrong number. 
He has used the wrong number. What he has failed to recognize 
is that if we incorporate legitimate business expenses in income 
grossed up those expenses also become deductible on a tax 
return and there would be no limit. The tax act presently says all 
expenses directly or indirectly associated with earning income 
will be deductible. As a result there would be virtually no limits 
on what members could spend for what purposes. If $150,000 a 
year is not the number, what is the number?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments and question from the member for Mississauga 
South.
<P>
	Dealing with the compensation package and the real number, 
we do not know what that number is. We are not putting a 
number forward. We are saying the total compensation package 
has to be looked at and all the loopholes have to be eliminated so 
that whatever we are being paid we have no special deals, no 
gold plated pension plan, no tax exempt status. We can put it all 
right out on the table and let the voters, an independent group, 
decide what our compensation figure should be, not the 
members in the House. I am quite prepared to do that.
<P>
	The burning issue with Canadian voters is get it out in the 
open, stop this double standard of a better deal for us than they 
can get in the private sector. They are infuriated by that. You 
miss the message and you continue to miss the message and that 
was-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know that with great 
enthusiasm at times in debate we become more animated but I 
remind colleagues on both sides of the House that all 
interventions must be made through the Chair and not directly to 
one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did get carried 
away and I apologize for that. I will go through the Chair.
<P>
	On compensation the mistake was putting a number when a 
number did not need to be put. The point by the member for 
Calgary West was it should be above board.
<P>
	If we were to ask the Canadian people the top 10 issues they 
want to see the government dealing with, gun control would not 
make that list. It is a sham because we are not dealing with those 
issues. In dealing with the gun control bill we ask for proof that 
the registration program will do what the government says it 
will, but we do not get that.
<P>
	Polls show that people who say they support the bill do not 
believe it will achieve what the government says it is will. It is 
incumbent on the government to prove if it can that the bill will 
reduce crime. It cannot do it and that is why the voters are 
rejecting it. That is why Mike Harris won with the huge majority 
he did.
<P>
	On Bill C-42, it is a sentencing bill. It contains something the 
voters do not want. I keep hearing in the House it is what we 
want. What is important is not what we want but what the people 
we are representing want.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Obviously a lot of people 
want to speak on this topic but I can only give the floor to one at 
a time.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would prefer to 
remain focused on you rather than getting into a debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13547"> 13547 </A></B>
<P>
	The point that I was making is that it is what the voters want, 
not what we want or what we think they want. The point I made 
when I started out was that Mike Harris won in Ontario because 
he listened to the voters and adapted his agenda. The Liberal 
Party, on the other hand, provincially and federally, are not 
listening to the voters. They paid the price for it in the province 
in Ontario.
<P>
	My suggestion to the member and all members of the 
government is that you will pay the price for it in the next federal 
election because you are not listening to the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will make a suggestion. I 
think if we could all be somewhat conscious of the fact that 
when we use the word ``you'' it leads to something less than 
what we desire in the Chamber. I will leave it at that for today. 
The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hear the howls of dread on the other side and I do not 
understand why. I can only imagine it is because fear of the truth 
is striking the cords of their vocal organs.
<P>
	I can understand their reluctance to hear some facts. I have 
come today armed with the odd fact to deal with the question of 
time allocation that members have raised in the course of their 
remarks and the extension of hours that we are going to enjoy 
together next week.
<P>
	The first thing I want to say is that the hon. member for 
Simcoe Centre talked about what the voters want. He seems to 
have forgotten the lesson of October 1993.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Talk to us about the Ontario election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I am talking about this House, not about the 
Ontario legislature. The Liberal Party of Canada put forward the 
most comprehensive and acceptable program that has ever been 
put forward by a political party in the history of the country and 
that was the red book.
<P>
	I am sorry I do not have my copy here today because I know 
the hon. member who is making all the noise over there and who 
I urged a few weeks ago to get a copy and put it under his pillow, 
would not be so vociferous this afternoon if he had spent a little 
more time studying the red book. I can tell him that the voters of 
Canada chose the Liberal Party of Canada to be the government 
because of the promises in the red book.
<P>
	In other words, the voters chose what they wanted when the 
election was held. They made their choice on October 25, 1993. 
They are getting delivered to them what it was they voted for in 
the red book. Every one of the campaign promises from the red 
book are being enforced in legislation today. The legislation we 
will be dealing with next week under time allocation was 
contained in the red book. The government is living up to the 
commitment it made to the Canadian electorate in 1993 in the 
red book.
<P>
	I notice the Bloc is silent and agreeable on these points 
because it knows that governments are elected to fulfil certain 
commitments. Frankly, its members recognize the commitments 
we made were good and valid ones so they are agreeing with us 
in this respect. However, the members of the Reform Party like 
to think of themselves as a government that got elected but in 
fact, because of their success, having had no one here before 
except the hon. member for Beaver River, they think they won 
the election because a whole bunch of them got elected. 
However, what percentage of the vote did they have? Did they 
break 10 per cent or was it 15 per cent? Whatever it was it was 
not a number that inspires confidence in the hearts of Canadians.
<P>
	While hon. members in the Reform Party can argue that they 
may have won the confidence of the people in their 
constituencies, which some of them did, one of them had the 
lowest percentage anyone had to get elected, I think it was 28 per 
cent or 29 per cent of the vote. He still managed to get in. It 
shows how badly split the electors were in that riding. The fact is 
they did not win the confidence of Canadians with the votes they 
had. In my constituency the Reform candidate had 12 per cent of 
the votes. Canadians did not vote for Reform policies. They 
voted for Liberal policies. They voted for Liberal policies as 
outlined in the red book. Those are the policies that are 
contained in the legislation we are debating, and were contained 
in the list of bills presented by the government House leader 
during his remarks earlier today when he presented the motion 
to extend hours.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	While I can understand a certain disagreement between the 
Reform Party members and the members of the government 
because of ideological points of view or differences in policy-I 
remember the little blue book had other promises in it-the fact 
remains our party was elected with a substantial majority of 
seats in the House, a very substantial portion of the popular vote 
in the country and we are proceeding to fulfil the promises we 
outlined to the electorate in 1993.
<P>
	Instead of asking us to substitute-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Allmand.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am going to draw on an 
experience of a previous life, that of a hockey referee.
<P>
	One of the principles we strived for was not to have ``rabbit 
ears''. I am not seeking to hear more than I would customarily 
hear. I would not want to put in question or in doubt the validity 
of the convention of not mentioning members in the House by 
name but in fact by their ridings.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13548"> 13548 </A></B>
<P>
	The Chair understands the vigour of the debate, of the 
co-operation necessary within the rules and spirit of that debate 
in this Chamber and I hope all of us will keep that in mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope I did not refer to someone 
by name. I try to avoid that. I apologize for doing that if I did. I 
do not recall.
<P>
	As I was saying, hon. members opposite may feel their views 
represent the majority of Canadians but it is not an opinion 
shared (a) by the majority of Canadians, and (b) by the vast 
majority of the members of the House. While they might want us 
to substitute Reform Party policy for the red book we will not do 
it. We will not be dissuaded from proceeding with the policies 
outlined in the red book because of a lot of shouting and yelling 
from the other side of the House. Nor will we do so because of 
obstruction practised by members from the opposite side of the 
House. I want to refer to that right now. I have some statistics 
that hon. members opposite may want to hear.
<P>
	In respect of Bill C-68, about which we heard a lot of bleating 
and whining yesterday when we applied a time allocation 
motion to the debate on it, I want to point out what has gone on 
here. This bill was introduced in February, debated at second 
reading on February 16, February 27, March 13, March 27, 
March 28 and April 5 for a total of 20 hours and 21 minutes. 
Over 38 members of the Reform Party spoke in the debate on 
second reading of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> And we're proud of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> They may be proud of it but I would have been 
embarrassed at some of the speeches I heard. After 20 hours of 
debate the bill went to committee where it spent something like 
five or six weeks. I have forgotten the amount of time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> How many witnesses were refused to be 
heard?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> ``How many witnesses'', says the hon. 
member. Hundreds. The committee heard witnesses night and 
day four or five days a week for four weeks. Then it spent over a 
week studying the bill in committee with something over 200 
amendments, I am told.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Four hundred and five.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Four hundred and five, the hon. member says. 
He only serves to prove my point. Hon. members opposite are 
wasting the time of the House and Parliament. They are 
deliberately trying to obstruct the bill. They have no interest in 
seeing that democracy takes its full course. Members of the 
House are entitled to express their view by a vote. That is the 
normal way of concluding debate. That is what the government 
is seeking to do by the time allocation motion it has brought in 
respect of this bill.
<P>
	I do not know why the government House leader was so 
generous as to allow six hours on each stage but he did. The fact 
is we will be debating this bill next week.  Hon. members 
opposite will have a chance to express their views along with the 
other members of the House, the members of the official 
opposition and the members of the governing party.
<P>
	I am pleased we will have an orderly debate and that we will 
conclude debate with a vote to see what happens to the bill. I 
strongly suspect it is going to pass, notwithstanding the 
objections of hon. members opposite.
<P>
	Let us turn to Bill C-85, another bill dear to the heart of the 
hon. member for Calgary West. This bill was also debated in the 
House at great length. We are hearing bleats and whines again 
from the Reform Party about the time allocation motion in 
respect of this bill. It was debated on May 4, May 9, May 10 and 
May 12 for a total of 15 hours and 57 minutes. That is almost 16 
hours of debate. Then it was referred to committee.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	The committee proceedings were expeditious. The matter was 
dealt with in a day. We heard five, six or seven different 
witnesses during the course of the day. Then, as I pointed out 
when I tabled the report from the committee, every clause was 
carried unanimously in the course of the clause by clause study 
in that committee.
<P>
	Now the hon. member for Calgary West is objecting. He has a 
whole string of amendments which he wants to bring to the 
House. He did not bring them in committee. He got up in a huff 
and huffed and puffed and blew himself out of the room. He was 
not there to propose his amendments. We did not have any 
discussion on any amendments. Now he thinks maybe we had 
better change the bill, so we are busy debating amendments in 
the House.
<P>
	We have allocated four hours to debate the amendments of the 
hon. member for Calgary West, then we will have a vote and then 
four hours on third reading. After 16 hours on second reading, 
four hours on third reading, four hours in report stage and a full 
day in committee, I do not know what objection there could be to 
passing the bill. The bill was in the red book. Everything in the 
bill was promised in the red book except the extra things we 
have added which can only help make hon. members feel more 
comfortable.
<P>
	What did we add? Opting out of the pension plan, which they 
asked for. They asked to be allowed to opt out and that has been 
granted in the bill. They asked that the pension be reduced and it 
has been reduced in the bill. It is not enough for them, but it has 
been reduced.
<P>
	Let us turn to Bill C-41. This is another bill which hon. 
members opposite think should not come under time allocation. 
We have heard nothing but complaints from hon. members 
opposite about the bill; not about the whole bill of course, just 
about one clause. Again, we have another red book promise 
being implemented by the government. Hon. members opposite 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13549"> 13549 </A></B>
<P>
were not elected on the red book so they should not ask us to 
substitute their opinion for ours. We chose what we were  going 
to run on. We put the platform forward in the red book and the 
people voted for it in droves.
<P>
	Let us look at the record on Bill C-41. It was given first 
reading in June 1994. It was debated in the House on September 
20, September 22 and October 18 for a total of 8.5 hours. It went 
to committee on October 18, 1994 and did not come back from 
committee until March 22.
<P>
	Yet the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley is bleating from her seat about the fact that the bill was 
in committee for six months. What did she do all that time? Did 
she sit and obstruct the bill? Why did she not call witnesses and 
move amendments then? There has been a whole pile of 
amendments moved to the bill. The hon. member clearly does 
not want a decision in the House, she just wants to obstruct and 
cause delay.
<P>
	The government has to make a decision. That is what 
governments are elected to do. This government made a 
decision. Its decision was outlined in the red book. It brought the 
bill before Parliament. It has allowed ample time for debate, 
ample time for discussion, ample time to hear witnesses and 
ample time to consult. There comes a day when you have to bite 
the bullet and make a decision and, by George, we are going to 
do it next week. The great thing is that we are going to be able to 
sit until late to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Just what we all want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Exactly. It is just what we all want, as the hon. 
member says. I am glad he is as enthusiastic at the prospect as I 
am. I will have supper with the hon. member in the lobby.
<P>
	As we look forward to next week's late night debates and, 
undoubtedly, very late night votes, I can only say that I hope the 
weather stays a little cooler. I know that debate will be heated on 
many of these bills. I recognize there is a difference of opinion. 
However, the fact is that the government has to bring these 
matters to a decision at some point in time and the time has 
come. These bills have been around and they have been debated 
extensively in Parliament.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, they have not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says they have not. I have 
just been through the facts. I wish he would listen to my speech. 
If he would listen he would agree with me.
<P>
	The fact is these bills have been debated extensively and 
Canadians have been consulted. There is disagreement. Of 
course there is disagreement. We recognise that. However, the 
government made a commitment to the Canadian people in the 
red book. The government made a series of commitments, and 
those commitments form the basis of government action in the 
House and will continue to form the basis of government action 
in the months and years to come.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister made it very clear when he was 
campaigning, and I remember hearing him say this, that at the 
end of the day Canadians will be able to turn to the red book, go 
through it and say this government lived up to its commitments. 
As Prime Minister, he will be going to Canadians in the next 
election, whether it is 1997 or 1998-it cannot be too soon, and 
hon. members opposite must be very nervous at that 
prospect-and he will say: ``Here is the red book. Here are the 
commitments we made. Here are the promises that we kept, one 
after the other.''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> That would be a short speech.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What about the ones you did not keep?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says what about the ones we 
did not keep. We were not elected for two years, we were elected 
for four or five. There is ample time for us to live up to the red 
book commitments. It was a blueprint for action, not for one or 
two years but for the full term of a Liberal government. That is 
what the government is doing.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite refer to the Ontario election as though 
it is some kind of setback.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I can only say to hon. members opposite that in 
spite of their laughter, the setback is going to be with them. If we 
go to most of the ridings around Ontario-and the hon. member 
for Simcoe Centre knows this very well, and it is Ontario they 
are now concerned about because of this election, which is why I 
am referring to those particular seats-we have to add up the 
Reform vote and the Tory vote in the last election and see what it 
comes to. Had the two been together-and of course we know 
they are becoming bedfellows over there-they might have won 
a few more seats than the one they got in Ontario in 1993.
<P>
	The success in the Ontario election can be attributed to the 
fact that the Reform Party failed to field any candidates in the 
provincial election. We know why they did not. As a national 
party they are going to have a tough time the next time living 
this down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> It is because our members said no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says it is because their 
members said no. We know it is because their leader said no, not 
because their members said no. Their members in Ontario 
wanted to run, but their leader said no. We all know about the 
dictatorial powers possessed by their leader. Let me get the little 
green book again, if members do not believe me on that score.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13550"> 13550 </A></B>
<P>
	I know hon. members opposite do not like me to quote from 
the little green book, the little book of Reform, the gospel 
according to Preston Manning and the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Is that an authorized publication?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> If the hon. member who is doing all the yelling 
kept this little book under his head at night he would not sleep 
well. I suspect that is the problem.
<P>
	Listen to this on the struggle against the usual charges. I 
cannot really read this; it is in small print. It says: ``Reform 
candidates must effectively combat the charges of separatism, 
extremism and eccentricity, which are invariably levelled 
against any new party originating in the west''. That is on the 
Reform Party questionnaire, but it does not say how they do it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> If you are going to use a prop, give us the 
name of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I will read one more quote from the leader: 
``People make assumptions that we are eccentric, that we have 
weird baggage''-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the hon. parliamentary 
secretary is using a prop.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> No, I would rule that is 
not a point of order. In fact he is quoting from a document, as I 
understand it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I would suggest 
it would be valuable if the parliamentary secretary were to 
identify the document he is reading from. I am making a 
statement that there is no such authorized publication by the 
Reform Party in that form.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I say respectfully to the 
hon. member for Kootenay East that the accuracy of the actual 
document being quoted from that might be debated. But it is 
certainly not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the members' 
discomfort. They are simply trying to run out my time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Well, identify the document.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I did. I read the title to the hon. member. It 
says: ``The Little Book of Reform: The Gospel According to 
Preston Manning and the Reform Party''. It is published by 
Little Red Book, Arsenal Pulp Press. It is compiled by 
Christopher Gudgeon and Mark Leiren-Young.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> A little red book? Oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I am sorry that hon. members do not have 
copies. Anyway, I would like to quote from their leader before 
my time runs out.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: ``People make assumptions that we are eccentric, 
that we have weird baggage on policy, that we are extreme and 
that we are separatists. We are not extreme. We are not crazy. We 
are not separatists.'' That is the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest.
<P>
	With great respect, hon. members opposite are asking us to 
substitute Reform policy for Liberal policy. The Liberal Party, 
as a government elected on principles outlined in the red book, 
will not do that. I ask hon. members to stop asking for that. Vote 
against these bills if members want to do so, but for heaven's 
sake, recognize that the government has an obligation to do what 
it said it would do.
<P>
	If the Reform Party were in government I hope they would try 
to live up to their promises, as we are succeeding in living up to 
ours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two points of order. One, is it 
common when one quotes from a book or whatever that the 
member would table that document?
<P>
	Second, during his remarks the member made mention that 
the Reform Party was somehow in bed with the Conservatives. 
He is imputing motives, and I so not think that is right.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me be brief and 
succinct. That is no point of order.
<P>
	And more than five members have risen:
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 27, it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put 
forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the motion now 
before the House. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.
<P>
	And more than five members having risen:
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45, the recorded division stands deferred until Monday, 
June 12, 1995, at the ordinary hour of daily adjournment.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 2</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill S-7, in Clause 2, be amended by deleting lines 11 to 14, on page 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 3</BLOCKQUOTE>

with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``end of each fiscal year, by the President of the Treasury Board, a report for the 
year on the application of this Act in respect of all federal bodies.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, of these four amendments, the 
amendment of substance, which required the tabling of the other 
three, is Motion No. 5, that Bill S-7 be amended by deleting 
clause 5. The objective is to remove crown corporations from 
being covered by this bill.
<P>
	Historically, crown corporations are supposed to act at arm's 
length from political interference. In recent years they have 
even in some cases been expected to make money and to run 
their operations in the same manner as private business. 
Therefore, although this House can, if it wishes, proceed to pass 
laws to regulate the operations of federal departments, I suggest 
that when it starts delving into the minute detail of the 
operations of a crown corporation it is exceeding its authority. 
Therefore I have tabled these amendments.
<P>
	If we are going to talk about what government should and 
should not do, I would like to elaborate a little more on that. It is 
not the business of government to pick winners and losers in the 
marketplace. I have received more intense corporate lobbying in 
favour of this bill than I have ever encountered in the brief year 
and a half that I have been in this place. Let us be clear about 
something. I do not have a problem with the practical purposes 
of this bill. The objectives are fine. The intentions are fine. But 
we know where the road goes that is paved with these intentions.
<P>
	The bill is very general in its wording, but it mandates a 
market specifically for propane and natural gas. There is 
mention in passing in the bill to ethanol, to hydrogen, to 
electricity, but let us be realistic, let us be honest: what we are 
talking about is propane and natural gas. The propane and 
natural gas companies have been doing the intense lobbying, 
along with various manufacturers and jobbers who would have a 
special interest in converting the government fleet.
<P>
	I do not have any problem with the products of these 
corporations being used as automotive fuels. Propane and 
natural gas have a very legitimate place in the energy mix and 
they have a well-defined applicability for vehicle fleets with 
high usage rates, especially in urban areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13552"> 13552 </A></B>
<P>
	In my riding we produce large amounts of both natural gas 
and liquid petroleum, so I do not believe I can be accused of 
geographic bias. My objections to this bill are based on 
technological, economic, and environmental considerations. In 
other words, I am not lobbying for anyone.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	I previously stated that there are certain applications where 
the use of these alternate fuels makes economic sense. 
Unfortunately, within the government fleet a very small number 
of vehicles have a sufficiently high annual fuel consumption or 
cover a sufficiently high annual distance to make them 
economically viable for conversion. This has been brought out 
by one of the government's own studies, the Bronson study, 
which indicated that only some 10 to 20 per cent of government 
vehicles are really good candidates for conversion.
<P>
	However, in this bill the schedule of conversions suggests that 
by April 1, 1997, 50 per cent of all new vehicle purchases have 
to be for vehicles with alternate fuel capacity, one year later it is 
60 per cent and finally building up to 75 per cent of new vehicle 
purchases in 1999. Ultimately 75 per cent of all vehicles in the 
fleet will have to run on some alternate fuel.
<P>
	An amendment has been presented and passed in committee 
adding the words ``where it is economically feasible''. When 
this was discussed in committee nobody seemed to know exactly 
what that meant. Frankly, I do not know what it means either 
because where economically feasible can mean whatever one 
wants it to mean depending on who is presenting the argument. 
This muddy bill has been mudified even further with this 
amendment.
<P>
	Let us do what we are supposed to do in this House which is to 
formulate policy. Let us not tell our fleet managers for heaven's 
sake how to manage their fleets. How nitpicking in detail do we 
get and for what reason?
<P>
	I would suggest that the lobbyists who are pressing for this 
bill want to set a precedent. They want to show that there is an 
opening for their product. If they cannot sell it in the 
marketplace or convince people to convert on the basis of sound 
economics then they say: ``Let us have the government mandate 
a market for us, even if it is just a little tiny one of 39,000 
vehicles''. If my amendment is accepted, it would be 25,000 
vehicles out of some seven million cars and vans. It is not going 
to make a great deal of difference to them on the spot. However, 
it sets a precedent of government interference in the normal 
course of doing business in the fuel industry. That is what I and 
the Reform Party do not want to see.
<P>
	I mentioned the environmental aspects. Everything is not 
black and white on the environmental effects of converting from 
gasoline or diesel over to natural gas and propane. Some 
emissions actually are worse with the compressed gas products 
than they are with gasoline and diesel.
<P>
	I refer specifically to nitrous oxides. Because of the higher 
compression ratios of the gas powered vehicles they are 
produced in considerably higher quantities than they are in 
gasoline and diesel motors. This has a profound effect on acid 
rain among other things. Other pollutants such as carbon dioxide 
are produced in lower quantities than the gaseous fuels. 
However, it is not entirely black and white.
<P>
	Therefore, I am stating flatly that these decisions should be 
left to the experts, the people we pay to operate our motor pools. 
We as politicians should keep out of it. We are not all mechanics 
or engineers. Let us let the marketplace decide what will happen 
here. If the product is good these lobbyists should be out selling 
it to the people who have to do the buying, not selling it here in 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	I almost hate to admit it but in part of our government we do 
have some good management, in the RCMP fleet. It has 32 per 
cent of the vehicles owned by the federal government apart from 
the crown vehicles. It certainly does not want to be put in a 
position of being mandated to do a conversion. Can we envisage 
pursuit cars on the highway powered by propane? The RCMP 
could change its slogan from ``we get our man'' to ``we 
sometimes catch him if he does not have a good start''.
<P>
	Propane has its place; natural gas has its place. These places 
should be decided on the basis of practicality and realism, not on 
the basis of what some high powered lobbyist wants the 
government to do.
<P>
	During first reading there was some comment about ways the 
government, if it is sincere about wanting to do away with 
emissions, could solve some of the problems without getting 
into conversion. I believe my hon. colleague from Macleod 
suggested the ministers with their big fat limousines could have 
their chauffeurs turn the motors off once in a while in winter 
when they are parked out front.
<P>
	Maybe they could even go to smaller vehicles. I would like to 
see all the ministers put in very small cars. If the government 
really wants to cut down on the emission of noxious gases in the 
precincts of government it could drive the whole bunch of them 
into the Ottawa River. That would be a good form of closure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
you have been very patient so far, and I hope you will be patient 
with me, too.
<P>
	This planet was loaned to us, so to speak, so that we could 
improve it if possible. If we want to leave a valuable legacy to 
our children, we must protect the earth. Obviously, I am in 
favour of Bill S-7, because its purpose is to convert 75 per cent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13553"> 13553 </A></B>
<P>
of all federal vehicles by the year 2004 so that they can run on 
fuels that are less damaging to the environment. I think that this 
should have been done a long time ago.
<P>
	The bill defines alternative fuels as fuels that are less 
damaging to the environment. What I find harder to understand 
is that the expression ``less damaging'' is not defined in the bill. 
What does that mean?
<P>
	In proper French, propane gas should be called ``propane'' 
instead of ``propane gas''.
<P>
	Here are some facts. The federal fleet now includes more than 
39,000 vehicles, which emit some 156,000 tonnes of carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere every year. This is terrible.
<P>
	Every year, 570 million tonnes of various greenhouses gases 
are emitted into the air from coast to coast. This is called 
pollution. For the past 18 years or so, the gases accumulated in 
the air have caused a gradual warming of the planet. The best 
experts predict that the earth's average temperature will rise by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius within a few years, which is almost 
unbelievable.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	This rise in temperature will have a major impact on sea 
levels, on ecosystems, of course, on the amount of drinking 
water and, as a result, on agriculture and human health.
<P>
	Every year, new diseases appear. We do not know where they 
come from, but we know very well where they are leading us. 
They are leading us to our death, of course, without our realizing 
it. By polluting the environment, thus aggravating these 
diseases, we are killing thousands of children.
<P>
	We will then spend enormous amounts on detecting these 
diseases. It is an endless cycle because, humans being what they 
are, they cannot keep adapt to nature. You know, nature is 
brilliantly organized; yet, with all our brains, we are going to 
destroy it.
<P>
	The Canadian government has committed itself in front of the 
international community to stabilizing greenhouse gas 
emissions at their 1990 level by the year 2000. The problem is 
however that, while she was prepared to do that much, the hon. 
minister was unable to get Cabinet approval. This means that 
there are several ministers on the other side of this House who 
are not aware of the consequences. That is a tragedy.
<P>
	Carbon dioxide emissions in Quebec are half the Canadian 
average. We, in Quebec, have been taking our responsibilities in 
this regard for many years. If only the federal government would 
follow our lead. I am not saying that everything is hunky-dory 
in Quebec; much needs to be done, but compared to others, we 
are certainly on the right track.
<P>
	Some, like the Reformers, question the validity of scientific 
results pointing to the existence of a greenhouse effect. I would 
like to share with you some of the reasons why I am for Bill S-7. 
In addition, this bill was introduced by a senator, and I 
congratulate him on that.
<P>
	In a speech to this House, I said that the senators were 
creatures living in a large aquarium, in which they swim now 
and then, although not too fast, and then rest. But seriously-I 
must be logical and responsible here-there are senators who do 
an excellent job and the sponsor of this bill is one of them.
<P>
	By passing Bill S-7, we will force the Canadian government 
to set an example. It will have to practice what it preaches, 
which it has never done yet.
<P>
	Of course, Treasury Board directives were issued regarding 
the conversion and improved management of the federal fleet. 
However, we are forced to recognize that these have hit a wall of 
inaction and resistance to change. Only through legislation will 
the government departments and agencies be forced to comply 
with the new environmental priorities.
<P>
	In addition, the federal government will save approximately 
$43 million in fuel over five years and another $15 million in the 
following years. Of course it will be a little more expensive. It 
will cost almost $1,500 more per vehicle purchased, a total of 
approximately $38.5 million more over a period of five years. 
However, it should also create savings of $7 million over five 
years.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Converting the federal government's fleet will have a ripple 
effect which will break the vicious circle of the low demand for 
converted vehicles because of the small number of outlets 
selling the fuel, which itself is caused by the small number of 
converted vehicles on the road, etc, etc. We hope that the large 
car manufacturers and fuel suppliers will take this opportunity 
to develop new models and to cultivate new markets.
<P>
	Clause 2, however, sets three conditions in the legal definition 
of an ``alternative fuel''. The three conditions are the following. 
The fuel must be: (a) for use in motor vehicles to deliver direct 
propulsion; (b) less damaging to the environment than 
conventional fuels, and (c) prescribed by regulation.
<P>
	I have some doubts about that definition, even though we 
support this bill.
<P>
	One can, nevertheless, not help but wonder about the 
relevance of designating specific fuels which, after scientific 
analyses and the development of new technology, could very 
well be condemned within a few years as more harmful to the 
environment than other fuels.
<P>
	I will give you an example. According to an article in <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, a study carried out by Carnegie University revealed that 
a 1988 vehicle which ran on electricity emitted 60 times more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13554"> 13554 </A></B>
<P>
lead into the environment per kilometre than a comparable 
vehicle which ran on leaded gasoline.
<P>
	What is considered less harmful at a given point in time can 
change drastically because of new developments and new 
technology.
<P>
	Despite these reservations, we support Bill S-7. Canada, the 
second largest producer of garbage in the world, the second 
greatest energy consumer and second highest emitter of 
greenhouse gases per capita, cannot afford to once miss such an 
opportunity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I join in the debate today with a mixed message. Very 
few things we encounter in Parliament and in life are entirely 
black or entirely white. They are usually a shade of grey, with 
the notable exception of the ongoing pension debate which is 
fairly direct in black and white. One is either on the side of the 
angels on that one or not. Today we are talking about Bill S-7, 
the alternative fuels act. In my opinion it is not quite so cut and 
dried.
<P>
	Our party is basically a free enterprise party. Our position is 
that if it can be done in the marketplace by the marketplace that 
is probably where the motivation and the determination for what 
happens in life should be made, primarily if we are talking about 
things commercial.
<P>
	The legislation is typical of government's desire to somehow 
manipulate the market or determine what is best for Canadians 
rather than let the marketplace decide what is best for 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	On the other side of the coin is the fact that most people are 
very much aware that some alternative fuels, specifically 
propane and natural gas, are far less polluting to the atmosphere. 
They are in great supply in Canada and are relatively cheap.
<P>
	If we could induce the marketplace to convert to propane or to 
natural gas, we would definitely be in a win-win situation, 
especially if the inducement for the marketplace to convert was 
of a moral suasion nature rather than an inducement by having to 
spend taxpayers' money to do it.
<P>
	Other aspects of the bill on alternative fuels are not so benign. 
My colleague who spoke before me raised the point about 
electric cars. There is a possibility that electric cars put more 
lead into the atmosphere than people had anticipated. When we 
talk about converting to ethanol we have to look beyond the 
immediate where it makes sense to use ethanol as a replaceable 
product. We can grow it. We can get it from the farms. It is not a 
depleting resource. It makes sense, especially if it is mixed with 
gas. However, as we dig into the ethanol situation we discover 
the cost to the environment to produce ethanol is not so benign. 
It has to be fertilized. It costs a fair amount to grow the crop. 
Then resources have to be put into the refining of ethanol. The 
cost relative to gasoline is substantially higher.
<P>
	The bill is not quite so easy. While part of it deals with 
alternative fuels which are readily changeable to and are very 
good for the environment, part of it also deals with other 
alternative fuels that may not be.
<P>
	I should like to put on record a few thoughts about what 
happened in Brazil's mandate to move to ethanol:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Brazil's ethanol program is the world's largest and most ambitious 
government initiative supporting alternative motor fuels. In 1979, Brazil's 
passenger car fleet was comprised almost exclusively of gasoline vehicles; a 
decade later, about 30 per cent of its vehicles were built to run on ethanol. In the 
period 1975 to 1979, ethanol was blended with gasoline as a fuel extender in a 20 
per cent ethanol-80 per cent gasoline blend.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1979, as a result of large oil price increases, the government decided that a 
new fuel-96 per cent ethanol-was needed to replace gasoline at the fastest 
possible rate. This decision meant that new fuel and automotive infrastructures 
were required. A large expansion of ethanol production capacity was needed to 
meet the government's new target of 10.7 billion litres by 1985. This changed the 
cost and character of the program: until 1979, ethanol production had been 
increased by using existing distilleries at sugar refineries; the 1985 ethanol 
production target could only be met by building new free-standing distilleries 
dedicated to producing ethanol. There were also new demands placed on the fuel 
distribution system. For example, local fuel stations needed to add pumps 
dedicated exclusively to dispensing ethanol fuel.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Consumers who had converted vehicles to take advantage of ethanol prices 
encountered problems with poor quality conversions. Also, after 1980, 
consumers faced higher fuel prices when the government increased ethanol 
prices [previously as low as 40 per cent of the price of gasoline].</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This begs a question. We were going through the effort then to 
convert to alternative fuels that are cheaper today. What will 
happen when the market supply is such that suddenly there is 
enough demand? The price is likely to go up and we will not 
have a price advantage. That is the way the marketplace tends to 
work.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	The quotation continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Consumers reacted rapidly, and ethanol vehicle sales fell to less than 10 per 
cent of total vehicle sales by July 1981.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government then renewed its support for the program by holding ethanol 
prices at 59 per cent of gasoline prices for two years and extending ethanol 
vehicle purchase incentives. Auto makers improved ethanol vehicles by using 
corrosion resistant materials, adding a small pump to inject gasoline to reduce 
cold starting problems and improving ethanol vehicle warranties. Public 
confidence in ethanol vehicles steadily recovered, with purchases peaking in 
1985 at about 95 per cent of the vehicle sales.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ethanol demand began to outstrip production as early as 1986. From late 1989 
to early 1990, there was an acute shortage of ethanol, and consumers with 
dedicated ethanol vehicles waited in long fuel lines. Ethanol vehicle sales dropped 
from over 50 per cent of the 1988 market to less than 4 per cent of vehicle sales in </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13555"> 13555 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>mid-1990. Most cars made in Brazil now are designed for ethanol/gasoline blends 
rather than neat ethanol.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was a long quote, but I thought it important to refer to the 
fact that once the government gets into the marketplace by 
regulating either the gasoline that can be sold, or the types of 
vehicles that should be sold, or in one way or another artificially 
changing the cost of a particular fuel, it sets up an intrinsic, 
automatic adjustment in the marketplace. The marketplace will 
be its own master. No matter how beneficial or how benign the 
intent behind a government motion might be, we cannot 
automatically assume that the result in the marketplace will 
have the same benign reaction.
<P>
	As I said earlier, there are conversions which on the face of 
them make great sense: the conversion to propane or to liquefied 
natural gas, particularly the conversion to propane in Canada. I 
believe there are over 3,000 stations in existence today in 
Canada that will allow people to fill up their vehicles with 
propane. Propane is significantly lower in price than gasoline. It 
has wide acceptance in fleets of taxis. It has wide acceptance in 
other industrial fleets. It is a consumer recognized good product.
<P>
	There is really no need for the government to provide any 
particular incentive for people to use common sense. We as a 
nation do not have the money any longer to be inducing 
consumers or changing the marketplace at our whim.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to rise to speak to this issue today. You can tell by 
looking at me that I am a person who believes in great efficiency.
<P>
	We ought to do everything possible to utilize our available 
fuel sources in the most efficient manner and to conserve our 
environment. They are two very worthy goals and probably 
there is no debate from anyone on that point. There should be no 
difference. I believe all Canadians in general would agree.
<P>
	If the goals in terms of moving people and materials in a 
transportation system are the most efficient use of limited 
resources and the elimination or reduction as much as possible 
of pollution of the air, ground and water environments, how 
should those goals be accomplished?
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Once again we have an example of a government thinking that 
unless it legislates it, it will not happen. I reject that hypothesis 
forthwith. I am sure people who come up with ideas to pass these 
laws are well motivated. There is no doubt about that but when 
one thinks of producing a law such as the one we are looking at 
today, it does start out with the assumption that if this law were 
not passed nothing would happen.
<P>
	That is not true. By and large Canadians are becoming more 
aware of their environmental responsibilities and simply 
because of that they are beginning to make adjustments in their 
lifestyles. Members of my family and I have been doing this for 
a long time. We used alternate fuels to the day many years ago. 
When it was possible we rode our bicycles.
<P>
	Maybe what the government should do is say everybody in the 
federal civil service instead of having a vehicle should have a 
bicycle. Maybe we should ask our Prime Minister who has gone 
from his Cadillac, Lincoln or whatever he had before to the 
Chevy to get a bicycle built for two. His assistant could help him 
provide the power. He would come toddling down Sussex Drive 
to the Hill every day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> He rode a bike in Beijing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> He has proven he is athletically oriented and that 
would be a wonderful statement of government leadership in 
how to move passengers in an efficient way.
<P>
	Members may know if they have ever read <I>Scientific 
American</I> that of all the modes of transportation the one 
requiring the least amount of energy per kilometre is the 
bicycle; the clear winner over every other form of 
transportation. If we want to reduce costs and pollution we 
ought to be pushing bicycles.
<P>
	Bill S-7 specifies we should go for alternate fuels. One of the 
things that disturbs me or causes me the most amount of concern 
is here again we have the push toward quotas and legislative 
requirements. I know it is good to set goals. There is nothing 
wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with saying we ought to 
set a goal but the error in this bill is instead of using the 
legislation to set a performance goal we are using the legislation 
to set a method goal.
<P>
	In other words, we are not saying we want to have vehicles run 
with better and cheaper fuel that pollute the atmosphere less. We 
are saying we require a certain quota of vehicles converted for 
alternate fuel.
<P>
	I noticed in scanning the bill there is an internal contradiction. 
It states that by a 2001 the goal is to have 75 per cent of vehicles 
on alternate fuels. If 75 per cent of the vehicles are on a certain 
type of fuel, the other ones are the alternate because these are 
now in the majority. If we did that our definitions would have to 
be changed. That is a moot point but it is one where we need to 
be careful in what we say.
<P>
	Most important, is it really cost effective? We know that to 
convert vehicles manufactured for one type of fuel is a costly 
activity. The return economically on that conversion is only 
there if the vehicle is driven a sufficient distance per year. For 
most of these conversion costs the fuel source is also less 
expensive and so there is a financial gain to be had. However, 
unless one drives the vehicle a sufficient distance it is not 
economical.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13556"> 13556 </A></B>
<P>
D (1450) 
<P>
	Approximately 70 per cent of vehicles owned by the federal 
government or its agencies are driven a distance less than the 
critical point at which it is economical to do the conversion. We 
need to go back one step and say that instead of converting 
existing vehicles we need to produce vehicles in the first place 
with the ability to handle current or alternate fuels.
<P>
	Here again we have a great problem because it is impossible 
to predict with accuracy the future. It could well be because of 
certain economic or environmental disasters or things beyond 
our control that certain types of fuels will become unavailable in 
sufficient quantity. As the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest mentioned, there have been examples of vehicles 
designed to run on one kind of fuel suddenly being parked 
because no fuel is available. It is wise to have dual fuel vehicles 
not only for the availability of the fuel but also in the event it 
goes out of the range of the alternate fuel station.
<P>
	There are many dual vehicles. I have been a passenger in a 
vehicle in which there is a switch on the dash. It drives along on 
propane and as soon as the propane is gone and the propane 
station is out of range, the driver can flip a switch and the 
vehicle will resume running on gasoline as it was originally 
intended. That is a cost item. Vehicles which run on two fuels 
require a greater cost in manufacturing if it is done at the 
manufacturing level and certainly involves a cost if done at the 
conversion level.
<P>
	Another factor is what proportion of the cost is the actual cost 
of producing the fuel and what proportion is the taxation. 
Provinces and certainly the federal government have fuel taxes. 
There has been a bit of publicity given to the latest fuel tax the 
government had the audacity to introduce in the last budget. It 
was a nominal 1.5 per cent per litre. Many Canadians do not 
realize that figure is not accurate; it is a new tax of 1.605 cents 
per litre since GST is paid on the tax as well. The government is 
not happy unless it is taxing the taxes.
<P>
	Propane, compressed natural gas and normal gasoline, as we 
call it, have different taxation levels. It is no secret, at least in 
Alberta, that one of the main reasons propane is economical is 
simply that the government is not taxing it. At the 
manufacturing or refinery level the cost of the two fuels was not 
that much different. The tax differentiated them.
<P>
	Perhaps we should simply change the tax structure to give a 
slight advantage to one fuel if it can be proven advantageous to 
the environment. Here again I express caution because we are 
now intruding in the marketplace and what we ought to be doing 
is setting performance standards, not method standards. In other 
words, we do not care how the goal is achieved; rather we do 
care the stated environmental goal is achieved.
<P>
	I can think of specific examples in which governments have 
tried to encourage good environmental practices. I remember 
the $100 tax on air conditioning. That was really a very bad tax, 
because there were a lot of vehicles that were much more 
efficient with air conditioning than without.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	I would simply urge the government to think very carefully 
about passing bills of this nature, which are so coercive and are 
not clearly defined in terms of objectives to be met.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
an old saying for the Liberals: ``If it moves, regulate it; if it does 
not, tax it''. It seems to me that this bill is yet another one of 
them that is being supported. I recognize that it came originally 
from the other place of great rest. We took a look at it and we are 
wondering what we should be doing about it. Then when the 
Liberals took it under their wing as if it were one of their own, 
we really started to take a look at it and we realized that it fit the 
principle of ``if it moves, regulate it''.
<P>
	One of the biggest problems we have in Canada today, 
whether it is this bill or anything else, is the constant, 
never-ending interference of all levels of government in 
everything we could possibly imagine: if it is interaction 
between people, let us legislate it and get it made right by 
legislation; if it is interaction between people relative to 
commerce then we have to make sure we have that absolutely 
airtight.
<P>
	What do we have motor pool managers for? Why do we have 
departments in the government and crown corporations that look 
after matters like this? What is their job? If their job is not to 
manage, if their job is not to make good sound judgments that 
can be based strictly on economics or can be based on a 
combination of economics and environment or can be made 
strictly for the purpose of environment, what are they there for? 
The government desires to consistently interfere and get into the 
faces, get into the lives, get into the wallets, get into the back 
pockets of every Canadian. It is a piece of work.
<P>
	In doing a little research for this, I reviewed a document 
called ``Comparative Analysis of Alternative Transportation 
Fuels'', put out by Clean Fuels Consulting Inc. in Toronto with 
branches in the States. I was interested in page 5 of the document 
which relates directly to my question of what do we have motor 
pool managers for, why are they there, do they not have any level 
of expertise. I do not profess to have any expertise so I went to 
the source.
<P>
	As an example: ``High alcohol fuels have problems with cold 
starts because the fuel does not vaporize easily. This problem 
does not exist for compressed natural gas and propane, where 
the fuel is already in the vapour phase to begin with. However, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13557"> 13557 </A></B>
<P>
these gases have a high ignition temperature and a high ignition 
delay, which could cause some cold start problems.''
<P>
	Rather than taking the time of the House to read more of this 
documentation, I just cite that as one example of the little bit of 
research that even a novice like myself can do to come across the 
fact that there are some serious problems that professional 
motor pool managers, people in the whole business of moving 
vehicles, moving people or materials in those vehicles, should 
be able to have a handle on. I would bow to their wisdom before I 
would bow to the wisdom of any member of the House, unless 
they had equal understanding, background, and schooling.
<P>
	For example, in talking about gasoline, another piece of 
research that came to me is that emission controls are working. 
In the past 15 years, unburned hydrocarbon emissions have been 
reduced by 98 per cent, nitrous oxides by 90 per cent, and carbon 
monoxide by 96 per cent.
<P>
	Again, I do not cite these numbers to in any way infer that I am 
an expert on this topic. I am merely asking, other than any 
members in the House who by pure coincidence happen to be 
experts, why are we as members of Parliament coming forward 
with this kind of legislation that will give quotas?
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	I go back to the fact the government seems to have a thing 
about quotas for everything. If the country does not have enough 
of this kind of person in this kind of industry, then we will have a 
quota. We have seen what the people of Ontario thought about 
that kind of legislation last night.
<P>
	The government just does not get it. It does not understand 
there is such a thing as a free market that actually drives the 
economy, that brings us to a norm, to a proper level.
<P>
	This morning I received a letter from a gentleman from 
Superior Propane in Unionville, Ontario via fax. I appreciated 
receiving the letter. He was trying to suggest to me reasons why 
this is a good bill and should be passed. His concluding sentence 
is: ``I look forward to the record of the vote showing your 
endorsement of this valuable bill''.
<P>
	I am prepared to listen to the debate on this bill and make a 
determination which way I will be voting at the conclusion of 
the debate but it is pretty obvious which direction I am leaning at 
this point.
<P>
	He says: ``I am contacting you regarding S-7, an important 
piece of legislation awaiting third reading in the House''. Then 
he explains five benefits of passing the bill like ``industrial 
benefits resulting from increased private sector investment of 
$40 million to $50 million''.
<P>
	With government mandating certain things through 
legislation we are going to be generating $40 million to $50 
million worth of private sector investment. The question I have 
is, if we were not mandating this would  that private sector 
investment be happening? In other words, I want to get a balance 
between those things.
<P>
	His second point is diversification of transportation energy, 
thus increasing competition among transportation fuel suppliers 
and economies to consumers. His third point is expanded 
markets for canola farmers. His fourth point is diversification of 
the western economy.
<P>
	It raises this question in my mind. If we have literally millions 
of vehicles that roll up and down the road, whether private 
vehicles, cars, trucks or whatever, or if we have vehicles that are 
not in the private sector but are owned by government, what is 
the comparison?
<P>
	The number of government vehicles is in the tens of thousands 
whereas the number of vehicles that are actually on the road are 
in the many millions. It then begs the question: Why are we 
doing this? We are talking about expanded markets for canola 
farmers. Surely converting the tens of thousands of vehicles that 
are owned by the federal government is not going to make a 
significant difference to canola farmers, and diversification of 
the western economies is, with all due respect to this gentleman, 
something of a stretch.
<P>
	However, in his fifth point he suggests the savings to the 
taxpayers resulting from reduced operating costs in the federal 
fleet are estimated at $4 million to $6 million annually. It then 
begs the question: If savings of $4 million to $6 million annually 
could be had by making these conversions, and if the 
government presently is trying to watch every dollar it is 
presently spending, why is it necessary to pass legislation? If the 
motor pool managers and the people who are in charge of these 
fleets cannot see there is a $4 million to $6 million annual 
savings and they are not prepared to do it, maybe they should be 
fired.
<P>
	I go back to page 13 of my research on this comparative 
analysis of alternative transportation fuels. I refer to what my 
colleague from Edmonton Southwest was mentioning about the 
situation in Brazil and I will recall one sentence. From 1989 to 
early 1990 there was an acute shortage of ethanol and consumers 
with dedicated ethanol vehicles waited in long fuel lines.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	We have seen with this and also with the artificial level of 
taxation on propane that the government has a tremendous 
ability to manipulate the private sector. Within the bill there 
consistently appears the phrase ``where it is cost effective and 
operationally feasible''. I am suggesting, is this legislation 
actually necessary? Are there not some other ways of achieving 
exactly the same thing? Surely we can reduce the amount of 
legislation that is currently on our slate. It seems to be pushing 
the government to all of these wonderful hours of time 
allocation and extended hours. Perhaps we could just dispose of 
this bill.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the House that at 
3.10 p.m. I will put the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will just make a few remarks.
<P>
	My hon. friend from Elk Island mentioned perhaps buying 
bicycles and saving some energy that way. I would suggest 
perhaps we should match the speed of our vehicles to the speed 
that the government moves. It would mean that we would go 
back to the horse and buggy days.
<P>
	Putting horses on the Hill might have a double advantage. We 
could collect the methane produced by these animals and run the 
little green buses. In that way we could really save energy. It 
would help tremendously environmentally and also help 
non-renewable resources.
<P>
	When I heard the member for Kingston and the Islands this 
afternoon there was so much hot air coming from that side of the 
House it led me to think we could do away with the airlines and 
travel by hot air balloons. That would really help us conserve 
energy in the air industry. We have good ideas around here, if we 
could just get the government to move fast enough to implement 
them.
<P>
	I have mentioned before but I will mention again that over the 
last two years we have been backtracking grain from the west to 
Thunder Bay. As we heard today, we then take it from Thunder 
Bay to California. If we had changed our attitude and gone the 
shortest route we could have probably saved enough energy for 
the House and crown corporations to operate their vehicles on 
regular fuel and still be gallons and gallons ahead as far as 
energy consumption is concerned.
<P>
	It is always a matter of using the most reliable and most 
efficient system. Back in the 1940s and early 1950s a big move 
was on toward propane in the farm industry, especially for 
tractors and some other vehicles. Very soon it was realized the 
value of the energy was not there. It slowed down machinery and 
the conversions that were done quickly faded away. It was just a 
matter of wasted money.
<P>
	One of the members pointed out that the RCMP would look 
very foolish with a propane car. That is probably what would 
happen. Substitutions would be made. Vehicles would be 
switched over to different fuels and because of taxes or 
inefficiencies of that system they would be done away with and 
vehicles would return to the regular energy.
<P>
	I appreciate these few minutes. I hope that some day I do see 
the horses and buggies back on the Hill, because it will sure 
speed up things the way this government is moving on some of 
this stuff.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, I might have 
inadvertently misled you when in my exuberance and it being 
Friday and wanting to get to other duties I said I would put the 
question. It was in fact the wrong technical term.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of private members' 
business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the 
order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 3.10 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 3.11 p.m.)
