DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 9, 1995, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-96, an act to establish the Department of 
Human Resources Development and to amend and repeal certain 
related acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak this morning to this 
bill to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development. However, I am also somewhat frustrated and 
astonished that the government could introduce this bill for second 
reading after the clear message sent in the referendum that 
significant changes were necessary in Canada.
<P>
	Although Quebecers decided to vote No and give federalism a 
last chance, they certainly did not have in mind the kind of action 
proposed in Bill C-96.
<P>
	This bill illustrates the fundamental difference in perception 
between the federal government and Quebec. Mr. Axworthy said 
yesterday in his speech, and I quote-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I apologize. I should have said the Minister of 
Human Resources Development instead of referring to a member 
by name.
<P>
	The minister said yesterday in his speech: ``It is decentralization 
of a very different kind. There has been a lot of talk about 
decentralization, but so far it has been a somewhat restricted debate 
as it talks only about decentralization in terms of transferring from 
the federal government to the provincial governments. Should we 
not also be talking about how to empower communities and 
individuals to make more choices? Is that not what we should be 
looking at in terms of decentralization? Partnership: government 
with the private sector,  government with school boards, 
government with the provinces. That is the kind of philosophy we 
have to continually talk about because that is what works''.
<P>
	That is what Mr. Axworthy claims, or should I say the Minister 
of Human Resources Development.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	In fact, this statement by the minister runs completely counter to 
the existing consensus in Quebec on manpower management. For 
example, I would like to quote from a 1991 letter written to the 
Minister of Employment and Immigration of the time by the 
Quebec Minister of Income Security which states: ``Quebec does 
indeed recognize the crying need to define its own manpower 
policies, to establish its priorities with respect to manpower 
development in close conjunction with its partners in the labour 
market, and then to design and administer programs tailored to the 
needs it has set as priorities''.
<P>
	Further on in the letter he goes on to say ``Even if the greatest 
constitutional harmony reigned in the country, which is not exactly 
the case, Quebec would make the same demands with respect to 
manpower, since it is so urgently necessary for Quebec's economic 
development that manpower programs be made efficient and 
tailored to Quebec's specific labour market priorities''. The person 
saying this in 1991 was a federalist Liberal Quebec minister.
<P>
	Today the federal government is tabling Bill C-96, and what is 
Quebec's reception to it? The Quebec Minister of Employment 
describes it as the final rejection of the unanimous consensus in 
Quebec that the federal government must withdraw completely 
from active manpower measures and hand back to Quebec the 
relevant budgets.
<P>
	So far, one could qualify this as a squabble between politicians, 
with each one wanting to hang on to his powers; the people will be 
the final judges of this. But there is something peculiar to this issue 
of manpower: the Quebec government position is also the position 
of all those in Quebec involved in this field.
<P>
	For instance, to quote someone who has never been identified as 
a sovereignist or as a backer of the present Quebec government, 
Ghislain Dufour, the spokesperson for the Conseil du Patronat du 
Québec, was still saying as recently as yesterday ``It is essential

that the manpower  issue be handed over to Quebec, so that there 
may at last be a proper policy''.
<P>
	He went on to say: ``This is one of the cards the federal 
government ought to lay on the table to indicate that it has indeed 
heard Quebec's message calling for change''.
<P>
	Despite Mr. Dufour's position in support of federalism, his 
heartfelt cry in his apparently unflagging hope that federalism 
might change went completely unheeded by the federal 
government, which, as if it were a matter of daily routine, is 
presenting Bill C-96 for second reading. The aim of the bill is 
simply to give the federal government the equivalent of a federal 
minister of education.
<P>
	I quote clause 6 of the bill as proof. It provides as follows.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of 
the human resources of Canada not by law assigned to any other Minister, 
department, board or agency of the Government of Canada, and are to be 
exercised with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality 
and promoting social security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The clause contains no reference to provincial jurisdictions or to 
the fact that Quebec already has a network set up to take action in 
the manpower sector or to the whole problem that has existed in 
this sector for the past five years. The government's position 
should be an obvious sign to Quebecers of the sort of change hinted 
at during the week before the referendum, without any basis or 
forethought, which today has been lost in the federal government's 
return to its old habits.
<P>
	What is Quebec's claim based on? It is based on the fact that an 
integrated policy on economic, social and political action, means 
that the government assuming responsibility, for instance for 
education, for the Quebec labour code which covers 90 per cent of 
workers in Quebec, for occupational health and safety, for labour 
standards, for regulating professional qualifications, professional 
conduct and mass layoffs-all having a direct impact on 
jobs-should control the other aspects, as well, such as training, 
the way we prepare our workforce for the challenges of the 
globalization of the marketplace and of new technology.
<P>
	It is rather like taking away half its tool box and thus preventing 
it from doing its job in a area that is critical for the future.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	I would like to give you more examples. I mentioned Mr. 
Dufour, from the Conseil du patronat, but a similar plea was 
voiced, last week, by Gérald Ponton, the president of the Quebec 
manufacturers' association, who cannot be accused either of being 
a sovereignist or a proponent of Quebec's independence. Mr. 
Ponton made the same kind of remark as Mr. Dufour. He even said  
that, during the referendum campaign, people everywhere in the 
field were saying: ``If they give us control over manpower or such 
and such an area, that might make it worth our while to listen to 
what is being said''. This man speaks on behalf of manufacturers, 
people who must adapt to changes on a daily basis. They never said 
that the federal government was the best level of government to 
deal with this. They are saying the same thing as the people from 
the job forum and the Société québécoise de développement de la 
main-d'oeuvre. They are telling us that it is imperative for Quebec 
to have control over manpower management in the province.
<P>
	I suggest that bringing Bill C-96 forward at second reading 
stage, as the federal government did, is somewhat of an affront not 
only to the Government of Quebec, but also to the people of 
Quebec as a whole, because, while they want changes, they want 
the assurance that Quebec will be able to control these major 
aspects of its development. We notice the same kind of attitude at 
the Canadian Institute of Adult Education, another group seriously 
involved with training, which asked the federal government to 
withdraw Bill C-96.
<P>
	How did this kind of approach come about in Quebec? Because 
Canada-and this fact was recognized by the OECD-is 
considered as some sort of testing ground, given its dismal track 
record in manpower training. It is characterized by the fact that we 
have hundreds of thousands of jobs available in Canada but at the 
same time more than one million people are out of work. The 
system is responsible for this mismatch between the number of 
jobs available and unemployed workers, because it should be 
possible to have only structural unemployment, caused for example 
by individuals quitting one job for another or by temporary 
situations arising from layoffs or other changes in the industry.
<P>
	But that is not the situation at present. We have a large workforce 
that has never been trained properly. And this cannot be blamed on 
Quebec achieving sovereignty, since it has not taken place yet. The 
present situation is the result, the doing of the current system. It 
was produced by this system. One of the most striking realities is 
how differently UI recipients are treated compared with welfare 
recipients or, even worse, with those who fall between the cracks.
<P>
	Canada has no integrated policy on how people looking for jobs 
should be treated. Our very sectoral approaches have led to results 
such as the last UI reform. The federal government has found two 
ways of dealing with its budget responsibilities and very tight fiscal 
constraints. To reduce its UI costs, it increased the number of 
weeks required to qualify for UI benefits and reduced the number 
of weeks of benefits.
<P>
	It then ended up with a UI fund surplus of $5 billion this year. At 
a time when our unemployment rate exceeds 11 per cent, is a UI 
fund surplus the best option? Is generating a surplus to be used by a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16471"> 16471 </A></B>
<P>
bureaucracy that has  already proven its ineffectiveness the best 
way to create jobs?
<P>
	At the same time, the provincial governments, which are also 
struggling with budget constraints, are responsible for welfare and 
systematically trying to keep social assistance costs as low as 
possible. Employment programs are therefore created so that 
people can go on unemployment insurance. But these jobs are not 
permanent. They are just a temporary measure.
<P>
	We are caught in a vicious circle. If we had a single level of 
government responsible for the whole manpower issue, including 
welfare recipients in the labour force who are able to work, UI 
recipients and those falling between the cracks, its sole objective 
would be to make the best possible use of human resources and not 
to reduce welfare and UI costs by offloading its deficits and 
responsibilities onto the other level of government. Only one 
government would then be judged in terms of the effectiveness of 
its manpower policy.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Why is it necessary that Quebec be responsible for that sector? 
Realities vary widely in the Canadian economic space. For policies 
in the social, regional development, manpower, health, housing and 
employment training sectors to be adequate, they must be geared to 
the environment in which they are apply. They must also be 
effective.
<P>
	It is not true that a single policy for the whole country can be 
effective, given the differences between regional economies. For 
example, the Maritimes and Quebec's eastern region have an 
economy which is largely dependent on natural resources and 
which, therefore, has fostered the development of a large number 
of seasonal industries. If you apply a national policy to these 
regions, you only generate disillusion, as is now the case. 
Moreover, many investments have been made year after year in 
these regions, but they simply did not produce any result. This can 
be explained by a number of reasons, including the fact that 
responsibility for the manpower sector was not delegated to the 
appropriate level of government.
<P>
	When you think of it, the accumulated surplus in the UI fund, 
which will be the primary funding source for the new human 
resources investment fund, is a new hidden tax. Once it realized 
that it could no longer borrow on foreign markets to keep trying to 
control everything-because international lenders were no longer 
willing to provide funding for that-the federal government found 
a new trick. It makes Canadians themselves lend money, through 
UI contributions.
<P>
	The government is trying to use a new artificial instrument 
which ultimately is based on a mismanagement of money. If, 
instead of generating this $5 billion surplus, the government had 
left that money in the economy, do you not think that it would have  
helped create a lot more jobs, that it would have given much more 
concrete results? So today the least trained categories of workers 
would have the possibility of getting jobs more easily and we 
would not be trying to give them training for which they are not 
necessarily prepared.
<P>
	The other element I would like to draw to the government's 
attention is that Bill C-96 will lead to open warfare between the 
Quebec educational system and others who might want to get 
involved in training. In fact, this may be the hidden agenda of the 
federal government, to demolish all of the educational tools 
Quebec has developed, but I believe that such educational bodies as 
la Fédération des commissions scolaires du Québec and la 
Fédération des cegeps du Québec have, nevertheless, developed 
original approaches that make Quebec very competitive in the 
world market.
<P>
	The deliberate choice by the federal government to sign 
agreements with organizations outside these systems, with criteria 
that differ from those of these systems will lead, within a few years, 
to an incredible mess with equivalencies. Who will have trained 
whom? How? To what standard? And this outcome will be just one 
more example of federal government waste and inefficiency, at a 
time when we no longer have any money to waste.
<P>
	This may have been done in the seventies in an attempt to put a 
Canadian model in place, some artificial concept of what Canada 
could be, but nowadays this is no longer possible, because of 
financial constraints and pressure from international lenders, as 
well as the future demands of each taxpayer in Quebec and in 
Canada.
<P>
	There is still time for the federal government to decide either to 
withdraw Bill C-96 or, at the very least, to heed the clear call from 
all those involved in this field in Quebec for the responsibility for 
manpower training to be handed over to the Government of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	This consensus has existed in Quebec for five years, during 
which all players have asked for manpower to be transferred to the 
Government of Quebec, while the federal 
government-Conservative or Liberal-turns a deaf ear. We must 
try to find the reason for this lack of openness, this failure to listen. 
What is happening at the federal level that they will not respond to 
the demands of all those people who earnestly want to reshape 
federalism?
<P>
	In any case, there is an aspect to decentralization that is very 
obvious and which the federal government refuses to recognize. 
Why? Because any decision to give Quebec responsibility for 
manpower or to give any other province the same kind of 
responsibility in this or other sectors would have the effect of 
taking power away from the federal mandarins.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16472"> 16472 </A></B>
<P>
	The people who were appointed during the Trudeau era and who 
since then have generated a lot of activities and believe that 
solutions in Canada will come from the top down instead of from 
the grass roots, all these people cannot bear the thought of a policy 
that would turn the decision making pyramid upside down, so that 
not their views but only the views of the citizens of Quebec and 
Canada would prevail.
<P>
	This government will be judged by the way it manages to shake 
up its senior public servants. After four years in power, the 
government will no longer have an excuse. It can no longer say: 
``The Conservatives were like that, and this is our first year and that 
is why nothing is happening, we have not had time to adjust''. They 
are now starting their third year, and if the federal government does 
not make any changes, the record will be there for Canadian to 
judge.
<P>
	There is another reason why C-96 is unacceptable: it perpetuates 
two levels of intervention in education. Today, no business in any 
industrial sector can afford this kind of duplication. There is a lot of 
unnecessary spending here.
<P>
	The minister of income security in the Liberal government 
preceding the Parti Quebecois government calculated the cost of 
this overlap between Quebec and Canada at between $250 and $275 
million a year. Can we afford such overlap in the future? Two 
hundred fifty million dollars, when, with the prebudget 
consultations underway, we are being told everywhere that the 
government has to make choices. It has to decide to be efficient 
where it can. It has to decide to withdraw from areas where it is not.
<P>
	Here we have concrete examples with obvious results that the 
government's involvement in labour matters over the past 10, 15 or 
20 years has been totally ineffective and has not permitted any sort 
of matching of available jobs and manpower. It is also an example 
of decentralization being a solution when you have faith in the 
government that is on the receiving end, that will have to take it on 
and that will be judged by the voters.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is being criticized by the Société québécoise de la 
main-d'oeuvre, the Quebec department of employment, the Institut 
canadien des adultes, the Forum sur l'emploi, the Association des 
manufacturiers du Québec and the Conseil du patronat du Québec. 
Here are enough reasons for the federal government to withdraw it 
or amend it so that Quebec could have control over the 
management of its manpower.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the 
words of the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. He was 
very clear in his presentation.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	The member began by stating that the referendum gave a clear 
message to the federal government. Yes, it did send a very clear 
message. The clear message is that the majority of Canadians in 
Quebec do not want to separate from Canada. That is the clear 
message and that is what we should be working toward.
<P>
	However, the Bloc Quebecois keeps pushing its hidden agenda, 
which it tried to hide during the referendum. The agenda was 
complete separation. The sooner the Bloc Quebecois accepts this, 
the sooner all three parties and the independent members in this 
House can start working together and continue building the strong, 
beautiful country we have.
<P>
	Yesterday we heard about the hospital closings in Quebec. That 
is going to hurt my family in Quebec. Why did that come out only 
after and not during the referendum? It would have hurt the hidden 
agenda of separation.
<P>
	We are bringing in a bill which deals with administration rather 
than any substantive reform. It does not entail new organizational 
changes as the Bloc Quebecois tries to make us believe. It does not 
introduce new statutory powers or affect federal-provincial 
jurisdiction. I do not know why that would concern the Bloc. The 
bill draws together portions of the former departments of 
employment and immigration, health and welfare, secretary of 
state and all the former department of labour. Think of the savings 
this will bring to Canadian taxpayers. Why not pass those savings 
on to the people who are looking for jobs and the people who have 
to be re-educated?
<P>
	I was an educator for 27 years. I have learned and am learning 
more so that education does not stop at the end of grade 8, at the 
end of grade 12 or at the end of university. Education is becoming a 
lifetime process. We are also learning that people with good 
professional jobs are not going to keep them for a lifetime. They 
are going to go through two, three, four jobs in a lifetime. 
Therefore they have to be retrained.
<P>
	Because of the kind of environment we are in, we have to give 
workers the freedom to move from province to province. If they are 
forced to move from one province to another or they do it of their 
own free will, why should they be hampered because one province 
has a program different from another province? Why should they 
not be able to move from one program to another from province to 
province? I cannot understand why speaker after speaker from the 
Bloc are against this federal-provincial operation of working 
together to save taxpayers money, to keep building this beautiful 
country.
<P>
	I have talked to many diplomats. I will not mention any names or 
countries but they are shocked at what has happened to our country. 
Canada is always used as a model and an example when countries 
move to more  democratic forms of government. Now they are so 
let down. We are letting them down because the model they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16473"> 16473 </A></B>
<P>
worshipped, the country to which immigrants from all over the 
world want to come, is quarrelling within instead of working 
together.
<P>
	I do not want a response, although I probably will get one. I want 
to leave a very clear message. The referendum did affect everyone 
in this House. We were elected by the people and the kind of 
comments I am hearing do not represent the majority of the people 
living in the province of Quebec. They showed that in the 
referendum.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is not changing any statutory powers. It is not taking 
any powers away from Quebec or from any other province. This 
bill is an attempt to work together, to give programs and services 
more efficiently at less cost to the taxpayers.
<P>
	I hope I have made my message clear. The Bloc is trying to 
resurface its hidden agenda and we are not going to accept it.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is easy to see the lack of 
understanding in this country. I would like to remind the hon. 
member who just spoke of a little historical fact. The sovereignist 
movement captured 40 per cent of the vote in 1980 and 49.4 per 
cent in 1995. This represents a 20 per cent increase for the 
sovereignists, while the federalist vote fell from 60 to 50 per cent.
<P>
	If you do not see this as a very significant warning to Canada, if 
you do not understand the message, you will bear the consequences 
of this political choice for the rest of Canada, which is accusing the 
federal government of misleading them for two years by pretending 
that there was no problem to be resolved with Quebec. But there is 
a problem. Canadian citizens felt compelled to travel to Montreal, 
to make long-distance calls, because the Canadian government 
misled them for two years by claiming that everything was fine. If 
you ever go back to your old haunts, you will pay the political 
price.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I simply want 
to remind the House that all comments must be made through the 
Chair, so that our debates can take place according to the best 
parliamentary tradition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. I would like to say that, in my 
speech, I presented the arguments put forward by Quebec 
federalists. I talked about the chief executive of the Quebec 
manufacturers' association, Gérald Ponton, former chief of staff to 
a Quebec Liberal minister. I also mentioned the spokesperson for 
the Conseil du patronat du Québec, Ghislain Dufour, who is not 
known for his sovereignist views. They both agree that it is 
important that the federal government withdraw from manpower 
management. This is not mean separatists speaking, but  Quebec 
federalists telling the federal government: ``Unless you get out of 
there, the next time will be right one for Quebec sovereignty''. That 
is the bottom line, and I think that the people of Quebec and Canada 
will be the judges of that.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the bill contained no major changes, 
that it was a technical bill. Let me read you clause 6 of this bill.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to development of the 
human resources of Canada-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Is that not a substantive change. Never before had the federal 
government dared lay down in an act that it had the power to 
interfere to such an extent with education, in spite of the fact that 
the Constitution clearly states that education falls under provincial 
jurisdiction. I will leave it up to the people to decide whehther this 
bill is a technical or a substantive bill.
<P>
	The hon. member also indicated in his remarks that manpower 
adjustment has become important, given that people now have to 
change jobs often. We could not agree more on that. This is the 
basis for the whole argument put forward by the Quebec 
government, which maintains that education does not include only 
primary and secondary school, as it did at the end of the 19th 
century, but encompasses all training. That is what Quebec's 
position is premised on.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say that the fact that Canada is 
considered as some sort of democratic model does not mean that, 
because there is, within this democracy, a major movement for the 
sovereignty of one part of the country and because this movement 
has a voice, we are any less democratic. People are supposed to be 
able to express themselves in a democracy. And that is what the 
people of Quebec have done and will do again, especially if the 
present government in Ottawa keeps ignoring the demands made 
not by sovereignists alone, but by sovereignists and federalists who 
are looking for profound changes. That is what the federal 
government will soon be judged on.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today 
to speak on Bill C-96. I am sure members know the bill establishes 
the Department of Human Resources Development and amends or 
repeals certain related legislation.
<P>
	In the time I have I will focus on the labour side of the bill and 
the duties the Prime Minister has entrusted with the Minister of 
Labour. Included in the bill are clear definitions of the direction 
and structures of the minister and the minister's duties. Clause 107 
of the bill repeals the Department of Labour Act. Clause 4, though, 
authorizes the appointment of the Minister of Labour.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16474"> 16474 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	According to subclause 4(2), the powers, duties and functions of 
the Minister of Labour extend to and include all matters over which 
Parliament has jurisdiction relating to labour not by law assigned to 
any other department, board or agency of the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	In other words, the Minister of Labour has all the powers, duties 
and functions related to labour matters under federal jurisdiction, 
except for staff relations and the federal public service.
<P>
	So that my hon. colleagues in the House understand the extent of 
this jurisdiction, I will sketch a broad outline for them. The areas 
covered by the Canada Labour Code fall within the labour 
minister's jurisdiction. The code governs industrial relations, 
occupational safety and health, and labour standards in the federal 
sphere. The code applies to Canadians working in major industrial 
sectors such as interprovincial and international rail, road and 
pipeline transportation, shipping, longshoring, air transportation, 
grain handling, international and interprovincial 
telecommunications, broadcasting, banks and certain crown 
corporations. These are critical sectors of the economy.
<P>
	Parts I and III of the code dealing with industrial relations and 
labour standards apply to over 700,000 Canadian workers. Part II 
also applies to the federal public sector so it affects over 1 million 
Canadians.
<P>
	Through the Canada Labour Code and other initiatives of the 
labour branch of HRD Canada, stable industrial relations are 
facilitated and safe, healthy, fair and productive workplaces are 
promoted. In the industrial relations sphere the Canada Labour 
Code has long been recognized as a model that successfully 
balances the rights and responsibilities of both labour and 
management.
<P>
	Application of the Canada Labour Code is the minister's major 
responsibility, but several other acts and policies fall under her 
jurisdiction. Among these is the Canada Centre for Occupational 
Health and Safety. The centre disseminates occupational health and 
safety information across the country and plays a key role in 
protecting the lives and health of workers in Canada.
<P>
	Other statutes that fall in whole or in part under the labour 
minister's jurisdiction are the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act, 
the Government Employees Compensation Act, the act respecting 
the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company, the Hazardous 
Materials Information Review Act, the Merchant Seamen 
Compensation Act, part II of the Status of the Artist Act, the Wages 
Liability Act, the Non-Smokers' Health Act and the Corporations 
and Labour Unions Liabilities Act. All these deal with matters of 
security, justice and equity, basic entitlements of all Canadian 
workers.
<P>
	The only function not carried over from the old Department of 
Labour is the program for older worker adjustment. This is the only 
responsibility that will be carried out elsewhere. On the other hand, 
the Minister of Labour could have added responsibilities under the 
Employment Equity Act once Bill C-64 has received royal assent.
<P>
	Given the broad scope of the labour branch, members may 
wonder why we want to merge into Human Resources 
Development. It is a logical way for the federal government to 
meet the challenges facing us as we enter the next century. By 
merging the two departments into one we want to give concrete 
form within a single structure to an integrated vision of all various 
issues relating to the work world and social security.
<P>
	If the development of our human potential is to be successful it 
has to be seen as a continuous whole. Society has undergone great 
changes and we have to adapt. An integrated and unified structure 
will obviously allow us to do that.
<P>
	We can no longer succeed in helping Canadians achieve their full 
potential by creating artificial bureaucratic categories for each of 
their needs. Nor can we respond to people's needs by losing them in 
the red tape of poorly co-ordinated government programs. 
Intelligent and careful integration is necessary but it does not 
preclude flexibility in procedures, enforcement or service to the 
Canadian public.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	We need an administrative structure that allows us to deliver 
services in an efficient manner and at a reasonable cost, taking into 
account both the financial restrictions facing us and our moral 
obligations toward the Canadian public. By rationalizing resources 
under the Human Resources Development banner we can and will 
achieve this goal.
<P>
	As well, we need a structure that fosters partnerships with the 
provinces, the industrial sector, the labour movement, the academic 
community and community groups. We have made great progress 
toward this and we will go even further under the new act.
<P>
	The model proposed here is similar to that in several provinces. 
Integration has already taken place in Quebec, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland. Since we are integrating departments some 
members might wonder why we need a labour minister at all. I will 
explain that rationale.
<P>
	We have had labour ministers throughout most of our history. It 
was the previous Tory government, which did not care much for the 
views of working Canadians, that eliminated the post. I am 
concerned the Reform will get the opportunity. The government 
believes that labour matters deserve special attention, and 
rightfully so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16475"> 16475 </A></B>
<P>
	The labour movement, labour-management relations, workplace 
conditions and equity for all workers are probably more important 
today than they have ever been in the past. For these reasons Bill 
C-96 provides for the appointment of a Minister of Labour. There 
is no separate bureaucracy or infrastructure, just a minister who 
can devote her time to the concerns of working Canadians.
<P>
	The minister uses the services and facilities of the human 
resources department. This keeps costs and duplication down 
without depriving the ministers of the tools needed to deal with 
their responsibilities.
<P>
	Last February the Prime Minister appointed the current Minister 
of Labour. Without waiting for the bill before us to pass he wanted 
to assure working Canadians that we were ready to deal with urgent 
and pressing matters affecting Canada's labour situation.
<P>
	I will outline some initiatives already undertaken by the minister 
since last February. In the area of industrial relations the minister 
continues to firmly believe in a free and open collective bargaining 
system which places the onus on labour and management to be 
responsible for resolving their own disputes.
<P>
	Where they are unable to do so, assistance is provided by the 
federal mediation and conciliation services of the labour branch at 
Labour Canada. The FMCS has had an astonishing track record, 
one that most people probably do not realize. Over 90 per cent of 
disputes referred to it are resolved without work stoppage.
<P>
	Throughout the world our federal system is seen as a model of 
balance and effective labour legislation. To have competitive and 
productive workplaces we need effective labour-management 
relations. To assist employers and unions to build effective 
communication channels the FMCS has developed a preventive 
mediation program which has been well received by its clients.
<P>
	The minister has undertaken two significant initiatives to ensure 
that our industrial relations system continues to set standards for 
the rest of the world. In recent years a number of labour disputes on 
the west coast have required the intervention of Parliament. In May 
the minister appointed an industrial inquiry commission to study 
industrial relations in longshoring, grain handling and other 
federally regulated industries at west coast ports. We expect to 
receive the commission's report later this month.
<P>
	In June the minister established the Sims task force to conduct an 
independent review and recommend improvements to part I of the 
Canada Labour Code. The task force will identify options and make 
recommendations for legislative change with the view to 
improving collective bargaining, reducing conflict and facilitating 
labour-management co-operation, ensuring effective and efficient 
administration of the code and  addressing the changing workplace 
and employment relationships.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	The task force is consulting at this moment with labour and 
management groups that are subject to the code and is scheduled to 
report to the minister by December 15 of this year.
<P>
	In the area of occupational health and safety, we are working to 
better harmonize our legislation and regulations with the provinces 
and the territories. In co-operation with them, we are trying to 
achieve greater uniformity throughout the country with regard to 
this issue. This is a win-win scenario for workers and employers. 
We all stand to gain through increased efficiency and savings 
resulting from a reduction in overlap.
<P>
	To further this initiative we are conducting two pilot projects. 
One is aimed at harmonizing the provisions of the Canada 
occupational safety and health regulations dealing with diving and 
confined spaces, while the other involves the field of ergonomics.
<P>
	I have already mentioned the review of part I of the Canada 
Labour Code, but we also are planning to revise parts II and III. In 
co-operation with our various partners we are seeking to modernize 
the code to better reflect the requirements of today's labour 
environment. Consultations are under way and labour and 
management have approached the revision process with energy and 
enthusiasm.
<P>
	Like all government organizations, the labour branch is 
reviewing all of its activities and methods. This review will help us 
to pinpoint more ways to increase both the quality and cost 
effectiveness of the programs and services we deliver to Canadians.
<P>
	The labour program also has international obligations. The 
adoption of the North American agreement on labour co-operation 
led to the establishment of a relatively new component within the 
program. The agreement is aimed at promoting co-operation and 
guaranteeing effective enforcement of labour legislation by 
Canada, the United States and Mexico. The labour branch opened a 
national office to implement the agreement in Canada not too long 
ago. This is welcome news.
<P>
	I am providing members with a sampling of the many activities 
currently carried out by the labour branch. These examples show 
that restructuring has in no way impeded the work of the branch. In 
fact, it has energized it. Since integration, the labour branch is vital, 
invigorated, and better able than ever before to make a strong 
contribution to the lives of working Canadians. Its integration 
within the Department of Human Resources Development ensures 
a healthy continuity and an integrated use of the resources available 
to promote the economic and social well-being of Canadians. In my  
mind, integration makes a lot of sense. It is not just some arbitrary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16476"> 16476 </A></B>
<P>
measure, but a decision made necessary by the times in which we 
live.
<P>
	The work of the labour branch cannot be done in isolation from 
considerations involving Canadians who are on unemployment 
insurance and employment programs. The challenge is to 
harmonize and co-ordinate all of our federal programs dealing with 
human resources. To meet that challenge we are guided by a logical 
and coherent vision.
<P>
	The bill before us offers the best of both worlds. It entrenches the 
powers and responsibilities of a full fledged Minister of Labour 
while at the same time placing the labour branch within a broader 
context, producing definite benefits for the government and for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Without hesitation I ask my hon. colleagues to support this 
important piece of legislation, which confirms what already exists: 
a very good and solid labour department in this country, which has 
done an exceptionally good job up to now as far as the rest of the 
world and Canada are concerned.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to put a question to the hon. member, who is 
an expert in labour relations and who knows a great deal about the 
human resources issue. We all acknowledge the great expertise of 
the member in these sectors.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Earlier today, we heard a Bloc member claim that this bill would 
give new powers to the federal government, that it was a 
centralizing instrument used by the government, or some nonsense 
to that effect.
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell us if it is true that the bill gives new 
powers to the federal government? Is it not a consolidation of 
existing laws on the sharing of powers between the two ministers 
responsible for human resources, namely the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Minister of Labour? Is it not true 
that the bill does not give any new power, does not centralize 
anything, and that, once again, the Bloc Quebecois' claims have 
little to do with reality?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question.
<P>
	In the last couple of days I have had the opportunity to listen to 
the Bloc on this bill. I have to admit I am saddened that members 
opposite have continued to make suggestions to their constituents 
that are factually incorrect.
<P>
	If we look at what the Department of Labour is doing, it is just 
the opposite of what is being said by the  members of the Bloc 
Quebecois. Let me give an example. As I mentioned in my speech, 
under health and safety we are going to be devolving powers and 
co-operating with the provinces. We have already entered into an 
agreement with Quebec to harmonize the way we deal with health 
and safety as it relates to federal and provincial jurisdictions. In 
essence, we have done what the Bloc is arguing we have not done, 
which is to decentralize to a certain extent the powers of the federal 
government under labour to the provinces to deal with certain areas 
like health and safety.
<P>
	I do not know why the members opposite continue to do this. 
Sooner or later someone in Quebec will start paying closer 
attention to what is going on in the House and start picking up the 
bills and reading them, only to find out that they are being 
misrepresented by these individual members across the way.
<P>
	Anyone who has been around as long as you and I have been, Mr. 
Speaker, will know that most people pay very close attention to 
what takes place in their country as it relates to the laws. These 
laws we are passing, which the opposition continues to suggest go 
in a totally opposite direction-that they are new powers and we 
are going to be stepping all over the provinces-sooner or later will 
show that we are working very hard to co-operate and do just the 
opposite.
<P>
	I want to give the Bloc a challenge in my final comments. I 
would like the members to change their approach of trying to get 
Quebecers not to like Canada. If Quebecers are to leave they should 
leave for other reasons than the fact that the federal government is 
not trying to do a good job. Quite frankly, that is the furthest from 
the truth I have ever seen.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It certainly would not be for 
me to debate with the hon. parliamentary secretary as to how long 
we have been here, but in light of the fact that a few days ago we 
marked the 30th anniversary of the members for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, I 
submit that we have not been here all that long.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened to this debate now for a couple of days. I have heard 
how much things are going to change for the better in our social 
programs and so on. After almost three decades of overspending by 
Liberal and Conservative governments, we have amassed $565 
billion in debt; that is 565 thousand million dollars. In the last two 
years this government has overspent its income by approximately 
$80 billion, adding to that debt.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan has in it about two years' worth of 
payouts, about $40 billion, all invested in low yield provincial 
bonds. The fund, if pensioners were to be fully paid out, would 
have to have about $550 billion in it, which it does not. It is another 
liability over and above the $565 billion we owe in operating costs.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="16477"> 16477 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	If the government is to look at social programming and improve 
the Canada pension plan, for instance, how will it do that with the 
burden of a $565 billion debt, a liability in the Canada pension plan 
and a deliberate plan of overspending? How will it happen without 
the government coming to the conclusion that something must 
change, perhaps even looking at premium increases and benefit 
reductions? Is that what the government will do? How will it get 
around being held accountable, like the last group that was over 
there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, since I know Reform Party members a 
little better than I know Bloc members, because I have to deal with 
them on a regular basis in my neighbourhood, I will tell the House 
what impresses and intrigues me the most about them. They came 
to the House with a particular focus and a promise they made to 
their constituents. I was in one of those ridings where they made 
that promise. They were going to be different. I frankly found that 
they were quite different. They were the most partisan group I have 
ever met in my life.
<P>
	One of the questions posed to us during the last election 
campaign was why not become more like those Reformers, who are 
non-politicians, who will ask questions of substance. I will see if I 
can answer the question.
<P>
	The member and his party have been spinning this scenario that 
the world is coming to an end in Canada and it is all going to fall 
apart unless we go as far to the right as we can, that everybody in 
Canada has to start paying massive user fees, including the seniors 
and the poor, because we cannot afford to tax anybody any more 
and our debt is so bad that we are going to sink under this big huge 
debt and some other country will have to bail us out.
<P>
	We all know that is not true. I will try to explain this to the 
members across the way. I had the opportunity to sit on the 
committee that reviewed the pension plan with actuaries. Under the 
legislation we have to review this every five years. I spent some 
time looking at how we were to restructure it. During that time, 
with all the experts in front of us, never did one of them say this 
program would collapse under a particular problem of liability and 
having no money.
<P>
	The problem with the individual across the way is he does not 
want to hear the truth about how the program works. These 
individuals across the way have no program or suggestions on how 
to run Canada. Their doom and gloom scenario, as with Klein and 
others, is to cut the government adrift, get rid of the government 
and let some right-wing business corporate elite look after it so 
they will not have to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> It is okay, be happy, you have 
your pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Yes, I have my pension. Quite frankly, I am proud 
that I have earned it. I will be here for a long time before I get to 
collect it. At least I pay tax. A lot of the boys across the way do not 
pay any tax. There is an individual there from Ontario, our 
multi-millionaire friend, who does not pay any tax.
<P>
	If this regional fringe party can articulate its vision of Canada 
and get higher than 10 per cent in the polls, then maybe we will 
start to look at some of its ideas. To date it is so far down that no 
one in the country is taking it seriously, including the people in my 
riding.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 11 a.m., we will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

attended a special event in my riding, the second annual memorial 
service held outdoors at the Woodstock Memorial Forest. Over 300 
people attended.
<P>
	This memorial forest was established by the city of Woodstock, 
the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority and a local 
funeral home. Twenty-three acres of conservation authority land 
has been set aside for the forest. The trees planted are chosen from 
original Carolinian species indigenous to our region. Each tree 
commemorates the life of a citizen who has died.
<P>
	The Woodstock Memorial Forest was started in recognition of 
the depletion of the earth's forests. Trees provide shelter for 
wildlife, control soil erosion, provide shade, remove carbon 
dioxide and provide oxygen. The beauty and grace of these trees 
enhance our environment and stand as living memorials to the

peacekeepers who have served on United Nations missions since 
1947 and the many Canadian forces' members who over the years 
have given their lives in service to our country.
<P>
	The spirit and sacrifice of these men and women have been 
dedicated to preserve the freedom and peace we cherish today. 
None gave their lives willingly yet all voluntarily put themselves in 
danger.
<P>
	In remembering, let us be mindful of the political turmoil and 
circumstances which led to conflict and be attentive to our 
responsibility to learn and profit from that history. The wreathes 
laid at the National War Memorial and others across our nation 
must cause us to remember so that those lives were not given in 
vain.
<P>
	As we pay tribute to the men and women of the Royal Canadian 
Navy, the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian Air Force and the

	Mrs. Hilda Simanavicius has recently returned from Lithuania

constructed in the 1970s, is one of seven Alcan Cable plants in 
North America.
<P>
	In 1990, Alcan Cable made a commitment to quality by defining 
a new business mission, with the objective of becoming a world

meet that objective, the management and employees of the 
Lapointe plant spared no effort to indeed become an international

	However, the Quebec health minister did not wait to find out the 
Bloc leader's personal opinion on the matter. He closed five 
hospitals in Montreal alone. The fine social democrat promises of

45 per cent of all new jobs created between 1990 and the year 2000 
will require more than 16 years of training and education. Never 
before have education and training played such a vital role in the 
future of our youth.
<P>
	In order to face this challenge head on, the government 
introduced the youth employment and learning strategy. This 
strategy is the cumulative result of many years of consultation, 
policy development and town hall meetings with Canadians from 
coast to coast to cast.
<P>
	Key elements of this strategy include youth service Canada and 
youth internship program. Youth service Canada gives young 
people an opportunity to develop skills and confidence while 
serving their community. The youth internship program provides a 
combination of on the job and in class training.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	To date these programs have given over 30,000 young Canadians 
a head start on their career path. This Liberal government 
recognizes that our youth is a very important resource and as such 
should be treated as a top priority. That is why this year during a 
time of fiscal restraint, the overall budget for youth employment 
services was increased by-

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMMITTEECHAIREDBYAGRICULTUREMINISTER">COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY AGRICULTURE MINISTER</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since it was unable to deliver the changes it promised 
Quebecers during the referendum campaign, the government has 
resorted to an old federal standby: creating committees.
<P>
	Ottawa has made a big thing of the phoney committee chaired by 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, but kept quiet about 
another committee which will be chaired by the minister of 
agriculture. Discreet though it may be, this shadow committee is 
supposed to prompt the federal government on basic directions for 
change in Canada.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. By 
establishing two committees, one supposedly to respond to 
Quebecers' desire for change and one to discuss the division of 
powers, does the government intend to keep sending two messages 
on the constitution, one to Quebec and one to the rest of Canada, as 
it has done for more than two years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is high time the official opposition realized we are in the 
business of governing Canada and that when problems arise with 
respect to unity and economic issues, we will appoint groups of 
ministers to make a thorough analysis of the options for dealing 
with these problems.
<P>
	This should come as no surprise. It is what any good government 
would do, and that being the case, I am not surprised the official 
opposition fails to understand what we are doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at least there is more of an inclination to be frank this 
morning. We are told there are problems with unity. There was no 
problem for the past two years. The constitution was not an issue. 
We had some flamboyant speeches in this House, which was not 
the case before.  The economy used to be fine, but this morning it is 
a real problem. They are aware of that.
<P>
	When we realize that the shadow committee of the minister of 
agriculture will consider the division of powers and that, unlike the 
other committee, the most influential ministers from Quebec will 
sit on this committee, will the Prime Minister finally admit that the 
phoney committee of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, 
which is supposed to respond to Quebecers' desire for change, is 
just a lot of window dressing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, once again, your typical example of a phoney committee 
is the regional commissions that were set up in Quebec by the Parti 
Quebecois, with the co-operation of the Bloc Quebecois. They 
were phoney committees that never accomplished a thing.
<P>
	In this case, it is entirely normal and appropriate that we should 
examine and try to solve the problems that exist in Canada today. 
At least we are trying to provide good government. In fact, all the 
players in Quebec, including Mario Dumont and the Conseil du 
patronat du Québec, have told the Quebec government it is time to 
deal with the real problems: jobs, unemployment and investment. 
That is what we are doing through the committee chaired by the 
minister of agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, actually, I want to thank the minister because the more he 
talks, the more he strengthens the sovereignist cause in Quebec.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister, although he was halfway around 
the world, managed to set the record straight. We know the phoney 
committee chaired by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
will accomplish very little since, as the Prime Minister said, they 
do not intend to tinker with the constitution to satisfy Quebec.
<P>
	That being said, and since we cannot expect to deal with 
Canada's problems without dealing with Quebec, does the Acting 
Prime Minister not realize that the shadow committee of the 
minister of agriculture is also doomed to fail?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, that is a good example of a phoney question, one that has 
no substance and does not make sense.
<P>
	First of all, in the Outaouais, in the five Outaouais ridings, the 
No side received 72.6 per cent of the votes, more than in any region 
in Quebec. This was more than in 1980.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16482"> 16482 </A></B>
<P>
	So obviously, the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie does 
not know what he is talking about when he indicates the influence 
we can have on what Quebecers have decided, which is to stay 
in Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, if the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie 
thinks economic issues are not important enough to warrant 
consideration, he is abdicating the basic responsibility of the 
official opposition, which is to protect the interests of Canadians 
and Quebecers at a time when the majority of Canadians and 
Quebecers want to see a solution to these economic problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	While travelling in New Zealand yesterday, the Prime Minister 
claimed that his government's main concern is to deal with what he 
calls ``the real problems of Canadians''. Yet, federal ministers are 
unable to name a single major legislative measure taken by their 
government, simply because there has not been any. Instead of 
taking action, they are creating yet another committee.
<P>
	Here is my question. While Canadians are faced with a growing 
poverty problem as the federal government keeps postponing 
reforms that will supposedly put the unemployed back to work, 
how can the government claim that setting up another ministerial 
committee will meet the real economic needs of Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, jobs and growth have always been 
central to this government's agenda.
<P>
	It is very important to note that in the first two years of our 
administration, from the fall of 1993 until the fall of 1995, 
economic circumstances have been created in Canada whereby 
500,000 new jobs have been created for Canadians. At the same 
time, the unemployment rate in the country has dropped below 10 
per cent, the lowest level in a long time.
<P>
	That is good progress in the first two years of our administration. 
It is still not enough progress from our point of view. We want to 
work very hard to accelerate job growth and to reduce 
unemployment. All members of the government, in cabinet and in 
caucus, will be sparing absolutely no effort to achieve that larger 
objective.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the minister 
is saying is that while they were creating jobs in the rest of Canada, 
Quebec was becoming the poorest province in Canada with its 
unemployed workers and its people living below the poverty line.
<P>
	Can the Acting Prime Minister tell us-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> It is because of the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Stop talking about separation.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member for Joliette.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize it is not important for the 
party in power to listen to the question because their answers never 
make sense.
<P>
	Can the Acting Prime Minister tell us what concrete and 
substantial legislative measures his government has taken since the 
referendum to tackle what he calls the real problems of Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman knows that the 
intervening period from the date of the referendum to now has only 
been a matter of a few days. The member should take into account 
the record of performance prior to the referendum date. It includes 
a broad range of initiatives, probably longer than you would allow 
me to answer during the course of question period, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I can think of such things as the Canada infrastructure works 
program which has been an enormous success from coast to coast 
to coast. There are the internship programs for Canadian youth, the 
Canadian Youth Service Corps. There is also the successful battle 
against the deficit. Not only have we met but we have exceeded 
every single one of our deficit targets which builds confidence in 
the Canadian economy. There is also a large list of measures for 
small business where 85 per cent of Canadian new jobs come from.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has been 
a heck of a week. We have had the official disloyal opposition 
acting-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to withdraw the 
word disloyal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw the word disloyal. It has 
been a heck of a week. We have had members of the official 
opposition acting like spoiled brats in not recognizing the results of 
the referendum which they lost. Now we have the government 
members who do not know why they won striking up the divine 
nine committee. We have a Prime Minister who wants Copps out of 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> In the meantime, this week we have been busy 
meeting with the governor of the Bank of Canada and with 10 of 
this country's leading economists which prompts my first question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16483"> 16483 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that the size of our federal debt is 
$567,902,132,500.57. Would the finance minister please confirm 
to this House what the size of our federal debt is?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the 
member's estimate of our national debt is within a couple of 
pennies.
<P>
	The problem is not only the size of the national debt, but that as a 
nation over the course of the last decade we did not face up to the 
fundamental problems of job creation, the preservation of our 
social programs and the preservation of the social fabric of this 
country. What is crucial is that we continue the course that has been 
set by this government. We must deal with the fundamental 
problems so that a subsequent government does not have to stand 
up and admit to the kind of heritage the member just described.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
problem is the debt. That is this country's major problem. The soft 
targets this finance minister has set are not solving the problem. He 
should get serious and set some targets that really mean something, 
such as a zero deficit within the time frame of his mandate.
<P>
	I know the finance minister has heard what many of the 
economists said yesterday when they were looking at forecasts into 
the future. If the minister were to listen to the advice of these 
leading economists he would recognize that the track he is taking 
this country down is not good enough. There is a demand by 
taxpayers to solve our problem quicker. It is better to err on the side 
of quickness than to err on the side of slowness.
<P>
	Why does this finance minister not commit his department and 
his government to a clearly defined program of when we will get to 
see a zero deficit?
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there has never been 
a better expression of the difference that exists between the Reform 
Party and the government than the one just expressed by the 
member.
<P>
	He in fact said that the end of government was to reduce the 
deficit, that the purpose of government was to make itself smaller. 
That is not true. The purpose of government is to make itself 
smarter. The purpose in reducing the deficit is to help in job 
creation. The fundamental role of the country is to give its citizens 
a better future.
<P>
	Yes, we have done a great deal to reduce the deficit. We will 
continue to reduce the deficit and we will balance the budget, but 
that is not the end of this society. The purpose of society is to give 
citizens a better  standard of living, to give children a better chance 
and to make sure we take children out of poverty. That is what we 
will do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the finance 
minister talks about making things better for Canada. He talks 
about how he will improve things for Canada. From when he came 
into power until when he leaves power overall spending will be the 
same, if not higher. He is not solving the problem. He is adding to 
the problem.
<P>
	The problem is the debt. The solution is to get to a zero deficit so 
that we do not add to it. Whether it is over three years, two years or 
whatever, that is the objective.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the member will ask his question right 
now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, for the good of the country and for the 
good of the financial community, will the finance minister quit 
playing politics with the deficit, come clean with Canadians and 
present a balanced budget before he goes to the electorate in the 
next election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as set out in the last 
budget, program spending by the government by 1996-97 will be at 
its lowest level as a percentage of our gross domestic product since 
1951. We will be the only government of the G-7 that will have put 
into place an absolute reduction in its expenditures.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture has just listed what we have done in 
terms of job creation which is fundamental. If our only objective is 
to reduce the deficit, the fastest way to do it is to put Canadians 
back to work. The minister of agriculture has just set out what we 
have done.
<P>
	We will reduce the deficit. Let there be no doubt about that. 
However we will do it in a balanced way, one that does not harm 
the Canadian economy, one that gives our children a chance.
<P>
	If we want anything different, we can take a look at the budget 
set out by members of the Reform Party this year: scorch and burn, 
demolish the country. They are so ashamed of it that ever since it 
came out they have refused to bring it forth and talk about it 
because they know it was a dud.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr.

it through, he would  have learned that Quebec was the biggest 
loser in the cancellation of the EH-101 contract.
<P>
	Given that the Canadian aerospace industry is mainly based in 
the Montreal area, that Quebec is far from getting its fair share of 
defence spending and that the minister did not hesitate to award 
without tender to Ontario a $2 billion contract for armoured 
personnel carriers, how can he explain the fact that there is no 
Canadian content requirement in the new contract? How can he 
justify that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member forgets that, a few years ago, the previous government 
awarded a contract worth more than $1 billion to Bell Helicopter, in 
Mirabel, to build helicopters for the Canadian army. This was a 
major contract for 100 helicopters. But that is something he failed 
to mention in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Quebec has a large part of the aerospace industry. Bell 
Helicopter has received the world product mandate for the 
construction of certain types of helicopters it is now delivering to 
the Canadian army. It was because of the government's 
decision-perhaps this is one of the few things the previous 
government did correctly-that Bell Helicopter company was able 
to get the world product mandate and bring jobs to Canada, to 
Quebec, for the making of these helicopters to serve Bell's 
worldwide market.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is like a propeller, we never know which way 
he will turn. Does he not realize that, by refusing to include a 
Canadian content requirement in this contract, he is not only 
compromising our businesses' chances of securing the contract but 
also completely ignoring the policy on managing major crown 
projects, namely projects in excess of $100 million, which clearly 
requires him to give top priority to industrial and regional 
development?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have stated 
as government policy that we will get the best deal for Canadian 
taxpayers. Where possible, we will buy off the shelf, and we have 
done that.
<P>
	As I said the other day, the hon. member and his party do not 
have much confidence in Quebec companies, many of them world 
class, that will easily be able to compete and offer their services to 
provide components  for these helicopters. He does not have faith 
in their own industries in Quebec. That is shameful.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance basically released his annual financial report. 
On page 2 of that report the minister acknowledged that he 
massaged the personal income tax collection figures for the 
previous year to take $3 billion out of revenue in 1994.
<P>
	Using the real figures, will the Minister of Finance acknowledge 
that the 1994 deficit was only $39 billion and that the 1995 deficit 
is exactly $38.7 billion, which means that the deficit has not come 
down hardly at all?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the accounting 
principles we followed in reporting the state of the government's 
finances have been consistent and are ones determined by the 
auditor general.
<P>
	If the hon. member is accusing the auditor general of massaging 
the numbers, I would suspect he should do so in another forum. 
Even if one accepts the premise of the member's question, which is 
obviously false, one would have to ask him to apply the same 
principles from one year to the next and he would find that his 
question does not stand up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
quoting from the report of the Minister of Finance that there were 
some changes and some fixing of the numbers in 1994.
<P>
	While we listen to the daily drivel of the government of how it 
cuts costs and is trying to create jobs, using his actual numbers tax 
collections were up $7.3 billion and the deficit has only come down 
by $4.5 billion.
<P>
	Therefore would he acknowledge that he is reducing the deficit 
on the backs of taxpayers, not by cutting spending, and that 
increased taxation kills jobs? It does not create jobs as he talked 
about earlier today.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member did not 
quote my words. He quoted his own words. He would have been 
better off to have quoted mine.
<P>
	First, we follow the accounting principles established by the 
auditor general. Second, the member will understand the basic 
problem of the country is compound interest. While our spending 
may well go down in terms of programs, our interest costs continue 
to rise. That is the basic nut we have to deal with.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
the government announced that it had reached a settlement to 
compensate the Italian company Agusta, following the cancellation 
of the contract for the EH-101 helicopters. No details will be made 
public until several months, but we know that this settlement will 
cost several hundred million dollars. Agusta, it must be 
remembered, is currently facing bribe and corruption charges in 
Europe.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of National Defence. While the 
terms of the settlement reached between the government and 
Agusta are not yet known, and given that the inquiry called for by 
the Liberals when they formed the opposition never took place, 
how can the government explain that Agusta is still being 
considered for the new helicopter contract?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was 
quite right in saying that an agreement in principle had been 
reached between the Government of Canada and the company to 
which she referred. Unfortunately the hon. member went on to 
make an assumption which has yet to be realized. In point of fact 
the Minister of National Defence has yet to give to the Department 
of Public Works and Government Services a request for a proposal.
<P>
	We do not know who in the world might be submitting bids for 
various procurement initiatives of the Government of Canada. How 
the hon. member could stretch an agreement on termination costs 
with a particular company into saying that it will now be somehow 
successful in some subsequent bid is beyond the realm of reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that answer 
has nothing to do with the question. My question was on the second 
contract, but the minister keeps referring to the first one. Will we 
have to make a video for the minister to understand the question?
<P>
	Let me put it again. Since Agusta is at the centre of a huge 
scandal in Belgium, how can the minister justify that, without any 
inquiry on the circumstances surrounding the signing of the 
EH-101 contract, he will pay Agusta hundreds of millions in 
compensation, without telling us whether he intends to exclude that 
company as a bidder for the new helicopter contract? That is my 
question to the minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to 
receive the video at any time. Perhaps she might want to have 
Canada Post deliver it.
<P>
	The Government of Canada, as I am sure any reasonable 
individual would understand, had a binding contract with the 
company in question. We made a decision upon coming to office 
about the termination of the contract. There are termination costs 
the Government of Canada will have to provide in accordance with 
the contract. We will live up to the contract obligations and we 
hope to be able to provide that information in due course.
<P>
	However the hon. member cannot jump from that resolution into 
thinking that automatically the company to which she refers may 
have some upper hand with regard to possible procurements of the 
Government of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
agree with the Minister of Finance that job creation and putting 
Canadians back to work are not drivel. The brother-in-law of the 
head of Canada Post is about to be awarded an untendered $300 
million contract and get an extension on another to the year 2002, 
and the minister responsible does nothing about it.
<P>
	If the Minister of Public Works again alleges there is nothing 
wrong here, would he assure the House that the contract will be 
investigated as part of the much anticipated review of Canada Post?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member once 
again likes to roll around in the mud. It is pretty sad when in point 
of fact we informed his colleague who raised the issue at a previous 
time that the suggestion the hon. member was making was 
incorrect.
<P>
	A letter I have, which I would be pleased to table for the benefit 
of the House, says:

<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister seldom does know what I am talking about.
<P>
	I talked a lot about patronage and about rolling around in the 
mud and the slime. We only have to go as far as Sydney, Nova 
Scotia, to see what is going on at the tar ponds in the middle of the 
member's riding.
<P>
	The federal conflict of interest code is being blatantly ignored 
over and over and this minister does nothing about it. Two senior 
executives in public works dole out federal money to their 
relatives, get caught in the act, and again the minister does nothing.
<P>
	How does the minister of public works expect to clean up 
nepotism at Canada Post when he continues to allow his public 
works employees to give out money to their wives and nephews 
without even going through the pretence of tendering?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada

knows a lot about stench. He knows a heck of a lot about it. In point 
of fact, he makes allegations continuously in the House.
<P>
	He refers to the tar ponds, which are not even in my 
constituency. I hope he will get his facts correct.
<P>
	With regard to the specific allegations he raises, I hope the hon. 
member would clearly understand that ministers of the crown do 
not have the authority to deal with public servants within their own 
departments. That is a responsibility of the respective deputy 
ministers of each of our departments. That is codified by law.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the minister responsible for regional 
development in Quebec.
<P>
	The minister responsible for regional development in Quebec is 
now contributing to the loss of jobs in the forest industry in Quebec 
since Ottawa decided unilaterally to withdraw from that sector and 
he refuses to grant the $80 million requested by the industry.
<P>
	By refusing that compensation to forest workers in Quebec, as he 
did recently in the case of farm producers in Western Canada where 
the federal government withdrew from the grain transportation 
sector, is the  minister not applying double standards and being 
unfair to Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this issue has been 
discussed over a number of years. The previous government is the 
one that cancelled those programs for forestry agreements. We 
have continued to try to extend that to give the woodlot owners an 
opportunity to adjust to the change. Last year the plan was 
extended for a further year and it does not expire until March 1996. 
The woodlot owners have been given lots of notice and lots of 
compensation in order to adjust.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
does the minister recognize that when he refuses to react positively 
to the claims of 170,000 stakeholders of the forest industry, he 
simply confirms the fears of Quebecers who thought that after a no 
to the referendum, the federal government would also say no to all 
of their requests?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it passing strange 
that the member would be asking for compensation on the one hand 
and at the same time saying that it is a responsibility of the 
provincial government. So let the provincial government do its job.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Krever 
inquiry has done a pretty good job of pointing out flaws in our 
blood system. Our health minister's reaction is like a deer in the 
headlights. The time for dithering is over.
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary maybe give the health minister a 
little nudge so we can have a little more accountability in our blood 
system?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer that question, 
but it is really rather sad that such an important subject as blood 
should be dealt with in such a flippant manner.
<P>
	The Krever inquiry has been set up to look at the safety of blood 
in the 1980s. That report has not yet come down. Mr. Krever has 
had an audit done on safety so far, which has shown that the blood 
system in Canada is as safe as any system of blood can be in any 
other part of the world. The hon. member, as a physician, should 
know that there is not 100 per cent safety in any issue that has to do 
with pathogens or biotechnology.
<P>
	We in health are not waiting for the Krever inquiry to come out 
with its recommendations. We have already begun. We have 
doubled the number of inspectors for blood in this country. We 
have started annual inspections, which was never done before. We 
have implemented at least 10 measures, which are too long for me 
to respond to right now, that will enhance safety before the Krever 
inquiry even comes out with its recommendations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
simply says that our blood system is fine. The report says the 
system is confusing, has poor accountability, is frozen in the past. 
If hers is not a flippant response, I do not know what is.
<P>
	Maybe it takes a hip check for the health minister. Will the 
parliamentary secretary ask the minister to at least clarify the lines 
of authority so that we do not have confusion in our blood system?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not only the Minister of Health 
who said the system is safe; it actually came out of  Mr. Krever 
himself. Those are his words on his safety audit.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member is speaking about another audit. All 
these audits are tools the Krever commission is using to come up 
with its final report.
<P>
	At the moment the Krever commission is looking at 
management issues, which is appropriate to do. We are waiting for 
that report to come out. When it does, we will look at it and take the 
appropriate steps, as we always do.

	The Minister of Health said last Wednesday in the House, and I

taking steps to make the system safer''.

year ago?

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

with regard to what the Krever inquiry has suggested so far, we 
have responded to Justice Krever's interim report and have acted 
on every recommendation within our jurisdiction. Unfortunately 
we cannot react on recommendations that have nothing to do with 
our jurisdiction. I will list these. I spoke to them earlier, but maybe 
what I need to do is list them.
<P>
	We have increased resources in the area of blood regulation. We 
have increased the frequency of inspections and improved the way 
we do them, making them on a yearly basis. We have enhanced the 
way we do inspections, requiring now a written report at the end of 
the inspection. We have introduced an exit notice that clearly sets 
out our observations and requirements for corrective action. We 
have established an independent advisory committee on blood 
regulation to provide us with advice on a range of issues, and so on.

have on prairie farmers who are not breaking the law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

no way to have an effective influence on the shaping of government 
policy. In fact that conduct sets back the case of those who would 
legitimately argue for some changes.
<P>
	It is a fundamental precept of democracy that we must all respect 
the law, even those laws with which we may disagree. If we do not 
have that fundamental respect for the law, soon we all descend to 
the law of the jungle.

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to present my report on strengthening government 
review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This document is our way of delivering on a promise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
Specifically, it is delivering on our promise to address some of the 
concerns expressed about review in the sixth report of the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	In a larger sense this document is also part of our effort to fulfil 
the government's election promise to Canadians. We told them that 
we would make government more efficient, that we would make it 
more affordable. We also promised we would make it more 
accountable.
<P>
	To get government right, we need to know what works and what 
does not work. Feedback in the form of reviews, evaluations and 
audits is the best way for the government to learn and to improve. 
As well, regular reviews are an excellent opportunity to remind our 
employees of what the public service is all about: delivering 
quality service to the public and doing our best with the resources 
that are available.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Canadians want to know how their tax money is spent. They 
want to be assured they are getting value for those tax dollars. As 
the people's elected representatives, we have a right to an 
accounting on those expenditures. Through the public accounts 
committee we have been told we need timely, relevant and useful 
feedback on the effects of government policies and programs.
<P>
	As the auditor general pointed out in his 1993 report, the 
government's feedback system does not always work as it should. 
This is why we are implementing many initiatives for things like 
quality management, a better expenditure management system, a 
modernized financial information system, a smarter use of modern 
information technology and of course with this report today, a 
strengthening of government review of its programs and services.
<P>
	The government-wide program review process is bringing many 
significant changes to the way we govern. It is more than just a 
short term tune-up. Our research shows that those changes are 
making a real difference to the way we manage the public service. 
We are working to create a new management culture, one that is 
results oriented and one that is client focused.
<P>
	Results oriented management means defining the results the 
government seeks to achieve in its programs. It means giving 
managers the resources and guidance they need to achieve those 
results. It means performance measurements, measuring and 
demonstrating actual achievements. It means ultimately finding a 
way to share what we learn with each other in the government and 
also with the public.
<P>
	This report is our way of documenting these changes. It is the 
product of a thorough investigation. We consulted many different 
groups, both internally and externally. Our valued professional 
auditors, our evaluators and others in the review community played 
a key role in the evolution of this report.
<P>
	What did we learn from these consultations? Our research 
showed that public service employees really do understand the 
importance of review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is apparent in the extensive amount of review activity 
carried out in the departments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16490"> 16490 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Treasury Board is leading the evolution of review in three 
key ways. First, we are linking results information with our 
business plan process and other forms of decision making. Second, 
we are improving our ability to co-ordinate government-wide 
reviews. Third, we are enhancing our review and performance 
database so that it will be a convenient source of information on 
key reviews as well as lessons learned and best practices.
<P>
	There is still room for improvement. We are committed to do 
what it takes to continue down the road this report puts us on. 
Administrative structures will be reinforced and results 
commitments will be more visible. In helping to provide the 
information for evaluation, we also need a better financial 
information system. We will continue to find better ways of 
measuring and making performance information available to 
Parliament.
<P>
	Finally, we are going to help departments develop better 
accountability or control frameworks giving the kind of training 
and expertise that is needed. We are going to analyse the 
information gaps for issues where more than one department is 
involved.
<P>
	Review is a powerful tool for change. It is integral to delivering 
quality services to Canadians. It is vital to the changes under way to 
improve our expenditure management system. We intend to 
continue our actions to strengthen government review and 
evaluation on government programs and services.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the efficiency of 
the civil service depends on a close and frequent assessment of all 
of the government programs. Departments must ensure that their 
programs meet their original objectives. Also, they must ensure 
that the various departmental programs produce very good results, 
in the best possible way, and that they do no waste the taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
	In his 1993 annual report, the auditor general made an 
assessment of the federal government programs which was very 
negative. He concluded that not only was the program assessment 
process seriously flawed, but also that only a quarter of federal 
expenditures had been reviewed between 1985-86 and 1991-92.
<P>
	For over two years now, the official opposition has been calling 
for a comprehensive assessment of all federal programs. Also, for 
this assessment to be efficient, it must be transparent, which means 
that members of Parliament should be able to take part in it. As you 
know, only elected representatives are accountable to the people. 
The President of the Treasury Board told us today that, as elected 
representatives of the people, we have the right to be well informed 
on how the money is  spent. But what have we seen since this 
government took office?
<P>
	For example, the so-called program assessment undertaken by 
his colleague from Intergovernmental Affairs was done behind 
closed doors. At a finance committee hearing, the official 
opposition even asked the President of the Treasury Board to 
release the studies, especially those on duplication, made in 
connection with the program review.
<P>
	At the time, the President of the Treasury Board referred us to 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs who refused to release 
them on the grounds that they were useful only to the policy 
makers. So much for transparency. We have to judge a government 
by its actions and results rather than by its rethoric.
<P>
	I am afraid this new management culture that the President of the 
Treasury Board says he wants to put in place clashes with the 
policies the present government has been practising since it took 
office.
<P>
	It is all fine and well for the President of the Treasury Board to 
preach and to say he wants to improve the federal program review, 
but the results will be disappointing as long as parliamentarians are 
denied access to the necessary information.
<P>
	I mentioned duplication of services earlier. To be effective, every 
program review process must answer this very simple question: 
Who is doing what? Which level of government is best able to deal 
with various areas? The federal government said and still says that 
jurisdiction must be given to the level of government which is best 
able to deal with it. Again, we must ensure this is not only rethoric.
<P>
	What is the every day reality since the present government took 
office? The reality is that the federal government is interfering 
increasingly in areas where the jurisdiction and legitimacy of 
Quebec and the provinces are absolutely clear. I will give you 
examples, passage of Bill C-76 and the issue of manpower training.
<P>
	With Bill C-76, the federal government has given itself the 
powers to unilaterally impose national standards, particularly in the 
areas of post-secondary education and welfare, thus increasing 
useless duplication.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Even though all of Quebec's social and economic stakeholders 
agree that the Government of Quebec is the level of government 
which is in the best position and which is the most effective to deal 
with manpower training, the federal government refuses to 
withdraw from this sector with compensation.
<P>
	A government is judged by its actions. The federal government's 
profoundly centralist philosophy prevents it from improving

duplication and the waste by making a strict assessment-through

<P>
government has once again decided to send the bill to the provinces 
and limits its action to tabling yet another report.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to respond on behalf of the Reform Party to the minister's 
first report on strengthening government review.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the first review, which the minister 
has said he takes great pride in tabling, is the result of the work 
done by the public accounts committee. It tabled a report last year 
calling for this review. There were eight specific, strong 
recommendations to help the government do its job better. We 
know the government is trying. Quite often we give them a failing 
grade but at least we see that they are trying.
<P>
	Looking at the report I noted this. He said: ``What did we learn? 
First of all our research showed that public service employees 
really do understand the importance of review''. I hope so because 
it meant that 30,000 of them were out the door.
<P>
	During the last election, the Liberals said that they were going to 
create jobs, that they were going to create an infrastructure 
program and spend $6 billion of borrowed money.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board admitted before the 
committee that $6 billion only created 8,000 full time jobs. We 
have now found that the government is spending another several 
billion dollars to move 30,000 civil servants on to the street and on 
to the rolls of UI.
<P>
	Canadians are going to be out $10 billion and we are also down 
about 20,000 jobs at the same time. We need program evaluation to 
do things properly. Unfortunately, by looking at the report that was 
just tabled-we have not had the opportunity to examine it in 
detail-it seems to me that this is the same old review rather than a 
proper evaluation of the programs of government, reviews that the 
auditor general has said focus primarily on efficiency and tinkering 
with the system rather than a full blown evaluation to save money.
<P>
	Take an example. I am not going to give the government the 
credit because it was actually started under the previous 
government, when the department of transportation decided to do a 
review of the Atlantic freight rates assistance program. This 
program had been started around the turn of the century and 
codified around the 1920s. This was to subsidize freight being 
moved from Atlantic Canada westward into Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	By 1993 it was costing us $100 million a year in subsidies. When 
an evaluation was done it was found the subsidy was going into the 
hands of these poor people  called Irvings and McCains and so on 
in Atlantic Canada. It was all set up by trucking firms owned by 
these large companies inflating the cost and the subsidy they were 
collecting. We found out the subsidy was providing no public 
policy benefits to the people of Canada, yet we were paying $100 
million.
<P>
	Program evaluation reviews can do the job properly if they are 
focused and done well. However, the auditor general tells us that 
the government is cutting back on its commitment to reduce $11.8 
million, in I think it was in the 1992-93 contracting to look at 
evaluation of programs. It cut back $8.5 million, a decline of 28 per 
cent while we listened to these wonderful words of the President of 
the Treasury Board telling us how reviews are doing a great job.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Page 26 of the report is about UI. The minister says: ``Studies 
include over 20 projects, assessing many aspects of the UI 
program'', which continues to keep people unemployed while we 
wait for the Minister of Human Resources Development to bring 
down the big review to find out how we can save billions in the 
program.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And it is coming in this lifetime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Program evaluation can do very great wonders to 
the deficits of the country if it looks at four fundamental elements. 
First, is the program still relevant? Has the focus changed over the 
years or should the focus be changed? Second, does the program 
meet the relevant need which has been identified in society? Third, 
is it being delivered efficiently? The fourth element is as important 
as any of them. Is there a better way of spending our money to 
achieve the same results more efficiently and ensuring that the need 
is served?
<P>
	I am glad to see that the President of the Treasury Board has 
tabled his first report. Perhaps it is a new beginning. It is certainly a 
small beginning. I have to compliment him on starting down the 
road. I only hope he is going to move aggressively and sincerely to 
save taxpayers a great deal of money.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHUMANRESOURCESDEVELOPMENTACT">DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-96, 
an act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related acts, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill C-96, an act to establish the 
Department of Human Resources Development and to amend and 
repeal certain related acts.
<P>
	Last week in my office I received a status of women document 
that prompts me to speak to this bill today. That document was a 
prepared camera ready piece to be used as an insert in householders 
from members of Parliament across Canada.
<P>
	It describes Canada's role at the fourth UN conference on 
women to an unsuspecting public. It described the government as 
recognizing the importance of strengthening the family. Nothing 
could be further from the truth.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development is one of 24 
federal departments included in the status of women plans. I will 
read from the document:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In preparing for the Conference-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-that is the fourth UN conference on women-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-Canada developed its own national action plan for gender equality ``Setting 
the Stage for the Next Century: the Federal Plan for Gender Equality,'' 
published in August, is a framework for federal action to advance women's 
equality in Canada to the year 2000''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This federal plan for gender equality outlines eight lofty 
sounding objectives. Today I would like to touch on five of the 
eight objectives to which the Department of Human Resources 
Development has committed.
<P>
	The first is to implement gender based analysis throughout 
federal departments and agencies. The second is to improve 
women's economic autonomy and well-being. Sixth, incorporate 
women's perspective in governance. Seventh, promote and support 
global gender equality and, eighth, advance gender equality for 
employees of federal departments and agencies.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16494"> 16494 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Human Resources Development before and after the 
reorganization this formalizes agreed along with other federal 
departments to implement this gender based analysis. What is 
gender based analysis? What is the definition offered by the 
government in its own publication? According to the federal plan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A gender based approach ensures that the development, analysis and 
implementation of legislation and policies are undertaken with an appreciation 
of gender differences. It also acknowledges that some women may be 
disadvantaged even further because of their race, colour, sexual orientation, 
social economic position, region, ability level or age.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Notice the subtle reference to sexual orientation in this list. This 
word, until recently with the passage of Bill C-41, did not exist in 
federal legislation. Even now the recognition of sexual orientation 
is not yet in our Canadian Human Rights Act. With this 
government document, however, it is now official policy in every 
government department, courtesy of the Status of Women and not 
of Parliament.
<P>
	It is the ambiguous concept of gender I should like to give close 
attention to today. The dictionary definition of gender refers to a 
person's sex. In contrast to this, according to the federal plan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gender refers not to men or women, but to the relationship between them and 
to the ways in which the roles of women and men, girls and boys, are socially 
constructed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The document goes on to expand on the concept of gender 
equality. To achieve gender equality, the social arrangements that 
govern the relationship between men and women will have to 
change to give equal value to the different roles they play as 
parents, as workers, and so on and so forth.
<P>
	The word parent does occur here. Does this mean that the 
importance of parent and family is being recognized? Has the 
traditional family or family been deemed to be worthy of the 
government's attention? If we go further in the document we 
realize that this is not the case. It goes on to say such statements as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Equality for all women will come about only as these attitudes embedded in 
the workplace, education institutes and family are challenged and begin to 
change.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another example of this policy duplicity is the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unequal participation and progress in paid work further undermines a 
woman's ability to achieve and sustain personal autonomy throughout her life.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This statement reflects the bias that it is only paid work that 
defines a woman's ability, value and worth in society. This 
illustrates the government's contempt for home and family 
relationships.
<P>
	Participation in the workplace defines ability, value and worth 
according to this Liberal government document. With this bias it is 
not only family structures  that become criticized under the 
microscope of their gender equality, but such things as religion, 
customs and traditional practices. The free choice or preference of 
individuals is replaced by this government imposed priority of 
workforce participation.
<P>
	Gender equality is also based upon the assumption of attaining 
equal outcomes, as noted in the federal plan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Attaining gender equality is predicated on the achievement of equal 
outcomes for both men and women.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is brought about not only by equal treatment but by 
``positive actions''. Positive actions imply government 
intervention. This document blatantly states that treating women 
and men identically will not ensure equal outcomes. Thus the 
philosophy of gender equality leads to the policy of employment 
equity and affirmative action from the workplace right through to 
the kitchens of our national homes. This policy has been rejected 
outright by Canadians and certainly by my constituents in Port 
Moody-Coquitlam.
<P>
	A recent survey I conducted of my constituents indicated that 
some 87 per cent believe that merit and merit alone should be the 
sole criteria for hiring and promotion. They have rejected 
employment equity and affirmative action, certainly in the 
workplace and most certainly in the home.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The policy or practice of employment equity is a fundamental 
insult to the abilities of women. It is a fundamental insult to me. 
The government cannot and should not mandate equal outcome in 
workplace participation between the sexes, between men and 
women. That should not be its role. Rather, the government should 
seek to encourage equality of opportunity and freedom of choice. 
Individuals should be free to decide how they wish to participate, 
both inside and outside the home.
<P>
	The government obviously has no respect for the value of 
nurturing or sustaining families. The government does not take into 
account nor does it respect that women may have other alternatives 
and priorities in life, may wish to make choices other than 
government choices, and may wish to invest their time and efforts 
in their families. Therefore it was to my great surprise to read the 
status of women document which states that they recognize the 
importance of the family and the importance of strengthening it.
<P>
	The minister pays only lip service to the needs and priorities of 
Canadian families while giving full service to radical feminists 
through such documents as the gender equality plan and the Beijing 
platform for action. It should be noted that neither the platform for 
action nor the federal plan for gender equality has been presented 
to the House. We have not seen a shred of those documents in this 
place for discussion. We have not been able to scrutinize what is in 
them, as we deserve to do. The  government has legislated in 24 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16495"> 16495 </A></B>
<P>
federal departments, including human resources, without this 
legislature.
<P>
	Where is the accountability in our system of government? The 
government, according to its notorious red book, stated that ``open 
government would be the watchword of the Liberal government 
program''. Why has not the government brought this agenda to the 
public's attention? Yet the two documents to which I referred, one 
being domestic and the other an international UN agreement, will 
have wide-ranging impact upon our legislation, our public policy, 
our society and our families.
<P>
	We will recall last month the passage of Bill C-64, a monument 
to employment equity in all federal departments. It is no 
coincidence that this is in the Beijing document.
<P>
	Human resources development is a main player in the realization 
of the Liberal government's gender based analysis agenda. It 
intends at any moment to interfere in the free choice of Canadian 
families by introducing a national day care program. It intends to 
add a further tax burden to all Canadians with this program in its 
desire to become a nanny state.
<P>
	We thought last year that the power of the radical women's lobby 
was defunded and disempowered with the removal of the National 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women. The Human Resources 
Development Department has committed to continued and added 
support for and influence from gender equity activists through the 
platform for action. This department among many others has 
committed to the funding and advice of gender feminist NGO 
groups to implement their gender equality objectives.
<P>
	We find that even the promotion and support of global gender 
equality is one of the mandates of the new human resources 
development. It applied to the department's funding radical 
feminists going to Beijing. It will apply to ongoing NAFTA labour 
agreements. Its mandate even applies to other international 
activities.
<P>
	Nothing is free or even cheap in federal government. What will 
the new priority cost this department or other departments? In lean 
economic times should the limited resources and sadly needed 
resources of a human resources development department be used to 
realize the unwanted agenda of a powerful special interest group, or 
should its limited resources apply to the needs of real Canadians?
<P>
	Instead of debating substantive and controversial policy issues 
such as the gender based employment equity contained in the 
platform for action and the federal plan for gender equality, we are 
debating a pro forma bill, Bill C-96, which actually offers nothing 
new, nothing fresh, nothing bold enough to reform this department 
or, more important, to reform federal-provincial relations. While 
RD is enacting fundamental, costly,  revolutionizing social policy 
behind the scenes, Bill C-96 does not even have a royal 
recommendation attached to it.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I am sure however that the cost of implementing the plan for 
gender equality and the platform for action will be considerable not 
only in this department but in every department across government. 
This is an issue that I intend to pursue. This cost will not only be in 
dollars but it will be in the weakened viability of our most precious 
societal institutions, and one such institution is our families.
<P>
	The government's non-legislative agenda is of great concern to 
me. This non-legislative agenda permeates every nook and cranny 
of every federal department at this point in time.
<P>
	Earlier the minister was saying that their policies affect the 
social fabric of the country. They certainly do. This one in 
particular strikes the very centre of our social fabric. The general 
secretary to the Beijing conference, Gertrude Mongella, declared at 
the opening ceremony of that conference that ``all evidence points 
to a social revolution in the making''.
<P>
	The two documents I have mentioned, the ones going into this 
department and others, will have a profound effect on our 
governments, our laws, our society and our families. What Bill 
C-96 shuffles around on the surface and what we are talking about 
today actually belie a whirlpool of change underneath.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I always enjoy listening to the hon. member's speech, but 
sometimes I find that members of the Reform Party miss some 
major points in legislation. I will quickly review for the hon. 
member the major objectives of the legislation and what the 
legislation allows the federal government to continue doing.
<P>
	Essentially it does a few things. It draws together portions of the 
former departments of employment and immigration, health and 
welfare, the secretary of state, and labour. The legislation will also 
allow the Government of Canada to continue improving 
employment programs and services for Canadians and building on 
what I consider to be significant achievements over the past two 
years.
<P>
	I should like to list some of those. We enacted some major 
changes to make student loans more accessible, flexible and 
sustainable, helping more than 300,000 students this year alone. 
The hon. member from the Bloc will know that because of the 
flexible federalism that exists in the country there is an opting out 
provision for the province of Quebec which allows the province of 
Quebec to administer its own Canada student loans program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16496"> 16496 </A></B>
<P>
	For the very first time the federal government moved to 
establish a special opportunities grant for individuals, like high 
need, part time students, women pursuing doctoral studies and 
disabled students. Through this department we have also created 
youth internship programs that have led to real jobs for some 
27,000 young Canadians, which is 20 per cent more than the red 
book commitment.
<P>
	We have approximately 130 Youth Service Canada projects 
across the country that give young people the opportunity to serve 
their community and to obtain valuable work experience.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Through effective partnerships with major industries and 
through the establishment of sectoral councils the government has 
been able to generate, for every federal dollar, $1.50 from the 
private sector because it believes the way to go in the new economy 
is through effective partnerships. We also have joint 
federal-provincial initiatives helping some 60,000 single mothers, 
older workers, aboriginals, young people get the new skills and 
new jobs.
<P>
	Approximately $111 million has been spent on older workers. 
The government has invested in a program for older workers over 
the past three years to help displaced workers deal with the new 
dynamic configuration occurring in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	The government has also done something that I believe is 
extremely important. In order to modernize the economy you must 
modernize the way government delivers its services. Services have 
been integrated and decentralized, moving from 450 to 750 points 
of service reaching smaller communities 24 hours a day.
<P>
	We talk about family. We talk about our seniors. We talk about 
young people. We talk about providing all Canadians-we are part 
of the Canadian family-with better services. There are four times 
as many offices where seniors can get in-person service. That is a 
fantastic accomplishment.
<P>
	The best technology is used to speed up service for UI. 
Processing time has been cut by two days. OAS claims have been 
cut from eight days to one-half day. We are focusing on 
employment programs that work like the self-employment 
assistance program from which 34,000 Canadians have benefited. 
They have created a job for themselves but more important, they 
have also created jobs for others. On its own this program has 
created 68,000 jobs.
<P>
	The point I am making to the hon. member is if we are talking 
about the Canadian family, i.e. everyone who resides within this 
country, it is crystal clear the government has moved in a positive 
direction. I hope that once in a while members of the opposition 
would get up on their feet and applaud these excellent initiatives by 
the Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if that was a question or 
a comment.
<P>
	I enjoy the opportunity to answer my colleague's presentation. 
He talks about the Canadian family. I am talking about Canadian 
families, the root of our society.
<P>
	I would like to reflect on what has happened in the last 20 years 
to Canadian families. In that time, especially in the last five years, 
youth violence has more than doubled. Real income, the amount of 
money a family has to support itself with, has dropped by some 6.5 
per cent in the last five or six years because of taxation, because of 
government overspending and because of fiscal policies that are 
putting tremendous pressures on the people that are trying to hold 
this nation together.
<P>
	Consider suicide rates. We have the third highest suicide rate 
among male youth in the world. The divorce rate has increased 10 
times in the last 35 years and we are shuffling the chairs around on 
the deck saying: ``We'll spend more money''.
<P>
	What are the priorities of Canadians? Is it their priority to find 
out what government can do or what they can do in job creation? 
We want to put the tools in the hands of Canadians so they can 
create the jobs. It is not what government can do, it is what 
Canadians can do. Government priorities should not be prompted 
by special interest groups, but what Canadian priorities are.
<P>
	The Canadian priorities are that their families be strengthened 
and that they be given the instruments to create their own future. 
That is exactly what the government's fiscal policies, justice 
policies and social policies are stripping away from those families. 
I put that to the hon. member who made the comments.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a brief comment to make. I want to congratulate the 
member for the relevance of the example she gave with regard to 
the family. Indeed we can see how the government is giving itself a 
lot of leeway in connection with policies that it is presenting abroad 
as being Canadian without having them validated in the House or 
even commented on.
<P>
	Based on this example, we have good reason to question the 
appropriateness of giving the federal government the responsibility 
it wants to give itself in clause 20 of the bill, for example, which 
says: ``-the Minister may enter into agreements with a province or 
group of provinces, agencies of provinces, financial institutions 
and such other persons or bodies as the Minister considers 
appropriate''.
<P>
	If this clause is left unchanged, and this is the question I will put 
the member, it means that the federal government can go against 
policies put in place by the  provinces. Family policy is an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16497"> 16497 </A></B>
<P>
interesting example because choices in this regard may differ 
across Canada.
<P>
	If clause 20 is left unchanged, it allows the federal government 
to interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction, in areas where 
policies already exist. Does the member not agree that we should at 
least amend this clause by adding to it that, when agreements are 
signed with public bodies, financial institutions or any other 
person, it be done in accordance with priorities established by the 
provinces? I would like to hear the member's opinion on this 
subject.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly as a Reformer and as a 
supporter of the accountability of programs being in the hands of 
those closest to the people who have to put the programs in place, I 
support the premise that the control of programs and decisions that 
are made be as close to the people as possible.
<P>
	I must add at the same time that every part of our nation should 
have the same input into what those decisions are. Certainly 
provinces can be deemed equal in the administration of the 
programs. The federal government's participation in those 
programs should be minimized as much as possible while 
maintaining the integrity and protection of Canadians across the 
system. The actual delivery of programs should be in provincial 
hands in an equal fashion from coast to coast.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-96, 
the act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The main object of this bill is to lend unified legal status to the 
department, enabling it to continue to assist Canadians in getting 
back to work. This is a housekeeping bill and is not intended to 
implement any major reforms. It does not call for any new 
organizational changes or new expenditures, and does not affect 
federal-provincial relations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-96 draws together and consolidates the legislative 
foundation of the new Department of Human Resources 
Development. It does not add anything new or subtract from the 
foundation. It merely puts everything in one place. That in itself is 
important. It is plain common sense. For administrative reasons 
alone, it is far more efficient to have a single legislative basis for 
the department. However, there is more to this than mere 
administrative convenience.
<P>
	When the government launched the department under the name 
of human resources development, it set the stage for a real change 
not just in name but in direction, in the way Human Resources 
Development Canada serves Canadians.
<P>
	Over the past two years, HRDC has been changing, innovating 
and adapting to the realities of today's economy and today's labour 
market. It is modernizing the way it does business, the way it 
delivers the services Canadians need, the way it works for 
Canadians in the changing world. For the nine million Canadians 
who come to HRDC for help this is why Bill C-96 is so important. 
The bill provides the solid foundation the department needs to keep 
moving forward.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	It is important to Canada's seniors. Last year the department 
completed the first year in a three-year income security program 
redesign project. Phase 2 is already well under way. The 
department is streamlining rules and procedures, developing the 
best technology available. The end result will be a fully 
modernized, efficient network for delivering services to clients of 
the old age security and Canada pension plan programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Once fully implemented, the new system will save taxpayers up 
to $100 million yearly in operating costs. Moreover, it will also 
provide faster service to seniors, the people who really depend on 
these programs for their security. For their sakes, let us ensure that 
the bill stays on track and is passed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Income security program redesign is only the start. As the 
minister has already announced in the House, Human Resources 
Development Canada has undertaken a complete review of its 
service delivery network, with a view to making it decentralized, 
integrated, user friendly and flexible. It will serve a greater number 
of Canadians everywhere in the country better than before. In 
reality, because of the new network, the number of departmental 
service points will be increased from 450 to 700 within three years.
<P>
	These will include 300 Human Resources Development Canada 
centres, which will provide quality one-on-one counselling to 
clients; self-serve mechanisms such as telephone, interactive 
television and computer services, which will broaden access to 
HRDC services; up to 400 electronic kiosks, which means 
self-serve terminals will be available in communities throughout 
the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The department is already creating the most advanced, efficient 
service delivery network in the federal government. Work on 
developing new technologies for this new network is well 
advanced, with things like a national on-line labour market 
information system incorporating an electronic job search bulletin 
board. The system will help people do their own matching between 
their skills and the jobs available anywhere in Canada.
<P>
	Pilot testing a new system called TELEDEC lets unemployment 
insurance claimants submit their bi-weekly report over a touchtone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16498"> 16498 </A></B>
<P>
telephone instead of  by mail or in person. TELEDEC allows 
people to get their cheques two days faster.
<P>
	TELE-APP, a new system being tested in partnership with NBTel 
allows people who have collected UI in the last 52 weeks to reapply 
using a touchtone phone.
<P>
	APPLI-SYS, a touch screen computer program helps people 
apply for UI benefits more quickly.
<P>
	Pilot testing document imaging begins the movement toward 
paperless claim processing.
<P>
	Early results from these new systems are promising. They are 
just the first of a range of technologies from the Internet 
application to software training packages that HRDC will explore 
to provide faster, more efficient service.
<P>
	We are bringing service delivery into the 21st century. In the 
process we are empowering more Canadians to help themselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the main objectives of the new service delivery network 
is to facilitate decentralization of the entire structure of 
departmental operations, to put into place programs and services 
within the community, to move decision making centres as close to 
the client as possible, and to get those most affected by programs 
and services actively involved in them.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	For instance, the network will include community-based 
mechanisms which will involve input from provincial governments 
and business, municipalities and community groups, working as 
partners with Human Resources Development Canada.
<P>
	With the human resources investment fund, we integrate these 
partnerships with our programs and services. Partnerships work, as 
seen from what has been achieved by sector councils that bring 
together entire industries and promote strategic initiatives with the 
provinces and co-operation with community groups across the 
country.
<P>
	Take one of the youth internship projects, in Winnipeg, where 45 
young people go to work every morning and go to school every 
afternoon. They acquire practical experience while taking courses 
that are relevant to that experience, and they are guaranteed a job 
when they finish the course.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What is really interesting about this project is that five major 
private sector firms in Winnipeg, for example, are not only taking 
part, they are taking the lead enthusiastically. It is not a case of 
government and business working on separate tracks; it is a case of 
partnership in action. And this year alone there will be 25,000 
young interns in similar projects across the country.
<P>
	That is where the department is headed. It is a new direction for 
Human Resources Development Canada and it is getting real 
concrete results for Canadians, for seniors, for young men and 
women, for people working hard to develop new skills for a new 
economy. It is getting results for the single mother, who for the first 
time can now get a grant to help care for her children while she 
goes to school. It is getting results for the older worker who finds a 
lifetime job taken over by technology but now has a real 
opportunity to prepare for new work and find a new job. That is 
why this bill is important.
<P>
	Over the past few years the transitional arrangements put in 
place to create the new Department of Human Resources 
Development have worked well. They have helped to put HRDC 
and our labour market and social programs on a new course. It is up 
to us to make sure the department can continue on that course. It is 
up to us to ensure the department moves forward and does so with a 
solid foundation. Bill C-96 provides that foundation. We need to 
pass the bill and get on with the work of serving Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was particularly surprised the hon. member's remarks at 
the start of his speech, when he said the bill served to consolidate 
legislation and that it had no effect on federal provincial relations.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member why, then, the Quebec minister of 
employment made the following statement: ``Bill C-96 flies in the 
face of the consensus in Quebec that the federal government should 
get completely out of labour matters and give the budgets involved 
back to Quebec''.
<P>
	I would also like the minister to tell us why the Société 
québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre passed a unanimous resolution in 
favour of the bill's withdrawal, stating that Quebec should have 
sole responsibility for workforce adaptation policies and 
occupational training within its borders and should therefore have 
the funds the federal government allocates to these programs in 
Quebec.
<P>
	I would also like the member to tell us why Ghislain Dufour, the 
spokesperson for the Conseil du patronat du Québec, known in 
Quebec for his federalist stance, said the same thing in the papers 
yesterday. According to him, if the federal government really 
wants to show its good faith in wanting the sort of change Quebec 
was seeking in the referendum, could it not, in this sector, at least 
have the decency as a federal government to correct its bill so the 
provinces could withdraw from its application, should they 
consider it relevant to do so, so that, in the end, the consensus in 
Quebec echoed by union federations, the Conseil du patronat, the 
party in power and the opposition may extend to all Quebecers? 
Why does the government not decide to give Quebec an 
opportunity to exercise its jurisdiction over manpower? Have the  
promises of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16499"> 16499 </A></B>
<P>
change made prior to October 30 already disappeared in a puff of 
smoke?
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here again we have a Bloc member, a separatist member, 
who is babbling away in true separatist fashion, in a parochial 
manner, focusing exclusively and constantly on Quebec.
<P>
	He should be talking about Canada as a whole, and considering 
how we can advance the cause of young people, single mothers, 
single parent families, and senior citizens. We are debating a bill 
providing the federal government with a structure to maintain and 
develop partnerships with the provinces and territories, 
management, labour, community groups and those involved in 
education, in order to reach common social and economic goals.
<P>
	We are talking about giving young Quebecers, since he is only 
interested in Quebec, the opportunity to find out, via computers in 
their own area or community, if there are jobs outside their own 
parish, town, or province. They are given access to the labour 
market anywhere in Canada, and mobility throughout the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member does not want to 
answer the question for a bad separatist member, could he answer 
Ghislain Dufour, spokesperson for the Conseil du patronat du 
Québec, a recognized federalist, and Gérald Ponton, president of 
the Association des manufacturiers du Québec, who is not 
identified with the sovereignist camp either? Let the member reply 
to those people if he will not give an answer here, to the Bloc 
Quebecois, or to the Quebec government. Let him reply to the 
federalist Quebecers who unanimously support Quebec's 
consensus on the repatriation of jurisdiction in the manpower 
sector.
<P>
	What is the member's answer to those people concerning 
Quebec's request that has been there on the table for five years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it funny that the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has finally admitted 
that he is a no-good separatist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I did not say ``no-good''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> I editorialized a bit; he is a separatist. I do not 
know if separatist is synonymous with no-good, but many in this 
country would say that the separatists are no good as a group but 
not necessarily as individuals.
<P>
	Do you think for a minute that I will answer questions from Bloc 
members, from people who have led the province of Quebec in all 
kinds of directions, into a muddle, who drafted a referendum 
question that got everyone confused? Thirty per cent of those who 
voted yes thought they were voting for some kind of association 
and not for separation.
<P>
	Bloc members, Quebec separatists and PQ members 
manipulated referendum scrutineers, telling them to reject ballots 
marked with an X that was too dark or not dark enough. There is an 
appalling number-this is unprecedented in Canadian 
history-except perhaps when Maurice Duplessis was in power. 
Maurice Duplessis may have come back as a Bloc member. During 
the referendum, these blockheads blocked some people's access to 
the polling stations.
<P>
	If they did not like someone's face, colour or language, they 
stopped and harassed them to prevent them from voting. Then, 
after those Canadians living in Quebec managed to cast their votes, 
they would check to see if their X was a little crooked. Those with 
shaking hands were unfortunate because their votes did not count. I 
have never seen something as outrageous as the counting of the 
votes on the night of the referendum.
<P>
	If you think I will answer quotes from a separatist-First of all, I 
would question the accuracy of his quotes and, second, I will not 
waste my time answering Bloc members.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in this debate on Bill C-96, to restructure the 
Department of Human Resources Development. I have been 
following the debate with interest ever since the minister made his 
presentation yesterday. I listened to the minister and his 
parliamentary secretary. I also listened to some speeches made by 
government members and the various questions that were asked, 
including the one put by our colleague from Parkdale-High Park.
<P>
	I draw from all of this a vision of Canada. I am not one to 
impugn motives right off the bat. I noticed that speeches were high 
quality, and a number of general principles have emerged. Of 
course, other remarks, and those made by the previous speaker are 
perhaps an example of this, remind us that mediocrity is to be 
found everywhere, even in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would like to look back over the debate, because, as I listened, I 
could perceive two visions: the standard Liberal vision and the 
Bloc Quebecois vision. I will not deal with what my hon. 
colleagues from the Reform Party said, but I think that basic issues 
were raised by the Liberals that need to be pointed out and set in the 
context of this debate.
<P>
	Basically, we are looking at the same mountain, except from 
different points of view. I think that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was sincere in his presentation. What did 
this presentation contain? First, he described a vision of Canada, 
along with the federal government's responsibilities according to 
that vision.
<P>
	I understood the minister to say that the federal government feels 
it has responsibilities regarding the development of human 
resources everywhere in Canada.  That sector includes issues 
related to manpower, employment, education, daycare and, in fact, 
any-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16500"> 16500 </A></B>
<P>
thing that directly concerns individuals, such as their families, their 
training, their education and their children.
<P>
	The minister told us that this bill merely seeks to provide a 
legislative framework for what is already being done in Canada, 
partly through the federal government's spending power, but also 
under the laws passed by this Parliament. I have seen, in my riding, 
some initiatives taken by the Department of Human Resources 
Development. I must say that, before coming here, I was not very 
familiar with the Canadian realities related to that department. I 
knew that there was an employment centre. I also knew that the 
federal government was involved in various ways, and I saw it take 
action.
<P>
	I have no criticism of the way department officials take action. 
They implement the programs. They do so with the best of 
intentions and they also try to do it efficiently. Just think of 
programs such as Article 25, the employability development 
program, and also programs such as the youth service, or the access 
to work program for women, which is designed to help women who 
do not get UI or welfare benefits find work.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	These programs reflect good intentions, as well as a clear desire 
to do the utmost. Through its initiatives, the department seeks to 
reach out to people in their everyday lives. It reaches out to 
individuals and community groups, and it signs agreements with 
municipalities. All this is currently taking place. It is being done 
and the bill before us seeks to provide a legislative framework for 
all these initiatives.
<P>
	Clause 6 clearly states that the minister's powers apply 
anywhere in Canada. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of 
the human resources of Canada-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That provision is extremely wide in scope. As for clause 20, it 
provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Minister may enter into agreements with a province or group of 
provinces, agencies of provinces, financial institutions and such other persons 
or bodies as the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, given the provisions of this bill, the minister may 
enter into agreements with anyone, so as to get involved in the 
education, manpower and employment sectors.
<P>
	If we lived in a unitarian state, that might be a solution. Although 
Canada is a very big country, it has a rather large population and it 
could be said that, because of regional characteristics, it may be 
good to have some degree of decentralization so that local needs 
are taken into account by the minister.
<P>
	But we are not in a unitarian country although a number of 
constitutional experts, considering the evolution of Canada, are not 
willing to say that we are in a federation, let alone in a 
confederation. But, in a federation, there are various levels of 
government and, ordinarily, these levels of government are 
sovereign in their jurisdiction. Canada is made up of provinces 
which, if we take a look at the Constitution, are supposed to have 
jurisdiction over education, training, over all the areas that have to 
do with Canadians as individuals, the federal government having 
kept, in 1867, jurisdiction over external trade, defence and the 
economy in general.
<P>
	If we examine the bill and the objectives of the bill, we realize 
that this legislation which is now before Parliament will give a 
federal minister the right to interfere in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. It is shocking. People of my race have found this 
shocking for years-and I use the word race in the sense of nation, 
as Mr. Duplessis did, since, moments ago, the member for 
Carleton-Gloucester reminded us of Maurice Duplessis. My 
people have always been shocked by these ways of doing things.
<P>
	For us, it is not only a question of what we could call a 
constitutional orthodoxy, according to which the federal 
government should have no say in provincial jurisdictions, but 
there is also an element of efficiency because in Quebec-other 
provinces may do what they want in this regard-there has been a 
large consensus for years now. My colleagues talked about it, 
especially the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, 
who raises the issue every time he has the floor. That consensus is 
that, for reason of efficiency, all the issues of professional training, 
manpower and employment must be Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I think that is self evident. I do not want to repeat what has 
already been said by other Bloc speakers, but nonetheless, I want to 
relate a personal experience. A few years ago, I was a career 
counsellor in the professional training centre in Jonquière, which is 
the biggest training centre in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region. At the time, we provided training in many areas: 
mechanics, plumbing, electricity, and so on. Every year we trained 
a group of students in industrial mechanics.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	At one point, a study had concluded that industrial mechanics 
was a trade with a future.
<P>
	What happened? Our school board kept offering a course in 
industrial mechanics to a group of about 20 students. The 
Government of Quebec, willing to provide training to social 
assistance recipients, commissioned the school board to train 
people in industrial mechanics-which made two groups-and the 
federal government also commissioned the school board to train 
two other groups in industrial mechanics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16501"> 16501 </A></B>
<P>
	Whereas every year we used to have one group of students in 
industrial mechanics, that year we had four groups. The school 
board, the Government of Quebec and the federal government did 
not consult with each other, everybody being busy with their own 
little policies.
<P>
	What happened? At the end of the year, instead of 20 people 
applying for a job, they were about 80. As a result, most of them 
did not find a job, which killed the industrial mechanics option in 
the area for several years.
<P>
	It is sad to see that people genuinely wanting to go back to the 
labour market were offered training for what was basically a dead 
end trade, not because studies promising jobs in that field were 
badly done, but because there had not been any consultation 
between the federal and provincial governments and the school 
board. That is what we want to avoid in Quebec.
<P>
	In Quebec, we want to have a full employment policy, the same 
type of policy they have in Austria, in some Scandinavian countries 
or even in Germany. Those full employment policies usually 
produce unemployment rates of about 6 or 7 per cent, instead of the 
12 or 13 per cent rates we have in Quebec and instead of the 15 or 
16 per cent rates we have in my area, Jonquière, or in the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area.
<P>
	That is what we want to do, but to do so, we need tools. We need 
co-ordination, but with the present practices in Canada, there is no 
co-ordination.
<P>
	This is why everyone in Quebec, whether the Quebec Liberal 
Party, the Conseil du patronat du Québec, or central labour 
bodies-with the exception of the provincial wing of the Liberal 
Party of Canada-is calling for the return of powers regarding 
manpower training and employment policies to Quebec so that the 
province can set policies to ensure that people will get useful 
training, taking the present job market into consideration, and will 
not be the victims of jurisdictional disputes or arguments between 
public servants.
<P>
	For four or five years now, the Government of Quebec, whether 
Liberal or Parti Quebecois, all governments of Quebec have been 
calling for training to be made the responsibility of the government 
of Quebec.
<P>
	And what do we see this morning in the House? Bill C-96, which 
says exactly the opposite, which says that the co-ordination will not 
be done by the Government of Quebec. This bill tells us that the 
minister will be entitled, for each community, municipality or 
province, as he wishes, to present programs, to suggest actions to 
community groups in order for them to create jobs or to propose the 
hiring of trainees to employers.
<P>
	This maintains the present policy, which is not effective. Despite 
all the good will, despite the relative success of some federal or 
provincial programs, we realize that we do not have the expected 
results when we take into account all the money invested and all the 
skills  called up in both the federal and provincial public services.
<P>
	Why is that? It is not due to ill will or lack of skill; it is simply a 
matter of organization. Things are poorly organized, and in order to 
properly organize manpower training, to properly organize 
employment policies, there must be only one decision maker.
<P>
	In Quebec, past and present governments, Liberal and PQ alike, 
unions and business owners' associations, everybody says 
unanimously that, considering the circumstances, considering the 
history, considering the needs, considering what is in place right 
now, it is the Government of Quebec that should have the 
responsibility for co-ordinating all these policies so that we can one 
day train our people properly and have a full employment policy 
that makes sense.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The bill before us means exactly the opposite. This bill says no. 
The consensus in Quebec is totally useless because a minister in 
Ottawa, the Minister of Human Resources Development, will have 
the power to develop programs and enter into agreements with 
provinces, municipalities, community groups, and individuals, 
implementing these programs in order to help Canadians get better 
training and better jobs.
<P>
	By saying ``to develop programs'', we are referring to money, 
because, in the end, it is always a matter of money. In fact, there is 
always a relation between any given program and the funds 
allocated to it by the Minister of Finance. So, a proposal is being 
made to Canadians, even in my riding, where people voted-one 
mentioned that the sovereignists were defeated in the referendum, 
but it fact they received almost 50 per cent, or 49.4 per cent. In my 
riding, however, it was 71 per cent for Quebec's sovereignty. You 
cannot ignore 71 per cent of the population. My riding came third 
in Quebec, after the riding of my colleague for Charlevoix and the 
riding of my leader, the Leader of the Opposition. This is no mean 
feat.
<P>
	In a sovereignist region like ours, people are still getting 
involved in the process, so they keep asking Quebec to fund certain 
programs and they request funding under some federal government 
programs. People know perfectly well that something must be 
done, in Quebec and Canada, as far as training and employment are 
concerned.
<P>
	People are not as partisan as some others, and in any case-I am 
not sure this is parliamentary-people are not against the federal 
government's involvement, even though they may have very 
deep-rooted sovereignist convictions. People are concerned and 
ask themselves: Will there be someone, one day, to make a decision 
and give us employment policies which are worthwhile?
<P>
	We do not see any hopeful sign coming from the government 
side. We do not see any in the area of  manpower and, as we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16502"> 16502 </A></B>
<P>
seen this week during Question Period, we do not see any hopeful 
sign either in the area of constitutional reform.
<P>
	I have the distinct impression that eventually, when the question 
is asked next time, people are going to give the answer that the 
Quebec sovereignist movement has been waiting for for so long. 
Why? In order to have effective policies and a state which is 
efficiently managed, so that its citizens get their money's worth. 
Taxpayers want effective programs. It is not by stepping on each 
others toes, as we are doing now, that we will get valid manpower 
and employment policies.
<P>
	I hope that the House will support the motion from my colleague 
from Mercier and that this bill will be sent into oblivion as quickly 
as possible.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to speak on debate, but I also want to embellish my 
fan club member from Simcoe Centre. He does well to applaud 
before because he may not applaud after he hears what I have to 
say.
<P>
	After reading the title of the bill, we realize it is just another 
piece of legislation, typically dry, typically complicated. It is easy 
in that context to lose sight of what the bill is about. Bill C-96, 
which I am happy to address for a few minutes, does just one single 
thing. It has a very simple and single purpose, and that purpose is 
integration.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	My friend from Crowfoot would understand all about 
integration. Any party that can get the member for Simcoe Centre 
and the member for Crowfoot at the same caucus table understands 
integration, I submit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to emphasize to my colleagues in the Bloc that 
this bill is about integration, and just that. It will consolidate the 
legal powers of the original departments in a single piece of 
legislation that is clear and coherent.
<P>
	This is the only goal of this bill. It does not provide new powers 
or establish new programs. It does not add anything to or take 
anything away from the powers of the human resources 
development department.
<P>
	This bill is merely an official document that puts the integration 
of social programs and labour market programs in Canada on a 
sound footing. That is important. But the underlying principle of 
this bill is even more important, that is the implementation of an 
integrated approach to human resources development in the new 
department.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I recognize that my friend from Mercier has an amendment to 
which technically we are speaking right  now. That is another 
debate. This is really about bringing together a number of functions 
that heretofore had been under the umbrella of several departments 
of government.
<P>
	I say to my friend from Port Moody-Coquitlam who spoke a 
few minutes ago in this debate that we have to make up our minds 
about what we want. I heard critics of the government at one point 
talk about duplication of effort, doing several things, the left hand 
not knowing what the right hand is doing. Then when we come up 
with what I believe is an absolutely laudable effort under Bill C-96 
to bring together some functions, so we do not have that kind of 
duplication, we are accused of just shuffling the chairs.
<P>
	It is difficult to do the right thing? No, it is not difficult to do the 
right thing, but it is difficult to be seen to be doing the right thing if 
somebody has a cliché to cover every situation, even if some of the 
clichés are mutually exclusive. Which are we doing: are we 
unnecessarily duplicating effort, or are we just shuffling the chairs?
<P>
	I listened with interest to her speech, as I did to the speech of my 
friend from Jonquière, who I always enjoy. We do not always 
agree, but he has a real ability to state his argument in a very 
reasoned way. I have always admired his ability to do so.
<P>
	I want to come back to my friend from Port Moody-Coquitlam. 
At one point in her speech she said something that was rather 
curious, about the bill's not having a royal recommendation. I 
wanted for the record to come back on that one. If she looked at the 
bill, she would realize that what she says is not true. It does have a 
royal recommendation. There are several proofs of that in the 
documentation she has in front of her. If she looked at the Order 
Paper for today, where Bill C-96 is listed, she will find a little ``R'' 
beside it. That means that this bill has a royal recommendation. If 
she does not believe my word, she should look at the bottom of the 
page, because it says at the bottom of the page ``Recommended by 
the Governor General''.
<P>
	Or if she wanted to actually look at the bill, and far be it from me 
to suggest she did not look at the bill, her own words almost 
condemn her on this point. If she had taken the time to open the 
cover to page 1A, the very first page inside, the very first thing she 
would have seen would have been ``Recommendation. His 
Excellency the Governor General recommends to the House of 
Commons'', et cetera. That is the royal recommendation she says 
the bill does not have. I can only hope that the rest of her input was 
more informed, because that one was dead wrong.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	With this bill the Department of Human Resources Development 
brings under one roof all of our efforts to help Canadians achieve 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16503"> 16503 </A></B>
<P>
their full potential in our society  and in our economy. Within a 
single department we are going to have programs and services 
under this bill that will help people who are looking for work find 
and hopefully keep jobs. It will help the employers find the people 
they need. It will provide services that will help both workers and 
employers under federal jurisdiction to maintain fair labour 
standards and a safe work environment.
<P>
	It will provide services that will help people between jobs, 
Canadian seniors, families with low incomes, and people with 
disabilities to get the income support they need. We will have under 
this umbrella department services to help people get training and to 
develop new skills for an economy that is always changing. It will 
provide services that will help local businesses and communities 
and entire industries to target the skills of the future and build a 
skilled workforce to keep Canada competitive and prosperous in a 
changing world.
<P>
	I think this integrated approach makes sense. It recognizes that 
in reality people do not neatly fall into tidy little categories. A 
young person looking for work may really need to get back to 
school first. She may also be a single mother and the lack of good 
child care support may prevent her from taking a course she needs. 
The person with a disability may be quite capable, willing, and 
eager to work, but also needs help meeting special medical costs. 
The older worker displaced by technology may need income 
support, but in the long run he or she needs help retooling and 
adapting to a new labour market.
<P>
	By bringing all the different programs these people need into one 
department we have taken the first step toward making sure the 
programs work together to provide meaningful co-ordinated 
solutions for the real world. By taking that first step we set the 
stage for real integration in the way programs and services are 
delivered to Canadians. For example, employment and UI services 
used to be delivered through Canada Employment Centres. Canada 
pension plan and old age security and guaranteed income 
supplement services, which used to come from a separate 
department, were delivered through separate client service centres. 
Now we are bringing all these together in new human resources 
centres across the country.
<P>
	Let us face it, when someone comes looking for a service they 
could not care less which particular program, branch, or 
department delivers that service. The last thing they need is to be 
sent running from one office to another to obtain those particular 
services. Combining those services in one location means reduced 
overhead, reduced administrative costs, and more importantly it 
means people getting better access, with one-stop shopping for all 
federal social security and labour market services. The ability to 
access those services under one roof on the part of the client is the 
real immediate benefit of the integration this bill provides for.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	The new service delivery network the Department of Human 
Resources Development is developing goes a bit beyond that. It 
goes well beyond that. The new network will make a new kind of 
integrated service possible, one that is more flexible and 
responsive to changing needs and circumstances. A fundamental 
goal of this approach is to ensure that integration takes place at the 
local level by locating the decision making and even the design of 
services at the local level instead of highly centralized and 
compartmentalized programs dictated from a headquarters 
somewhere.
<P>
	Ultimately each human resource centre would become an 
integral part of the community it serves. Decisions about what 
kinds of programs make sense in that community will be made in 
that community by the community. To make this work we have to 
completely rethink the way we define programs and services. We 
cannot say to communities across Canada here is a program and 
here are all the rules you have to follow, do it our way or not at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We cannot tell people: ``We will enrol you in this program even 
if you do not need it because it is the only one we can afford''.
<P>
	We want to be able to tell communities and individuals: ``Here 
are the basic tools that have proved useful. Here is the money and 
the resources that are available. It is up to you to decide which tools 
you want to use and how you can use those resources most 
effectively. You should not worry about the restrictions of the 
various programs. The only thing that matters is the task at hand''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have developed an increasingly sophisticated and effective 
set of employment programs, a set of tools to help people develop 
new skills, gain work experience, and find jobs. Our challenge is to 
integrate these two components to build a single integrated 
employment system that people can turn to not just for a cheque but 
for help to get back into the workforce. This means finding a way to 
combine that essential system of income protection provided by UI 
with an effective active system of empowerment, a system that 
gives people the resources and the opportunity to make choices 
about the kinds of jobs they need, the kinds of skills that are 
required, the kind of future they want to build for themselves.
<P>
	For example, we are experimenting with a form of internship 
with small businesses. These are companies that desperately want 
to hire new workers but cannot afford the training new workers 
require. With this program, we help them hire young people, older 
workers, women coming back into the workforce, and we provide 
some support to pay for the learning curve, the time it  takes the 
workers to become fully productive in their new jobs. That 
experiment is already beginning to show some good results. Small 
businesses are creating permanent jobs for unemployed Canadians. 
That simply would not exist otherwise.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16504"> 16504 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look at another example. Over the past year we developed 
a program for self-employment under unemployment insurance so 
that people have a choice: rather than simply collecting benefits 
and waiting for a job to come around, they can create their own 
jobs. The department provides some financial support, mentoring 
and counselling to help participants get their businesses started. 
Over the past year 30,000 individuals have started up their own 
businesses through the unemployment insurance program. They 
have created not just 30,000 jobs, but 60,000. Not only are they 
helping themselves, they are helping other unemployed Canadians 
to get back to work.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	That is the kind of thing that can happen when we stop thinking 
in terms of separate compartments and start thinking in terms of 
integration. By bringing together the full range of Canada's social 
and labour market programs, we are setting a new course and 
making a real difference in the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-96 provides the basis for this new direction. It ensures that 
the structure is in place for the federal government to continue 
bringing programs and services together, working with our partners 
in the provinces and communities across Canada.
<P>
	As we debate all of the detailed clauses of the bill, let us not 
forget what the bill is about. It is about making this kind of 
integration possible. It provides Canadians with a future which is 
full of new possibilities. That is what the bill is about.
<P>
	Implicitly the bill is not about several things. It is not about 
shuffling the chairs, as someone has said. It is about trying to 
eliminate the unnecessary duplication, unnecessary inconvenience 
for clients, Canadians across the country who demand and have a 
right to certain services from government. They demand and have a 
right to services which are provided at the least possible cost, in the 
most efficient manner and at the least inconvenience to the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	The bill brings together various functions of other departments, 
including the Department of Health, the Secretary of State, the 
former department of labour, as well as the Department of Human 
Resources Development. The bill seeks to consolidate in a manner 
which gets a bigger bang for our buck. At the same time, it is not 
meant to underline the role of the provinces, as has been suggested. 
That is another debate for another time. This is simply a bringing 
together of several functions which have always pertained to the 
federal  government and will continue to do so until some level of 
government decides otherwise.

	The House resumed, from October 17, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-317, An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code 
and the Public Service Staff Relations Act (scabs and essential 
services), be read the second time and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks with a quote by the 
present Minister for Human Resources Development who said, on 
November 23, 1994, in a letter he sent me: ``I wish to inform you 
that I am presently examining all aspects of the Canada Labour 
Code, including the issue of limiting the use of replacement 
workers, with the view to updating and improving the code to bring 
it more into line with today's realities''. We are now in November 
1995, and we still have been given notice that this overhaul of the 
Canada Labour Code would take place.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	In the meantime, a member of the Bloc proposed a private bill, 
which is before us today and which, in my opinion, makes good 
horse sense. There has been anti-scab legislation in Quebec since 
1979. We have witnessed a 35 per cent decrease in labour disputes 
in Quebec since that date. This has led to decreased tension in 
labour relations, and has avoided very awkward situations that 
would have ended in unacceptable assaults.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16505"> 16505 </A></B>
<P>
	To find out what occurred in Quebec before the adoption of 
anti-scab legislation, one need only remember the Ogilvie conflict. 
Unfortunately, this company came under the Canada Labour Code 
which contains no anti-scab provision, and that poisoned labour 
relations.
<P>
	Learning from this experience, learning from what has been 
done in Quebec in this area, it would be very important for 
Parliament as a whole to pass this anti-scab legislation at second 
reading.
<P>
	On October 17, 1995, the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said that it was not appropriate to 
amend only one aspect of the Labour Code, that it was not the best 
way to proceed, and that the whole code should be revised. I recall 
last year's statement by the minister who said that we cannot wait 
forever for the government to act, if it does not take action. I 
believe that when a member chooses as a vehicle a private 
member's bill, and proposes an amendment which could improve 
Canadian legislation, it should be taken advantage of and that he 
should be given as much leeway as possible.
<P>
	This kind of legislation, which will make it possible for all 
Canadian workers to be covered by anti-scab legislation, is 
something of a sign of respect for workers. In the past, gains were 
made by labour unions, and also by the population, in Quebec, for 
instance, where minimum working conditions are set out under 
legislation which is a bit like the collective agreement of non 
unionized workers. This is why, if we passed anti-scab legislation 
which covered federal civil servants as a whole, it would somewhat 
remedy an unacceptable situation. I think this could be compared to 
the minimum wage issue.
<P>
	A few months ago, it was because the Bloc questioned the fact 
that the minimum hourly wage within the federal government was 
still four dollars that the government reacted, a few weeks later and 
rectified the situation by order in council. This is completely 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Now we are faced with another situation in which the inaction of 
the present government and of preceding governments as well is 
perhaps more of an ideological choice. We have to remember that 
some of the members of this government voted in favour of the 
recent anti-scab legislation tabled in the House. A number of these 
people are now in cabinet, and it would be most inappropriate for 
them to vote against the present bill.
<P>
	The advantage of such a private member's bill is that it does not 
necessarily require party solidarity. It will be a recorded division. 
So we will have an opportunity to see whether those in favour of 
anti-strikebreaking legislation a few years ago, who are now 
members of Parliament, will be consistent and let Canada give 
itself legislation that-I would like to say, will set the record 
straight-will give workers governed by the Canada Labour Code 
the same rights as Quebecers.
<P>
	This is all the more important given the example we have just 
seen in Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The Government of Ontario decided to abolish this right. I 
believe that in the coming years we will witness disgraceful acts, 
bodily assaults; relations between employers and employees will 
grow more bitter and create all kinds of problems that the antiscab 
bill prevents.
<P>
	To give a concrete example of this, one or two years ago in 
Quebec, the Conseil du Patronat du Québec had a favourable 
judgement from the Superior Court which would have allowed it to 
have the antiscab legislation quashed by the Supreme Court. We 
are not talking of a union here but of the Conseil du Patronat du 
Québec. They thought preferable not to take their case to the 
Supreme Court, even if they could have won in that instance, 
because they realised, in the time it took to get that judgment, that, 
in a majority of cases, antiscab legislation contributes to better 
labour relations.
<P>
	Let us remember what happened as regards the definition of 
essential services. During the first few years, there were a few 
problems: what should be considered an essential service and who 
should define them? We used the experience we had gained so far 
to come up with the most adequate bill possible, in order to give the 
workers who come under the Canada Labour Code the opportunity 
to be properly covered and also to give the employers who are 
subject to this code the chance to enjoy better labour relations.
<P>
	With an antiscab legislation, we will not have to deal in the 
future with so many situations as the one we had with the Ogilvie 
workers.
<P>
	This is why I would ask members of this House to put their 
partisanship aside for the second reading of this bill and to 
determine if, given the way they perceive quality labour relations 
in the future, in the 20th century, it would not be better to pass this 
piece of legislation, to promote it internationally and to gain from 
Quebec's experience in that field?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too rise today to speak on Bill 
C-317, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act to prohibit the use of replacement 
employees during a legal strike and to maintain essential services 
during a work stoppage at a crown corporation or in the public 
service.
<P>
	I shall confine my remarks to those matters pertinent to the 
Canada Labour Code but I would like to say a few words about the 
Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	As members opposite may know, it was under a Liberal 
government that federal government workers gained the right to 
strike. However, it was also recognized  at that time, 1967, that the 
rights of federal government employees to strike could not be 
absolute. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16506"> 16506 </A></B>
<P>
There are health, safety and security considerations that come 
before the employees' rights to engage in job action.
<P>
	As a result, the Public Service Staff Relations Act provides for 
the right to strike but it ensures that services which are essential to 
the health, safety and security of Canadians are maintained during 
a legal work stoppage. The act does this by permitting the employer 
to designate three months prior to the notice to bargain the 
positions that cannot go on strike because they are essential to the 
health, safety and security of the Canadian public.
<P>
	In addition, the employer has no right to lock out employees 
under the provisions of the act. This approach is a reasonable one 
and it is not clear to me why the member across the way would 
want to change this.
<P>
	I read very carefully the member's speech of June 15 when he 
discussed the intent and provisions of his bill. I really must 
question some of his exaggerated comments. For instance he says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A strike broken by scabs is no strike but a right to strike hypocritically 
denied. Either we are for the right to strike, a basic right won by workers after 
many years of fighting, or we are against. If we are in favour, we will not 
undermine, either directly or indirectly, the workers' sacred right to strike-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	Surely the member would agree with me that no right is absolute, 
let alone sacred. The Canadian citizenry, employers, managers, 
entrepreneurs and employees, all know there are limits to every 
right, including the right to strike. That is only common sense. 
Even the right to free speech is not absolute. To use a famous 
example, we do not have the right to scream ``fire'' in a crowded 
theatre. So it is with the right to strike. It too must have some 
limits.
<P>
	I also note that in his speech the member referred a number of 
times to the three provinces, Quebec, Ontario and British 
Columbia, that have anti-replacement worker legislation. The 
member must be aware that as of last week only two provinces 
currently have such legislation.
<P>
	I want to draw attention to the views of a distinguished authority 
on labour relations, Mr. Paul C. Weiler. For those who do not know 
this gentleman, he is a Canadian labour lawyer who at one time 
chaired the British Columbia Labour Relations Board. Under his 
guidance the British Columbia board was responsible for 
introducing a number of progressive innovations in labour 
relations. His work has been praised by neutral observers and union 
leaders alike.
<P>
	Mr. Weiler is now teaching labour law at Harvard University. 
Recently he served as chief counsel to the U.S. Commission on the 
Future of Worker-Management Relations. I am saying all this 
because I want to quote Mr. Weiler who wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For employees who may have spent 20 years with a company building up a 
wealth of experience and seniority that can rarely be duplicated elsewhere, the 
stark reality is that if they do go on strike, they can be replaced by the company 
with people who, in less than 20 minutes on the job, gain permanent priority 
over the striking veterans.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clearly the American practice is unacceptable, but while Mr. 
Weiler is strongly against the hiring of permanent replacement 
workers, he does not favour the Quebec solution. He speaks about 
this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The type of alternative rule that I favour exists already in Ontario labour law, 
which grants lawful strikers a right to return to their jobs for a period of up to six 
months after the beginning of the work stoppage, even if their return will 
dislodge newly hired replacements.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He states unequivocally that he does not ``favour adoption of the 
recent response of Quebec labour law to this problem'' whereby the 
government ``effectively requires employers to shut down at least 
the bulk of their operations because they are legally prohibited 
from using any non-managerial personnel to replace strikers''.
<P>
	I am not saying that I agree with everything Mr. Weiler has said, 
but I do think that the issue is not clear. If this highly regarded 
expert in industrial relations, as strong a supporter of the collective 
bargaining process as we will find anywhere, does not favour a ban 
on the use of replacements, then I as a federal member concerned 
with the interests of the country as a whole must proceed cautiously 
and thoughtfully on this question and be open to the arguments and 
concerns of both sides.
<P>
	Labour law is about balance among other things. We need to 
balance the rights of workers with the rights of employers. We need 
to balance equity concerns with growth concerns. As national 
legislators we must be interested in policies that increase 
democracy at work and give greater protection to workers and in 
policies that encourage the efficient management of enterprises. 
We must also be sure that we know the priorities of the workers.
<P>
	There are a number of issues of concern to workers on matters 
related to labour standards, occupational safety and health, 
employment equity and industrial relations. These issues are best 
dealt with through the consultation process involved in a 
comprehensive and careful review of the federal labour code.
<P>
	The member across the way I am sure knows that such a review 
is presently under way in the House. It is a timely undertaking since 
a complete review of part I of the Canada Labour Code has not 
been done in over two decades.
<P>

	Since last winter federal government officials have been having 
discussions with labour, management, academics and others. The

<P>
Laval University, and Paula Knopf, a Toronto based mediator, are 
the other members of this task force.
<P>
	The task force is mandated to look into a number of critical 
labour relations issues including those raised by the member in his 
bill. I have considerable confidence in the task force and I might 
add in the Commission of Inquiry on Labour Relations at West 
Coast Ports. Both are comprised of very knowledgeable, dedicated 
and highly regarded experts who I am sure will have important 
things to say on labour relations.
<P>
	I agree with those who argue that once we have had a chance to 
study and discuss the findings and analyses and the 
recommendations of these two groups, we will be in a much better 
position to decide on the questions that concern the member and 
indeed all of us in this House.
<P>
	I want to make one point before I conclude. The review of the 
Canada Labour Code is taking place while the Canadian workforce 
is in the midst of profound transformation. We need to take account 
of new computer technology among other factors transforming our 
workplace. The emphasis is now on flattened hierarchies, 
decentralized decision making, flexible production systems, work 
teams, high quality products and services and continuous learning.
<P>
	Labour has generally not shown opposition to technological 
change. However, with the pressures which come to bear on us as 
Canadian legislators it is important and fortunate for us to have this 
discussion in the House.
<P>
	It seems to me that because this change is occurring, reform to 
the federal law should be studied very carefully. We would not be 
doing anyone any favours by acting in an imprudent and 
precipitous manner.
<P>
	Whatever the merits of the member's bill, those who have been 
telling the member to wait until the court review is completed are 
right. It seems to me to be common sense that we wait on those 
results.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a delight to 
enter into the debate on Bill C-317, a bill that would cause certain 
amendments to be made to the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	I will preface my statements by saying that the hon. member who 
has proposed this bill and its amendments to the code has a very 
good motivation in standing up to try to defend the workers. This 
country is very dependent upon its labour force in order to continue 
to enjoy our high standard of living. The bill is certainly in the best 
interests not only of the workers but also of the companies 
involved, the organizations, the rest of Canadians and customers 
both in Canada and around the world. They benefit from Canadian 
products if the workforce is very well organized and works 
efficiently and smoothly.
<P>
	What is being addressed here is the problem of a dispute. What 
happens when the firm that employs the labourers and the labourers 
cannot reach an agreement? Sometimes these disputes are over 
wages. Members will agree that there have been occasions where 
employers have been unfair to workers with respect to wages. Even 
more important, there have been a number of occasions where the 
workers' safety is at risk and the employer is unwilling to spend the 
money or to take the necessary measures to protect the safety of the 
workers.
<P>
	Bill C-317 proposes that if any of these disputes regardless of 
their origin result in a strike, then as that strike is a hard won right 
of the workers, it should not be reduced or eliminated by the hiring 
of replacement workers. To me, that is indeed one of the solutions. 
If we are going to provide that workers cannot be replaced, that 
indeed considerably strengthens the bargaining position of the 
workers in areas of dispute.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	However, we need to ask whether this is the best way of solving 
the problem. I propose that it is not. While we are saying the 
worker is having his hamburger taken away from him, what this 
bill proposes is to simply give him ketchup on the hamburger. What 
I would like to propose is that we offer that worker a good Alberta 
steak instead.
<P>
	What am I talking about? I am talking about ways of dispute 
resolution. Having worked in this area for a number of years as a 
representative of people who were employees in a professional 
association, which to a degree is a euphemism for a union, because 
we did collective bargaining, I believe very strongly that the very 
worst way of dispute resolution is that of the strike, because no one 
wins in a strike. When there is a strike and business is shut down, or 
in my case the educational institution is shut down, the students, 
the employees, the instructors, and all of the other employees in the 
work suffer because of a loss of wages during the time of the strike.
<P>
	In the case of industry across this country, not only our own 
domestic customers suffer but our customers around the world 
suffer when our businesses are put on strike or when our 
transportation systems fail because of strike or our 
communications systems are brought down to their knees because 
the employees refuse to work and no one else is ready and 
permitted to work in this area.
<P>
	What then is the solution? If it is not a strike, what can be done? 
There are many, many other areas of disputes in which we do not 
resort to strike. For example, if there is a dispute between one of us 
and our neighbour as to where the boundary should be, we do not 
proceed to put something in front of their driveway so they cannot 
get out of the house in the morning. That would not be an 
acceptable way of solving that problem. Instead, we go to the 
authorities. We may get surveyors in to make sure the boundaries 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16508"> 16508 </A></B>
<P>
are clearly marked. When that is done and if  your neighbour still 
does not agree to it, then we may go to a court of law.
<P>
	I propose, and I have experience in this and it works very well, 
that what we need to do in the case of a dispute between employees 
and employers is to have an orderly mechanism that works to solve 
this problem, so that the workers, the employers, all of the 
customers, all of the citizens, and indeed our reputation around the 
world for timely delivery of goods and services can be maintained. 
It would help us in the long run because of the reliability that would 
be automatically assumed when people around the world place 
customer orders with Canadian firms.
<P>
	I am proposing that we should be using a dispute mechanism that 
involves some sort of a hearing, a court, an arbitrator, something 
that is final and binding.
<P>
	I would like to tell you that I have had first-hand experience with 
this. I had the honour of being chosen by my fellow instructors, 
way back in 1982, to be the founding president of our staff 
association. I had considerable input. It was not a one-man show by 
any means, but I had considerable input into the formulation of our 
first collective agreement, which then became the pattern for all 
subsequent agreements at the Northern Alberta Institute of 
Technology, where I worked. Indeed, many of the items in that 
contract persist to this day. And one of the things I pressed for very 
strongly was that we would immediately bargain away our right to 
strike.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	We built into our contract and the constitution of our association 
a mechanism that provided for a dispute resolution with time lines. 
So many days prior to the expiration of the contract we had to give 
notice of our desire to enter into negotiations, and if we did not the 
employer might. If neither of us did, that was a tacit understanding 
that we would carry on with the current agreement. After so many 
days of that happening we had to have negotiators in place. After so 
many days we had to lay our opening positions on the table. After 
so many days if an agreement had not been reached we had to name 
an arbitrator. And so it went. It was all set up in such a way that 
prior to the expiry of a contract the new contract would be in place 
by one means or another.
<P>
	A very important problem developed. With that contract we had 
an excellent mechanism and did not have any strikes or work 
stoppages. Unfortunately the Government of Alberta played its 
hand. I need to say this because there are dangers in this type of a 
system. When we went to the arbitration system the government 
passed a law that stated that in the case of an arbitration the 
arbitrator must take into account the policy of the government. 
Unfortunately the government was our employer. We were in the 
situation of being in the boxing ring and our opponent happened to 
also be the referee, which made it very difficult to get fair 
settlements from then on.
<P>
	If the mechanism is truly independent of any pressure from 
either party so that there can be a really justified way of reducing 
the problem and dispute to a resolution, that is by far the best way.
<P>
	In conclusion, if we are not going to go for things like final 
position bargaining or arbitration as the method of solving labour 
disputes, we will continue with these very wasteful and hurtful 
strikes. Instead of supporting this bill, which would only strengthen 
the dispute mechanism of striking and fighting with each other, I 
would like to propose the opposite: that we move toward a more 
rational system of dispute resolution, which would benefit us all.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am highly tempted to dedicate this speech to the 
government whip, but I will resist the urge.
<P>
	It might a good idea to remind everyone of what this bill is all 
about. Thanks are due to the member for Manicouagan for having 
introduced this private member's bill, the purpose of which is to 
prohibit the hiring of persons to replace employees of an employer 
under the Canada Labour Code or of the Public Service who are on 
strike or locked out.
<P>
	Why did I insist on reading the purpose of this bill word for 
word? Because the bill under consideration is a logical follow-up to 
rights workers presently have, the right to unionize, the right to 
strike. What surprises me, in the statements I heard from the 
government majority as well as from the Reform Party, is that they 
claimed that providing anti-scab mechanisms would hinder any 
attempt at mediation prior to a strike.
<P>
	Members will agree that, in a labour organisation, a strike is a 
final step and it is defined as such by the legislator. No 
parliamentarian wishes to see strikes become a spontaneous 
solution in the workplace. Everybody agrees on the fact that any 
group that goes on strike was forced to do so by circumstances. 
Adopting antiscab legislation does not spare us the previous steps.
<P>
	I cannot see why government members as well as our Reform 
Party colleagues have presented this bill as a rather sorry mess 
without going into this kind of nuance that we feel is very 
significant. Worse still, the parliamentary secretary to the Prime 
Minister-whom I usually respect and will continue to respect as 
long as you are in the Chair-argued that this measure was put 
forward by the Conservatives in Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	First, you will allow me, Mr. Speaker, to ask the parliamentary 
secretary not to quote that government too often. I do not think that 
government should serve as reference to the government majority 
unless, as we suspected, blue or red in Ottawa amounts exactly to 
the same thing and that no distinction has to be established.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16509"> 16509 </A></B>
<P>
	Until very recently, three provinces making up 70 per cent of 
the labour force were protected by antiscab provisions. What did 
this have as a concrete effect? Two things. As we have said on 
several occasions an antiscab legislation brings an element of 
civility, of courtesy to a power relationship that could be tempted 
to break negotiations. That is the first thing.
<P>
	What very concrete effect does this have? When we look at the 
specialized literature on the subject, we learn, and that has been a 
powerful argument raised by the member for Manicouagan, that in 
provinces where there are laws such as this one, labour disputes do 
not last as long. I think this is an objective which must be 
supported.
<P>
	It is not the first time that we have a legislation such as this one. 
In its time, the NDP suggested a similar provision. The member for 
Richelieu did so in a more recent past. Yet, no agreement was 
achieved, they were not successful in ensuring that a provision, 
without being insignificant, would be a tool for the legislator, a tool 
for those who are concerned with labour relations and a tool for the 
management of human resources.
<P>
	What do we say when we are in favour of a provision such as this 
one? We say that, a few years ago, as a society, the people of 
Quebec and Canada democratically voted for a recourse, and that is 
the right to strike. Admittedly, this is a last resort. A strike is never 
fun for the union, the workers or the employer, because this has to 
do with carrying out work.
<P>
	When there is a work stoppage, we can all agree that, 
unavoidably, the economy in general is affected. This kind of 
situation is not desirable. Once it has been democratically 
recognized by a society-and you will recall that, around the time 
when discussions started, people used to say, even in the public 
service, before there was a legal right to strike: ``The Queen does 
not negotiate with her subjects''. I am sure that those of us who are 
older will remember. For me, this is history, but some were there 
when all this was happening.
<P>
	Once the choice has been democratically made to give workers 
the right to strike, we, as legislators, have the duty and 
responsibility to ensure that strikes are carried out with civility and 
without violence.
<P>
	When you have workers who get up every morning to earn a 
living, who must go on strike for various reasons including 
improved standards and better salaries, and who see their jobs 
threatened by scabs doing their work, you end up with a potentially 
explosive situation.
<P>
	As even the political neophytes among us know, without 
antiscab legislation all long term strikes involved violence.
<P>
	We as legislators-and I am sure my colleagues across the way 
will agree-have a responsibility to ensure that the people who 
exercice their right to strike, a right that is recognized and well 
defined, can do so in the right conditions.
<P>
	I did not quite understand the comments made by the previous 
speaker, who, as we know, is rather easy to get along with. He 
seemed to be saying that they would rather try to use existing 
mechanisms. That goes without saying.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the hon. member for Manicouagan, wise man and 
experienced parliamentarian that he is, provided in the legislation a 
sound instrument known as an essential services board. This is to 
say that, even in cases where the final step a strike is taken, it will 
be recognized that nobody can be taken hostage because a 
democratic right is used, and that certain conditions have to be met, 
a notice has to be given and essential services have to be 
maintained.
<P>
	Where have all the true Liberals gone? People on the other 
side-the government whip among them-tell us that they are 
Liberal in the noble, true and historical sense of the word. They tell 
us they are Liberals. To be a Liberal, to be a liberal, is to recognize 
a number of rights in a very clear context.
<P>
	What are they afraid of? I would like to ask them, through you, 
why they are afraid of such a bill. Is it because workers will be able 
to exercise their democratic right to go out on strike? If this 
legislation is not passed on the pretext that it is incomplete, this 
will bring us back to a dramatic truth about this Parliament, which 
is that our labour minister is a time shared minister, a part time 
minister. A full time minister would have had taken her 
responsibilities. Since it came into office two years ago, this 
government has had ample time and opportunity to introduce a 
major revision of the Labour Code.
<P>
	We have a part time minister, and the government whip will 
agree that this is why we are in a deplorable situation where the 
Labour Code has not undergone a major overhaul.
<P>
	This is a balanced and democratic bill. It reflects values that are 
widely recognized in our society.
<P>
	If the government majority went so far as to oppose this bill, I 
am sure that the price it would have to pay would be extremely 
high, both in Quebec and elsewhere, because workers under federal 
jurisdiction have the right to be legally protected against the 
possible use of scabs.
<P>
	You are indicating to me that my time is up. My colleagues will 
be disappointed, but I will use this last opportunity to urge them to 
adopt such a bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Manicouagan, who presented this motion to the House, has 
indicated to the Chair that he would like, if possible, with consent 
of the House, to take two minutes to close the debate. But I want it 
to be clearly understood that after the House gives its consent, the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16510"> 16510 </A></B>
<P>
member will speak to close the debate, which means that nobody 
else  will be able to speak after that even if there is some time left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to thank, naturally, all those from each party, who 
made the effort to speak, to express their personal opinions and that 
of their party.
<P>
	I am sure we have made progress, ideologically speaking, in 
many areas. We have also had the opportunity to understand 
somewhat better the more radical positions of certain other 
individuals and certain other parties.
<P>
	I heard certain key words, like ``wait''. This bill is a bit too early, 
we have to wait for the upcoming reform. I say that, if we have to 
wait, why not wait for third reading on this? It might perhaps 
provide an opportunity for the Code to get out in the meantime. 
This business about waiting, you know, it is not our fault if we are 
ahead. We are what we are in the Bloc.
<P>
	Bill C-317 provides a good opportunity for social advancement 
and for respect of those who keep the economy moving, that is, the 
workers, and the employers too, because Bill C-317 has the highest 
regard for employers, as it indicates.
<P>
	I would simply like, at this point, to repeat my thanks to all those 
who felt it was worthwhile taking part.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank all the hon. 
members for their co-operation. Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the yeas have 
it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to the order made 
earlier today, the recorded division on the proposed motion stands 
deferred until Tuesday, November 21, 1995, after government 
orders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being after 2.30 p.m. the House stands adjourned until 
Monday, November 20, at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Orders 28 
and 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.41 p.m.)
