<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-18, an act to suspend the 
operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, be concurred in with 
the exception of amendment 1 in clause 2 to which this House proposes the 
following amendment:</BLOCKQUOTE>
Strike out ``the sixth day of February'' and substitute ``June 22''.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And that a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint Their Honours 
therewith.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, in proposing the motion I wish to 
take the opportunity to reaffirm the government's intention and 
desire to have in place an impartial readjustment of electoral 
boundaries based on the 1991 census for any election to be held 
at the end of a normal life of a Parliament with a majority 
government. I am speaking of an election in 1997 or 1998.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	We think the original timetable proposed in Bill C-18 would 
have permitted this to happen. Bill C-18 proposed a two-year 
suspension of the process while the entire process was itself 
being reviewed by a parliamentary committee. We did not 
consider this to be a minimum time for such a review but a 
maximum time setting an outside limit for completing the 
review and passing the necessary legislation.
<P>
	By order of the House, the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs has been instructed to bring in legislation to 
update this process, with an ultimate deadline for a report for 
this purpose of December 16, 1994. This is the date when the 
House is scheduled to  begin its winter adjournment which, 
under the rules of the House, ends on February 6, 1995.
<P>
	It would be only after that date that the rest of the legislative 
process on any bill would be undertaken. I am speaking of a 
further committee stage, report stage and third reading in the 
House. Then there would have to be consideration in the Senate.
<P>
	It was our opinion, given the always unpredictable nature of 
demands on parliamentary time, that a two-year timetable for 
new legislation was not unreasonable even though, as I said, we 
regarded this not as a minimum but a maximum time.
<P>
	It has since become clear, however, that there is some 
considerable concern in parts of the country that this maximum 
would become a minimum and therefore that the provision for a 
two-year suspension appeared to make it impossible for an 
election in 1997 or 1998 to be held on the basis of new 
boundaries.
<P>
	The amendments proposed by the Senate do attempt to 
address this concern. The amendments in effect would provide 
that the suspension of the process would last only until February 
6, 1995, and if no change to the process were legislated by that 
date the existing process would automatically be resumed where 
it left off.
<P>
	It is the government's intention to reassure the public of our 
desire that a general election taking place at the end of the 
normal term of the present Parliament be held on the basis of the 
1991 census. Therefore we are prepared to accept the Senate 
formulation except on one point, and that is we do not view the 
date of February 6, 1995 as being appropriate or realistic.
<P>
	As I have said, this date does not recognize the timetable 
already ordered by the House for the preparation of new 
legislation on this matter. It does not recognize the provisions of 
the rules of the House for an adjournment between December 
16, 1994 and February 6, 1995. It represents, it could be said, an 
inappropriate involvement by the Senate in the right of the 
House of Commons to set its own agenda. After all, the House 
ordered on April 19 that a committee prepare legislation no later 
than December 16 of this year, the date on which as I have said 
under the rules of the House we will be adjourning until 
February 6.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4812"> 4812 </A></B>
<P>
	It must be emphasized that it is already the stated intention of 
the House of Commons, expressed by its order, not just the 
intention of the government, to have the procedure committee 
bring in legislation to reform and update the process of 
redistribution.
<P>
	There are many areas the committee will likely want to 
consider. Some have been raised already when the bill was 
before the House at earlier stages of debate. I am sure they will 
be discussed again in detail in the committee hearings and when 
the committee reports. However today I do not intend to 
anticipate what may be in the report or presume to suggest what 
the committee may have in the report in question.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	I intend to conclude by saying that the government concurs in 
the Senate amendments but asks for one amendment to them, 
that is that the legislation have a more realistic timetable in it for 
the completion of the review, a June 22, 1995 date rather than a 
February 6, 1995 date.
<P>
	Therefore the government asks the House to accept the Senate 
amendments subject to the amendment I have put forward to 
create a more realistic timetable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Madam Speaker, we find ourselves in a rather unique situation 
this morning. Only a few months ago, the government 
introduced a bill in this House to delay the electoral boundaries 
adjustment process. Bill C-18 called for a two-year 
postponement of the boundaries review process and for the 
dismantling of commissions responsible for travelling across 
Canada to hear the views of citizens about the redrawing of their 
riding's boundaries.
<P>
	The arguments which were put forward by government 
representatives, by Liberal Party members, and which were 
supported by the official opposition were based on two points: 
first, since the members of the 35th Parliament were elected on 
October 25, 1993, the next elections would not, in all likelihood, 
be held until sometime in 1997 or 1998.
<P>
	Therefore, there was no rush to redraw electoral boundaries. 
During the debate, the government said it could take all the time 
it needed to ensure that certain criteria were taken into account 
during this process, criteria such as the number of voters, of 
course, and also attachment to a particular region. Therefore, let 
me say again that the government, supported by the official 
opposition, agreed to vote in favour of this bill to postpone the 
process for the next two years.
<P>
	A few weeks later, the leader of the Conservative Party and 
the hon. member for Sherbrooke, a great democrat if ever there 
was one, joined forces with the Conservative majority in the 
Senate and together, they decided to take on the mantle of 
defenders of democracy. They decided  to propose some 
amendments to Bill C-18, claiming, I say again, to be the 
defenders of democracy.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Let me point out several inconsistencies in this position. 
During the last election campaign, the member for Sherbrooke 
and leader of the Conservative Party, at least what remains of it, 
claimed in his ads running several times a day in Quebec that to 
be effective in the House of Commons, one needed to be part of 
the government.
<P>
	The hon. member for Sherbrooke and leader of the 
Conservative Party argued, unlike the Bloc Quebecois 
candidates, that the real power was not in opposition, but on the 
government side because, to his mind, that is where decisions 
about the running of the country were made, not in the 
opposition ranks.
<P>
	The member for Sherbrooke and leader of the Conservative 
Party also said that the opposition operates behind the scenes 
and that opposition members have no real power in the House of 
Commons. This was what the leader of the Conservative Party 
and member for Sherbrooke claimed and this debate is eloquent 
proof indeed of what he meant.
<P>
	Since he views the role of the opposition as that of lobbyists, 
like he indicated during the election campaign, he immediately 
set to work, hardly ever participating in the regular business of 
the House, preferring to lobby senators into embarrassing the 
government. I do not mean to ascribe intentions to him, but he 
may have had in mind the days when, with a Liberal majority, 
the Senate manoeuvred to create difficulties for the 
Conservative government in passing significant legislation like 
the GST or free trade. We all remember those days.
<P>
	But the Senate is now comprised mostly of Conservative 
senators, although it may be more appropriate to call it purple 
than blue, because several of these senators side now with the 
Liberals, now with the Conservatives. If you mix blue and red, 
you get purple.
<P>
	The leader of the Conservative Party and member for 
Sherbrooke, no doubt a fervent defender of democracy, 
persuaded the Conservative senators that amendments had to be 
made to Bill C-18 to ensure that the Upper House could impose 
its agenda on the government.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The inconsistency is striking here. During the election 
campaign, the Conservative leader said that the real power was 
on the side of the government. Yet, the first thing he did in 
opposition, aside from not attending any of the debates in this 
House, was precisely to get busy in the wings, to use the Senate, 
and its Conservative majority, to interfere with the intentions of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4813"> 4813 </A></B>
<P>
the government and the House of Commons. In my mind, that is 
miscarriage of democracy.
<P>
	Now that masks have been shed, we can see what the 
Conservative leader and member for Sherbrooke is really after. 
Amazingly, the Liberal government goes along with him. We 
really need to be clear on what is going on. I will come back in a 
moment to the role of the Senate. When Bill C-18 was 
introduced in this House, as the Solicitor General said just a 
moment ago, both the government and the Official Opposition 
intended to ensure time was taken to do serious work on this bill, 
instead of proceeding hastily at the risk of finding ourselves in 
impossible situations later on.
<P>
	Several government members and several members of the 
Official Opposition spoke in this debate to explain the tragic, 
disastrous effects the changes proposed by the electoral 
boundaries readjustment commission will have on people's 
lives. I for one described the problems affecting my riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead in this House. The 
commission planned to literally turn the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead upside down in the most 
incredibly thoughtless fashion, attaching one part of the riding 
to another riding with which it had no ties, either sociologically 
or in terms of business communications, and also 
communications between constituents and their elected 
representatives, or in terms their dealings with the government.
<P>
	Many examples were given. I would say that just about every 
hon. member spoke of adverse effects the proposed changes 
would have on their ridings. Never, on the side of the Official 
Opposition, did we want or intend to interfere with the electoral 
boundaries readjustment process by preventing the commission 
from making any changes before the next election.
<P>
	We said that this two-year timeframe-as, may I remind you, 
the Solicitor General just reiterated-can be seen as the 
maximum amount of time needed to make intelligent changes, 
to take into account the number of voters per riding and to 
ensure that in the next election campaign-in which we in the 
Official Opposition do not wish to participate-riding 
redistribution will be based on data from the 1991 census rather 
than the 1981 census.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Everyone agreed. And everyone still agrees today that we 
have all the time we need to ensure that intelligent public 
hearings will be held in Quebec and throughout Canada, that the 
proposed amendments will be tabled in this House, and that a 
bill can be passed in time for these changes to be in place before 
the next election.
<P>
	I want to look at an argument that was used not only by 
columnists and Liberal Party faithful during their last 
convention but also by our friends from the Reform Party and 
others, namely that delaying the process would forestall any 
changes and that we in the Official Opposition act as though we 
do not want to take the number criterion into account. We do 
think that this criterion is important. There must be a kind of 
balance,  of equity in the demographic weight of the various 
ridings.
<P>
	That is not the only criterion to be considered, however. That 
is another reason why we in the Official Opposition support 
postponing the review process. We wanted to ask the House 
committee to review these criteria and we will do so in a few 
weeks. At the beginning of July, hearings will be held by the 
parliamentary committee to review the criteria used by the 
commission to redraw the electoral map.
<P>
	Agreeing to review these criteria is one more argument in 
favour of deferring the process. If we accept the fact that the 
current redistribution criteria must be revised, we should, I 
think, immediately admit that we must suspend the review 
process, wait for the decisions on these new criteria and then go 
out and consult the people throughout Quebec and Canada, to 
ensure that the proposed changes respect the will of the people 
and the new criteria that will be adopted.
<P>
	After hearing the government position that the Solicitor 
General has just outlined, we must come to the conclusion that, 
under pressure from the senators and from Liberal militants at 
their last convention, the government has decided to go back on 
its word and to ensure that the process will be shorter than the 
two years set out in Bill C-18. Strangely, as I mentioned earlier, 
it shows that the process initiated by the leader of the 
Conservative Party was right. We must keep this in mind. 
Madam Speaker, this means that the leader of the Conservative 
Party, with a caucus of two members in this House, is the one 
leading the government. Our friends opposite must realize that 
they are being led by the leader of a party that has almost no 
members left in this House. Is that democracy? I doubt it. I see 
democracy differently.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	We must also realize that this political game, because that is 
what it is, is supported by individuals who were never elected 
anywhere, and I refer to the senators. As we know, they are 
appointed by the government for all sorts of reasons, but 
especially for their political connections. It has been well known 
for a long time. Since our institutions were created, the senators' 
role has been to look after very important issues on occasion, I 
agree, but more often than not, to look after the affairs of their 
party, be it Conservative or Liberal.
<P>
	The unelected senators are teaching a lesson in democracy to 
us, members of Parliament who have been democratically 
elected by all the voters in our ridings. So what legitimacy does 
the Senate have to act in an issue like this? It is totally 
ridiculous. Just being here in the House today dealing with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4814"> 4814 </A></B>
<P>
Senate amendments on the redrawing of electoral boundaries, 
which lies at the very heart of our democratic system, is absurd.
<P>
	Unelected senators, some of whom are there simply to ensure 
that the traditional parties have enough money in their election 
fund, are telling us elected members: ``You did your job badly. 
You are undemocratic. You do not represent the will of the 
people and we in our ivory tower know what the people need. We 
know what you must do and we are imposing it on you''.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I just cannot get over it. We must remember 
this date, June 3, 1994, when unelected people were able to 
impose their agenda on the government which was elected 
barely six months ago. I would also like to point out that for 
many years, Quebec has been represented in the House of 
Commons in proportion to its share of the population; that is, 
about 25 per cent of the members of the House of Commons 
come from Quebec, which is the same as Quebec's share of the 
population.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Among the changes proposed by the commission, a certain 
number of ridings are to be added. In fact, two ridings would be 
added in British Columbia and four in Ontario, for a total of six, 
raising the number of members sitting in the House of Commons 
from 295 to 301. For one thing, this would lower Quebec's share 
of the representation in this House and of course, something not 
to be overlooked, it would increase government spending, 
because six more members would cost the taxpayers of Canada 
and Quebec more money.
<P>
	We must send a clear message since Bill C-18, as was also 
agreed during the negotiations surrounding Meech, protects 
Quebec's relative weight, that is a representation equivalent to 
25 per cent of the total in the House of Commons. In our future 
decisions, we should always keep in mind-and I say this for the 
benefit of government and Reform Party members-that 
Quebecers represent approximately one quarter of the Canadian 
population. As long as Quebec remains part of Canada, this 
proportion should be reflected here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	As for the addition of new members, we are not in a position 
right now to increase government spending. Everyone in the 
House agrees on that. I think the government, the Official 
Opposition and the Reform Party are unanimous to say that, at 
least, government spending should not increase. We, as well as 
our friends from the Reform Party, even hope for a review of all 
expenditures and budget items, in an effort to reduce 
government spending.
<P>
	So, why create new jobs for additional MPs? I think there are 
more important issues to solve than to find jobs in this House for 
a few more individuals. During the election campaign, the Prime 
Minister used to say, and he still says, that the Liberals' main 
priority was jobs, jobs, and jobs. I do hope that what he had in 
mind was not to create jobs here in this House but, rather, in 
ridings across Canada, where people suffer from the current 
economic situation.
<P>
	Again, this issue does not require urgent action. To delay the 
process for 24 months, as was originally proposed, does not, as 
far as we are concerned, jeopardize in any way the review 
process which will have to take place before the next election.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	In 24 months means early 1996, unless the Prime Minister, 
after deciding that he can no longer run the country, is anxious to 
yield to the Conservative leader and chooses to act quickly, 
which I think is unlikely, so we can expect an election to be held 
in the fall of 1997 or even in 1998, which leaves us enough time 
to readjust electoral boundaries.
<P>
	Another point is that there is absolutely no reason why we 
should increase the number of members in this House. None at 
all. There is no objection to readjusting electoral boundaries to 
ensure that the voter population is more evenly distributed. But 
there is no justification at all for increasing the number of 
members in this House.
<P>
	Clarity is of the essence. The government must send a clear 
signal to the public that its objective is not to create jobs here, at 
taxpayers' expense, but jobs out there for the unemployed who 
are waiting for answers from the government.
<P>
	I also want to point out that the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Commission has continued its work, which 
consists in conducting public hearings across the country to 
listen to what individuals and groups have to say about the 
proposed amendments. My point is that the Commission, 
despite the very clear message sent by the government when it 
tabled C-18 in this House, could not care less about the 
government's plans and that is why it has proceeded to conduct 
hearings across Canada, or at least in Quebec.
<P>
	What impact will this have on the readjustment process? As 
soon as those concerned, including the municipal authorities in 
our electoral districts, realized that the government intended to 
postpone the electoral boundaries readjustment process for two 
years, people thought it was not worth appearing before the 
commission to make their presentations. They said to 
themselves: They will have to come back later, so we will go as 
soon as there is an official process duly approved by the 
government.
<P>
	The commission simply ignored the government's plans. As 
the Solicitor General said a moment ago, the commission is a 
quasi-judicial body that can make decisions as it sees fit, and so 
it decided to go ahead anyway. As a result, in many locations, in 
the Eastern Townships for instance, only three groups appeared 
before the commission, while dozens of groups and 
municipalities would have done so if there had been a clearly 
established and clearly identified process.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4815"> 4815 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The same happened in the Lower St. Lawrence district and 
other regions in Quebec, where many citizens and 
representatives of local authorities, especially municipalities, 
decided against appearing before the commission because they 
realized the process would be repeated in a year and a half or two 
years.
<P>
	If we approve the amendments before the House, the 
commission's work will not be terminated but merely suspended 
for five or six months, after which, the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Commission will resume its work. Does this mean 
that where public hearings were held, the commission will not 
go back to listen to members of the public and representatives of 
our municipalities? If so, there would be some justification for 
wondering whether the process is democratic.
<P>
	That is why the commission, which was aware of the 
government's plans when the bill was tabled, should have 
stopped the process including the hearings, and waited until the 
government decided whether or not to extend the process. This 
is one more reason for repeating the entire process. Therefore, 
we should wait for the results regarding the criteria to be used by 
the commissions.
<P>
	I said earlier, and other members also mentioned it, that the 
number of voters is one of the criteria, but there are others which 
should be taken into consideration. We should not forget the 
weight of regions within a province; we have to be careful not to 
strip regions of their representation because their young people, 
unable to find jobs in their area, had to move out, hopefully to a 
job in Montreal or maybe to join the ranks of those unemployed 
or on welfare in Montreal, Quebec City or elsewhere.
<P>
	We have to devise criteria which do not jeopardize the future 
of these regions. We should take the time to think and to discuss 
the process, so as to be on solid ground when we finally launch 
the operation.
<P>
	Second, when the readjustment process resumes, the 
government has to make sure that the commission's work is 
reviewed, and give private citizens and interest groups every 
opportunity to make their views known about the readjustments.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	For all these reasons, and in keeping with our stated views as 
Official Opposition, we would like to see the schedule which 
was in Bill C-18 adhered to, while assuring the House, and 
indeed the people of Quebec and Canada, that what we are 
seeking is a readjustment which will apply to the next federal 
elections to be held in 1997-1998 and which will be based on 
sound criteria.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
speech by the member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead will 
not stand as a model of rigor.
<P>
	In his speech, he mentioned something I must object to since I 
am directly concerned. He referred to the fact that I was not 
present in the House. There is no need to remind you of the very 
well known rule which prohibits a member from referring to the 
presence or the absence of another member. And I would add, if 
only the parliamentary secretary could keep quiet for a few 
seconds, that this remark is particularly obnoxious for the 
following reason: the Bloc did all it could to prevent the 11 
independent members from speaking in the House. It is 
extremely hypocritical on its part to then rise in the House and 
claim that we were absent during the debate, when it did nothing 
at all to promote a fundamental element of democracy. After all, 
we represent more voters than it does.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry for 
interrupting, but we were about to start a debate. I was aware of 
the comments by the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. I believe it was a slip of the 
tongue and I shall ask him to withdraw.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure whether this is a point of order or 
a question of privilege, or if the member for Sherbrooke was 
looking for an opportunity to speak in the House. I will concede 
that he is right in his application of the Standing Orders. I have 
no problem acknowledging it, but I will point out that, during 
the election campaign, the member for Sherbrooke was 
constantly denouncing the Bloc members' absence.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order! It is also a matter 
of debate. Resuming debate. The hon. member for Calgary West.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
rising today to speak to Bill C-18, which suspends the operation 
of the electoral boundaries adjustment process and to address 
specifically the motion that the government has brought forward 
to accommodate amendments that have come from the Senate 
study of the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-18 is, I think, to kill the electoral 
boundaries readjustment process. The Reform Party was 
opposed to that bill until now. However, I can say that with the 
amendments proposed by the Senate and those put forward by 
the government today, we can now support this bill.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4816"> 4816 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As you know, Madam Speaker, we did oppose and have 
opposed vigorously Bill C-18. We were opposed to it to such an 
extent that at second reading closure was moved. We still have 
some concerns with this course of action, but I should begin by 
saying we can support this bill with the accommodations the 
government has made today.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Let us review Bill C-18 and some of the original problems 
that have been addressed. The House will recall that originally 
there was no demand from the public for this legislation, 
certainly no mention in the red book of any intention to bring in 
such legislation and no serious mention of the procedural 
concerns that had arisen when legislation such as this had been 
introduced previously in 1973, 1985 and 1992. Yet in late 
March, early April, the government came out with C-18 as their 
top legislative priority.
<P>
	When the bill was rammed through the House with closure, it 
really did not present a lot of opportunity for meaningful public 
debate. We had begun to hear, and the Senate later heard, from 
provincial and territorial governments, from many academics 
and experts and from many individual Canadians, particularly 
from British Columbia, all of whom were condemning C-18 as 
not simply a bad bill and not simply an undemocratic bill, but an 
unconstitutional bill.
<P>
	It was apparent that the bill had been prepared without 
consultation with Elections Canada. Mr. Kingsley, the Chief 
Electoral Officer, has stated in committee hearings that it has 
always been the practice of the governments of the day to 
consult Elections Canada when considering changes to such 
processes and it is what we would have expected normally on 
this occasion.
<P>
	The mechanics of our electoral system are admired around the 
world and Elections Canada's advice, as we know, is frequently 
sought by other countries. Recently we played a role in the 
elections in new democracies in both South Africa and Ukraine.
<P>
	The electoral process and its outcome affect all Canadians. 
The interests of all of Canadians must be served, not the 
interests of politicians, not partisan interests or political 
self-interest.
<P>
	One of the biggest problems with the original bill was the lack 
of all-party consensus. The government had only the support of 
the Bloc Quebecois. It was opposed by the Reform Party, and I 
should add, opposed quite vigorously by the New Democratic 
Party and by the Progressive Conservative Party, although its 
opposition comes primarily from the Senate. We heard only 
within weeks of the passage of the bill that many elements of the 
Liberal Party were also opposed, as some members found out at 
their recent convention.
<P>
	The reason I mention these other parties is that the support of 
parties, both major and minor, in this type of legislation is 
important for the operation of the democratic system. The 
support of the Bloc Quebecois is a different matter and I will 
address that in my later remarks.
<P>
	While all this has been going on, the public hearings into the 
redistribution process have continued. The bulk of the dollars 
had been spent even before the bill was introduced and now 
eight out of eleven of the commissions have finished their public 
hearings; in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick-

	<B>Mr. John Loney (Edmonton North):</B> Mr. Speaker, both the 
environment and the economy are big winners today as the result 
of two agreements between the federal and Alberta 
governments. The agreements are an example of federal and 
provincial governments working co-operatively to administer 
environmental regulations without sacrificing the quality of the 
environment or increasing the risk to human health.
<P>
	The administrative and equivalency agreements are provided 
for under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. They will 
lead to a more efficient delivery of the environmental protection 
and enforcement programs that govern toxic substances by 
reducing overlap and lightening the paper burden on jointly 
regulated industries.
<P>
	This initiative is part of the federal government's overall plan 
to harmonize federal and provincial legislation and regulations 
where possible and eliminate unnecessary duplication.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to draw to the House's attention the 50th 
anniversary of the founding of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, the only United Nations agency to be 
headquartered in Montreal since its founding in 1944. The ICAO 
has now become an important component of the worldwide 
transportation industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4817"> 4817 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1944, a total of 52 countries signed the convention on 
international civil aviation. The signing came at a time when 9 
million people used airplanes as a mode of transportation. 
Today, airplanes carry nearly 1.2 billion passengers and are 
recognized as the safest means of transportation. We have the 
ICAO to thank in large part for this record because it had the 
foresight to invite member states to adopt efficient air safety 
measures.
<P>
	The success of the ICAO clearly shows what the peoples of 
the world can accomplish when they work together. Many 
challenges await the ICAO in the next 50 years, and we wish this 
organization the best of luck.

that school is almost out, young people of this country are 
thinking more about their future. I thought it might be a good 
time to reflect on the difference between the younger generation 
and us baby boomers.
<P>
	To boomers, McDonald's was a farmer with all the pets you 
could envision. To the younger generation, McDonald's means 
burgers and fries mc-ketchuped to death.
<P>
	To boomers, Mac the Knife was the number one song by 
Bobby Darrin. Today, Mac the Knife is one of countless young 
offenders.
<P>
	The boomers have lived with the benefits of borrowed money. 
Today the younger generation lives with the results of borrowed 
money.
<P>
	Yes, there are differences between the two generations. Will 
the future be better for the younger generation? It will depend on 
them, their determination, their creativity, their respect for the 
environment and their optimism.

week in Montreal, the Liberal government followed through on 
an election promise to pave the way for Canada's future by 
announcing investments totalling $80.8 million in projects in 
the city of Montreal. These projects represent phase one of the 
Canada-Quebec infrastructure program aimed at the 
refurbishment and construction of municipal infrastructures.
<P>

<P>
	My riding of Saint-Denis will receive $15.53 million,

it will boost the economy of Quebec and it will boost the

Environmental Week I extend an invitation to all hon. members 
and to all Canadians to be good environmental citizens and to 
take part in this week's activities.
<P>
	As a result of numerous activities and exhibitions being held 
nation-wide, Canadians will have the opportunity to familiarize 
themselves with healthy environmental practices.
<P>
	We as parliamentarians have a great responsibility not only to 
Canadians and our immediate neighbours but to the whole world 
to promote environmentally responsible policies and to make 
sure that the laws that we pass in this House are sustainable.
<P>
	The Canadian public also has a responsibility because the 
laws and the regulations we pass both here and in our provincial 
legislatures will not work unless there is public involvement.
<P>
	Environmental Week re-emphasizes the importance of public 
participation.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
prestigious bond rating agency known as Moody's has lowered 
Canada's foreign currency debt credit rating. Responding to the 
lowering of the rating, the Minister of Finance stated that the 
fundamental components of the Canadian economy are sound.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance say that everything is fine 
when structural unemployment in Canada remains extremely 
high, when according to the OECD, the debt ratio of the 
Canadian public sector as a percentage of GDP increased by 82 
per cent between 1985 and 1993, contrary to the average 
increase of only 21 per cent for all OECD countries?
<P>
	It is not the current political situation in Quebec that is 
responsible for the repeated moves to lower the federal 
government's credit rating, but rather the sorry state of the 
federal government's finances, a situation which will not be 
resolved by the Liberal budget and one which has foreign 
investors worried.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, private radio 
stations in my riding and indeed across Canada are worried for 
their very survival. This industry has lost more than $100 
million during the last three years. Today radio stations are 
facing another threat, a potential change in government policy.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is studying 
``Neighbouring Rights'' which would extend the current music 
copyrights. If this is done, radio stations will have to pay 
royalties to producers and performing artists whenever they 
play a song on the radio.
<P>
	Such an amendment would cost radio stations across Canada 
$22 million. Since Canada is a net importer of music, most of the 
royalties will flow across the Canadian border into the pockets 
of already wealthy music producers and artists. The struggling 
Canadian musician will see very little benefit.
<P>
	The policy could also shut down local radio stations if 
enacted. It will undoubtedly result in the loss of jobs.

<P>
	Let us pay tribute today to the memories and courage of those 
brave men and women who struggled for human rights and 
democracy in China and continue to do so today.
<P>
	Tragically, grave violations of human rights continue in 
China as documented just this week by Amnesty International. 
Suppression of the rights of labour, denial of political and 
religious freedom, torture and widespread capital punishment 
are all continuing in China.
<P>
	As well, China continues to ruthlessly suppress the human 
rights and religious freedoms of the people of Tibet and to 
supply arms to bloody military regimes such as Burma.
<P>
	Finally, our government must be just as vigorous and publicly 
outspoken in defence of the human rights of the people of China 
and Tibet as they are in pursuit of corporate profits and trade.

participated in the D-Day landing which led to a quick victory in 
northwest Europe.

Canadians.
<P>
	I would also like to bring the attention of this House and 
Canadians to another group of Canadians who are serving their 
country as part of the United Nations protection force in the 
former Yugoslavia. These soldiers were observed to have the 
highest standards of training, patience, diligence and ability to 
negotiate without bringing arms to bear in the situation. Some of 
these situations are very trying and some of them are very 
unnerving. Our sailors, our soldiers and airmen who are serving

	Today in Thunder Bay there will be inaugural celebrations for 
National Transportation Week which runs from June 5 to 11. A 
wide range of transport related ceremonies, activities and 
seminars have been planned for major cities from coast to coast 
to coast.
<P>
	The theme of National Transportation Week 1994 is 
``Intermodalism: The Perfect Fit''. Intermodalism, which 
describes the use of two or more modes of transportation in a 
continuous operation under a single bill of lading, is increasing 
in this country. This mode of transport is particularly evident in 
our import-export trade which counts on computer applications 
and streamlined procedures to get goods to market quickly and 
at the best possible prices.
<P>
	Transportation is the life support system for our economy and 
it is critically important to our ability to compete internationally 
in the ever evolving global marketplace.

Speaker, I stand before you today to address the reduction of the 
northern living allowance. The towns listed in appendix C of the 
Revenue Canada income tax guide are to endure a gradual 
reduction of the amounts with total elimination by 1995.
<P>
	For the Canadians who live in these towns, and specifically 
my constituents of Dauphin-Swan River, this deduction is not 
one of convenience but a means of compensating for the burden 
of having to travel up to 300 kilometres to seek medical 
attention.
<P>
	All Canadians are entitled to equal access to health care and 
government services. Geography and standard of living create 
barriers to such services. With the emphasis of the Canadian 
economy focused upon urban centres dotting the 49th parallel it 
would seem that we are penalizing those who inhabit our 
northern and rural regions. Large corporations offer their 
employees isolation pay in order to entice transfer to these 
locations.
<P>
	I implore the hon. Minister of Finance within his mandate of 
fiscal responsibility and reduced spending to explore other 
avenues of revenue generation other than eliminating the 
northern living allowance for those towns listed in appendix C.

<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the

proposed French school is justified because the site already 
purchased by the school board is allegedly next to a site that 
handles toxic and hazardous wastes, when such a site does not 
exist? Does she still maintain that, yes or no?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

next to it.

reconcile her statement supporting Kingston's obstruction, 
when her colleague, the heritage minister, gave a grant of over 
half a million dollars for the proposed francophone community 
cultural centre located on the very site condemned by the 
environment minister?

December 1, 1993.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary's father and father-in-law are 
also listed as officers and directors of Dynamic Maintenance, a 
situation which would hardly qualify as an arm's length

how can she explain this apparent violation of the conflict code?

colleague that the contract in question was consummated before 
the election. Eight bidders were involved in the process and it 
was whittled down to four. The successful bidder in this 
particular incident saved the taxpayers of Canada, which I 
assume is the goal of the hon. member, approximately $3.4 
million.

opinion which clearly states that no conflict of interest exists in 
this particular instance.

spoken to the B.C. ministry of finance and corporate relations 
and we were informed that until a person is delisted they remain 
an officer of the company. They also informed us that the 
records are up to date.

Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. In 
response to a Canadian Press release, which did not accurately 
report comments claimed to have been made by the Leader of 
the Opposition at a private meeting with members of the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Deputy Prime Minister 
said that it was shameful for the opposition leader to hold secret 
meetings with small groups.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order! I am not sure that the hon. members 
want to ask or answer questions on events taking place outside

administrative work of the government. However, if the Deputy 
Prime Minister wants to answer the question, she may do so.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I said that it was shameful 
on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to hold private

<P>
	Since the hon. member is advising the Leader of the

discuss secret agenda, will she confirm that the Prime Minister 
of Canada did indeed have private discussions with a small 
group on issues which no one here knows, unless it is the hon. 
member, if she has a gift for clairvoyance? If she is in the know, 
she should tell us what the Prime Minister said during his

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

regardless of whether the meeting is private or public. I am sure 
the member himself, when his leader promised he was going to 
resign the day after the referendum, would have wished to have 
been consulted on the secret agenda of his own leader.

whatsoever of the existence of such a briefing note''.
<P>
	Will the Solicitor General keep denying the existence of a 
memorandum from his department about arms being smuggled 
into the country on CP trains and does he expect the RCMP to 
investigate this matter since, contrary to what CP officials have 
stated, we saw pictures last night of detached freight cars from a

if the hon. member can confirm that these freight cars contained

for the Minister of Finance. Yesterday the minister expressed 
disappointment at Canada losing its last AAA foreign currency

believe that current fiscal measures are sufficient to allay their 
concerns about Canada's debt crisis.

the minister going to take to ensure that no further erosion of our 
credit rating takes place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, we were disappointed by Moody's 
action. On the other hand the House will understand that 
Moody's had signalled some months ago that it intended to 
review our foreign pay debt.
<P>
	The member will also recognize that we are dealing with only 
2 per cent of our debt, the extent which is foreign pay and that 
they confirmed the AAA rating that Canada enjoys on its 
domestic currency debt.
<P>
	Furthermore, Moody's clearly recognized that the 
government had taken very clear action in terms of deficit 
reduction. I would assure the hon. member and the financial 
community that we intend to hit our deficit targets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I specifically 
asked what new action and I got a repeat of the same line we 
heard before.
<P>
	The four main rating agencies are sending smoke signals to 
the government warning about the danger of inaction on the 
deficit. Will the finance minister do something to reduce federal 
spending before these smoke signals erupt into a full-fledged 
fire?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member refers to the four rating 
agencies. He will know that the actions taken by the other rating 
agencies were taken some time ago before the election. Moody's 
has simply brought our foreign pay debt down to the levels of the 
others.
<P>
	It does not mean this is an acceptable situation. We laid out 
very clearly in our budget that we were going to hit our interim 
target of 3 per cent within three yeas, that our ultimate goal was 
to eliminate the deficit. Since then the Prime Minister has on

Kanesatake, of misappropriation of public funds by Jerry 
Peltier?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

which is receiving $10,000 from the federal government, as a 
matter of fact from the Canada Council.
<P>
	Recently this conference has come under widespread 
criticism because participation will be restricted on the basis of 
race. Even the founder of the union and its former chairman, 
Pierre Berton, has argued the union should not support 
something ``which excludes any people because of the colour of 
their skin''.

discriminate on the basis of race?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr.

heritage is also the minister of multiculturalism and therefore 
profoundly against discrimination in all circumstances.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am

the matter as one requiring action. However he went on to say 
that he was talking to the provinces about having them amend

treated as criminals and not mental health patients?

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

the law at present does not permit the detention of prisoners

<P>
	We recognize there are prisoners whose situation is such that 
they may continue to provide a serious risk to the public after the 
end of the sentence imposed by the courts. We are examining 
with the provinces how we can deal with that situation in a way 
that is consistent with the Constitution of Canada and will be 
upheld by the courts.
<P>
	We are proceeding through a federal-provincial task force 
which is expected to report shortly. On the basis of that report 
we will formulate proposals which will be discussed in the

it had commissioned on a non-remunerated basis by a

<P>
	The report will certainly lead the way in terms of a review of 
how we can strengthen what has generally been a very 
successful program. In the last seven years some $2.5 billion of 
investment has been attracted, creating an estimated 30,000

	The attempt is to try to strengthen the success stories and to 
try to correct some areas of concern namely in the investor

improved that. We should continue to find ways of 
strengthening our mechanisms and our monitoring to ensure that 
those who do invest and want to create jobs and create economic 
wealth do so and, second, to keep it in context.

interest in this situation, most especially western farmers, as we 
arrive at a decision in respect of the matter in the coming 
months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, this issue has 
been studied to death for more than 25 years. If all the money 
that was spent on studies was put into a safety net program, I 
suggest there would be no need for any further spending on 
agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister stop studying and start acting on this 
important transportation issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has indicated that 
this issue is very high on its agenda for action in the coming 
months.
<P>
	In addition to some of the issues referred to by the hon. 
gentleman in his question, we also have some important 
considerations to take into account with respect to the impact of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, especially the new 
GATT which is to come into effect in 1995. That is a most recent 
matter that comes to bear on the situation with some very direct 
consequences that we have to take into account.
<P>
	The hon. member may rest assured that he and his colleagues, 
and most especially farmers across western Canada, will see a 
very vigorous, active agenda on the subject in the time between 
now and this time next year.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Today in London the Prime Minister and about 300 Canadian 
veterans are participating in the unveiling of a very special 
commemorative memorial. This weekend all across Canada 
special celebrations in honour of the 50th anniversary of D-Day 
are taking place. We remember that many veterans who served 
Canada and the world were aboriginal veterans from Canada.
<P>
	As we celebrate this commemoration of the 50th anniversary 
of D-Day, is the government prepared to take steps to address 
some of the grievances that have been held over these 50 years 
by aboriginal veterans?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State (Veterans)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	I remind my hon. colleague that aboriginal veterans have the 
same rights under veterans legislation as any other veterans in 
the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Secretary of 
State for Veterans Affairs.
<P>
	As the minister is aware, the other place is currently studying 
grievances brought forward by aboriginal veterans 
acknowledging that in fact aboriginal veterans have not been 
treated the same as other veterans returning to Canada.
<P>
	Will the minister undertake to examine the grievances in 
testimony being presented in the other place and return to the 
House with perhaps a better answer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State (Veterans)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yes, certainly I want to mention the very 
importance of D-Day and the celebrations that are taking place 
on June 6.
<P>
	Any studies that have taken place that indicate there are any 
problems with veterans, veterans pensions or anything 
involving veterans affairs would be looked at by myself and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.
<P>
	If my hon. colleague has any information that would indicate 
any aboriginal veteran did not receive the same as any other 
veteran in the country, I would certainly want to hear about it.

<HR>

<P>
	Industrial conversion is a concern for all economic 
stakeholders in Quebec. Last May 15, a report commissioned by 
the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec indicated 
that the federal government should move quickly to introduce a 
process to facilitate the conversion of Quebec's defence 
industry. As it happens, the minister responsible for the 
FORD-Q has dissociated himself completely from his own 
study.
<P>
	Why has the minister dissociated himself so quickly from his 
own office's studies? Could it be that he is caving in to the 
pressure exerted by Ontario ministers, particularly the Minister 
of Industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the Minister 
responsible for the FORD-Q, as the Minister of Finance and as a 
minister from Quebec, I do indeed support, and I stated this 
repeatedly during the election campaign, our government's 
position with respect to helping defence industries convert to 
civilian production.
<P>
	Moreover, the Minister of Industry has stated himself on 
numerous occasions that we have a fund and that we intend to 
work on this area.

made announcements and was quoted in the press to have said 
that the juvenile system needed change.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the current Young Offenders Act 
brought to Canadians by a previous Liberal government is 
fundamentally flawed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

any law after it has been in place for a number of years can be 
updated and often improved in the light of experience. That is 
what we are doing, because we want to respond to the concerns 
of Canadians with respect to the safety of their homes and their 
streets. At the same time we want to make sure, as part of our 
broader strategy, to get at the root causes of criminal behaviour.
<P>
	We want to update the law, but we want to have a more 
fundamental review. I hope we have the support of this House in 
this activity.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the President of the Treasury Board. I understand 
the minister is going to introduce more computers in order to 
improve service to Canadians by their government.
<P>
	My concern is, will this mean fewer human conversations 
between Canadians who require help from their government and 
the public servants who are there to help them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
rapid technological change is creating opportunities to deliver 
services in ways that are more accessible, responsive and 
affordable for Canadians.
<P>
	Indeed, we are going through the exercise now of trying to 
integrate many of the systems in government services so that 
information will be more readily available and we will be able to 
get answers. The Minister of Public Works is doing the same 
thing and is involved in this exercise to make information more 
accessible to Canadians.
<P>
	Certainly the human factor is a very important one and our 
frontline workers will continue to be very important in the 
delivery of such services. While people may be able call up 
information about government services on their computer or 
even their television screen, it is important they have the option 
of being able to contact somebody who can also provide that 
information.
<P>
	We are giving Canadians the options. Certainly, one-stop 
shopping, the concept of not being shoved around from pillar to 
post when you need information about government services and 
want to access them, is very important. There will continue to be 
a human face in the provision of government services which we 
want to make more efficient and effective in how they are 
delivered to Canadians.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALTRANSPORTATIONWEEK">NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION WEEK</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Madam 
Speaker, this evening I will be attending the launching of 
National Transportation Week, 1994 in Thunder Bay, Ontario. 
As a parliamentarian and minister of the Crown, I feel it is 
appropriate that I present to my colleagues in this chamber the 
most important elements of the speech I will deliver tonight.
<P>
	This year, National Transportation Week coincides with the 
50th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy. 
Transportation, and the fledgling Department of Transport, 
played a critical role in the war effort.
<P>
	Since the beginning of our history, unique, visionary 
transportation policies have helped secure freedom and keep the 
peace. They have brought Canada prosperity and bound 
Canadians together.
<P>
	Efficient, reliable, safe and affordable transportation systems 
to move people and goods are essential to maintain Canada's 
economic competitiveness. The current transportation system, 
despite many past successes and significant achievements, is 
becoming a handicap rather than an advantage to Canadian 
businesses and consumers. We must modernize quickly. That 
will require tough choices and difficult adjustments. The future 
will bring even greater challenges. Much of our system is 
over-built and we can no longer afford it.
<P>
	That is not to criticize the past, but to recognize that we must 
not be held captive by it or to it.
<P>
	Let me give you some examples: 94 per cent of all air 
passengers and cargo are handled at only 26 airports out of the 
650 in this country; 84 per cent of all rail traffic is carried on 
only 33 per cent of our rail lines; and 80 per cent of our marine 
traffic passes through only 30 out of about 300 public ports.
<P>
	Our system is not cost-free. Through the federal government 
alone, Canadian taxpayers are directly subsidizing the Canadian 
transportation system at a cost of more than $1.6 billion this 
year.
<P>
	The challenge facing me as Minister of Transport is to 
develop policies that will foster and encourage our 
transportation industries to rise to the challenges of the 21st 
century.
<P>
	Transport Canada must become the proponent of a broader 
national vision based on the needs of the nation from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific to the Arctic. We must become advocates 
for a modern, intermodal transportation system-one that is 
viable, efficient, safe, affordable, reliable and environmentally 
friendly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The most realistic and viable policy thrust I believe must be 
based on what the 1994 federal budget referred to as 
commercialization. The budget called on Transport Canada to 
review the potential for commercialization of a number of our 
major activities. We intend to do that in consultation with 
affected parties, with the objective of improving efficiency and 
ensuring long term viability.
<P>
	What does commercialization mean? It can be one of many 
approaches by which market discipline and business principles 
can be introduced to traditional government activity. 
Commercialization covers a vast continuum of options, from 
government agencies to not for profit organizations, to public 
and private sector partnerships, to employee run companies, to 
crown corporations, to privatization.
<P>
	Commercialization means users dictate what services they 
want provided and users can determine in large part how costs 
can be controlled. Commercialization means that whatever 
option is selected must allow market discipline to lead to more 
efficient service, greater flexibility and less dependence on tax 
dollars.
<P>
	Commercialization means the goal must be higher quality and 
more efficient service to the user at less cost to the Canadian 
taxpayer. Commercialization will not dilute Transport Canada's 
highest priority ensuring and where possible enhancing the 
safety and security of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	Transport Canada is going to look at commercializing many 
activities. We will consult widely on how that might best be 
achieved. We will be looking at airport operations, the air 
navigation system, activities of the Canadian Coast Guard, and 
operation of the St. Lawrence Seaway.
<P>
	We believe that carefully planned commercialization will 
mean major savings to taxpayers and better service to clients. 
We also believe that the role and structure of crown corporations 
such as CN and VIA Rail must be reviewed. Because of the great 
uncertainty in the rail sector and the concern raised by proposals 
for a merger, I intend to convene a meeting of industry leaders to  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4830"> 4830 </A></B>
<P>
discuss the problems railroads are facing and seek solutions 
together.
<P>
	Let me restate our fundamental commitments as we pursue 
our goal of a national integrated affordable transportation 
system.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will continue to meet its 
constitutional, legal and fiduciary obligations with respect to 
transportation. The government will continue to ensure 
reasonable service to Canada's remote communities and for 
Canadians with disabilities. Transport Canada will not abandon 
its responsibility to ensure safe and secure transportation 
standards, rules and regulations. The government will promote a 
national integrated transportation system that respects the 
environment.
<P>
	I believe it is possible to promote the national interest at the 
same time as we protect the interests of the taxpayers of Canada 
and I am determined to do both.
<P>
	Canada is recognized as a world-class G-7 nation; indeed, we 
are at the top of the class according to the United Nations. The 
challenge is to remain that way. Maintaining the standard of 
living Canadians have come to expect will require hard work 
and many tough choices in the years ahead. It will require 
co-operation and compassion on the part of those who will be 
called upon to make those difficult decisions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must take into account those displaced by change; those 
abandoned by the travelling public, those communities, 
villages, towns and cities which will experience loss.
<P>
	These are some of the challenges facing the Canadian 
transportation industry. I also want to take this opportunity to 
wish the hundreds of thousands of men and women who work in 
the transportation field, from coast to coast to coast, every 
success, as we launch National Transportation Week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Madam Speaker, as part of 
National Transportation Week, I too would like to pay tribute to 
everyone who works or has worked in this field.
<P>
	National Transportation Week is a good opportunity to take 
stock of our transportation system and its importance for the 
development of our economy in Quebec and Canada. We must 
understand that transportation is an industry which has a major 
impact on the whole economy; even more, transportation 
directly affects people's quality of life. The transportation 
system is like the circulatory system in the body.
<P>
	The transportation system has gone through great upheaval in 
the past ten years. Deregulation has had a major impact on 
transportation in Quebec and Canada. In some cases, our system 
is operating beyond capacity and in others it is underused. 
Federal transportation policies have something to do with many 
of the problems our transportation system is now experiencing.
<P>
	The federal government systematically neglected rail 
transport in favour of air and road transport. As a result of this 
policy, our roads and airports are congested. Our rail system has 
been so neglected that today Canada has the oldest and slowest 
passenger rail transportation system of all industrialized 
countries.
<P>
	Meanwhile, we must continually build new runways at our 
airports and our roads are deteriorating so much that the 
provinces can no longer repair them adequately.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	We agree with the minister that we must acquire a truly 
intermodal system that is efficient, safe and affordable. For this, 
the government must not leave the field of transportation but 
instead invest in facilities that will put our transportation system 
at the leading edge of technology.
<P>
	Having a modern transportation system provides tremendous 
benefits. Montreal's airports alone generated $2.2 billion in 
economic benefits for the region in 1992, according to a study 
by the École des Hautes Études Commerciales. Other 
transportation infrastructures certainly have a major economic 
impact.
<P>
	The minister claims that his marketing plan is the answer to 
all our problems with the transportation system. The market 
forces are supposed to resolve all our problems. True enough, 
bringing the decision-making center closer to the users will 
increase the efficiency of the system, but it would be naive to 
think that market logic can be applied to the transportation 
problem across Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Some services, like port and airport administration, lend 
themselves well to being managed locally by non-profit 
organization. In other cases, like the Canadian Coast Guard, 
local management poses serious difficulties, but I will come 
back to this later.
<P>
	We must also ask ourselves what impact if any, this will have 
on transportation services provided to remote areas. The 
minister views the role of his department as ensuring 
transportation safety. That is to take a very restrictive view to its 
responsibilities. As it was so aptly put in the Liberal policy on 
VIA Rail developed by the Liberal caucus in November 1989, 
the government must provide an efficient and affordable 
transportation system to people living in remote areas. It sounds 
like market logic could not be applied to the transportation 
problem in remote areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4831"> 4831 </A></B>
<P>
	Air deregulation resulted in substantial increases in fares to 
regional destinations. Also, the withdrawal of several of VIA 
Rail's regional lines has resulted in depriving regional 
communities of an important development tool. The 
government cannot decommit from regional transportation, 
because of the severe impact such a decision would have on 
regional economic development.
<P>
	With his privatization plan, the minister is trying to free 
himself from his obligations towards remote areas. He is also 
refusing to hold any public hearings on transportation in remote 
areas. In so doing, he is acting like a cold-blooded policy maker 
who does take into account the interests of the public.
<P>
	If the Coast Guard were to be privatized, this would seriously 
affect the competitiveness of ports along the St. Lawrence River 
vis-à-vis those in the Maritimes. Any measure as a direct 
consequence of which shipowners would have to pay higher 
tariffs in ports along the river than in the Maritimes is an all-out 
attack against fundamental economic development tools of 
Quebec.
<P>
	It is totally unacceptable. The federal government has been 
trying for over ten years to pass the cost of operating the Coast 
Guard onto shipowners and thus, to the public. This is not to say 
that we are against any form of privatization in the Canadian 
transportation system. In some cases, privatization can be a 
powerful tool to promote the expansion of transportation 
systems. Transfer of airports to local non-profit organizations 
has been successful. Harbours are another kind of services that 
could easily be transferred to local non-profit organizations.
<P>
	Montreal harbour would lend itself well to such a project. 
Also, if we could give VIA Rail more flexibility to implement 
projects in cooperation with local interests, it would probably be 
able to provide better service on existing lines and even restore 
several of the abandoned lines.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Freight services on branch lines could also help to keep 
several lines in operation and could be affected by CN and CP 
streamlining policies. Remember that remote areas consider 
these lines as vitally important for their economic development 
strategies. What policies does the minister support in this area? 
None, for now. I will have the opportunity to come back to these 
issues some other time and indicate to the House our position on 
this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in response to the minister's speech on National 
Transportation Week.
<P>
	Transportation affects Canadians economically, socially and 
culturally. It provides Canadians with links to one another and to 
the outside world. Increasingly these  links are under pressure 
through high taxation and outdated practices which are slow to 
change.
<P>
	Canada more than ever must adapt its transportation system to 
the needs of Canadians and to the rest of the world. It is no 
longer acceptable that every province have different trucking 
standards for instance or that railways pay for Canada's 
highways through fuel taxes.
<P>
	Changes must be the theme of this new government.
<P>
	The minister has outlined efficiency, reliability, safety and 
affordability as the keys to his mandate as the minister of 
transportation. Thus far commercialization is one of his focuses. 
Commercialization is a noble notion which deserves support. It 
is not however going to solve all the problems that Canadian 
transportation companies and their customers face.
<P>
	For too long governments have put up too many obstacles to 
transportation and their customers while trying to move them in 
directions that are contrary to the best interest of all people in 
Canada.
<P>
	More than anything, this government should be addressing 
transportation problems with an eye toward reducing regulation 
and taxation. This applies at both the federal and provincial 
levels.
<P>
	The failure of federal-provincial co-ordination manifests 
itself in the different transportation standards, subsidies and 
taxation structures among provinces and the federal 
government.
<P>
	Canada still has time to improve its transportation links 
through federal-provincial co-ordination. However, the 
government is slow to address this problem. It is no longer 
adequate to blame one another for failure to achieve agreement.
<P>
	It is important to note that the minister did not mention 
highways once throughout his speech. Canada's highways are 
for the most part in disrepair. They are in disrepair because of 
the failure of government to recognize three things. First, the 
federal government's co-operation is the key to an integrated 
Canadian transportation system. Second, users must pay for the 
services they receive. Third, the private sector is more efficient 
at providing transportation services.
<P>
	Canada's economic deficiency in large part is directly tied to 
its efficiency in transporting goods and people. A clear example 
of this is when Canada entered into trade agreements without 
making the necessary improvements to our transportation 
system to compete with the Americans, the Mexicans and the 
rest of the world.
<P>
	How can Canada compete if it is unable to transport its goods 
and its people to markets which are looking for the services? 
Now is the time to make the necessary changes to improve our 
transportation links and the barriers which stifle growth. We 
cannot wait any longer.
<P>
	The government made some changes toward these goals. It 
has entered into agreements with Mexico to improve 
transportation links between the two countries. This process 
must contin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4832"> 4832 </A></B>
<P>
ue. The first step toward this  goal is the re-opening of the open 
skies negotiations with the United States, an agreement that is of 
vital importance to my constituency.
<P>
	The minister must realize that the 1974 federal-provincial 
bilateral air agreement with the United States is inadequate and 
must be updated. The efficiency of Canada's air transportation 
system is dependent upon it. If airline customers demand a 
direct flight from Ottawa to Washington why is it not provided?
<P>
	The Association of Canadian Airport Communities estimates 
that an open skies agreement costs as much as $10 billion in 
annual economic benefits and would create as many as 250,000 
new jobs. The announcement earlier regarding the 90,000 
government-created infrastructure jobs in my opinion pales by 
comparison.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The government's failure to move forward on an open skies 
agreement is very costly to Canadians.
<P>
	It is not unusual that the minister makes reference to the need 
for an efficient and reliable transportation system. Ministers of 
Transport have been using that line for a long time but we have 
seen very little action to bring about such a transportation 
network. In particular the movement of grain has proven to be 
inefficient and unreliable. A strike at the west coast, 
ever-increasing demurrage charges and a shortage of hopper 
cars has shaken what little faith Canadian farmers had in the 
grain transportation system.
<P>
	The Grain Transportation Agency which falls squarely within 
the purview of the Minister of Transport and handles the 
allocations of grain cars was shown to be completely 
incompetent before joint committees of agriculture and 
transport. Indeed the committee recommended that in the short 
term the GTA be scrapped in favour of a single person working 
to allocate grain cars.
<P>
	The minister has taken no action with respect to the GTA and 
it is now this minister working toward an efficient and reliable 
transportation system. Is this how he plans to accomplish it? Far 
be it from me to question the $14.7 million budget of the GTA.
<P>
	The present inaction of this sector of transportation is 
damaging to our global reputation as a leading and reliable 
exporter of grain.
<P>
	I would also like to take issue with the minister's remarks 
regarding the department's assurance that it will uphold safe 
transportation standards, rules and regulations. The 
Transportation Safety Board is a major player in formulating 
and revising transportation safety regulations. However, two 
months ago a review of the TSB found its operations to be less 
than adequate. Indeed, the review suggested that serious flaws 
were evident as a result of internal bureaucracy, excessive 
secrecy, and a reluctance to question government regulations.
<P>
	By way of example the review found that in 1992 a ferry 
loading accident and a CN derailment both should have gone to a 
public review. Further, on May 18, 1994, the TSB recommended 
the wearing of flotation devices in float planes during all phases 
of take-off and landing, a recommendation described by 
industry officials as futile, unenforceable and even dangerous to 
the occupants of the float planes.
<P>
	Evidence continues to mount that the Transportation Safety 
Board established to help ensure the safety of travellers is 
actually unable to carry out its most important mandate.
<P>
	This government has yet to overhaul the Transportation 
Safety Board. How many more Canadian travellers will have to 
be put at risk before this government establishes reforms to the 
Transportation Safety Board? Reform should be forthcoming if 
this minister is serious about his responsibility to safe and 
secure transportation standards, rules and regulations.
<P>
	The challenges are formidable and the changes needed are 
numerous. Transportation in Canada has done well in spite of

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ELECTORALBOUNDARIESREADJUSTMENTSUSPENSIONACT,1994">ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT 
SUSPENSION ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion in relation to 
the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-18, an act to 
suspend the operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, 
when I rose before question period in a much noisier Chamber I 
was stating that our party was prepared to support the bill with 
some reservation, given the Senate and government 
amendments that have been tabled today. I was pointing out 
some of the concerns we had with the bill and the fact that most 
of the commissions have now reported or are close to reporting 
in terms of their particular roles.
<P>
	The effects of the amendments are basically as follows. The 
Senate is trying to ensure that redistribution is completed prior 
to the next federal election and the amendments now agreed to 
by the government should accomplish it. They also go further. 
They keep the commissions that were originally to be killed by 
the bill in a suspended existence and allow the present stage of 
public hearings to be completed so that we save the money we 
basically had already spent on the process.
<P>
	Furthermore, and this is important, the amendments will in 
effect serve as a safety net to the committee examining the 
redistribution process. They provide a backup position in case 
the committee is unable to reach agreement on the nature of 
reforms, particularly if reforms are reached that do not 
necessitate starting the process from scratch once again.
<P>
	They make it politically difficult under the motion the House 
earlier passed, Government Motion No. 10, for the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to come up with a 
piece of work that is essentially partisan or that would lead to 
boundaries and a process that was not agreeable.
<P>
	Also it is important this whole series of events has shown, 
particularly when the lower House is forced to act hastily, that 
the upper House can make a valid contribution. There are many 
problems with the Senate as it is constituted today and 
improvements could still be made, but I will leave that for 
another colleague of mine to comment on.
<P>
	I point out that with the amendments the government has now 
introduced, or the Senate amendments that the government is 
supporting, particularly with the additional change that the 
government has made, the amendments to the bill are in 
substance virtually identical to what the Reform Party had 
proposed before the bill originally left the House.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Originally it was not our intention to see redistribution killed 
but this is as workable a compromise as we are going to get, 
given the obvious desire of the government to examine the 
process.
<P>
	I urge the government to pursue in the future, not only with 
this bill, but also with motion No. 10, a really substantial all 
party agreement on changes to the redistribution process.
<P>
	When we are dealing with the rules of the game it seems 
reasonable to expect that we would have a consensual approach. 
I urge the government to consider the opinions of the major 
parties in the House, the Liberal Party and the Reform Party. It 
should also, because elections concern minor parties, consider 
the effect on the New Democratic Party and the Progressive 
Conservative Party and whatever input they would have into this 
legislation.
<P>
	It might be noticed that I did not mention the Bloc Quebecois 
in my comments. Frankly I have been mystified at every stage of 
the bill at the unusual Bloc position of supporting the unilateral 
changes in the first place. Then the Bloc engaged in a filibuster 
when it said it wanted the bill passed quickly and now the Bloc 
says it does not want changes.
<P>
	We have seen in recent weeks some of the difficulties in 
having an Official Opposition that does not have the same stake 
in Canadian democracy and in Canadian institutions, not just on 
this issue, but on others.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As is obviously the case for many other hon. members here, 
the recent attitude of the Bloc Quebecois and its leader worries 
me a lot. But it is important to note that the Bloc claims it will 
not run in the next federal election. Indeed, the Bloc is not as 
interested as the Reform Party or the Liberal Party in a system 
and in issues concerning the next election.
<P>
	What this illustrates, albeit in a small way, is that they cannot 
constantly aim at leaving the Federation and still claim to be 
concerned by all things Canadian.
<P>
	They cannot have it both ways. This is a fact that we should 
take into account when considering this bill and the amendments 
to the Election Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take the last few minutes of my speech to 
comment on Motion No. 10. This bill suspends the process 
beginning in September for a period of nearly a year and 
government motion No. 10 charges the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs with studying a new law. It has laid 
out four items.
<P>
	I will very quickly go over what our party feels very strongly 
the government should be considering. First, we had insisted 
and the government had accepted that this committee look at a 
formula to cap or reduce the size of the House. There has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4836"> 4836 </A></B>
<P>
some comment on this  because we have been urging, 
particularly in the case of British Columbia, that it achieve its 
fair representation.
<P>
	We cannot have things every way and we recognize that. The 
size of the House should be capped. Maybe even the size should 
be lowered, but the proportionality of the provinces should be 
reflected. We would expect British Columbia and Ontario to 
increase their number of seats. Obviously this necessitates a 
new formula and some loss of seats for smaller provinces. You 
cannot violate the Constitution and forbid proportionality. At 
the same time you cannot cap the number of seats, as the Bloc 
Quebecois wants, and say that the smaller provinces that are 
losing share cannot decline in representation. You cannot have 
all of these things at once and then deny regional representation 
through the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	That is another case where the Bloc's position makes no 
particular sense. Once again we would urge that the only valid 
reason for completely stopping this process rather than 
resuming it will be to come up with a new formula that will cap 
and reduce the number of seats which is what the public has been 
telling us.
<P>
	Another aspect of the motion called for a review of the present 
method of selecting members of electoral boundaries 
commissions. The Lortie commission, which spent a great deal 
of time and money studying these issues and which on these 
subjects was really addressing non-ideological issues, 
recommended that the use of independent electoral boundaries 
commissions for each province and the Northwest Territories, as 
well as the composition and manner of their appointment, be 
maintained. The chairman is to be appointed by the chief justice 
of the province and additional members by the Speaker of the 
House. That is certainly what our party will be stressing.
<P>
	The current commissions have not only the chief justices but 
also additional members who are, by and large, the academics 
with expertise in this field across the country. It is difficult to 
imagine finding more qualified people.
<P>
	The motion asks that they review the rules governing and the 
powers and methods of the commissions and whether they ought 
to commence their work on the basis of making necessary 
alterations to the boundaries of existing electoral districts 
wherever possible.
<P>
	Several recommendations here are relevant. If anything we 
would be restricting, as the Lortie commission suggested, the 
latitude in terms of population deviation. We should look at 
more frequent and partial redistribution after each general 
election rather than after each decennial census. Those are 
things we would encourage the commission to study, but we 
would also suggest that minor changes in those areas are not 
grounds for suspending, stopping or restarting the process.
<P>
	Finally, the motion asks that we review the time and nature of 
the involvement of the public in the work of the commission. We 
would support strongly the Lortie commission recommendation 
which was that far from increasing the role of politicians, that 
their role be decreased, that we looked more at two stages of 
public hearings rather than a second stage where hearings are in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	Those are our concerns. They are concerns we continue to 
have about the process being suspended. However, with these 
amendments there are reasonable safeguards to protect the 
interests of the public as well as the interests of various parties.
<P>
	At this point, I congratulate the government on finally seeing 
the light on some of these issues and accepting amendments that 
we had originally proposed and that the Senate also has 
proposed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am rather surprised at the comments made by the hon. 
member of the Reform Party. He said that the position of the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois was rather ambiguous. I think he is 
bothered by the fact that the goal of our leader, the leader of the 
opposition, is so clear cut and that the sovereignty of Quebec is 
clearly part of that goal, and I think we will soon be there. I am 
sure that what brought on the hon. member's comments is the 
fact that the Reform Party is going nowhere fast.
<P>
	Incidentally, the hon. member said that our attitude in this 
debate had been rather puzzling. I just want to remind him that 
in eastern Quebec, where according to the readjustment plan 
submitted to the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Commission, a whole riding will disappear, the only party that 
bothered to speak on behalf of the voters in that riding was the 
Bloc Quebecois. We did not see the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who was directly 
concerned, or the Reform Party, which says it intends to 
campaign in Quebec when the next federal election is called.
<P>
	They did nothing except approve the amendments from the 
Senate. I thought the Reform Party was in favour of an elected 
Senate, a Senate that would have real clout, and now they go 
along with a proposal to add amendments to a bill that is a 
perfect example of how parliamentary work can become a 
complete shambles.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The bill was tabled too late. Amendments were proposed 
which were not what the government wanted in the first place, 
and now we are told our position is wrong, although the position 
taken by the government and the Reform Party makes no sense at 
all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4837"> 4837 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also like to ask the hon. member whether he is aware 
of the fact that a committee of the House will consider the 
criteria to be used in determining electoral boundaries. In fact, it 
was recommended by the House that the committee be able to 
consider criteria other than demography in determining 
electoral boundaries, which we feel is entirely appropriate. As 
far as I know, the Reform Party, like the other parties in this 
House, is involved in the work of this committee.
<P>
	So I would like to know whether the hon. member is aware 
that the committee exists and that it will amend the legislation, 
at least we hope so, to make determining electoral boundaries 
more than just a roll of the dice, the only criterion being the 
number of voters and without any consideration of other 
important criteria including the size, of the territory and the 
number of municipalities, things he should be aware of, because 
in the western provinces these are important considerations, and 
I am thinking of Saskatchewan particularly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, if I 
understood the question correctly, we recognize the demands of 
the public in some regions, including western regions, for 
regional representation in the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	Naturally, the committee can study the way to do it within the 
readjustment process, and we support that. However, there is a 
limit to the capacity to represent the regions in this House. 
According to the Constitution, this chamber represents the 
population. This is a constitutional fact.
<P>
	If we want effective regional representation, we have to 
reform the Senate. This is our position and I believe that, in this 
regard, the position of the Bloc contains a contradiction. You 
cannot oppose Senate reform and support an effective regional 
representation in Parliament.
<P>
	I would also like to make a few personal comments about the 
position of the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. I will no say 
anything specific, but just point out that there is another 
contradiction here between the public objectives for the next 
election and the fact that the Bloc does not intend to run in that 
election. This is intrinsic to their position on sovereignty. One 
cannot have sovereignty as the ultimate goal and pretend to be 
concerned about the future of the country. This is a fact.
<P>
	I say to the government that the position taken by the Bloc in 
this debate demonstrates that we have an opposition party that 
has a vested interest in disagreeing with every possible 
proposition. We have seen it during the constitutional debates. 
The same applies to the electoral legislation. I am advising the 
government to follow the consensus of federalist parties and to 
be wary of the Bloc position, given its raison d'être.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have two questions for the hon. member.
<P>
	I listened to his speech with great interest. I know that the hon. 
member for Calgary West is something of a party expert in 
matters of electoral reform. The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster is a member of the House committee 
on procedure and House affairs which is about to embark on a 
study as he knows pursuant to House reference of replacement 
arrangements for the current electoral boundaries readjustment 
act.
<P>
	In his speech he set out a series of parameters. I thought I 
heard him say things to the effect that any new bill would have to 
comply with certain minimum demands like a freeze on the 
number of members if it was going to be acceptable. I could go 
on with a list but I do not want to repeat everything he said.
<P>
	I was very surprised to hear him suggest that the committee 
had to comply with these demands if the Reform Party was going 
to agree to the bill.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminister has been 
impressing on me the importance of entering on this discussion 
with an open mind so the committee can come to its own 
conclusions based on the evidence that it hears from the 
witnesses it expects to call both next week and in July when the 
committee will be having hearings while other members are 
away.
<P>
	I am wondering if the hon. member is saying we are not to 
enter on this discussion with an open mind but in fact are to 
come to the conclusions that he has recommended in his speech. 
If so, I hope he will communicate those views to the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminister who I think would be 
appalled if that were the case given the representations he made 
to me.
<P>
	Second, I did not hear him mention his support for the Senate 
in his speech and I know in public utterances, rather pious public 
utterances I may say, outside this House the hon. member 
suggested that the Senate should block this bill.
<P>
	I did not hear him mention that again in his speech here and I 
wonder if perhaps he could illumine the House on that point and 
let us hear his views on what the Senate should do, should have 
done, or should continue to do with Bill C-18.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy to 
answer both questions.
<P>
	First, on the issue of the committee study, obviously myself as 
well as the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminister would 
expect the committee to do a wide ranging study, but in the end 
we have to give the public a reason to suggest why we would 
completely  suspend and eventually kill the process that has 
been under way.
<P>
	I would suggest that there are certain minimum parameters 
that would justify killing it this time as opposed to waiting for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4838"> 4838 </A></B>
<P>
next time. We are not going to change a couple of commas in the 
Elections Act and use that as an excuse, as I said before, to flush 
$5 million or $6 million down the toilet. I would suggest that the 
public itself has some fairly obvious parameters in mind.
<P>
	I am rushed here but I will answer the second question which 
concerns my position on the Senate.
<P>
	Obviously now that the Reform Party supports the bill I would 
urge the Senate to give it consideration and to see the wisdom in 
supporting it. The Senate has the constitutional power to pass or 
defeat any piece of legislation. That power is not conferred upon 
it by myself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to note to all members that 
the making of law in Parliament is a dialectical act, that there are 
many players, and what we have seen has been a constructive 
interaction as it should happen between the House and the 
Senate and in fact the public at large.
<P>
	If we were looking at the players involved we would have to 
take note of the resolutions of the Liberal Party, federal and 
British Columbia branch, the resolutions passed there and 
adopted unanimously by the annual meeting of the Liberal Party, 
conversations between members of the House and senators and a 
process that results in a measure coming back from the Senate 
and being acted upon by the House. I will have more to say on 
the substance of that in a moment.
<P>
	Let me address one of the problems that has worried me in 
connection with this whole process under way and that concerns 
some issues of the constitutionality of the very act upon which 
the electoral commissions have been operating, the 
Representation Act of 1985.
<P>
	When that first appeared it seemed to me that in artificially 
capping the representation for British Columbia and other 
fast-growing provinces it raised basic issues of 
constitutionality that should be tested.  Since the end result was 
to eliminate the seat of a New Democratic Party member from 
Vancouver, the mayor of Vancouver launched a legal action 
challenging the constitutionality of this measure.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I would have preferred to see the challenge based on the 
simple issue of the artificial capping. Instead, it raised the more 
fundamental question whether a measure changing the 
proportional representation of provinces in the House could be 
adopted by legislation of the federal Parliament alone and not by 
the more complicated and difficult procedures envisaged under 
the Constitution for that.
<P>
	I would add that several of the Conservative senators, and 
there are contradictions here, who are now arguing very 
strongly, and I welcome their support, for extra seats for British 
Columbia participated as cabinet members in the decisions 
which in effect limit B.C. now to two seats instead of the five 
that it would otherwise have been entitled to in accordance with 
the 1991 census. But that is in the past and we look forward to 
the future.
<P>
	I should say though that when the mayor of Vancouver 
launched his action the federal government did not support it. 
Nor did the government of British Columbia. I think this is 
worth comment because its chief legal officer at the time has 
suggested that perhaps Bill C-18 has a Quebec angle in it, 
designed artificially to preserve Quebec seats in the House. I 
think this is a rather far-fetched idea but if it were so then in 
relation to the Representation Act of 1985 why did the Attorney 
General of British Columbia not intervene in that litigation 
before the Supreme Court?
<P>
	I simply commend to members the litigation, in particular the 
opinion of Justice Lambert which seems to me even more 
persuasive today than it was then.
<P>
	Let us come on to this particular issue with the Senate itself. I 
welcome the discussions that we have had with individual 
senators. I welcome the response made by the Senate to what I 
think and hope will be an acceptance of the proposal made now 
by the House.
<P>
	I see a similar contradiction in the position of the Reform 
Party opposite. I think if you capped the size of the House of 
Commons, the point about the Representation Act of 1985, then 
automatically either you gel permanently the size of the 
representation from fast-growing provinces like British 
Columbia and Ontario or you reduce those. You diminish the 
representation of provinces in which the Reform Party has of 
course members. Saskatchewan and Manitoba are the very 
obvious examples.
<P>
	There are contradictions there. It is very important to 
remember this before taking absolutist positions on how many 
seats we should have. I think it is worthy of note that British 
Columbia delegates to the Liberal Party and British Columbia 
members have contented themselves with asking for two seats 
more and not the five that on census returns we would be entitled 
to.
<P>
	Let me come back to the issue of what this is all about, Bill 
C-18, its substantive measures. It would have been a pity if 
discussion of this had been buried in discussion of other issues 
on size of provincial representation in the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4839"> 4839 </A></B>
<P>
	We missed an opportunity in the 1980s to update our 
constitution in the areas of the electoral processes. The electoral 
processes are more important even than constitutional 
processes. They are pre-constitutional, they go to the root of 
constituent power. It is basic that they should be in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	I think if the events had been different with the Trudeau 
government patriation project of 1980 to 1982, provisions on 
electoral representation would have been included in some 
detail. As it is, our constitution in comparison to virtually every 
other liberal democratic constitution of today is naked as to 
provisions as to electoral representation.
<P>
	You look at the United States, France, Germany, Japan or 
India and you find detailed provisions in the constitution or else, 
and sometimes in supplement, detailed decisions of the 
Supreme Court, jurisprudence constante in the civil law sense. 
This makes for a body of opinions, a body of rules that guide in 
the case of the United States the state legislatures which are 
charged with the duty in effect of becoming electoral boundary 
commissions and the similar bodies in other countries.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	We do not have this. I think the preoccupation in the 1980s 
and the early 1990s with the single issue in the Constitution 
prevented us from making changes that would bring us into the 
21st century. This is very basic.
<P>
	I think in terms of electoral commissions that the process of 
the appointment of commissioners is casual and ad hoc and not 
really very acceptable. I say this having served as an electoral 
boundary commissioner in a pre-political capacity. The Speaker 
of the House, Madam Sauvé, asked me if I would serve. She said 
she was anxious to get a non-partisan figure of recognized 
public integrity. It was an honour to serve. But I think the 
process in which simply the Speaker appoints is not good 
enough today. This is as serious a function as that performed by 
Supreme Court judges and other senior crown officials. Perhaps 
it should go to Parliament for some sort of confirmation which 
would inevitably insist upon multipartisan representation or 
participation in the choice of the commissioners.
<P>
	One of the things that is very noticeable with the recent group 
of commissioners is the absence of continuity. When I sat we 
had a great advantage. A member of our commission, Olive 
Woodley from Vernon, had served on several different 
commissions. Therefore when I from my specialized 
professional viewpoint would advance a proposition she would 
counter by saying ``this is how we did it in the past and this is 
why''. Of course, I yielded to those arguments when they made 
sense.
<P>
	It is a fact that none of the members of the 11 commissions, 33 
in all, has had any previous experience. They are neophytes. 
References have been made to the judges as chairmen but the 
judges traditionally have been  neutral and have not interfered. 
So the work is thrown upon the lay commissioners. Is this a good 
thing?
<P>
	In the past the chief electoral commissioner was consulted by 
the Speakers in making appointments. This time the chief 
electoral commissioner was not. We have this in evidence to the 
committee on House Procedures, given on the evening that Bill 
C-18 was adopted by the House.
<P>
	The chief electoral commissioner also throughout the regime 
of Mr. Castonguay constituted himself a member of each 
electoral commission. Mr. Kingsley interpreting his mandate 
narrowly and I think correctly abstained from doing this. So 
there are commissions in a sense sent out on to uncharted seas.
<P>
	One of the problems also as I have said is that there is nothing 
in the Constitution on this. Mr. Trudeau would have liked to 
have got around to it but the facts were he was diverted by the 
gang of eight and other situations and this was left out. If you 
look at the electoral law passed conformably to the Constitution 
on this you will find that while it establishes some antinomies, 
things that may be considered, it gives no guidance as to how 
they are to be applied. I think this is wrong and that it is for 
Parliament to establish the norms guiding and governing 
electoral boundary commissioners.
<P>
	Let us take one example, the principle of continuity. In that 
special relationship that Edmund Burke discussed between the 
member and constituents, the continuity is very, very important. 
It does not really make sense with 208 new members in the 
House to have this wholesale revision of boundaries even in a 
province like Newfoundland that I understand increased only 
738 people between the 1981 and 1991 census. Why revise all 
five constituencies? Is it a make-work project?
<P>
	I do not imply that the commissioners did not act with due 
care and consideration. When I acted as a commissioner we 
accepted that being a member of Parliament is a difficult role 
and that one should respect the relationship between member 
and constituent and that continuity was a factor to take into 
account.
<P>
	I think this time the commissions have gone too far the other 
way. In an absence of instruction they are entitled to do that. I 
think it is time for Parliament to lay down rules.
<P>
	Let me take some other examples of variations that a more 
experienced commission in terms of continuity would have 
established.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	I was intrigued that my colleagues from the Kootenays made 
the point that the commission had taken a two-dimensional 
topographical approach to the constituency boundaries in the 
B.C. interior. A three-dimensional approach is needed because 
there are mountain ranges in the middle. What they have done in 
that area is to reinsert what was the rule until 1960 but was 
changed then because somebody had pointed out the  mountain 
range in the middle of the constituency and that to get around it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4840"> 4840 </A></B>
<P>
involved a laborious 48-hour journey. Therefore there are areas 
where knowledge becomes very important.
<P>
	More important, I would raise the issue of the absence of 
guiding constitutional principles here.
<P>
	In the detailed jurisprudence of the United States Supreme 
Court, Mr. Justice Brennan elaborated on the principle of what 
he called benign discrimination in the formation of electoral 
boundaries. Mr. Justice White in the same case raised the issue 
of properly taking into account racial factors in making 
decisions.
<P>
	What they were concerned with was whether-and again I use 
another term of art-you can indulge an electoral commission in 
positive gerrymandering artificially to create an electorate by 
geographical distortion to produce a majority for one minority 
group that otherwise would not be represented. Why it came to 
the Supreme Court of the United States was that another 
minority said: ``You helped this one but not us''.
<P>
	I raise the issue of whether electoral boundary commissions 
in Canada should be operating on the basis of creating 
artificially single ethnic majority constituencies or not.
<P>
	I simply cite the example in British Columbia of the five city 
seats held by the Liberal Party. It was not planned that way, but it 
does happen that the five members each represent different 
ethnic communities. There is representation from the 
Caribbean, from Italy, from the Punjab, from China via Hong 
Kong, and from what used to be called one of the two founding 
nations. There are five different people, but each running in a 
constituency that is multiethnic.
<P>
	My own constituency has 22 different ethnic communities. To 
gain a nomination for an election you have to seek an interethnic 
consensus. That is closer to the Canada of the 21st century, but it 
seems to me in B.C. the commission is pushing us the other way, 
back to the 19th century configuration.
<P>
	Again, there are perfectly legitimate reasons for doing that. 
The United States Supreme Court sanctioned just such a rule in 
the United States. But this is too serious and challenging a 
constitutional issue to be left to commissioners appointed ad 
hoc for one particular journey at one particular time. It should be 
decided by Parliament.
<P>
	Those principles should be in the Constitution, whether it is 
an amendment to the charter, or the jurisprudence of the 
Supreme Court, or both, as it is in the United States and the other 
countries I have cited. In other words, the committee on House 
procedures has an obligation to establish some sort of motor 
principles, directive principles, that could be carried out by 
electoral boundary commissions in the future and indeed in the 
present case.
<P>
	There is another big gap in our constitutionalism on electoral 
processes. There is no mention of political parties, although 25 
years ago the German Supreme Court decided they are the key to 
the parliamentary processes and must be included and subject to 
the law.
<P>
	What I am saying is we missed an opportunity in the 1980s to 
bring our Constitution up to date on what is basic to any free and 
democratic society: a system of fair, responsible electoral 
representation. We have to do it now. The time limit imposed by 
the Senate originally, in effect six months, was not enough. Two 
years would have been reasonable, but I think it can be done in 
one year.
<P>
	I therefore welcome the amendment proposed by the 
government House leader to the bill as returned by the Senate. I 
welcome the indications being given that this may be agreeable 
to the Senate. I welcome the support of the Bloc and I do 
welcome the support, if somewhat tardy, of the Reform Party on 
this.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a heavy responsibility for the committee on House 
procedures. It can be done. It will give us a truly modern 
Constitution that responds to the need which is basic to a free 
and democratic society: a fair, open electoral system 
implemented by people responsible to Parliament and subject 
therefore to all-party control as to their operations. If possible, 
put the controlling principles into the Constitution, into the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms so that every citizen of Canada 
can read them, study them and apply them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my hon. 
colleague from Vancouver Quadra. We happen to sit on that 
same procedure and House affairs committee which will be 
reviewing the electoral boundaries redistribution process.
<P>
	He mentioned in his speech that he has been an electoral 
boundaries commissioner. What adequate provisions in the 
selection of all Elections Canada officials, including those who 
would be responsible for determining who the new 
commissioners, would he consider might be fair? What would 
be the best process for determining it is not a partisan process 
and there could be absolutely no question of gerrymandering or 
political influence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I speak of course only as a 
private member, I cannot engage the government. My own 
recommendation is conveyed in a series of writings over a 
period of time. I spoke most recently to the Institute for the 
Administration of Justice which is a sort of trade union of the 
Supreme Court judges of Canada.
<P>
	My own suggestion would be that while the government might 
nominate the process should be approved by a parliamentary 
committee. It could be the committee on House management, 
but it should go to a committee. In that sort of situation there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4841"> 4841 </A></B>
<P>
should be an opportunity for examination of the nominees as to 
their  qualifications. I would anticipate the sort of situation there 
is in other countries, a form of multi-party support for the 
eventual commissioners who would be nominated.
<P>
	Once you get it into a system where Parliament itself speaks 
on the qualifications and makes a decision you would inevitably 
get a system where the government alone is not imposing its 
will, but you would get a consensus choice. It would narrow 
down to the people with recognized competence, but you should 
probably be aiming for a permanent standing electoral 
commission.
<P>
	You can look at the errors the 1993 commission made. They 
are very similar to the ones I would have made 10 years ago as a 
commissioner if I had not had a wise person on the commission 
who had already served two or three times and was able to say 
that something was a foolish proposal or that something should 
be changed.
<P>
	I envision a standing commission, but I also envisage 
ratification of the appointments by a parliamentary committee 
or some other parliamentary process.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Madam Speaker, 
in reference to the hon. member's statement on the capping of 
MPs, I cannot quite seem to follow how that is actually going to 
carve the boundaries out in stone or stabilize the electoral 
boundaries.
<P>
	Where I am coming from in this is that I see three components 
here as far as mathematics is concerned. There is the number of 
MPs and the total population of the country. Divide the MPs into 
that and you come up with a figure on representation. Based on 
that and the movement across the country plus those persons 
coming in, I cannot see when you get that figure of 
representation how that is not going to affect moving the 
boundaries about as well to accommodate that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, our dilemma here relates 
to the federal system and the gelling of regionalism in terms of 
particular provinces. The reality is if the size of the House is 
kept at 295 and the population jumps by a million, let us say 
predominantly in British Columbia and Ontario, then either you 
deny the fast-growing provinces the benefits of their increased 
population or you take them away from Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and probably Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	Having sat as a commissioner but also being a member, I 
wonder if that is fair to the people in those provinces. I wonder if 
it is politically realizable, first of all. Would we ever get a 
measure of that sort through the House or through a 
constitutional amendment if it is needed, but I also wonder if it 
is fair. I do express grave reserves. It has been pointed out to me 
as a commissioner about changing boundaries arbitrarily. We 
have to recognize that members do build up a relationship of 
trust with the constituency; it is one of the worthwhile things in a 
democratic society.
<P>
	I would say we can live with an increase in the size of the 
House for the next period of time. The countries that have gelled 
their membership, like Great Britain, have a huge House first of 
all, but also have a relatively static internal organization. There 
are no provinces and no regional subdivisions which have to be 
respected under the constitutional order, so there is much more 
flexibility.
<P>
	I would hate to have to say to colleagues in Saskatchewan that 
they must give up two seats, or that Manitoba must give up four 
seats so British Columbia can have more. My resolution of the 
dilemma is simply to allow the increase to go for at least the next 
decade and let us see what happens. It is only going to be two, 
four, six, for the next 10 years. Otherwise I do foresee anguished 
political choices which involve my voting to deprive people in 
other provinces of seats and I do not want to do that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as I rise to speak on Bill C-18, I feel like saying that the 
saga goes on. This legislation has created quite a mess; I can 
personally attest to that. The causes are not hard to find. The 
Liberal government dragged its feet on the issue of the electoral 
map. It introduced this bill much too late, which caused 
electoral boundaries commissions to sit, because the legislation 
had not yet passed all the stages.
<P>
	Now we are at the stage where a non-elected Senate is 
proposing an amendment and, all of a sudden, the other parties 
decide that it looks like the most appropriate solution.
<P>
	To give you an inkling of how absurd the situation is, I will 
tell you about my own experience with the electoral boundaries 
commission's hearings in eastern Quebec.
<P>
	Around ten groups had registered to come before the 
commission the days I was there. Only two, I believe, finally 
appeared because people understood that the hearings had been 
suspended for 24 months. Elected representatives, who sit in the 
House of Commons, had voted this 24-month delay. And now, 
we have to reconsider this bill, which has been sent back here by 
non-elected people, and give a different message to voters.
<P>
	Because witnesses are not appearing at hearings, we are going 
to have to start the consultation process all over again. Needless 
to say, this will result in more waste, since commission 
members, who travelled across Canada, have incurred travel 
expenses and received a salary, as they should, for the work they 
had done. They were mandated to hold hearings, because the 
government did not present its bill on time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4842"> 4842 </A></B>
<P>
	Fortunately, these people are extremely competent; at least, 
those I met at the hearings in Rimouski were. The Bloc 
Quebecois was the only party to make presentations, both in 
Rimouski and in Percé, and I had the opportunity to say that the 
disappearance of a riding in eastern Quebec was unacceptable. It 
is unacceptable that this area be torn apart in such a way.
<P>
	It was interesting to see the commissioners' reaction to our 
brief. They explained that the present legislation does not give 
them any flexibility in the interpretation of the criteria.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	So, we will still have submitted our recommendations. The 
House of Commons committee that will convene on what I 
would call the architecture of the legislation, the make-up of 
electoral ridings, will have to take into account, in the 
redistribution, such criteria as demography, but also the 
territory covered, the number of municipalities being served, as 
well as sociological and economic components of the territory.
<P>
	What is surprising is that the current commissioners proposed 
to us possible amendments to the initial proposition that they 
had made. Due to the inadequate representation of groups that 
had registered but withdrawn because of the message given by 
the government that everything was postponed for 24 months, 
we are now in a situation where a very interesting debate on 
other adjustment possibilities cannot be held.
<P>
	Today, as I was saying earlier, the saga continues. We are back 
in the House with amendments from the other place with which 
the government suddenly agrees. The government, which 
initially felt that a 24-month timetable was needed to 
adequately review the legislation in time for the next election 
and still allow for consideration of criteria other than 
demography, is now back-tracking. It has decided that a 
12-month timetable is enough. They gave the population a new 
message and I wonder who will be able to find their way in the 
mess created by the government and by the amendments of 
non-elected people who allow themselves to make propositions 
regarding a vital element: representation. The redistribution of 
electoral ridings is for the next election.
<P>
	The next general election should normally be held in four or 
five years but it might as well be in one or two years if this 
government systematically refuses to acknowledge the repeated 
requests of opposition parties for a clear constitutional position. 
This government, as a result of the referendum on the 
sovereignty of Quebec and the benefits that province will gain 
from it, will certainly be forced to adjust and possibly ask 
Canadian electors what position they want to take, what kind of 
government they want to hold negotiations. We might have to do 
that. Therefore, it is important that the type of representation 
that we have be clear and accurate, but this government does not 
obtain a passing grade in this  regard, it does not satisfy the need 
for a democratic and satisfactory electoral system.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of this House to an 
inconsistency in the amendment under title 2, page 1, which 
proposes to replace lines 17 through 21. The amendment 
provides for the temporary suspension of electoral commission 
work. At the same time, this House will examine the criteria 
which should be taken into account for the modification of the 
electoral map. We might once more find ourselves in an absurd 
situation where the House committee could ask experts-and I 
hope that the members of the electoral commissions can be 
considered as experts-to come before the committee when 
their work as commissioners has been suspended. 
Commissioners whose work has been suspended would 
therefore be asked to appear as commission members. This is 
unheard of.
<P>
	Of course, these people could always be asked to appear on an 
individual basis, but in that case they would be entitled to extra 
pay, which will add to the saga surrounding C-18 and the costly 
mess it has created. Why do we find ourselves in a situation 
where the government and the Reform Party are forced to 
change position, which further complicates everything?
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal government and the Reform Party must have 
received strong messages from their constituents, the former at 
the Liberal convention and, in the case of the Reform members 
from the West, they must have had the message that the electoral 
map had to be changed as soon as possible in order to allow 
British Columbia, for example, to have adequate representation.
<P>
	We, from the Bloc Quebecois, have never been against the 
fact that each province be adequately represented in the 
electoral process. We only wanted to show that the blind 
application of demographic criteria has a major negative impact 
on regions whose population is dwindling.
<P>
	When studying what characterizes an economic, social and 
cultural area, we realize that the first thing that brings about 
atrophy is the loss of jobs, which leads to the migration of young 
people and even of seniors, because they no longer have access 
to essential services. Then, one day, those people no longer have 
any representation.
<P>
	That is the effect that the electoral map had on the eastern part 
of Quebec. For several years, there were five constituencies in 
eastern Quebec. The proposal which was made by the electoral 
commission pursuant to the legislation and which only takes 
into account the demographic criteria results in the elimination 
of a riding. Therefore, the people living in the Gaspé Peninsula 
and in the Matapédia area will find themselves in the same 
riding, even if municipalities are 300 km apart, not to say 1000 
km in winter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4843"> 4843 </A></B>
<P>
	This kind of representation is unacceptable to constituents, to 
all the people living in that part of Quebec and Canada. And this 
could happen elsewhere. If I look for example at the evolution of 
the demographic situation in Saskatchewan, I think it would be 
important to take those other criteria into account because if we 
consider only the demographic factor, we will systematically 
contribute to the perpetuation of something we did before, that 
is reduce the impact of resource regions, regions where we have 
made sure we occupied the territory and had good 
representation.
<P>
	It is not only out of social concern that we want to guarantee 
the future of our regions, it is also for economical and cultural 
reasons; if we do not occupy the territory as we did in the past, 
the resources in our part of the country will become 
progressively under-utilized. Therefore, the type of 
representation we want to guarantee is very important.
<P>
	We were told: ``The Bloc Quebecois does not want to 
participate in the next federal election, it says there will be no 
such federal election because it will win the referendum on 
sovereignty. So why does it take action on this issue?'' Let me 
tell you that our mandate is to defend Quebec's interests and, in 
so doing, we must respect the choice that Quebecers will make 
in the referendum.
<P>
	We believe we can bring them to choose Quebec instead of 
Canada, but if they were to decide otherwise, we all want to be 
absolutely sure we conscientiously fought for Quebec's 
interests. To do so, we must anticipate all possible scenarios and 
make sure that Quebec will always be well represented within 
Canada.
<P>
	Even though I hope this will not happen, if Quebecers were to 
choose to stay in Canada, they will require adequate 
representation. Adequate representation means, for example, 
what we were given by the Meech Lake Accord which was 
rejected, following initiatives of the party which now forms the 
government. We were offered 25 per cent of the seats, and this 
percentage will have to be maintained in the future.
<P>
	So, we are fighting for the interests of Quebecers, for the 
region where a riding was done away with. We are defending the 
interests of people in the Lower St. Lawrence, the Gaspé 
Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands. We want to make sure that 
the number of ridings in this region will guarantee adequate 
economic, social and cultural development.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Just imagine that under the Conservatives, although we had 
five members and even ministers, our regional TV stations were 
closed. We do not want to be, in the future, in a situation where 
we could be further disadvantaged because we would had an 
even smaller representation.
<P>
	Also, how can we be sure, given the uncompromising attitude 
of the present government in its dealings with the provinces, and 
given its determination not to re-open the constitutional issue, 
that it will not have to hold elections within a year? We have to 
consider every possibility and try to protect Quebec interests in 
accordance with the overwhelming mandate we received as a 
result of the October 1993 election.
<P>
	In the area of readjustment of electoral boundaries, the Bloc 
Quebecois has done its duty. It co-operated with the government 
for the 24-month period, but it also participated, when possible, 
in the hearings to have maximum representation.
<P>
	The other side, however, never ordered the electoral 
commissions to stop working. We found ourselves in a terrible 
mess, in which we are sinking deeper with this new amendment. 
For my part, I believe that, by agreeing with the arguments of a 
non-elected House, the government is insulting Canadians and 
Quebecers. The House had decided that a 24-month suspension 
was appropriate, but under the pressure of more or less official 
representations from a non-elected body, it reversed its 
decision, and I believe that it is setting a dangerous precedent. 
For people who all said that they wanted Parliament to be 
effective, Bill C-18 is the perfect example of everything one 
should not do to make sure that it sails smoothly through 
Parliament.
<P>
	With this bill, they accumulated every possible blunder. They 
set a deadline, presenting all kinds of arguments in favour of it. 
The Reform Party and the Liberal Party did not agree on what it 
should be, and today they both come back with a shorter 
deadline. They give us the same arguments, but this time to 
justify the new deadline. This is not doing much to improve the 
government's credibility among voters.
<P>
	This is a wonderful opportunity to highlight how useless the 
Senate is or, in some cases, how obstructive it can be. This year, 
we are going to spend $43 million to keep that useless place in 
operation, when in fact there is a consensus in Quebec that this 
institution is totally useless. In Quebec, we abolished the 
Legislative Council 25 years ago. It was similar to the Senate, 
and since we abolished it, we have not had to put up with 
annoying situations of this kind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Everyone in Quebec loves the Senate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Everyone in Quebec loves the Senate. Well, I 
invite the hon. member making this comment to come to Quebec 
this summer and ask people if they know who their senator is. I 
think he is in for quite a surprise!
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Some question!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I suppose I could even put the same question to the 
members of this House. Do they know which senator is 
responsible for their riding? The Senate has put before the 
House proposals which have influenced the government. The 
justification for such action remains a mystery.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4844"> 4844 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Now we find ourselves in the position of probably having to 
hire an information officer to explain to the public what is going 
on with Bill C-18. A bill was introduced and a decision was 
made to postpone the process for 24 months. Now the Senate has 
intervened and the process will be delayed only 12 months. Is 
some other body preparing to tell us to act differently?
<P>
	Our message to the people of Canada is that this Parliament 
does not know what it is doing. If it acts this way when an issue 
like this arises, what will it do later on when dealing with other 
matters?
<P>
	I hope that we can settle this matter once and for all, and then 
move on to something else. I hope that we can focus our energies 
on bringing about real economic recovery to take the place of the 
timid measures which this government has introduced, and in 
the process, end this debate which has taken up more of 
Parliament's time and energies than it deserved to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, it is the end of the week and I am 
sitting here listening to members from the Bloc talking about an 
issue that they will not even have to deal with two years from 
now. If they win or lose the election, they all said they are going 
to quit and go back to their roots.
<P>
	I want to ask a very specific question because the member 
talked in his speech about how much he cared about the 
economy and about putting people back to work.
<P>
	He mentioned during his speech a couple of times, not just the 
economy of Quebec but the economy of Canada, and I was 
struck by the sensitivity to the whole country and not just 
Quebec.
<P>
	As he knows, we had a Moody's downgrading yesterday 
afternoon. We are hearing from many people that the uncertainty 
with regard to the issue of separation in Quebec is one of the 
factors that is causing the jitters in our economy.
<P>
	Does the member not think it would be much more 
productive, in trying to put his constituents back to work, all of 
the people who are out of work in the province of Quebec and in 
every region, to talk about building Canada rather than trying to 
destroy it?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I find this question particularly 
interesting because the present uncertainty is not due to this 
issue. It results from the failure of the Canadian federal system 
to resolve its own problems over the past 15 years. It never 
resolved its problems. In 1982, it managed to repatriate the 
Canadian Constitution without Quebec's consent and since 
1982, not one single government in Quebec, whether 
sovereigntist or federalist -and we cannot say that people like 
Mr. Bourassa or Mr. Johnson have no backbone- has agreed  to 
sign it. This goes to show that the federal system has problems 
of its own to resolve.
<P>
	The present uncertainty of the federal system reveals itself in 
the national debt. As for Canada's rating problems, in the short 
term, the deciding factor is not the Quebec issue, but this $500 
billion debt and the fact that it was allowed to grow from 
approximately $100 billion in 1980 to over $500 billion today. 
That is a $400 billion increase in just 15 years! If I were an 
investor, I would tell myself: ``There is something wrong with 
those guys. We cannot tell where they are going''. That is the 
problem with Canada.
<P>
	Also, the hon. member indicated that he was pleasantly 
surprised by my sensitivity to the whole country. Of course, I 
have am concerned with Canada, in economic terms. I do have 
economic concerns with regard to the Free Trade Accord which 
governs trade throughout North America as well as the new 
accord which replaces the GATT accords and which has a global 
scope. I want countries in the South to have healthy economies 
because they import our products. I want English Canada, and 
Ontario in particular, to be able to keep going the way it is now 
because Ontario is our main client in Quebec and vice versa. 
This is something we must bear in mind. So, I want excellent 
economic relations to be maintained between Quebec, the 
United States, and Mexico.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The best way of ensuring direct economic relations for the 
future is to see to it that a small entity like Quebec can develop 
unhampered, take decisions quickly and get out of the system to 
rid us once and for all of this dinosaur, the Canadian federal 
system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup mentioned that he had 
attended one of the public hearings to consider the new 
boundaries as they were readjusted by the current boundaries 
readjustment commission.
<P>
	I too had the privilege of appearing before the commission in 
my province of Saskatchewan. I found the hearings to be very 
fair. In fact there were some of the same sentiments in 
Saskatchewan. Not many submissions were made because of the 
confusion surrounding the whole issue and the government's 
mismanagement of the entire affair. I found the whole 
atmosphere, the environment of the discussion, to be totally 
non-partisan. I found the committee to be competent and 
willing to listen to the constructive proposals that were brought 
forward through the submissions.
<P>
	Not being very familiar with what was happening in the 
province of Quebec I wonder whether the hon. member found 
the same environment and the same competence among the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4845"> 4845 </A></B>
<P>
commissions in his province, at least at the hearings he was able 
to attend.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to the last part of the 
question, I can say that the legislators on the commission were 
Quebecers. They are very competent in their field, as I pointed 
out in my speech.
<P>
	Yet the commissioners themselves told us they were required 
by the act to consider only the demographic factor when other 
criteria should be taken into account. That was the issue referred 
to the House committee.
<P>
	I think it is important to take these criteria into account and to 
give ourselves the time we need to do so, as provided for in the 
initial 24-month timeframe.
<P>
	I would like to add one more thing. Given the mandate we 
received from Quebecers, we must anticipate all possibilities. If 
we are faced with another election for one reason or another, we 
must have as good an electoral map as possible in order to 
defend ourselves. Finally, as long as we pay taxes to Ottawa, we 
will be represented because there is no taxation without 
representation. Quebecers decided they wanted to be 
represented by sovereigntists, and they did so in a more 
significant way than for any other party in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We still have two more 
minutes.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, no. We want to either 
resume debate or give the hon. member the chance to ask a 
question. I think we are about two minutes away from private 
members' business. Rather than launching into my speech and 
only getting two minutes into it, if the hon. member had another 
question I would gladly defer to him.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, today I am rising to speak about the changes 
that the other place is proposing to Bill C-18. I am glad we have 
a chance to revisit the issue.
<P>
	Bill C-18, as it was originally envisioned by the government, 
was a very serious breach of the fundamental principles of 
democracy, namely preventing the intervention of political 
parties in the design, conduct and outcome of elections in 
Canada.
<P>
	The electoral process in Canada is probably the most fair, 
unbiased and most professional in the world. Our electoral 
process is not perfect and I hope we will have the opportunity to 
discuss some improvements at a later date.
<P>
	The intent of Bill C-18 not only threatens the non-partisan 
aspect of our democratic process but it jeopardizes the 
reputation that Canada enjoys internationally as a country that 
can be counted on to set high standards of impartiality in regard 
to the electoral process. Witness that Canada is very often called 
on to supervise or observe elections around the world. The 
Ukrainian and South African elections are two recent examples 
of this.
<P>
	I cannot emphasize enough the damage that would be done to 
Canada's international reputation if Bill C-18 were to have 
passed in its original form. It should obvious that Reformers 
were correct in their analysis of the bill. The government should 
have accepted our amendments.
<P>
	The reasons why this bill had to be-

House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFLABOURACT">DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve)</B> moved that 
Bill C-243, an Act to amend the Department of Labour Act 
(eligibility for assistance for long-service employees), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I will start by saying that since I had 
the pleasure of being elected to this House to represent the 
people of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, I never felt so strongly 
that I was speaking on a subject that is important for Montreal. It 
is important for Montreal, of course, but for other places as well, 
because the main purpose of the bill before hon. members of this 
House is to correct a terrible form of discrimination suffered by 
workers in Montreal and elsewhere.
<P>
	I will have an opportunity to explain this discrimination in 
detail. First, with your permission, I would like to remind those 
listening to us this afternoon about POWA. This is not the first 
time that we have discussed POWA in this House. Members 
previously elected to Parliament, including the members for 
Saint-Léonard, Saint-Denis and Westmount-Saint-Henri, 
spoke many times in the past to call strongly for major 
improvements to POWA.
<P>
	I am therefore pleased to speak because I agree with what my 
hon. colleagues said in the past. POWA is a federal-provincial 
agreement, financed 70 per cent by the central government and 
30 per cent by the participating  provinces. It seeks to compen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4846"> 4846 </A></B>
<P>
sate and provide income support for laid-off workers. As you 
know, in these tough economic times, there are many lay-offs.
<P>
	The joint federal-provincial agreement on POWA sets forth 
some criteria for workers to qualify. The agreement provides 
that workers will be eligible depending on the size of the 
municipality or community in which the company is located.
<P>
	Let me give you the example of Montreal. When people are 
laid off in the Greater Montreal, something which has occurred a 
number of times in the past, the agreement provides that, to be 
eligible for POWA, a minimum of 100 workers must have been 
laid off. This is the first condition.
<P>
	Consequently, before a worker can be eligible for the program 
on an individual basis, some important collective considerations 
related to the major change occurring, will determine whether 
that worker is eligible or not.
<P>
	The second condition to qualify is that 8 per cent of laid off 
workers must be 55 or over. In Montreal, this criteria does not 
present great problems, compared to the rule requiring that a 
minimum of 100 workers be laid off. I will come back to this 
later on.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	The Program for Older Worker Adjustment has been in 
existence since 1989. Quebec and seven other provinces have 
signed this agreement, which replaces the former Work 
Adjustment Training program, or WAT, more specifically 
targeted to the furniture industry and other traditional sectors. 
The proposed bill-and I point it out, because I feel it is 
important to do so-is designed to correct a terrible form of 
discrimination against urban centres with a population of over 
500,000, including Montreal.
<P>
	It is important to keep in mind this basic and unavoidable 
reality to understand what is going on in Montreal and what 
conditions must be met by a Montreal worker to be eligible in 
case of a mass lay-off-which, as you know, is a breach of 
contract on the employer's part-including the condition to the 
effect that at least 100 workers must have been laid off.
<P>
	If you look at the lay-offs which have occurred in the recent 
past in Montreal, you see that they took place in very specific 
industries-textile, clothing and retail-which, of course, are 
not the only ones in trouble, but are nevertheless experiencing 
particular problems due to national and international factors.
<P>
	I point this out is because between 70 and 80 per cent of these 
industries-textile, clothing and retail-are concentrated in 
Montreal. This is particularly true for the textile and clothing 
industries which, as you will recall, underwent a first stage of 
industrialization. When selecting a site for their facilities, this 
being one of the location factors to use an economic expression, 
most textile and clothing industries chose Montreal. This is  why 
70 to 80 per cent of those industries are now concentrated in the 
Montreal region. And this is where the problem lies since, on 
average, textile and clothing industries have 20, 25 or 30 
employees.
<P>
	It is so true-and I will have the opportunity to come back to 
this issue later-that 78 per cent of all requests submitted last 
year under POWA in the Montreal area were turned down, 
because workers were not eligible. And because this program is 
particularly unsuitable to the traditional industries and harmful 
to Montreal workers, a consensus was reached, a rare feat in our 
political system, and the Liberal Party in Quebec, through Mr. 
Bourbeau, formerly the minister of manpower, now the minister 
of finance, expressed its wish for a review of the program in 
order to bring the minimum of 100 down to 20. The Quebec 
government, first under Mr. Bourassa and now under Mr. 
Johnson, expressed its desire that this program be modified.
<P>
	The same wish was expressed by the mayor of Montreal, the 
major central labour bodies and all the people who are somewhat 
concerned by Montreal's economic development and the 
minimum social justice workers are entitled to expect and who 
have noticed some problems with POWA. In a rare show of 
unanimity, all parties involved called for changes to this 
program.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	And yet, this is the second version of POWA. A first 
agreement was signed in 1988 and renegotiated last year by the 
previous government, which was not, of course, a Liberal 
government. The Conservative government did not yield to all 
the demands of these people who know better than anybody else 
the real problems of Montreal's workers.
<P>
	I have very concrete figures that will show to our colleagues 
how this POWA program is not suitable for Montreal's workers. 
The proof is that, in 1993-94, in the clothing industry, 75 
businesses qualified, which means that their employees were 
eligible, and exactly 359 companies did not qualify because of 
the minimum of 100 workers.
<P>
	Thus, there were four times more businesses that did not 
qualify than those that did, even if there were massive lay-offs. 
Four times more businesses could not ensure income support for 
their workers-I remind you that these workers are 55 years of 
age and more who have given 20, 25, 30 years of their lives to 
the labour force, the labour market, and their 
community-because of a stupid criterion which is not adapted 
to the situation in Montreal.
<P>
	The same is true for the business sector. As you know, one of 
the realities of our modern economies is that the tertiary sector 
is becoming the main production sector and, in Montreal, 
according to the figures available for 1993-94, 41 commercial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4847"> 4847 </A></B>
<P>
businesses were declared eligible under POWA while 139 did 
not qualify.
<P>
	So, three times more companies and three times more workers 
were excluded than included. That is nonsense and, out of 
consideration for the workers, the situation must be corrected. I 
repeat, because it cannot be overemphasized, all concerned 
agree. It is wrong for a worker in a desperate situation, which 
often may have drastic consequences over which he has no 
control, like a massive lay-off, to have to go through an 
eligibility determination process. His eligibility should not be 
based on the size of the municipality in which he lives.
<P>
	The case of Steinberg shows how absurd these criteria are. We 
are all familiar with this case and we remember that workers in 
13 of the 28 stores that should have qualified under POWA were 
in fact excluded. In the case of Steinberg, there is another factor 
that should be mentioned, namely that we were in a situation 
where there were two categories of employers.
<P>
	Despite the fact that Steinberg was a chain that had various 
stores across Quebec, you will see, Madam Speaker, how absurd 
the situation was regarding the eligibility under POWA and you 
will feel sad about it. It is a situation that has to change. So, 
according to the criteria used, it was possible for a person who 
worked in a Steinberg store in Ville d'Anjou to qualify under 
POWA, whereas another Steinberg employee who worked in a 
Montreal store could be excluded.
<P>
	You did not misunderstand, Madam Speaker. It was the same 
corporate organization, with the same employer, the same 
technologies, the same collective agreement, and the same 
supervision system, and we ended up with a totally unacceptable 
situation where workers were divided into two groups, with 
some people being excluded and others included. That is 
unacceptable from the point of view of social rights.
<P>
	Why? Because, once more, eligibility depends on the size of 
the municipality where the production unit is located. Let us 
take the Steinberg situation. In the case of laid-off workers in 
Saint-Jérôme, there had to be 40 workers eligible to POWA if 
individual workers were to be compensated.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	And for the same company, the same production unit, the 
same technology, and the same producer, if you were working 
for Steinberg in Longueuil, but still for the same company, the 
number of laid-off workers was 80 to become eligible.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Twenty in Ville d'Anjou.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Twenty in Ville d'Anjou. Furthermore, we hear 
about an opting out agreement which reminds us a lot of the 
Conservative regime, characterized by nepotism, favouritism 
and insensitivity to workers.
<P>
	This reality does not concern only Montreal. It is my duty, as 
the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, to speak of the 
situation in Montreal. But I asked our colleagues in the Reform 
Party to come up with some figures for their provinces and I got 
some more figures for other provinces which have more 
traditional sectors and are concerned with major economic 
changes.
<P>
	You will be surprised to hear this, but I have figures for Nova 
Scotia. In Nova Scotia, according to the latest figures available, 
ten businesses obtained their certificate of compliance for 
POWA and 36 were excluded, also on the basis of the number of 
laid-off workers.
<P>
	The same thing happened in Ontario, a somewhat more 
dynamic region, the country's industrial heartland, where 184 
lay-offs were certified in 1993-94, and the workers in 663 
companies were excluded. I must remind the House that workers 
are eligible on a collective basis before being eligible on an 
individual basis.
<P>
	That is to say that there is something in this program that must 
be reviewed. For my part, I have been speaking on that matter 
for a long time. You know, in politics, we develop a special 
interest for some matters; for me, it was POWA, because I am 
from a mostly working-class neighbourhood.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I made several representations to my 
colleagues from the Liberal Party and the Reform Party to whom 
I want to address my thanks for their co-operation; I think we 
are going to agree that some amendments are needed.
<P>
	In fairness, I do not want to leave our viewers with the 
impression that we are the first to address this issue. MPs in the 
previous Parliament, particularly the Liberals when they were 
sitting on this side, also called for amendments to the agreement 
on POWA on several occasions. And if it is not against our 
Standing Orders, I would like to quote one our most 
distinguished colleagues, the member for Saint-Léonard, that 
we are delighted to see participate in today's debate. I know that 
we share the same views on this issue and I am very pleased 
about that, because he also represents the Montreal region and I 
know he is sensitive to the reality of non-eligible workers.
<P>
	In short, let me quote some of his most famous words: ``Mr. 
Speaker, under Standing Order 36, I have the pleasure to table a 
petition signed by 2,657 Canadians who call upon the 
government to amend the regulations concerning the Program 
for Older Worker Adjustment.
<P>
	As you know, in the metropolitan region, those employed by 
companies of less of 100 employees are not eligible. It is a case 
of discrimination-this is the term used by the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard-when we know that in Canada, 98 per cent of 
companies are small and medium-sized firms with less than 100 
employees''.
<P>
	What are our chances of getting his support in this very 
important matter for the workers of Montreal and to what extent 
can he have some influence within his government? I can talk in 
a non-partisan way because this  is a question which concerns 
all members of Parliament. Whether we are members of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4848"> 4848 </A></B>
<P>
Reform Party, the Bloc or even the government, we all know 
what it means to lose one's job at 55 years of age. Disruptions 
can happen in our economic community over which we have no 
control.
<P>
	At 55, after having devoted one's life to a job-but you are not 
of that generation, you are a young woman-workers have given 
20, 25 or even 30 years to the job market. We have no right to 
leave these people without adequate financial protection. I see 
that the hon. member for Saint-Léonard is nodding in 
agreement.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	Such is the intention of the bill. There is nothing complicated 
in what we are saying, nothing original, I admit. We are saying 
what the Liberals said before us, what Quebecers are saying 
through their minister of finance, Mr. Bourbeau, and through the 
mayor of Montreal, and what the labour confederations are 
asking for. What we are saying is that Montreal's work 
environment does not prepare workers who could be laid off in 
the sectors which are more likely to be affected.
<P>
	It is in this context that I ask today, innocently but with 
enthusiasm, the consent of the House to put the following 
motion. I move, seconded by the member for Bourassa:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-243 presented in my name, be deemed read for the second time 
and referred to the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I conclude by mentioning that I am convinced this bill must be 
examined by a committee. I want to let the government know 
that I am open-minded. I am willing to change my mind if some 
dimensions of the debate have escaped me. I am open-minded 
and I know the members are sensitive to the reality faced by 
Montreal workers. I am confident they will give the necessary 
consent in this matter.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House has heard the 
motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the said motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There is no unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to take part in this important debate, because I find it 
essential, as the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
mentioned in his speech, where he quoted one of my most 
famous statements-I was not aware that I was now 
famous-and read a petition containing more than 2,000 names. 
So, for information purposes and for the record, let me add that I 
tabled more than 5,000 petitions concerning the Program for 
Older Worker Adjustment, or POWA.
<P>
	For the benefit of our viewers and listeners, I will describe the 
program. It is intended for 55-year-old workers who lose their 
jobs following massive lay-offs. These last few years, God 
knows there have been quite a few of those. In the past, as the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve mentioned, we had 
a program to assist older workers from special sectors, whether 
it be the textile, clothing or footwear sector. The program often 
allowed exceptions depending on the community or the number 
of the lay-offs.
<P>
	After the change in government and with evolving economic 
conditions, the Tories abolished the program and introduced a 
new one involving the provinces. POWA did not target any 
particular industry, it included all economic sectors. However, 
to limit public expenditures, because there were some major 
economic constraints, they introduced the rule of 100 jobs for 
every municipality of at least 500,000 residents. If you take 
Montreal, the number would apply to the city of Montreal. For 
example, in La Salle, it would be 60 jobs, and, in Saint-Léonard, 
it would probably be 80. But, to my mind, for the unemployed, 
this has always been a kind of discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The difference between the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and myself-There have been a 
number of meetings on the subject and we even attended some of 
these together, and I said this before and I say it again today, if 
you want to get rid of discrimination, you get rid of it across the 
board. If 100 is discriminatory, then 20 is just as discriminatory 
as 100, because where do you draw the line, Madam Speaker?
<P>
	An example: 74 per cent of small businesses in Canada 
employ fewer than five workers, and 97 per cent employ fewer 
than 50. Since three quarters of all small businesses in Canada 
employ fewer than five workers, we would correct only 25 per 
cent of the discriminatory practices in this sector. As I said 
before, when you get rid of discrimination, you get rid of it 
across the board. If a practice is discriminatory, you get rid of it 
altogether. That is why, since October 25, with the advent of the 
new Liberal government I have been working with the 
Department of Human Resources Development to deal with all 
aspects of this problem. It is a social problem.
<P>
	When a 55-year old worker is laid off, either in a collective 
lay-off or individually, it is very difficult for him to get a job. 
This is a social problem that has been with us since the sixties. 
Twice attempts were made to deal with the problem through 
programs which, unfortunately, failed to deliver. I am working 
with the minister, with the human resources development 
committee to which the hon. member wants to refer this bill, and 
our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4849"> 4849 </A></B>
<P>
objective is to deal with this problem once and for all through 
the reform of our social programs. We have young people, older 
workers, women and the disabled who need our help.
<P>
	As we approach the 21st century, we have an economy that has 
changed completely, and we must deal with this through social 
measures that go beyond the consideration that 100 jobs are 
affected in a company. It is a problem because we are talking 
about older workers. What difference does it make whether a 
person works in Saint-Léonard, Ville LaSalle, Chicoutimi or 
Laval? That should not be a problem. We have to deal with the 
social issues.
<P>
	At the time, I asked the hon. member to join me, with his party 
colleagues, so that we could all work together. All parties are 
represented on the Committee on Human Resources 
Development. When the report is comes out this fall, they want 
to prepare a study that includes these programs. The minister is 
working on this with his department. We will then be in a 
position to respond.
<P>
	Reducing the number from 100 to 20 does not get rid of the 
problem. There will still be discrimination, because 74 per cent 
of small businesses have fewer than five employees, and more 
and more small businesses are being set up. We cannot depend 
on big companies to create jobs. We saw what happened. Like 
me, the hon. member is from East Montreal, and we all know 
what happened to the big companies in Montreal during the 
recession. Only small businesses will be able to create real jobs. 
In fact, this government is committed to creating jobs by 
developing small businesses, so we cannot discriminate in this 
area. I would urge the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to continue his efforts, as I continue 
mine, to help older workers.
<P>
	We must find a system, a comprehensive solution so that 
everybody has a job, whether the company has ten, five, twenty 
or fifty employees; we all know that units are becoming 
increasingly smaller.
<P>
	The member knows quite well that if this bill were to pass 
tomorrow morning, there would be just as many cases in the 
ridings as there are today, because the problem would still be the 
same. Even as members of Parliament we do not know what to 
say sometimes; we often see cases where they are close to the 
100 threshold. I know of many instances where there are 80, 
even 95 employees affected in a plant which does not qualify. So 
if the limit is 20, what will we say when there are only 17 or 18? 
The discrimination will be exactly the same.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, my colleague mentioned the Steinberg case. 
I am well aware of that case because I met the parties involved 
several times here in Ottawa and in my riding. I am still working 
on it and I hope to solve that Steinberg problem because it is a 
simple matter of interpretation. We could solve it even within 
the existing program. The problem is that a civil servant 
somewhere decided to consider different parts of the company 
as separate units. Steinberg was a single employer and we know 
it moved employees from one supermarket to another, in 
different municipalities. These people had to follow orders, go 
and work a week or a day in such or  such a place. When 
Steinberg closed its doors they were in one store rather than 
another, and the choice had not been theirs.
<P>
	I believe that together we could have that decision reviewed 
and we could bring justice to these employees. However, the 
general problem can only be solved with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the committees which work on the 
matter. As it is, we have to allow some time. Social programs are 
not going to be reformed every year. We are in a favourable 
period and we must act. I am glad we are doing this now, because 
I think the timing is right. We have to press on.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve not to 
give up. His bill did not get unanimous consent and could not be 
referred to a committee, but it is a subject that we should come 
back to. There is a problem in our society which has to be solved, 
but solved for good. As I said earlier, you do not correct a 
discrimination by creating another one. That discrimination has 
to disappear completely if we want to leave some hope to our 
workers, even those less than 55. Should there be some lay-offs, 
they should expect some compensation, even if they are young. 
They should be able to access a system allowing them to 
continue paying their mortgage, the rent, their children's 
tuition. Today, that security does not exist.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
and I urge him to continue his battle; he will always get my 
support on this. I am convinced that the reform of social 
programs will answer this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, excuse my inexperience, I am 
willing to learn. We presented a motion we hoped would be 
votable to defer a bill and I understand that the government is 
not going to accept it on the basis of specific criteria which it 
finds discriminatory. If we were to present our proposal and say 
that we are committed to remove any mention of eligibility 
according to a specific number, be it 20 or 100, can we ask the 
House to reconsider the motion and vote again on it, if the 
member for Saint-Léonard is willing to be consistent?
<P>
	You do understand my point of order, Madam Speaker. The 
member told me that it was not admissible because it was 
discriminatory. I am willing to remove the element found 
discriminatory, and I ask the House to reconsider the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent to amend the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member has 
introduced a bill. Over a month ago, he came to me and asked me 
to support this bill, but I told him that I could not back it in its 
present form. He had all the time he needed to make the 
necessary amendments. I think that in my speech, I was honest. I 
congratulated the member and encouraged him to keep at it. 
However, if he is only interested in politicking, then I am not 
biting.
<P>
	I maintain that he had all the time in the world to come up with 
some amendments. I made it clear to him from the very 
beginning when he asked for my support that I could not give it 
to him. Now that we are debating this bill in the House and he is 
making his speech, he is coming back to this point. The best 
thing to do now is to have this debate and, if he wishes, he could 
introduce another bill at a later time or, as I suggested, raise the 
matter before the human resources committee. This would 
certainly help the cause of these older workers a great deal. 
However, if he is interested in politicking, then politicking he 
will get.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, indeed we do not have any 
interest in politicking. If that had been the case, we would have 
referred to the question of social reform and mentioned the fact 
that some precedents do exist since the unemployment 
insurance formula was changed in Bill C-17 to reduce benefits. 
The unemployment insurance system was changed, even though 
social reform has not yet been finalized. Therefore, a precedent 
does exist.
<P>
	However, in the measure-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but I think 
the hon. member will agree with me that-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to finish my 
point of order. To the extent that we are not interested in 
politicking, we have just heard the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard say that one of the program's provisions was 
discriminatory. We are prepared to support his suggestion that 
the discriminatory provision be removed and that the whole 
matter be referred to committee. This being the case, we would 
support the hon. member for Saint-Léonard's proposal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. Let there 
be no mistake. I will not tolerate, and I do not expect that you 
will either, being accused by the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard of politicking. Let me tell you-and I would like 
to wrap up, if I may-that I have been involved in this issue 
since 1989. The riding I represent is fairly disadvantaged as 
compared to that of the hon. member for Saint-Léonard and I 
find his comment uncalled for.
<P>
	The real question, the one workers will remember, is: Does 
this government want-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu): </B>Order! The hon. 
member for Saint-Léonard, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, given the hon. member's 
lack of experience, I shall remain calm and ignore these last 
remarks. What I want to say however is that the chief opposition 
whip's remarks baffle me. He has been sitting here long enough. 
He should be familiar with the Standing Orders by now. If he 
reads the bill, he will see that there will be nothing left if my 
proposal is agreed to. It will become an entirely new bill.
<P>
	When I said that I had stated my views, or my intentions to the 
hon. member the first time he had come to see me, a few months 
ago, to ask for my support, I meant that I had made the same 
objections to the bill as I did in my speech today. This bill 
reduces the number of jobs in a municipality with a population 
of 500,000 from 100 to 20 and this, retroactively. Basically, 
there is still discrimination.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> With all due respect, I 
say to the Government Whip that this is a matter for debate and 
not a question of privilege or a point of order.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> My colleague, the Government Whip, said that 
I have been a member long enough to be familiar with the 
procedure.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but this is not 
a question of privilege.
<P>
	There was no unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the points 
you are raising have to do with the debate. This is not a question 
of privilege.
<P>
	The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie on point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like you to explain to 
me why wanting to set the record straight-when I am accused 
of not knowing the procedure despite having been a member for 
a number of years-is not a question of privilege.
<P>
	Is it not clearly a question of privilege? I would like to know.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In any case, it does not 
really relate to what the hon. member said and, I repeat, this is a 
matter for debate. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> If it is not a point of 
order, the debate will resume immediately. The hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, every member of this House 
has the right to understand your decision and I would like to 
understand it.
<P>
	I raised a point of order about something. The hon. member 
for Saint-Léonard alleged that-

<HR>
<B><A NAME="4851"> 4851 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order! Order! I repeat 
again that there never was unanimous consent, so we cannot 
return to the question you raised at first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Question of privilege!
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> On a question of 
privilege, the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, when I said that the member 
for Saint-Léonard had said that I should know the procedure 
since I have sat here for several years, you told me that he did not 
say that. Could you tell me what he said?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> On this point, we will 
check the blues when they come out and I will get back to you on 
it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address this bill. It gives me an opportunity to discuss 
some of the serious unemployment problems in Canada and to 
determine if the government's response has been adequate and 
propose some constructive alternatives.
<P>
	I would like to start by saying that the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has proposed some fairly significant 
changes to the government's older worker adjustment program, 
one of which if passed would cost millions of dollars more and 
require the renegotiation of six federal-provincial agreements.
<P>
	As well intentioned as this bill is, I think the consequences 
and the cost of implementing this bill have not been considered 
as long and as hard as they would need to be.
<P>
	This bill would dramatically change the eligibility rules for 
the program for older worker adjustment, otherwise known as 
POWA. Section 5.1 of the Department of Labour Act gives the 
minister the authority to enter into agreements with provincial 
governments for the purpose of making income assistance 
payments to older workers between the ages of 55 and 65. 
Workers are eligible only if they have been affected by major 
permanent lay-offs and have exhausted their UI insurance 
benefits.
<P>
	The federal government has entered into POWA agreements 
with six provinces: Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. As there is a 
limited amount of money allocated to POWA agreements, the 
government establishes in each agreement a formula for 
determining what it considers to be a major layoff. The formula 
is based on the size of the city or community, the size of the 
company and is different in each federal-provincial agreement.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Here is an example of the formula used in a Quebec POWA 
agreement. In a community, let us say, of a million people you 
would require a number of employees to equal 100. If your 
community or city has 165,000 people then you need only 80 
employees to qualify under  a POWA agreement. As the size of 
the community decreases so does the number of employees.
<P>
	Just to illustrate this, in a community of 50,000 people you 
would require 50 employees to qualify. In a community of 
17,000 or fewer you would require 20 employees to qualify 
under this program.
<P>
	Eligibility for POWA assistance is determined for each 
specific mass layoff and then for the individual employee 
affected by the layoff. Interestingly, between April 1, 1992 and 
December 23, 1993, 380 layoffs in the six provinces were 
designated under this program. Annuities were purchased for 
3,500 older workers for a total cost of $104 million to the federal 
government and some $39 million to the provincial 
governments.
<P>
	Officials have told us that the federal contributions to POWA 
have been capped at $50 million and estimates for 1994-95 
confirm that the government will spend $50 million on POWA.
<P>
	The hon. member is proposing in this bill to change this 
program significantly with huge financial implications and 
creating a potential problem in the area of federal-provincial 
relations. This bill would remove the discretion the minister has 
in negotiating federal-provincial agreements. Instead of leaving 
the determination and eligibility for POWA based on the size of 
the community, impact on the community, type of industry, size 
of the company and the number of employees affected, this bill 
would require both federal and provincial governments to 
include all companies with 20 or more employees.
<P>
	This member's office has confirmed that it has no way of 
knowing how many companies or how many employees would 
become eligible for coverage under POWA as a result of the 
changes proposed by this bill.
<P>
	The member is asking Canadian taxpayers to write a blank 
cheque.
<P>
	How could anyone in this House support this bill not knowing 
how much it is likely to cost the federal government? Not only 
would this bill require the federal government to assume new 
and unknown program cuts, which would surely be in the tens of 
millions of dollars, the bill would also require that the province 
increase its contribution to the program for older workers 
adjustment.
<P>
	Second, I would point out in regard to this bill in clause 5.1 
that the amendment would immediately rescind all current 
federal-provincial agreements and require the Minister of 
Human Resources to renegotiate each one of them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4852"> 4852 </A></B>
<P>
	What would this mean for federal-provincial relations? What 
would this mean for older workers who are already receiving 
assistance under the POWA program?
<P>
	This bill clearly creates more problems than it solves.
<P>
	The Reform Party would like to thank the hon. member for 
introducing this bill. While we cannot support it, it is always 
enlightening to investigate a government program and see how 
the problems were addressed in the past, what was wrong with 
the approach and possibly how it could be done better in the 
future.
<P>
	When we look at the program for older worker adjustment, we 
see a government using its powers to design a discriminatory 
program which supports older workers, subject to a completely 
arbitrary formula based on the size of the community, type of 
industry, the size of the company, and the age and employment 
status of the employee.
<P>
	This means if I were a worker aged 59 living in Montreal, laid 
off from a company with more than 100 employees in the textile 
industry and had just used up the last of my unemployment 
insurance benefits, I would be eligible for assistance under 
POWA.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, if I were a 59 year old Montrealer laid off 
from a company with 90 employees, not 100, in the textile 
industry and had just exhausted my UI benefits I would not be 
eligible for assistance under POWA.
<P>
	While I admire the government's intent to keep the cost of 
POWA capped at $50 million, I am frankly amazed that the 
government would implement a program that is this 
discriminatory.
<P>
	What about older workers who are in exactly the same boat 
but did not work for the right size of company or a specified 
industry? What about all the older workers who are in the same 
or worse circumstances because they worked for themselves all 
their lives? No one is coming around to them with a guaranteed 
annual income.
<P>
	I believe that if the government is going to create a program 
for older workers who have exhausted their UI benefits and have 
little opportunity for employment, then it had better include all 
older workers, not just a few selected workers in a few selected 
industries in a few selected provinces.
<P>
	While we may sympathize with the plight of older 
unemployed workers and while the intentions of the government 
and my hon. friend who introduced the bill are entirely noble, 
the fact is that many Canadians are facing tough times and 
would like the government to buy them an annuity until they 
reach age 65.
<P>
	What would happen to these older workers if there were no 
pilot program? Many of them would find work eventually or 
would find work elsewhere. A number of them would rely on 
their families for help until they did find work. Unfortunately 
some may have to resort to welfare.
<P>
	In my opinion, Canada is not short of safety nets. In fact, I 
believe we have too many. The program for older worker 
adjustments is an illustration of this point.
<P>
	Specific groups of people who are hard pressed lobbied the 
government for help and the government, in a legitimate desire 
to help, creates yet another social program, another income 
supplement program.
<P>
	In our view, Canada needs only one income supplement 
program and it should be administered through the income tax 
system. How much money would be saved by using this Reform 
approach? We say billions.
<P>
	The government's social programs are an overlapping, 
confusing mess that few politicians and few Canadians 
understand. It is time to bring some common sense back to our 
social programs and to get our social spending under control. 
This is why I am here in Ottawa and I intend to do my best to do 
just that.
<P>
	Let me summarize once more why we cannot support the 
measures in the bill. The bill changes the eligibility criteria for 
POWA programs, increasing the number of persons eligible for 
the benefit and as a result would dramatically increase costs 
both for the provincial and the federal governments.
<P>
	Reformers were sent to Ottawa to save the taxpayer money not 
to find new ways to spend it.
<P>
	The bill would remove the discretion that the minister has to 
negotiate provincial-federal agreements. While that is not 
necessarily all bad, it may not be in the best interest of the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	The bill would require the government to immediately rescind 
and renegotiate six federal-provincial agreements. This would 
likely cause a problem not only in the area of 
inter-governmental relations but for older workers now and in 
the future.
<P>
	I understand the member's motivation for presenting the bill. 
I am sure he has the best interest of the older laid-off workers in 
his constituency at heart and I commend him for that, but has he 
taken into consideration fully the Canadian taxpayer? What we 
really need is a complete overhaul of our social programs.
<P>
	My colleagues across the way have set for themselves the 
onerous task of reducing the federal deficit to 3 per cent of gross 
domestic product in three years' time while maintaining an 
acceptable level of social security.
<P>
	We still spend $70 billion a year on these programs, half of all 
the money taken in. If the Liberal government is going to reach 
the target it has set for itself, it has no alternative but to reduce 
program spending, not increase it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4853"> 4853 </A></B>
<P>
	We feel that if there is a problem for all older, laid-off 
workers, whether they work in a big company, a small company 
or for themselves, then the government should not be selective 
in which older workers qualify for assistance.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	This having been said, we think the social safety net for older 
workers is sufficient and there is no need for POWA. To this end 
we will be making a proposal to eliminate the program through 
our standing committee under section 81(7).
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to the bill proposed 
by the member from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve because it 
brings to the attention of the House the very difficult adjustment 
problems faced by laid-off older workers.
<P>
	These problems have caused the government to arrange a cost 
shared program to offer assistance for older workers who have 
been involved in major layoffs and this program has been in 
place since 1988.
<P>
	Under the program, the federal and provincial governments 
have purchased annuities to provide income assistance to 9,000 
older workers. The federal government has contributed $254 
million, the provincial governments, $109 million as their 
respective portion of cost.
<P>
	The effect of the bill proposed by the hon. member from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve will be to change one of the major 
criteria of the program for older workers adjustment and to place 
that change into the Department of Labour Act.
<P>
	At present, the program criteria are contained in the cost 
shared framework agreements negotiated and signed by the 
federal government and the participating provinces. The bill 
would make one of the layoff designation criteria part of the law. 
Specifically, the bill would allow any layoff involving at least 
20 employed workers to be eligible under the program. This bill 
would significantly change one of the fundamental concepts 
behind and the criteria for eligibility in the program for older 
worker adjustment.
<P>
	Presently, to be eligible under the program, a layoff is 
considered relative to the size of the community. This 
consideration is directly related to the degree of difficulty that 
laid off older workers will face finding new employment. The 
more laid off workers with similar skills, the greater the 
competition for jobs and the degree of difficulty in finding a job 
also depends on the size of the labour market.
<P>
	Under the current federal-provincial framework agreements 
that govern eligibility at least 20 workers must be laid off in 
communities with a population of 10,000 or less and at least 100 
laid off in communities with a population of more than half a 
million. There are various categories in between.
<P>
	I have no difficulty with proposals to change the numbers 
involved. In fact, the lower numbers might even be an 
improvement, but a graduated entry requirement is a way of 
measuring both the hardship faced by the laid off workers in 
finding re-employment and the disruption to the community 
caused by the layoff.
<P>
	On the other hand, to establish in law a universal minimum 
would mean that practically all layoffs would need to be 
covered, thereby removing the targeted measures of limited 
prospects for re-employment and significant economic 
disruption in a region. The effect would be to change the 
fundamental program criteria and that without any consultation 
with our provincial partners.
<P>
	The bill is well intentioned and it would help more older 
workers. However, I am concerned that if enacted it could 
potentially cost the federal and provincial governments billions 
of dollars. As we know, during times of scarce resources the 
measurement of targeting mechanisms contained in present 
legislation could be overwhelmed by sheer volume and drive 
cash strapped governments out of the program. That would not 
help unemployed workers.
<P>
	Where in the event that criteria were changed without 
commensurate funding increases, the advantage that smaller 
communities have now because of the graduated entry 
requirements would result in small communities being left 
behind.
<P>
	The government recognizes the needs of unemployed older 
workers and has programs in place to help those in greatest 
difficulty. Improvements need to be made to address the needs 
of older workers and that is being done in the social policy 
review.
<P>
	I would bring to the attention of the House a program that was 
instituted between the federal government and the province of 
New Brunswick called Jobs Corps, where older workers are 
allowed to earn up to $1,000 a month for a year and in return 
would work for 26 weeks. They could earn up to $8,000 on top of 
that without penalty to the original $12,000.
<P>
	The government recognizes the need to help older workers 
who are trying to move in a direction of active programming to 
decrease the potential for dependency and away from passive 
programs.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the member's motion. 
I encourage the member to participate in the social policy 
review process and welcome consideration of all of his ideas.

	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Madam Speaker, I request the unanimous consent 
of the House to pursue the debate. There are two members 
waiting for their turn to speak. It should not take too long. This 
is an extremely important debate. Normally, a Bloc Quebecois 
member should have spoken before a Liberal Party member. I 
am a bit confused.
