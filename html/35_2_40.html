	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ)</B> moved 
that Bill C-203, an act to amend the Criminal Code (criminal 
organization), be read the second time and referred to a legislative 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I will say for starters that this bill goes 
beyond amending the Criminal Code, as you mentioned, since it is 
aimed essentially at including in the Criminal Code provisions that 
would make it possible for Canada to have the tool necessary to 
fight organized crime, namely antigang legislation.
<P>
	Allow me to explain why I am tabling such a bill. You will recall 
that last year, in early August, a car bomb went off in the riding of 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, which I represent here in the House of 
Commons, killing Daniel Desrochers, an 11 year old boy who had 
the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<P>
	This incident was the most eloquent, the most perverse, the most 
revolting example of what can happen when society does not have 
the necessary tools to fight organized crime. As you know, this car 
bombing was part of a fratricide struggle between the Hell's Angels 
and the Rock Machine.
<P>
	Let us start at the beginning-I hope the pages are going to bring 
me some water, otherwise I will not last for 20 minutes, I can tell 
you that. Today we are talking about organized crime. Organized 
crime is a concern in all major cities in Canada. I gave you an 
example which occurred in the riding of 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, but the threat from organised crime, the 
underworld and the mafia is as real in Toronto, York, Vancouver, 
Halifax as in any other city in Canada.
<P>
	Organized crime is ubiquitous. Let us see how organized crime 
works. Not every society is plagued with organized crime. Certain 
conditions are needed for organized crime to thrive. The first of 
those conditions is  a wealthy environment, one where criminal 
organizations can make some profits. There must be an open 
society, one where axes of communication allow these 
organizations to communicate easily with all continents. I repeat, 
there is a good reason why organised crime is found mainly in large 
cities.
<P>
	When I think about Montreal for example, there is the port, there 
are the roads, the highways and the airports, so it is simple to 
understand why it is unusually easy for the underworld to 
communicate with other continents and to create readily accessible 
networks. Another condition is a society free from any 
dictatorship, where there are legal rights and therefore, where 
human rights are respected, where there are charters and where all 
individuals have equal rights. Generally it is easier for the 
underworld to establish itself in a highly bureaucratic society.
<P>
	That being said, we all remember the car bomb attack which 
killed the young Daniel Desrochers. Because of my contacts with 
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, I can easily see that 
there are other trouble spots, other cities in Canada touched by 
organized crime, particularly in Ontario. I hope the Ontario 
members will vote for this bill, because later on I will ask for the 
House's consent to make it a votable item. Let us be clear, if we do 
not act right now in order to fight organised crime, we are in for 
some very troubled times.
<P>
	How does it happen? Organised crime works in phases. First, 
they gain control of the territory. When that is done, through fear 
and intimidation, they go on to the second phase, money 
laundering. It is estimated that, last year in Canada, a total of $20 
billion were laundered. Such an amount means there is an 
underground economy being set up; that gives us an idea of the 
magnitude of organized crime.
<P>
	So organized crime grows by phases. It settles in cities or regions 
where communications are easy. It takes over control of a territory 
and starts taking part in money laundering activities. In a third 
phase, it invests in legal and illegal activities. As I said money 
laundering activities in Canada have been estimated by police 
forces at $20 billion.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Organized crime not only deals in money laundering activities it 
invests in specific ventures. People familiar with the issue, who 
have studied the underworld and know what it is about, have told 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2336"> 2336 </A></B>
<P>
me that at present in  Montreal organized crime is investing mostly 
in two sectors, restaurants and construction.
<P>
	What is going on? What is the situation? Here are few figures 
which were given to me by the person probably best informed on 
organized crime, Mr. Sangollo who works for the Montreal urban 
community police department where he is responsible for 
organized crime investigations.
<P>
	According to Mr. Sangollo, in Canada, drug seizures represent 
some $1.5 to 4 billion. Keep im mind that the police seizes about 
10 per cent of the volume coming into Canada. This gives you an 
idea of the size of the problem.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that each year, in Canada alone, the 
underworld invests $20 billion in legal and illegal activities. 
Investments mean there is a connection, an interface if you like, 
between the underworld and the legal world. If $20 billion are 
invested in illegal and legal businesses, that means accountants, 
lawyers and people in high places allow these activities to proceed. 
Some even believe politicians help smooth the way for such 
activities, but as you can understand I am not here to name names. I 
will let those in a position of authority do that.
<P>
	The underworld is associated with territory control, money 
laundering and investments in legal and illegal activities. Members 
understand that we are talking about the reality of drug trafficking, 
which is the easiest way for the underworld to get rich.
<P>
	Perhaps I can give some other examples. It is said that 75 to 80 
per cent of drug trafficking in bars in Quebec is controlled by 
organized crime; 75 to 80 per cent, that is something. Since 1988, 
90 per cent of the cocaine and hashish that have been seized in 
Canada were originally intended for Quebec's criminal network. 
Montreal, where, as I pointed out, there are airports, 
transcontinental highways and an efficient railway system, has 
mafia bosses on its territory.
<P>
	In this context, it is very important that we, as parliamentarians, 
take our responsibilities. I do not even dare to think that this 
government will not give me its support to state that this bill may 
be votable, not only to state that it may be votable, but also to 
ensure there is a real debate here in Parliament. Do we not have the 
responsibility to make sure that Daniel Desrochers, who died last 
August as a result of a car bombing in my neighbourhood, did not 
die in vain? We have the responsibility to take action to make sure 
he did not die in vain.
<P>
	The first thing to do is to take our responsibilities as 
parliamentarians, by proposing an amendment to the Criminal 
Code so that it contains the main provisions for an anti-gang 
legislation.
<P>
	What am I proposing? I am not saying this is perfect, this is the 
bottom line. If there is a parliamentarian in  this House, whether a 
government member or an opposition member, who decides one 
way or the other to improve the bill, any intelligent suggestion, 
wherever it comes from, will be welcomed.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	But we tried, I tried, to make a contribution to the development 
of an anti-gang law.
<P>
	I have four proposals. I spent a great deal of time consulting with 
lawyers, criminologists and other people who are familiar with 
criminal law. My first proposal is to define ``criminal 
organization'' as follows: ``a group of individuals-who habitually 
engage in activities that bring them into serious conflict with 
society or with the police''. I stress the words ``that bring them into 
serious conflict''. If at least five members of this group have in the 
past committed enterprise crime offences, the courts will have the 
authority to regard it as a criminal organization.
<P>
	Enterprise crime offences have been in the Criminal Code since 
1987. These offences are theft, possession of stolen goods, forgery 
and breach of trust. There are some 30 offences already on the 
books.
<P>
	What is missing is a definition of ``criminal organization''. The 
advantage of this bill is that it introduces three presumptions 
allowing public prosecutors to bring crime bosses before the 
courts. The great paradox we face is that these crime bosses in 
Montreal and elsewhere are known to the police but cannot be 
prosecuted because, under the existing provisions of the Criminal 
Code, they must be caught red-handed. We know full well that 
those who planted the bomb that killed little Daniel Desrochers are 
obviously not the same people who planned the killing.
<P>
	In the fight against organized crime, we are trying to give 
ourselves the means to bring crime bosses before the courts. To that 
end, my bill not only gives a legal definition of ``criminal 
organization'' but also introduces three presumptions. First, that an 
individual who keeps company with a criminal organization is 
presumed to be living off it. This, I think, is very clear. A link could 
be made with prostitution.
<P>
	Under existing provisions in the Criminal Code, an individual 
who is habitually in the company of prostitutes is presumed to be 
living off the avails of prostitution. So the first presumption 
making it possible to prosecute crime bosses would be that an 
individual who keeps company with a criminal organization is 
presumed to be living off its proceeds.
<P>
	The second, but just as important, presumption is that an 
individual who frequents places linked to organized crime is 
presumed to be living off the proceeds of a criminal organization.
<P>
	The third presumption allowing public prosecutors to bring 
crime bosses before the courts is that an individual  whose worth 
increases disproportionately between the time of the offence and 
the beginning of the trial is presumed to be living off the proceeds 
of a criminal organization. It is not normal for an individual whose 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2337"> 2337 </A></B>
<P>
net worth was estimated at $10,000 for income security purposes, 
who was known as a welfare recipient by the police, to have a 
personal fortune estimated at $3 million three weeks, three months 
or one year later. You will not convince me that this individual was 
a three time winner of the Quebec lottery; that is not what we are 
talking about. What we are talking about is the illicit way these 
individuals are getting rich.
<P>
	That is why we need a legal definition of ``criminal 
organization''. We will create a new criminal offence-living off 
the proceeds of a criminal organization-and give public 
prosecutors three presumptions allowing them to bring crime 
bosses before the courts.
<P>
	The existence of these presumptions does not mean that defence 
lawyers cannot refute them or that the principles of natural justice 
do not apply, but that it is up to the individual to demonstrate, for 
example, how he got richer.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Another provision of this bill that police forces had been 
requesting for many years to fight organized crime is the one 
addressing the need for those sentenced to imprisonment to serve 
three-fourths of their sentence. If this bill is passed, there will be no 
remission of sentence and, after sentencing, access to parole will 
become possible only when three-fourths of the sentence has been 
served. Why is it necessary to hold firm on having people serve 
three-fourths of their sentence? Because that is how networks are 
dismantled, how the chain of command is broken in the underworld 
and organized crime.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying something important about 
my bill. Of course, in preparing this bill, I had to consult 
extensively and I had mixed feelings about going through with it. I 
concluded that it is important for any bill that comes before us to 
make sense and be valid, legally speaking. That is why I provided 
for the use of the notwithstanding clause: section 33 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. Why did I chose to do so? Because I realize 
that, if this bill is passed and then challenged in any ordinary court 
of law in this country, it could be argued that it interferes with 
freedom of speech, freedom of association and the legal rights set 
out in section 7 of the charter, namely the presumption of 
innocence.
<P>
	I am convinced that each of us in our various ridings represent 
people who would be very pleased to see this Parliament take its 
responsibilities, even if we determine that, in order to fight 
effectively against organized crime, we may have to restrict certain 
rights by limiting the scope of the charter.
<P>
	As you know, in February, I tabled a petition signed by 65,000 
people from all over Quebec, calling for the adoption of antigang 
legislation. I have yet to meet one person saying: ``But it is 
important not to restrict in any way the movement of the most
<P>
criminalized segment of our society because we have this charter, 
you see''. That is not what the charter is about. I am sure my fellow 
citizens of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, like all Canadians and 
Quebecers, would have no objection to sacrificing some degree of 
freedom to the higher interest, which is fighting organized crime.
<P>
	That is why my bill provides for the possibility of resorting to 
the notwithstanding clause, which, indeed, has been used very 
seldom. The truth is, as one government member or another will no 
doubt mention, the notwithstanding clause has never been used by 
the Canadian Parliament. Two provinces did: Quebec, between 
1982 and 1985 and again in 1989, after the Brown decision was 
handed down, and Saskatchewan, in a labour dispute. If the 
legislator included a notwithstanding clause, it is because it needs 
to be used in some cases, and the threat posed by organized crime 
across the countries of Quebec and Canada is so serious that we 
have a duty, as parliamentarians, to point out that, without a 
notwithstanding clause, no antigang legislation can be brought 
forward.
<P>
	We cannot allow what happened in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
and Montreal to happen elsewhere. I ask for consent to see if it 
would be possible to have this bill declared a votable item and not 
only voted on but also debated for two extra hours, because the 
situation is so serious that parliamentarians will agree with my 
diagnostic.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me, but I did not quite understand 
what the hon. member just said. My colleagues, does the House

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr.

unanimous consent to refer the bill  to the Standing Committee on

<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I did indicate no 
on the motion put forward by the House where you indicated you

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The no is noted. Now the hon. 
parliamentary secretary has identified himself as the source of it. If 
he wishes to do so, that is his privilege. He now has the floor on 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to participate in the debate today on Bill C-203, 
introduced by the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	The bill proposes amendments to the Criminal Code in an effort 
to deal with criminal organizations. More specifically, the bill 
would create a new part in the code. A new offence of living in 
whole or in part off the proceeds of crime from a criminal 
organization would be established. This offence would be 
punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. The bill would also 
establish two presumptions in respect of persons who could be 
members of a criminal organization.
<P>
	The bill borrows extensively from the provisions of part XXII.2 
the Criminal Code which deals with the proceeds of crime and 
modifies them for application to property from criminal 
organizations.
<P>
	The bill would also impose on the courts an obligation to order 
that a person convicted of an offence serve three quarters of any 
term of imprisonment handed down in respect of this conviction.
<P>
	The bill recognizes there may be significant charter problems 
with some of its provisions, specifically subsection 33(1) of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and states the 
provisions of the bill operate notwithstanding certain rights and 
freedoms guaranteed under the charter.
<P>
	The problems of organized crime are difficult and complex. It 
has been suggested by some that our Criminal Code does not 
provide law enforcement agencies the tools needed to fight 
organized crime. According to some, our relative lack of successful 
investigations and prosecutions of organized crime figures is 
considered to be evidence that our laws are insufficient. It follows 
according to that logic that our laws must be changed. Given the 
breadth of some of the proposed solutions, it is incumbent on those 
who advance these proposals to satisfy a number of concerns.
<P>
	I will take the next few minutes to review and comment on the 
manner in which this question was approached in the United States 
and more specifically deal with an American statute which is 
frequently mentioned as a possible model for Canada. I refer of 
course to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law, or 
the RICO law as it is called.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations provisions of 
the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 represent the attempt of 
the United States Congress to control the growth of organized 
crime in America.
<P>
	In response to the report of the President's commission on law 
enforcement and the administration of justice, the Katzenbach 
commission, Congress adopted what became title IX of the 
Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. In passing the RICO statute 
Congress put in place the statutory machinery it hoped would expel 
the cancer of organized crime from American society. In doing so, 
Congress focused on the criminal infiltration of legitimate 
enterprises relying on the existing legal apparati to respond to other 
criminal issues such as gambling and prostitution. To excise the 
cancer of enterprise infiltration Congress proposed to confront 
organized crime by direct attack, by forcible removal and by 
prevention of return.
<P>
	The essential drafting difficulty was finding a constitutional 
method of defining organized crime. A deliberate choice was made 
not to explicitly outlaw membership in organized criminal groups 
such as the Mafia because of the recognized constitutional 
concerns of making status, that is, membership in an organization, 
a crime, and of defining what constituted an organized criminal 
syndicate. Rather, in an attempt to ensure the constitutionality of 
the statute, Congress made its central proscription the use of a 
pattern of racketeering activities in connection with an enterprise.
<P>
	Unable to define what were organized criminal syndicates and 
then outlaw membership in them, Congress turned to an 
operational definition of organized crime and tried to get at the 
criminal organization through its activity. Thus RICO pursues a 
broadly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2339"> 2339 </A></B>
<P>
defined category of criminal activity, not the mere membership in 
an organization that can only be broadly  defined if the definition is 
to be in any way helpful. RICO prohibits activities not 
membership.
<P>
	Early versions of the statute applied to anyone who invested 
deliberately unreported income, regardless of the source of the 
income or the criminal status of the investor. As finally enacted 
however RICO is not limited to any statutorily defined member of 
the Mafia. At that time the novelty of RICO was not the criminal 
fine or the imprisonment provision but the section providing for 
criminal forfeiture to the United States government any illicit 
interest in or profit gained from a criminally infiltrated enterprise.
<P>
	The stated purpose of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 
under which RICO is subsumed is to seek the eradication of 
organized crime by establishing new penal prohibitions and by 
providing enhanced sanctions and new remedies. To implement 
this general purpose, Congress fashioned an elaborate statutory 
scheme proscribing a variety of racketeering activities.
<P>
	The first section of the RICO provisions provides a definition of 
terms. In particular, the definition of racketeering activity marks a 
significant departure from typical criminal statutes because it 
includes activities traditionally considered criminal, such as 
murder, narcotics dealing and gambling, as well as acts such as 
extortion, mail and wire fraud and securities fraud. Any of the 
offences listed in this definition may serve as predicate acts to a 
criminal RICO charge.
<P>
	In a similarly broad manner, a pattern of racketeering activity is 
defined as at least two acts of racketeering activity, the last of 
which occurred within 10 years, excluding any period of 
imprisonment after the commission of a prior act of racketeering 
activity.
<P>
	The second section of RICO lists the crimes which result from 
engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. Section 1962(a) 
outlaws the acquisition of an interest in a legitimate business 
through the investment of money obtained from racketeering 
activity. Section 1962(b) prohibits the acquisition of a legitimate 
business through racketeering acts. Section 1962(c), the most 
widely used provision, outlaws the operation of an enterprise 
through the use of racketeering activity. Section 1962(d) prohibits 
the conspiracy to commit any act in the first three parts of section 
1962.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Rico prohibits among other things the installation of an 
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. These words 
have made Justice Scalia of the United States Supreme Court state 
in a 1989 decision:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the highest court in the land has been unable to derive from this statute 
anything more than today's meagre guidance bodes ill for the day when a 
constitutional challenge is presented.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those familiar with the history of Rico will know that it is aimed 
at stopping the infiltration of racketeers into legitimate 
organizations. Canada chose to pass its  proceeds of crime 
legislation to effect the same result, that is, taking the profit out of 
crime.
<P>
	Those familiar with its operation will know that the state must 
prove at least two predicate acts that constitute a pattern of 
racketeering activity, those predicate acts being for all intents and 
purposes other codified offences before the remedies provided by 
Rico can kick in.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
bill, which was introduced by my colleague from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, attempts to deal with a very serious 
problem. I would like to say at the outset that we support what the 
member is doing and we support his bill.
<P>
	As the member opposite has just said, there are some very 
serious issues at stake here. The member who introduced the bill 
has been very candid about the fact that there are some very serious 
competing interests which need to be weighed in taking the action 
he has proposed. He has not hidden the fact that this is not an action 
he undertakes lightly nor that Canadians should accept lightly. 
What he is arguing and the argument that I at least accept is that 
this is a serious enough situation so that serious measures are 
warranted and should be supported by our legislators.
<P>
	Organized crime is a very serious problem in our country, a 
problem which unfortunately is growing. Many people do not have 
a very clear idea of just how large a problem it is.
<P>
	I was speaking last weekend with a gentleman who works for the 
intelligence arm of a police service in our country. Some of the 
things he told me were shocking, disturbing and even frightening. I 
asked him why nobody knew what he had told me. I did not know. 
Why do Canadians not know? It is their country, it is their safety, it 
is their future at stake. Why do we not have a better idea of some of 
these difficulties? In his opinion, and it is only one man's opinion, 
he said there was a feeling that nobody knows what to do with the 
problem. Therefore it is better that we do not try to face it and make 
it explicit because then we would actually have to do something 
about it.
<P>
	It is very important that members of Parliament not alarm the 
public unnecessarily. It is important that members of Parliament 
use discretion and deal with serious national concerns in a very 
moderate and balanced manner.
<P>
	When the country has serious problems it is no longer acceptable 
to simply ignore them or hide them by sweeping them under the 
carpet. I applaud the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve who 
has recognized not just in his area but in other areas of the country 
that this is a crime, a serious situation which we have to squarely 
face. We need to put our heads together to come up with  some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2340"> 2340 </A></B>
<P>
solutions and strategies to contain the problem and if possible to 
diminish it.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	As the hon. member very sensibly and very appropriately points 
out, this may not be the best or the only solution to the problem, but 
at least it is a solution. Goodness knows the justice department and 
the justice minister have put forward nothing better to date.
<P>
	I found it very disturbing that the government representative 
who just spoke, having no other solution and having put forward 
nothing at all to deal with this very serious problem, would refuse 
to even allow the bill to be examined by the justice committee of 
the House. The government is just killing it without any alternative 
and without facing up to a very serious problem. We have not 
properly examined and heard witnesses and had expert opinion on 
the proposals in this private member's bill to the extent we would 
like to.
<P>
	The member was very sensible to put forward an opportunity for 
the House to examine his proposals. Out of that examination very 
likely would have come, as the member candidly admits, even 
better or stronger proposals and at least the issue would be on the 
table.
<P>
	The Liberal government has swept the issue right back under the 
carpet, not wanting to even talk about what we might do to contain 
a very serious problem. I find that completely unacceptable as a 
member of this House who is charged with acting in the best 
interests of Canadians and with dealing with the country's major 
concerns.
<P>
	The member is seeking in the bill to add a new charge to the 
Criminal Code making it an offence to live off the avails of 
criminal proceeds. This would particularly affect members of 
criminal organizations. There are a number of criminal 
organizations in Canada: biker gangs, the Mafia, the Russian 
Mafia, Asian gangs. Because of this country's weak and toothless 
administration of justice, unfortunately the evidence is that these 
organizations are not being contained. In fact, as the hon. member 
stated in his presentation, his concern and the concern of other 
people is that the impact of these organizations on our country is 
growing.
<P>
	This bill would also affect individuals who associate with these 
criminal organizations and would make them guilty by association. 
That is the bone of contention in this legislation. As the House 
knows, our charter of rights and freedoms protects Canadians' right 
of association. That is a very important democratic right and one 
which should not be trifled with without very serious advantage to 
our society. It must clearly and unquestionably be in the public 
interest to do so.
<P>
	One of the hon. member's colleagues introduced a bill last week 
that would change some of the procedures in our courts to protect 
witnesses in cases of sexual assault and violent assault. I objected 
to that last week. I felt that principles of jurisprudence which were 
in the public good  were going to be eroded which made that action 
unjustified.
<P>
	When we weigh these matters we have to be very careful. There 
are differences of opinion about how the rights and needs of society 
should be balanced. In my view, because I am convinced of the 
seriousness of this situation, we could and should be responsible 
for looking very closely at endorsing the proposals put forward by 
the hon. member who introduced this bill.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	It is clear the present Criminal Code procedures are not doing the 
job needed. For example, money laundering techniques are 
becoming increasingly more sophisticated. It is very difficult for 
law enforcement officers to do the job that needs to be done and to 
keep on top of criminal activity and the results of it.
<P>
	In terms of human misery, the activities of these criminal 
organizations simply cannot be allowed. It has to be vigorously 
combated by individuals in our country.
<P>
	As the hon. member stated, the activities of these criminal 
organizations and the impact on other individuals in society, on our 
young people, on families, on our communities and on public 
safety in general is absolutely enormous and simply must be 
addressed. It must be faced squarely.
<P>
	I believe in containing problems when they are small rather than 
waiting until we have a full blown crisis on our hands. It is my view 
that we should look seriously at the problem. Perhaps these 
proposals are not the whole answer but we should certainly be 
discussing and looking at them.
<P>
	On August 18, 1995 the Minister of Justice in an article 
published in the Toronto <I>Sun</I> said: ``We should not assume another 
federal law will solve the problem''. Then on March 29, 1995 in 
statements which were printed in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, he talked 
about the federal government considering amending the Criminal 
Code with anti-biker legislation but he has done nothing about it.
<P>
	Therefore, which is it? The justice minister needs to take some 
leadership on this issue. Certainly when other members try to take 
leadership, the last thing we need is to refuse to hear or even 
discuss their proposals. I am upset about this. I disagree strongly 
with the Liberal members who refused the unanimous consent 
necessary to allow this bill to even be discussed in the justice 
committee.
<P>
	I believe this is something we should-

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec 
City, which I have the honour of representing in this House, is 
known throughout the world as the centre of French culture in 
North America. It is also famous for its magnificent location, its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2341"> 2341 </A></B>
<P>
old city, its cultural life, its  tourist attractions and its warm 
hospitality. In other words, a quiet capital.
<P>
	As for Montreal, it is one of North America's major centres. 
Unfortunately, a certain level of crime prevails in these large cities. 
A person living outside Montreal is aware of this fact and knows 
that it is somewhat unavoidable.
<P>
	Now, the so-called quiet city of Quebec is starting to experience 
some of the problems of a large urban centre. The most striking one 
is certainly that of organized crime, which still manifests itself 
sporadically, but in an obvious way. Once we recover from the 
shock, we start to get a better understanding of the problems 
experienced by our fellow citizens from Montreal.
<P>
	The motorcycle gang war has started up again and is even worse 
than before in the Quebec City region, particularly last week in the 
neighbourhood Saint-Roch. People are scared. They wonder how 
bad the confrontation will be. This is why I find it important today 
to take part in the debate on the bill tabled by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve on criminal organizations.
<P>
	I must admit that reading the related file turned out to be very 
instructive. I learned that Quebec had the dubious honour of being 
the centre of organized crime in Canada. This is particularly true in 
the case of drug trafficking. Indeed, almost all the cocaine and 
haschisch seized in Canada is confiscated in Quebec. This is not to 
say that Montrealers consume all of these drugs. It simply means 
that Montreal is the port of entry, the hub of drug trafficking. This 
indicates criminal networks are established there and very well 
organized.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I learned also that some conditions are needed for such criminal 
networks to operate. To become prosperous, they need a rich 
environment allowing criminals to rake in profits. Also needed is 
an open environment, linked to other regions, countries and 
continents. As we know, Montreal is linked to other regions 
through a well developed road, rail, air and marine transport 
system. Moreover, because of our vast territory, authorities have a 
hard time maintaining strict control. Also needed is a free 
environment, devoid of oppression or dictatorship, which is of 
course the case in our society, in Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, according to experts in the field, in order to develop, 
organized crime needs a bureaucratized environment where justice 
and security services are governed by strict and complex rules. We 
only have to think of all the constitutional protection enjoyed by 
defendants in our criminal justice system to see that this condition 
is easily satisfied in Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, all the conditions are met for Quebec, through its 
metropolis, Montreal, to hold the dubious title of headquarters for 
organized crime. What can we do about this? Year after year, police 
authorities sadly  acknowledge that organized crime is on the 
increase and doing fine thank you, and steadily expanding. Faced 
with this situation, police authorities, with their meagre resources 
already stretched very thin, have been calling out for help for a long 
time now.
<P>
	This bill my colleague for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has 
introduced is an attempt at solving this problem. It would make it 
possible for the courts to condemn any person living on proceeds of 
organized crime. What is the rationale behind this bill? Why is it 
needed, when there are already so many sections and offenses in 
the Criminal Code?
<P>
	The answer is quite simple. It is because, sadly, it is always those 
at the lowest level of organized crime who get caught, and not the 
bosses, who are protected by an aura of respectability and legality 
because they are never caught in the act.
<P>
	With the new provisions in my colleague's bill, the police could 
have the crime bosses condemned by demonstrating that they are 
living on the proceeds of organized crime.
<P>
	The proof would me made in two stages. First of all, if a person 
lives with or is habitually in the company of a member of a 
criminal organization or regularly frequents a habitual meeting 
place of a criminal organization or if the value of all the property 
possessed by that person has increased in a way that cannot be 
justified, that person would be deemed to be a member of the 
criminal organization.
<P>
	Once that presumption has been established, that person could be 
accused of living on the proceeds of organized crime. Conviction 
would carry a maximum penalty of ten years in prison, and the 
property acquired with the proceeds of organized crime would be 
forfeited to Her Majesty. Thus, law enforcement authorities would 
have the means to fight criminal organizations and to deal with the 
real cause of the problem.
<P>
	I think all of us should try to get better acquainted with the sad 
reality of the proliferation of criminal organizations. Nobody is 
protected against that problem, whether we live in Montreal or 
Quebec City.
<P>
	Our vulnerability lies in the very nature of organized crime. 
Experts agree that it should be defined as a constant conspiracy to 
make profits and get more power through the use of fear and 
corruption.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	That is why everyone is vulnerable. When an organization uses 
fear and corruption, it can get almost unlimited in scope. Each and 
everyone of us is afraid at the mere thought of being pressured or 
threatened by criminals.
<P>
	Right now, the Montreal area is prey to these types of criminals. 
Everything seems to indicate though that other regions, like mine, 
could very soon be controlled by  criminals, if it is not already the 
case. Therefore, we have to give our police and legal authorities the 
power they need to fight this social evil, while, of course, 
upholding the basic human rights of all individuals. This is exactly 
what 
<P>

<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONRESUMEDOFREPORTSTAGE">CONSIDERATION RESUMED OF REPORT STAGE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from May 3, consideration of Bill C-12, an 
act respecting employment insurance in Canada, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee; and of Group No. 3 of motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I stand today to speak on this bill that is before 
us. I think that the Bloc Quebecois has demonstrated much 
consistency from the very beginning, and what it is asking is that 
this bill be withdrawn and that the consultation process be started 
all over again on a new basis.
<P>
	All of us had a previous life before becoming members of this 
House. As for me, I was an unionist at the CSN. The way 
consultation is carried out in this House and the way it is carried 
out inside a democratic labour confederation are often like night 
and day because, when  it comes to bills, we often have specific 
groups come here to defend our idea.
<P>
	This time, many groups have come, but the government only 
heard what it wanted to hear.
<P>
	The bill before us is seriously flawed, the main flaw being that 
we need to have another consultation process to get broader input 
and to better hear what victims of this bill have to say.
<P>
	There are many things I want to discuss. Since I have only ten 
minutes at my disposal, I brought with me notes on the main 
aspects that I think should be reviewed, especially manpower 
policy and job training.
<P>
	I was at the CSN for a long time and I know that labour 
confederations, employers, all community groups, groups acting 
on behalf of welfare recipients and the unemployed have long been 
asking for the transfer of manpower training, that is, for the return 
to Quebec of a structure that we already know very well because 
Travail Quebec centres also have training programs.
<P>
	Constituents are constantly coming to my office and are telling 
me this: ``Mr. Bachand, we do not know whom to turn to when it 
comes to manpower training. There are some fifty programs on the 
federal side and as many on the provincial one''. Of course, when it 
comes to manpower or occupational training, there is a large 
consensus in Quebec and we have difficulty understanding why the 
government always insists on remaining active in this area of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I also had a quick look at the whole reform, and examined the 
numbers involved perhaps just a bit more carefully. We think the 
reform is very negative because it is unfair. It is unfair because, 
under the present system and depending on the regions where they 
live, some people must work 15 hours a week for 12 to 15 weeks, or 
between 180 and 300 hours, before becoming entitled to UI. From 
now on, they will have to work 35 hours a week for 12 to 20 weeks, 
that is to say between 420 and 700 hours.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It is understandable that in regions where there is more work, 
people are expected to work for longer periods. Nevertheless, the 
government is doubling the number of hours required to be eligible 
for unemployment insurance. The Minister of Finance, who is 
among us today, must be happy with the measure presented by his 
colleague. This measure will inject more money into the fund, 
which already receives quite a lot of money. The minister will no 
doubt use it to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	Naturally, it is the unemployed and welfare recipients who will 
suffer most since, in today's context, which is the complete 
opposite of what the Liberals promised-that is jobs, jobs, 
jobs-when your unemployment insurance benefits run out, you 
become a  welfare recipient. We often hear the federal ministers 
say that they have created thousands of jobs since they came to 
power. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2344"> 2344 </A></B>
<P>
What they do not say is that there were also job losses. When we 
look at the figures, we note that there are fewer jobs now than there 
were when this government came to power. This explains why the 
minister is presenting us a reform that, once more, will penalize the 
most disadvantaged.
<P>
	We could also mention the people who are just starting to work. 
We all remember our first day at work. We were very happy to 
come back home with a paycheck and be able to say that finally we 
were contributing to society and were recognized as workers. Many 
young people have a job paid at minimum wage. From now on, 
they will have to pay employment insurance premiums and work 
910 hours to become eligible. If you have a weekend job in a 
McDonald's and work only ten hours a week, it takes time to 
accumulate 910 hours. Therefore, this reform is unfair for new 
workers also.
<P>
	This reform is also regressive because it causes a lot of 
distortion. The bill only succeeds in getting more money for the 
fund. However, it introduces a lot of negativism, and I have just 
described a part of that. But the fact that the maximum insurable 
earnings are being lowered from $42,000 to $39,000 means that a 
person earning more than $39,000 will not pay premiums anymore. 
So instead of hiring another employee, employers will ask their 
present workers to work overtime because over $39,000 the 
employer and the employee pay no more premiums. This measure 
is not conducive to job creation.
<P>
	At the present time, society is thinking about job sharing. When 
one wants to stimulate job creation to give work to more people, 
this is exactly the kind of measure that is counterproductive 
because employers and employees will seize the opportunity to do 
overtime, thus avoiding paying unemployment insurance 
contributions since maximum insurable earnings are set at $39,000.
<P>
	The measure will also create poverty because not only will 
people be told that there is less work, but their benefits will also be 
reduced. The shortening of the benefit period will throw more 
people on social assistance. We saw the impact of the changes 
implemented in 1994 on social assistance in Quebec. There was a 
major increase in the number of social assistance recipients and the 
provinces, not the federal government, have to foot the bill.
<P>
	The federal government can argue that it makes transfers for 
social assistance programs, but we know that those transfers 
decrease steadily. Meanwhile, Quebec taxpayers have to pay 
through their Quebec taxes for the federal withdrawal from these 
jurisdictions. In the 1994 reform, there were $2.4 billion in cuts for 
all of Canada, including $735 million for Quebec. The new 
measures represent a further loss of $600 million for Quebec. So, 
since 1994, we lost about $1.3 billion for the unemployed.
<P>
	This is a terrible blow for areas crippled by unemployment. As I 
said, this means that less federal funds will be made available and 
that more people will end up on welfare.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I also said that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of 
Industry must be very happy.
<P>
	If we consider the principles and duties of a government that is 
supposed to redistribute wealth, we wonder what the industry 
minister is doing. He goes around telling businesses like Bell and 
the financial institutions: ``You should not lay people off. You 
should be careful. The good way to redistribute wealth and to 
create more jobs is to keep people at work''.
<P>
	On the other hand, the minister is a lot less in a hurry to 
introduce bills dealing with the banks which made profits of $5 
billion and Bell which made $2 or $3 billion profit while 
continuing to lay people off. The government is quick to attack the 
disadvantaged, those who are jobless and desperate.
<P>
	We have also seen that the government is quick to close debates. 
We are speaking on behalf of the 1.4 million unemployed 
Canadians, 414,000 of whom are in Quebec. We are going to tell 
these people that we were not given enough time to defend 
ourselves. Who will defend these people if not the Bloc Quebecois? 
We do not defend Quebecers only, but Canadians as well. And the 
government has just told Canadians and Quebecers that it will not 
allow them to express their views any longer because it wants to 
ram its bill through and, in order to do that, it will impose time 
allocation to prevent us from acting as the government's 
conscience. That is our job here, but we are prevented from doing 
it.
<P>
	So we will be more than happy to show Canadians what kind of 
government they are dealing with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise at noon today to speak to Bill C-12, a 
bill which, by the way, the official opposition is prevented from 
debating as fully as it would have wished because of the gag you 
have just allowed, when all we want is to defend the poorest 
members of Canadian society.
<P>
	First of all, Bill C-12 sets out to change the name 
``unemployment insurance'' to ``employment insurance'', as 
though it were a disgrace to draw UI benefits. So, from now on, it 
will be called employment insurance.
<P>
	I had a discussion with a member of the Liberal government, 
who tried to win me over to his way of seeing things by explaining 
that employment insurance should operate on the same principle as 
car insurance, the idea being that if you have a car accident, fine, 
two accidents, not quite so fine, and, after three, your insurance 
rates go up because you are a high risk case.  This same MP tried to 
convince me that seasonal workers depended on UI for a living. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2345"> 2345 </A></B>
<P>
Since those who grow Christmas trees, woodcutters, or fishermen, 
for example, must turn to UI year after year, they would be poor 
clients for the insurance company, which would either have to raise 
its rates or lower its benefits.
<P>
	Imagine, for a moment, that you are ill, at a low ebb, you have 
cancer perhaps. And their idea of gratitude is to bump up your 
health insurance premiums, whether or not you can afford it. Or 
perhaps they would say: ``You are ill, we will take less care of 
you''. Yes, just like you are going to do with employment 
insurance. You will penalize the so-called frequent users. It is 
crazy.
<P>
	Worse yet, the surplus in the fund this year will be over $5 
billion. Those $5 billion will be taken mainly from the workers' 
pockets, in a variety of ways, but particularly by increasing the 
number of weeks worked.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Your reply will be that I have misunderstood, that what we are 
looking at is not insurable weeks any more, it is hours. But in your 
calculations-of course I mean the government's calculations-a 
week is 35 hours, but all hours are counted. So the logger slogging 
away in the woods could accumulate ten 84 hour weeks. With his 
10 weeks at 84 hours a week, he would become eligible after 10 
weeks, because that would total 840 hours, assuming he is not a 
first time user of UI. He would be eligible because the 840 would 
be divided by 35, which would give more than the 20 or 22 weeks 
required.
<P>
	Now to take the example of Mrs. Blouin, of Saint-Nazaire Street 
in Thetford Mines. She works at Cooprix, a supermarket, and 
averages 15 to 24 hours a week. Because the unemployment rate in 
the Chaudière-Appalaches region is 8 per cent, this lady will have 
great difficulty in becoming eligible for unemployment insurance 
benefits.
<P>
	According to Bill C-12, and using the example of the 
Chaudière-Appalaches region with its 8 per cent unemployment, 
this lady would have to work 18 weeks at 35 hours a week which, 
by my calculations, makes 630 hours. This lady works a very few 
hours, although she would love to have 35 hours a week. There just 
is not enough work.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that, in the various regions, 
calculation of the unemployment rate is sometimes very 
roundabout, I would not go so far as to say the figures are fiddled 
with, but obtained in a roundabout way, yes. It is strange, however, 
that in the Chaudière-Appalaches region the rate of unemployment 
is only 8 per cent, down 2 per cent in the past three years, yet there 
has been a 4 per cent increase in welfare recipients.
<P>
	So there we have the see saw effect, take people away from the 
UI side and put them onto the welfare side. To all intents and 
purposes, the federal government assumed  an area of provincial 
jurisdiction in 1940, imposing itself on an area that was not within 
its purview, over the objections of Maurice Duplessis. Now, in 
order to make that area more cost-effective, it is pushing the most 
disadvantaged off onto an area of provincial jurisdiction, namely 
social assistance. You will share my opinion that the trick of 
changing unemployment insurance into employment insurance is 
both mean spirited and crooked.
<P>
	It had been the wish of the Bloc to withdraw eligibility from 
those who leave jobs of their own free will. In the bill, those who 
quit would have serious difficulties in drawing employment 
insurance, unemployment insurance benefits. It is comical to see 
how the folks in the Liberal Party are changing their tune.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	In 1990, when it was in the opposition, the Liberal Party had 
emphatically and fiercely objected to the conservative 
government's plan to penalize workers who voluntarily quit their 
jobs. You know as well as I do what is going on in some plants. 
Their was an article in <I>La Presse</I> two weeks ago saying that some 
plant managers literally exploit their employees. Many of them 
have to quit before they drop dead on the job or suffer a breakdown. 
Their notice of termination of employment indicates that they left 
of their own will. Some employers-fortunately not all of them but 
their will always be some-take advantage of their employees and 
will do it even more in the future.
<P>
	The hon. member for Malpeque, fortunately for him, was not a 
member of the House of Commons in 1990. Had he been part of the 
Liberal clan at that time, I believe he would have acted the same 
way. When Liberals were in opposition, that rule was not 
acceptable to them. It had to be eliminated in order to prevent 
abuse. Now that they are in power, the Liberals once more take 
advantage of the neediest.
<P>
	Another measure I find deplorable is that all gains over $39,000 
are no longer insurable. In return, the maximum amount of benefits 
to which workers could be eligible will be reduced. Since my time 
is already up, I would like to urge this government and the finance 
minister to look at other avenues, other alternatives before 
reducing their deficit on the back of the most disadvantaged 
people.
<P>
	I invite the finance minister, through you Mr. Speaker, to register 
all his boats in Canada and to pay a little more income tax. He can 
afford it. I also invite him, when he purchases new ships, to buy 
them in Canada rather than in Asia, for instance. That would create 
jobs here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on 
the employment insurance bill since it has  dominated the best part 
of the last 18 months of my being here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2346"> 2346 </A></B>
<P>
	The system has worked in large measure. The social security 
review took place and a committee of Parliament went across 
Canada talking about our social programs and how they might be 
reorganized. I will be the first to acknowledge that not all the things 
that people asked were done, but as a member of the committee I 
can tell members that people were listened to and those 
interventions had an impact.
<P>
	The minister put forward a bill after that exercise. While a good 
start on the reform, it had some flaws. Rather than stubbornly 
holding to the bill, significant amendments have not only been 
allowed or accepted but actually encouraged.
<P>
	That is evidence the system can work and that these pieces of 
legislation can be significantly improved in the interest of 
Canadians, and in our case specifically seasonal workers in all 
parts of Canada, certainly in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Three major amendments we have witnessed have to do with the 
so-called intensity rule, the gap and the divisor. I will speak 
specifically about the benefits of the bill so that those who are 
involved in debate will realize exactly what it is they would have us 
not do if they got their way and were able to through the bill out.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Specifically, because of the shift from weeks to hours as the 
measure of eligibility, essentially the government is saying that if a 
person works a 70 hour week, which many people in Atlantic 
Canada are very familiar with, with this change the employee is 
getting the value of two weeks under the existing law. In other 
words, someone who works 70 hours gets the value of one week. 
After this amendment, the value of 70 hours will be two weeks for 
all intents and purposes. That means that on average many people 
in my part of Canada will get into the UI system more easily than 
has been the case for many years. This is probably the first time in 
six or seven years that the system has been more accessible rather 
than less accessible.
<P>
	Because the value is on hours rather than on weeks, at the end of 
the claim there is an additional period of eligibility because 
eligibility is based on how much one works. If the number of weeks 
worked is limited, regardless if it was 15 hours a week or 75 hours a 
week, under the present rules it is one week. With the new system 
every hour will be counted. On average for Atlantic Canada it will 
mean about two additional weeks of eligibility at the end of a 
claim. That is very important.
<P>
	Ultimately the effect is that we are allowing more people in the 
current labour pool, the people who are in and out of the program 
regularly, more access to a nationally based income redistribution 
program.
<P>
	There are those in the third party who are very negative, to be 
polite, about the social policy aspects of the unemployment 
insurance program. It is important to accept and understand the 
extent of this very real and important element of EI, that there are 
communities, industries and families in the country that, while they 
can work for a period of time each year, cannot work all year and 
cannot make enough money during their working period to sustain 
the family year round. This is a very efficient way of dealing with 
the problem.
<P>
	I would accept that the first two budgets of the government had 
the effect of making unemployment insurance, soon to be 
employment insurance, harder to get. However, the amendment 
will go in the opposite direction and make the program more 
accessible. It is something very important to the people working in 
seasonal industries, particularly in Atlantic Canada but also across 
the country. That in itself is sufficient reason to applaud the 
government for the amendment.
<P>
	There is also the low income supplement. Families with incomes 
of less than $26,000 will see their benefits increased as much as 13 
per cent. That is again in keeping with the social policy objectives 
in the employment insurance program. That is good news 
particularly for those who simply cannot make enough money in 
part of a year to sustain a family. This should be applauded by all 
concerned for those families that receive less than $26,000.
<P>
	All those people who were held at 14 hours per week because 
their employer did not want to pay benefits will now have first hour 
coverage. I will be the first to admit it will be more difficult for 
first time entrants to get into the system. However, if they worked 
anything up to 14 hours in the past they had absolutely no access 
whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Because of the change in the way the employment benefits or 
non-income based aspects of the program are being reorganized 
many people will have access to employment benefits, the human 
resources investment fund benefits, who have been on 
unemployment insurance in the last three years, or five years if it 
was for maternity or sickness benefits.
<P>
	That means all of those people we have heard about who were in 
programs because they were eligible for unemployment insurance 
benefits will now be entitled to benefits after their income benefits 
are exhausted. That is a major improvement. We all know of cases 
where people were in programs and as soon as their income 
benefits were exhausted they were out of the program.
<P>
	This is a very contentious part of the bill. I would like to speak to 
its objective, that new entrants will have a harder time than in the 
past. That has often been brought to our attention. We will have to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2347"> 2347 </A></B>
<P>
deal with it. We will  have to improve it. We will have to recognize 
where the weaknesses and the faults are.
<P>
	Generally speaking, it is important for Canadians to talk about 
what it means when kids leave school to go into industries where 
ultimately they will be sustained only by a social program such as 
UI. I do not want that for my kids. I do not want to hold out for my 
children the possibility of going into an industry which in all 
likelihood will be short lived.
<P>
	They will be sustained only because of the existence of the 
unemployment insurance program. I recognize our obligation to 
the people who are there now. However, it is a difficult question for 
me whether we want to attract more people to those programs. I 
acknowledge our responsibility to replace the job opportunities 
with other opportunities for young Canadians, but I am not sure I 
can abide by an objective which would see people drawn into a 
system which would provide unemployment insurance as a means 
of livelihood well into the future.
<P>
	I strongly believe the system has to be improved and changed. 
When the bill was presented many of us were very concerned about 
its weaknesses. After doing our homework we were able to affect 
the outcome of law. I feel good about that. I thank the minister and 
my colleagues who joined with me in the process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to my colleague opposite and I would have thought that, 
following consultations with the various groups and organizations 
which appeared before the human resources development 
committee, he would be tempted to try to change the attitude of his 
government on this reform.
<P>
	The bill before us-and I am sure my colleague will agree-is 
based on very dubious assumptions. First, the government tells us 
that claimants abuse the system. This is totally wrong. When there 
are no jobs anywhere, when the campaign promise to create jobs is 
not kept, it is pretty hard to ask people to work. So it is not 
surprising that the number of unemployed has been continually 
rising since the 1993 election.
<P>
	Another assumption of this bill is that jobs are available.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Yes, and about those jobs that are available, we would like to 
know where they are, who they are for and how they could be 
filled.
<P>
	When we have no control over job training, we can ask why jobs 
are available, because training will be provided in areas where 
there is no need. Therefore, for this very reason, shortages develop 
in certain areas, in certain types of jobs, resulting in there being no 
takers. Is it the fault of the workers? No. I say no it is not the fault 
of the workers. It is the fault of the federal government, which  
cannot agree with the provinces to relinquish the field of job 
training to them.
<P>
	Training belongs to those closest to the people. We are too far 
removed here to know exactly what is happening in my region. So, 
let us leave it up to people in the regions to decide what sort of 
training they are going to give. So, let us leave it up to the 
provinces to look after things. That way, we can avoid useless 
expenditure.
<P>
	This bill, therefore, is not focussed on the real challenge of the 
social programs. There is only one way to meet the challenge of the 
social programs, and that is by creating jobs, and they have not 
managed to do so. Jobs, jobs, jobs is what they promised. There are 
none, and they have not created any either.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> We have created them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion: </B>They have not created any, they have created 
jobless individuals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Oh, no. We did create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Sure. It wakes certain people up when they are told 
that. Of course it is upsetting. It is distressing for them to be 
reminded of one of their promises. The one that brought them to 
power was the promise to create jobs, but they have not created 
any. Of course, it is hard to accept.
<P>
	I am really wondering about how we could make this 
government understand that a majority of Canadian citizens do not 
want this reform. How can we go about it? Everywhere we go, we 
are told this reform is inequitable, unfair and inefficient. Those are 
terms we often hear.
<P>
	It is a reform which will make citizens poorer still. And who are 
those who are becoming poorer? Mostly young people, women and 
those who will be left out. People will be stuck in the same vicious 
cycle: a small project here, an odd job there, then UI benefits, 
welfare and so on. It will become impossible to get out of this 
vicious cycle.
<P>
	This reform is ruining collective instruments we had elaborated 
here, based on a social consensus. People accepted to share some of 
the common wealth. Today, they do not care anymore about this 
great principle. They even use the UI fund surplus not to create jobs 
but precisely to reduce the deficit. This money would be better 
spent and more profitable if it were used to create jobs, all the more 
so since the government is no longer contributing to the fund. As a 
consequence, it now belongs to workers and employers.
<P>
	We have no right to take money in this fund belonging to those 
who pay into it. If we do so, it should not be to erase a deficit but to 
try to improve things for workers.
<P>
	I was in my riding last Saturday. I walked with union leaders, 
priests, seniors, young people, board of trade representatives, city 
councillors, business owners, men and women of common sense. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2348"> 2348 </A></B>
<P>
They were demonstrating  with me to tell the government they did 
not want this UI reform.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	So there was another demonstration. I did not see any activist 
behind it, although they say that all these demonstrations are 
organized by people who are paid to do so. I did not see that. It was 
organized by social services, humanitarian organizations and 
community groups, all ordinary people.
<P>
	However, not one single Liberal Party representative was present 
at that demonstration. None. There were no Liberals to answer 
people's questions. What I saw were ordinary people, people who 
want to change their lives, people who think restructuring work and 
the labour market is important, but that it should not be done the 
way it is being done now, with this bill.
<P>
	There was also a group which seized that opportunity to bring 
me a petition, a group of people from Ferland-et-Boilleau in the 
Chicoutimi riding, a town of approximately 680 people. More than 
three-fourths of them signed the petition. Unfortunately, I know we 
will have to vote on the bill this week and maybe there will not be 
time to have the petition certified by the clerk and tabled in the 
House. Therefore, I am speaking on their behalf. They said: 
``Please ask the government to abandon its unemployment 
insurance reform''.
<P>
	These small-town people are honest, hard-working and a good 
part of them do not have a steady job as we say. They do not have 
that opportunity over there. Why? Because most of them find their 
livelihood in logging and a few others in tourism. You will have 
understood that they are seasonal workers, and we know what the 
bill has in store for them. They know full well, they do understand 
that this reform will push several of them onto welfare. As welfare 
recipients, they will no longer depend on the federal government, 
but on provincial governments.
<P>
	This is another way to shovel the deficit and an ever increasing 
debt into the provinces' backyards. Seasonal workers can be found 
just about anywhere in the country. I say it again, they are the ones 
who are going to be the most severely penalized by this reform. 
Why? Because they cannot find work year round, a permanent job 
is a thing of the past. It does not exist any more, and the present 
reform does not take this fact into account.
<P>
	Sure, there are other kinds of seasonal workers: forestry workers, 
people working in the tourism industry, construction workers; we 
cannot say that the construction industry is very healthy in Canada 
right now. The housing sector is a bit like the fleet of taxis around 
here, it is going to ratchet.
<P>
	This means that the value of houses is decreasing because people 
can no longer afford to keep them in good repair, which has a 
domino effect on municipalities since they have to lower the 
assessment. We cannot say  that the construction industry is 
healthy. Work in this sector is truly seasonal.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Since you are indicating that my time is running out, I will stop. 
On Saturday, I was asked to do something else; people told me to 
make sure that the government would not adopt this reform. I could 
not make such a promise. When I make a promise, I try to keep it.
<P>
	There are a few hours left before we are called to vote on this 
reform; members opposite should be thinking about what has been 
happening in the last year and a half or two years since we have 
been talking about this reform, and realize people are going to be 
forced onto welfare because of it. They should change their mind.
<P>
	For the sake of all these people, of all the workers who do not 
waste their time drinking beer-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. member's time is 
expired. The hon. member for St. Boniface has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to this bill. We are creating jobs for young 
people and I want to share some facts with my colleagues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Here are some of the facts with respect to creating new 
opportunities for youth. I want to share a number of points. An 
estimated 39,000 young Canadians who cannot qualify for UI today 
will now qualify for employment insurance benefits once this bill 
becomes law. Funding for youth is being boosted by 22 per cent 
from $193 million last year to $236 million this year. That is a 
substantial amount.
<P>
	The Team Canada partnerships with provinces and businesses 
will give unemployed young people opportunities to develop hard, 
job ready skills. We recognize the difficulties facing many youths 
and students. As such, the Government of Canada will double its 
funding for summer student jobs in 1996.
<P>
	For young people, once this becomes law, every hour of work 
will now count. Weeks are often a poor measure of time spent on 
the job, particularly for part time workers and multiple job holders. 
Four out of ten part time workers in Canada are young people under 
25 years of age. Under employment insurance all work will be 
insured.
<P>
	Employment insurance will provide income protection for more 
young people if they work enough hours. The hours based system 
will remove the glass ceiling that limits part time workers, 
including many young workers, to less than 15 hours a week. This 
will benefit many young people who start out with a number of 
small jobs to gain work experience.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2349"> 2349 </A></B>
<P>
	As well, employment insurance will provide fairer premiums 
to many youth. About 625,000 young people will have their 
premiums refunded because they earn $2,000 a year or less. This 
represents nearly half of the 1.3 million who will receive the 
rebate.
<P>
	For students the new system will have little impact from one 
perspective. For example, a student who works 14 hours a week for 
$7 an hour would pay less than $3 a week in premiums. In return 
the work is insured which is a very important objective.
<P>
	Many youth will gain valuable experience with employment 
insurance's active employment benefits. The government is 
investing $800 million a year from employment insurance reform 
savings into direct, proven measures to get Canadians back to 
work. Several employment insurance employment tools will help 
get unemployed youth back to work.
<P>
	Targeted wage subsidies will help young people get to work and 
get the work experience they need to round out their résumés and to 
qualify for jobs in the new economy.
<P>
	Job creating partnerships will bring government and community 
groups together to give unemployed youth opportunities to gain 
hard, new, employable skills.
<P>
	These are but some of the measures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And here are some more. You certainly know that not everyone 
needs an employment benefit to find a new job. The national 
employment service will help young people to find jobs in new and 
emerging industries and to receive training for 21st century jobs.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	At the present time, two million Canadians, including many 
young people, use information and counselling services to look for 
jobs. A reinforced and automated job market information system 
will tell young people where there are jobs available.
<P>
	Human Resources Development Canada staff will also show 
young people how to be more efficient in their job search, through 
new services, especially group information sessions designed to 
speed up as much as possible their return to the work force.
<P>
	Investing in our youth is the top priority of this government and 
an essential part of our job strategy. Youth unemployment is 
presently around 16 per cent. That is one and a half times more than 
the national average. Many young people go to school and rely on 
their summer job, or on a more regular job, to pay for their studies 
and to acquire the work experience they really need.
<P>
	The government recognizes the difficult situation in which 
young people are. That is why it has taken several initiatives to 
respond to their concerns. We recognize  that a post-secondary 
diploma is becoming an essential element of job stability. The 
budget is allocating an additional $165 million over three years to 
help students and their families meet the increasing cost of 
education.
<P>
	To assist young people, we are extending the eligibility to the 
allowance for child care expenses in order to help a greater number 
of young parents working nights or going back to school.
<P>
	Easier student loan repayment provisions will also give our 
young people a break. Young graduates will be in a better position 
to repay their loans when they have joined the labour force. All 
these measures show the absolute priority we place on giving our 
young people a leg up in an increasingly competitive and hard 
market.
<P>
	I have just shared with my colleagues some facts which are 
rarely discussed by opposition members, in fact, which they do not 
even mention. Members opposite saw it as their role to attack the 
bill. I recognize that role as basic in a democracy such as ours. But 
I would have appreciated receiving concrete and specific 
suggestions, with related costs, as to how the bill could be 
improved. In addition to criticism, we would like to hear some 
solutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I was saying, I have shared with my colleagues a number of 
key points with respect to this legislation. These are facts. If 
opposition members wish to dispute them, they may do so. I would 
be delighted to respond.
<P>
	I find it surprising that they would not have put the positives as 
well as that which they see as potential negatives in front of us. We 
would then have a more balanced picture of what it is that is 
happening.
<P>
	It is unfortunate there are no specifics costed out, potential 
responses to those weaknesses which they see. That would have 
improved not only the dialogue, the debate, the exchange, the 
discussion but perhaps even this legislation.
<P>
	Having made those points, I would hope that in the spirit of the 
democratic ideal of this House of Commons we would look at that 
which is good and no matter what our political party allegiance, say 
it. Then look at that which can be improved on and indicate how 
that might be so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I conclude with these few comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the member for St. Boniface criticized the official opposition, I 
have no choice but to reply to him. The hon. member comes from a 
very nice region where the francophonie thrived and is still alive. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2350"> 2350 </A></B>
<P>
However, people in his region cannot get a daily French newspaper, 
only a weekly one.
<P>
	I discussed this issue with the hon. member for St. Boniface 
about a year ago, but the situation has not changed.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The member, who spoke eloquently about education during most 
of his speech comes from a province that, since about the beginning 
of the century, has been violating the rights of French speaking 
people to education in their own language. I find it hard to 
understand the member's sudden interest for education and youth.
<P>
	If he is serious about giving his attention to this issue, he should 
read the Constitution carefully. He will probably be surprised to 
find out that education and training are two areas that come under 
provincial jurisdiction. This is not a statement made by bad 
separatists: it is, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on which 
side of the House one sits, spelled out in the Constitution. We are 
simply asking the government to comply with the Constitution.
<P>
	We are told that we only criticize, that we do not fulfil our 
responsibility to propose positive changes. I remind the hon. 
member that about 75 per cent of all those who sent submissions to 
the human resources development committee opposed Bill C-12. 
As elected representatives we represent people and we say that this 
bill, as the hon. member for Chicoutimi said earlier, is 
unacceptable to them.
<P>
	If Bill C-12 is so promising for young people, how-I too will 
conclude by asking the member a question-can we accept that, if 
it is passed, a new entrant will have to have worked three times 
more than under the current system, that is 910 hours? This 
requirement alone shows how absurd Bill C-12 is in the way it 
treats young people. If the member can, at some point, provide an 
answer I want him to explain how this requirement of 910 hours, 
which is three times the number currently required in the case of 
young people or women who apply for the first time. These were 
my answers to the member for St. Boniface, along with a question.
<P>
	Before getting on with my speech as such, I want to congratulate 
two members whom I know very well-there were certainly others 
who were out there this past weekend-and one of them even got a 
sunburn during the demonstration. I am referring to the hon. 
member for Chicoutimi who, along with local interest groups, 
succeeded in getting over 1,000 people to protest against Bill C-12, 
and the hon. member for Témiscamingue, who also convinced 
many of his constituents to come protest and show their discontent 
regarding this bill. I believe that people in every riding and region 
have shown their dissatisfaction with this legislation.
<P>
	However, the best way to avoid all these problems with Bill C-12 
remains job creation. Government, however, does not create jobs. 
We have seen how ineffectual this government is in that field also.
<P>
	In my riding, there are two groups that are creating jobs. Since 
we are talking about unemployment insurance, employment 
insurance and jobs, I want to point out the outstanding work done 
by these two groups. I will start with the Société de développement 
économique de la Rive-Nord, under the chairmanship of Raymond 
Gervais.
<P>
	This economic development corporation, which brings together 
the communities of the regional county municipality of 
L'Assomption, is doing outstanding work. With the stakeholders 
and the businessmen and women in the community, this economic 
development corporation seeks to attract businesses to our area and 
has had more than its fair share of success at it. It has a pretty good 
record of job creation, I want to emphasize that.
<P>
	There is also the Société de développement économique des 
Moulins inc., which forms the other part of my riding, that is the 
regional county municipality of Les Moulins, except for the city of 
Mascouche; its chairwoman, Lise Brouillette, is doing a 
tremendous work to attract and keep businesses and to help create 
and maintain jobs in the area. Hats off to the Société de 
développement économique de la Rive-Nord, as well as to the 
Société de développement économique des Moulins inc.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	These two organizations work day in and day out to create jobs. 
When I last spoke on Bill C-12, Mr. Speaker, I mentioned to my 
Liberal colleagues the problem with the Terrebonne employment 
centre which does not make any sense.
<P>
	Let me remind those who might have forgotten or not heard 
about it that the Terrebonne employment centre was affected by the 
infamous employment centres restructuring, as improvised as the 
infamous constitutional process, and was asked, summoned or 
ordered to move to a brand new building the federal government 
has rented for ten years in order to meet the required standards.
<P>
	Even before the official opening of the new employment centre, 
not a few weeks after but before the opening, the director of the 
centre received a nice letter asking him to inform his staff that in a 
few months time, within a year or two, the number of employees 
would have to be reduced from around a hundred down to 10 or 15.
<P>
	This is truly the way to destroy the climate in a workplace. This 
is truly the way to inspire the people hired to help young people, 
women and everybody to find a job. Instead of trying to encourage 
the people who  try to help others find a job, we crush them by 
sending them a letter in which they are told, even before the official

opening of their brand new centre, that it will be closed and they 
will have to move. We do not know when, we do not know where, 
but do not worry.
<P>
	The homeowners, the children in school and the people in that 
community cannot accept what is going on, and I, as their member, 
cannot accept it either. That is why however often we speak of 
unemployment insurance-and I can say it in this House-we will 
never accept this decision on the Terrebonne employment centre.
<P>
	Now, as for the bill itself, as I said a little while ago to my 
colleague from St. Boniface who prides himself on having 
implemented, contrary to what he used to say when he was in 
opposition, a system that is truly against the people, how can he 
accept and tell the people that 75 per cent of the briefs that were 
presented to the human resources committee havbe been ignored? 
Some 75 per cent of the briefs that were tabled expressed serious 
reservations,or simply called for the withdrawal of Bill C-12.
<P>
	Even researchers hired by the department to assess the reform 
expressed serious reservations, and one of them is Marc Van 
Audenrode. He said: ``If we can easily imagine what the impact of 
a specific amendment on one aspect of a system would be, it is 
almost impossible to imagine what the consequences of an as deep 
a reform as the one proposed would be. I could, like many other 
economists, give a very precise evaluation of what, I think, the 
consequences of reduced benefit periods or replacement rates 
would be, but I cannot give even a hint of what the consequences of 
the proposed reform would be and, frankly, I do not think any 
economist can''. My colleague from St. Boniface has probably just 
got his degree in economics, because he gave us all the figures 
demonstrating that it was a good thing to cut young people and 
women off and to ask them to work three times longer to be eligible 
for unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	I want to quote some briefs that were tabled. ``The two-tier 
system created by this legislation goes against the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it discriminates against 
women and young people. The government is blaming those who 
have to live with decisions dictated by financial considerations''. 
That was from the Syndicat de la fonction publique du Québec. 
Another brief that was submitted says this: ``The potential 
advantages of a system based on the number of hours worked are 
nullified by the increased number of hours labour force entrants or 
re-entrants, or other people, must accumulate to become eligible 
for benefits. A disproportionate number of women and young 
people belong to the labour force entrant or re-entrant category''. 
That was from the Fédération des femmes du Québec.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Some will say that all these comments are from Quebec. Here is 
one from the Canadian Union of Public Employees. ``Benefits will 
be reduced through a number of proposals. This reduction is 
economically and morally unjustified. The proposals will have 
severe repercussions on women who earn less than men in general 
and who will receive benefits that will be much lower than those 
paid to men''. Again, that was from the Canadian Union of Public 
Employees.
<P>
	I will read you one more comment-I have several others-that 
comes from the Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Labour. 
``The use of family income to determine eligibility (to the family 
supplement) is discriminatory against women. We are opposed to 
the dilution of unemployment insurance through a form of income 
support similar to welfare; if this measure is adopted, it should not 
have the effect of making women even less independent''. Those 
were some of the comments-and there are many 
more-indicating that the majority of people, not only in Quebec, 
who have anything to do with this bill are strongly opposed to it. 
That is the most astonishing thing.
<P>
	As for manpower training, it should not even be an issue. In 
Quebec, everybody agrees that manpower training should be the 
responsibility of the province. It is a unanimous opinion. Even 
Ghislain Dufault, who could be cited as an example, agrees that the 
federal government should withdraw, that it would be much 
simpler.
<P>
	In conclusion, the minister talked about abusers. We also have 
statistics on abusers. We were told that this bill would eliminate 
abuse or reduce the number of abusers. The percentage of benefits 
received by abusers among unemployment insurance recipients is 
0.0068 per cent. If, for less than 1 per cent, the government is 
willing to make everybody pay, we will certainly not support such a 
measure.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this 
debate we have heard a great many wild claims from the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois about the negative impacts of Bill C-12.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc have made no secret of the fact that they do 
not like the legislation. It is rather disappointing to see a party 
allow its ideologically driven aspirations for a separate Quebec 
completely override a fact driven interpretation of the bill.
<P>
	What seems very clear is that members of the Bloc cannot 
possibly support changes that will improve a federal program to 
help more Canadians get and keep jobs and that will, in fact, create 
up to 100,000 new jobs for workers, both in Quebec and across 
Canada. It would  be an admission that Canada can be made to 
work better for all Quebecers and all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2352"> 2352 </A></B>
<P>
	They have not looked at this legislation on its merits. They 
simply make a series of outrageous claims which bear little or no 
relationship to the reality of the bill, claims which I believe must be 
responded to so that all Canadians, including Quebecers, 
understand the true nature of this very progressive and very 
necessary piece of legislation.
<P>
	The member for Mercier, for example, said that the lower 
revenues of $900 million resulting from a reduction in the 
maximum insurable earnings will be made up by those: ``who 
currently do not pay unemployment insurance contributions''. The 
member for Louis-Hébert says: ``Making part time workers, 
students and so on contribute will bring $900 million into the 
unemployment insurance fund and what makes that measure so 
pervasive is that it will allow the government to give the money to 
the richer workers''.
<P>
	What are the facts? Of the 500,000 workers who will have their 
work insured for the first time, 76 per cent or 380,000 will have 
their premiums refunded. The remaining 120,000 new premium 
payers will pay a total of $14 million and they will be eligible to 
claim benefits if they become unemployed.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	That is not all. Nine hundred and twenty thousand low income 
individuals who are paying premiums today will have about $30 
million in premiums refunded. Also, while more part time workers 
will be insured under EI, fewer of them will actually pay 
premiums. As a group they will pay $6 million less in premiums 
than they do today.
<P>
	The biggest impact of moving to first dollar coverage in terms of 
premiums payments will be a lifting of the weekly maximum. This 
will mean that individuals with high weekly incomes will pay their 
fair share of premiums for the first time.
<P>
	What is more, 350,000 low income claimants with families will 
now be eligible for a supplement which will increase their benefits 
to up to 80 per cent of weekly earnings from the standard 55 per 
cent rate. On average, this means an increase in income of some 12 
per cent. In addition, they will be exempt from the intensity rule by 
which repeat users will see a modest reduction of benefits. As well, 
people will also be able to earn up to $50 per week while on claim 
without having their benefits reduced.
<P>
	The facts are the opposite of what the Bloc members have been 
saying. Low income workers are not financing the reduction of the 
MIE. Low income workers will see their situation improve under 
this legislation.
<P>
	The member for Mercier also claims that by reducing the MIE 
the government is giving a gift to major  corporations and workers 
earning between $39,000 and $42,000. First, reducing the MIE to 
$39,000 means that it will be about 17 per cent above the average 
wage in the year 2000. Left alone it would have grown to about 47 
per cent above the average.
<P>
	While some high income earners and their employers will pay a 
bit less in premiums, which works out to about $150 a year, it also 
means high income workers will receive substantially less in 
benefits; nearly $2,340 less. As the House can see, what the 
member for Mercier is saying and what are the facts are two very 
different things. That can hardly be categorized as a gift to high 
income workers.
<P>
	I want to bring a matter to the floor of the House. The member 
for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans adds that women will not 
be able to meet the requirement as it will mean 910 hours of work a 
year. First, the 910 hours to qualify for EI benefits only applies to 
the first year in the labour market for a new entrant or a re-entrant 
in order to establish a reasonable attachment to the labour market 
before being eligible for insurance benefits. By the second year, 
provided the person has at least 490 hours of work in the first, they 
need only meet the variable entrance requirement of 420 to 700 
hours. It does not go on year after year, as has been suggested by 
members opposite.
<P>
	The reason for this change is very obvious. That low first time 
entry requirement can encourage young people to take temporary, 
unstable work rather than completing their education. The message 
to young people is clear. Do not drop out of school with a plan to 
work in a low wage job for a few months, then live off EI benefits. 
You will have to work longer to qualify and the new rules will also 
require you to do a lot more to find work.
<P>
	Members opposite should also be aware that there are special 
provisions for women re-entering the labour force. They will be 
eligible for the new re-employment measures for up to five years 
after leaving the labour force rather than the three-year limit for 
regular claimants.
<P>
	The member for Ahuntsic claims that the reform is an attack 
against seasonal workers. This is very close to my heart and to 
many people in this place and to part time workers. He states that 
eligibility requirements have been tightened. What the member 
does not say is that about 90,000 individuals who become 
unemployed today and cannot qualify for UI, will qualify for EI 
benefits. This includes 45,000 seasonal workers who have long 
hours of work but not enough insured weeks to qualify for benefits. 
It also includes about 45,000 part time workers and multiple job 
holders who have none or only certain weeks of their work insured 
today.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	The member should also know that the amendments presented in 
the committee to address the issues of gaps  in income of workers 
in seasonal jobs plus the new divisor rule will greatly help workers 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2353"> 2353 </A></B>
<P>
in seasonal industries by providing them with a longer period to 
access eligibility for benefits.
<P>
	When we look at the facts versus what is being said by members 
opposite it is obvious that this is very good legislation which will 
help a large number of people.
<P>
	I want to use this opportunity to set the record straight on part II 
of Bill C-12. The member for Mercier criticized Bill C-12 for not 
contributing to getting the unemployed back to work. She said: 
``We claim, and we have every evidence to support our claim, that 
not only does the bill not guarantee a job, nor promote job creation, 
but also that it is anti-job''. This is false and I want to set the record 
straight.
<P>
	Employment insurance is a full employment system. It provides 
the framework for providing practical, proven measures which will 
help Canadians get back to work quickly and keep working. Of the 
$2 billion in savings achieved by EI, $800 million or 40 per cent 
will be reinvested in active re-employment measures. That will be 
added to the $1.9 billion the government already spends out of 
general revenues. A total of $2.7 billion will be going to address 
structural unemployment.
<P>
	The active employment measures designed to help Canadians 
get back to work quickly include wage subsidies, income 
supplements, support for self-employment, community job 
partnerships and skills, loans and grants. They will help up to 
400,000 Canadians to find work and get back to work. On top of 
that, a $300 million transitional job fund is being put in place to 
stimulate job creation in high unemployment areas.
<P>
	Despite the overwhelming evidence that the Government of 
Canada is working closely with the provinces to better co-ordinate 
support programs for unemployed Canadians, the member for 
Quebec still claims that unemployment insurance is funded by the 
provinces and that it is the federal government that tells the 
provinces what kind of programs and what kind of measures must 
be implemented to help those who cannot find a job. That statement 
is wrong on two counts. First, it is employers and employees who 
fund the program through their premiums, not the provinces. 
Second, the bill sets out a framework for new federal-provincial 
agreements on labour market arrangements aimed at eliminating 
duplication and overlap.
<P>
	The bill permits a variety of flexible delivery methods for 
employment measures. I want members opposite to realize that 
people in Quebec are not going to buy into the rhetoric. What they 
want are the facts. What I have laid before the House are the facts. I 
wish members opposite would take the time to read the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

Napanee. Gibbard designs and crafts some of the world's finest 
furniture.
<P>
	Gibbard furniture can be found abroad in private homes and in 
more than 70 Canadian embassies. Most recently, Gibbard has 
expanded into the Japanese marketplace, where the exceptional 
craftsmanship and quality wood that goes into their furniture is 
appreciated. Bruce McPherson, Sr., tells me that the Japanese are 
especially interested in the solid cherry furniture produced in their 
historic Napanee landmark.
<P>
	Founded in 1835 by John Gibbard, the company is celebrating 
160 years in business. Four generations of Gibbards and, since 
1940, two generations of the McPherson family have operated this 
firm.
<P>
	Congratulations to them, their predecessors and their talented 
employees on achieving an exceptional and well-deserved 
reputation. Please join me in wishing Gibbard Furniture Shops 
continued success into the next millennium.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
an attempt to do something about the government's poor track 
record in helping the unemployed find jobs, the constituents of 
Québec-Est formed Solidarité-emploi Laurentien, a not for profit 
organization bringing together the unemployed and employers in 
the Quebec City area.
<P>
	In two years, Solidarité-emploi has helped over 500 people in the 
region to find work. This is a real success story, and we 
congratulate the organizers, including president Suzanne Lessard, 
and encourage them to keep up their splendid work.
<P>
	There is one question, however. Should the government not 
provide them with adequate support, with the resources that they 
must have to continue operating? It seems not.
<P>
	Despite repeated requests, the minister will not see them. The 
federal Liberal government is not doing very well at creating jobs, 
but here we have an example of a local initiative achieving 
extraordinary success.

when the Liberals were looking for votes in the last election, the 
Prime Minister stated: ``There is not one promise I have made that I 
will not keep''. That was his first mistake.
<P>
	Then there is the GST. The finance minister has already 
apologized for not keeping the promise. The Deputy Prime 
Minister has resigned because the promise was not kept. However, 
the Prime Minister is still trying to buy his way out of the promise 
with our money. Now that is a real mistake.
<P>
	What about the promise that our social safety net would never be 
tampered with? Now the Liberals turn around and announce major 
plans to alter programs like CPP and UI. They have announced that 
25 per cent of seniors will have their benefits cut by 10 per cent. 
Health care and education have been hit by huge Liberal cuts to 
provincial transfers. On the Liberal promise to restore integrity to 
Parliament, it is now clear that there is no grit in integrity.

Mr. Speaker, Canadians everywhere have been asked repeatedly by

economic recovery. Families have had to lower expectations and 
communities have had to do more with less.
<P>
	At the same time, it is not just business as usual for giant oil 
companies, it is business better than usual. 1994 saw these 
companies receive more than $743 million in direct federal grants

triple this year at the same time as Canadians are paying record 
prices at the pumps.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last weekend, Lise Bissonnette, director of <I>Le Devoir</I>, was 
inducted into the Canadian Journalism Hall of Fame. This is a well 
deserved honour and sign of recognition for this great journalist.
<P>
	Throughout her career, Ms. Bissonnette has shown great 
research skills and been very rigorous in her interpretation of 
events, two essential qualities for a journalist.
<P>
	Moreover, we cannot ignore what we see as a major 
achievement: ensuring the survival and preserving the 
independence of <I>Le Devoir</I> in a context that is often and still 
difficult. This tour de force shows the strong will of this woman, 
for whom we have great respect and admiration.
<P>
	<I>Le Devoir</I> is an essential tool of Quebec democracy. We 
congratulate Ms. Bissonnette on doing an excellent job and hope <I>Le 
Devoir</I> will be around for a long time to come.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a stated 
objective of the fisheries minister's plan for revitalizing the 
commercial salmon fishery in B.C. is to reduce the size of the 
commercial fleet by 50 per cent. Eliminating 50 per cent of the 
fleet will do absolutely nothing to improve the economics of 
fishing if at the same time the fleet's catch is reduced by one-half, 
and that is what is happening.
<P>
	For example, last summer, the native's share of the commercial 
catch on the Fraser River under the aboriginal fishing strategy 
increased to over 50 per cent of the fish caught. With the Nisga'a 
soon to be guaranteed by treaty 27 per cent of the Nass River 
production and at least two other Nass bands yet to settle, the native 
allocation on the Nass will easily exceed 50 per cent of the catch. 
Allocations of this magnitude will be repeated coastwide as more 
than 40 treaties are concluded.
<P>
	It is readily apparent that the downsizing of the fleet by one-half 
which will occur under the minister's plan has only been prescribed 
to accommodate increased allocations to native only fisheries 
under treaties and aboriginal fishing arrangements.

	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville,

complain about the gasoline price gouging by the oil companies. 
This price fixing practice has long been a ploy by the gasoline 
industry to rob money from the pockets of hard working 
Canadians.
<P>
	Various individuals and groups have suggested a boycott of these 
gasoline companies. I have also asked the government to legislate 
an end to these price fixing tactics. To date nothing has been done 
and these multinationals continue to reap the benefits.
<P>
	I propose a solution to this situation. If our government 
exchanges surplus Canadian wheat for Iraqi oil I can assure the 
House it would go a long way toward providing food and medical 
supplies for the thousands of sick children and women in Iraq while 
helping some 30 million Canadians by reducing their gasoline 
prices to 45 cents per litre.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, May 6 to 12 is Emergency Preparedness Week in 
Canada. In declaring a special week, the federal government 
through Emergency Preparedness Canada joins with the provinces 
and territories in a nationwide effort to increase public awareness 
of the need to prepare for emergencies of all kinds.
<P>
	Every year at least some of our communities are hit by large 
scale emergencies and local disasters. Floods, forest fires, toxic 
spills, blizzards, tornadoes and industrial accidents are only a few 
of the natural or human caused events that can threaten lives, 
property, the environment and the local economy. While there is 
little Canadians can do to prevent these catastrophes, everyone 
should be prepared to deal with them.
<P>
	I therefore invite all members of the House and all Canadians to 
mark Emergency Preparedness Week by taking the time to inform 
themselves on how they can help safeguard themselves, their 
families and assist their communities before, during and after a 
disaster strikes.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the matter of the constitution, the Prime Minister is 
hiding behind Quebec's action to justify potential intervention by 
the federal government in the Bertrand case, which is aimed at 
denying Quebecers the fundamental right of deciding their future 
themselves.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
How can the federal government put itself in the position of 
blackmailing the Government of Quebec by making its non 
intervention in the Bertrand case conditional on Quebec's 
renouncing Quebecers' fundamental right to decide their future 
themselves?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I told the House last week, the 
litigation before the court has become of interest because of the 
position taken by the Government of Quebec. Simply stated, it is 
that neither the courts nor the Constitution of Canada can have any 
relevance to a declaration by Quebec of its sovereignty. That 
proposition of course is profoundly wrong.
<P>
	It is the question of whether the federal attorney general can 
assist the court in dealing with it that has attracted our attention. 
We are considering our position in relation to intervention. No 
decision has yet been made, but that is the reason we are 
considering it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a scrum this morning, the Prime Minister himself said 
that it would be much easier for the federal government not to 
intervene in the matter, provided the Government of Quebec agreed 
not to defend Quebecers' right to decide their own future. This is 
what the Prime Minister said this morning, in Montreal.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice why the federal government has now 
resorted to blackmail-there is no other way to describe 
it-against the Government of Quebec, when in fact the federal 
government has always implicitly recognized Quebecers' right to 
decide their future themselves by participating in the previous two 
referendums and by agreeing to accept the results?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the process of a population of a 
province or a country expressing itself by referendum is not new.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2358"> 2358 </A></B>
<P>
	Naturally, the opinion of the population when expressed by 
referendum is important. No one contests that. Nor does anyone 
contest the right of the population of Quebec to express itself on 
any such question.
<P>
	What has caught the attention of the national government is that 
the Government of Quebec in the litigation which raises the 
legality of l'avant de project de loi and Bill No. 1 has taken the 
position that after such a thing might occur, neither the 
Constitution nor the courts have any role or relevance in 
determining what would happen then, or in the declaration of 
sovereignty by the province of Quebec. That is a very fundamental 
issue.
<P>
	As I have indicated to the House, we are considering whether we 
can assist the court on those legal points. That is why we are 
considering intervention in that case. It has nothing to do with 
blackmail at all. It has to do with fundamental principles of law and 
the rule of law. That is what we have under consideration.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, by wanting to put to the test of law Quebecers' inalienable 
right to decide their future, is the federal government not placing 
itself in the untenable position of wanting in a way to put a legal 
interpretation before democracy and a people's choice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not believe democracy and 
the rule of law are incompatible concepts; the one is safeguarded 
by the application of the other.
<P>
	There are important aspects of the rule of law arising from the 
position taken by the Government of Quebec in the Bertrand 
litigation. It may be that after considering the position we 
determine that we will not intervene. It may be that we conclude 
the matter is so obvious there is no need for us to assist the court. 
We might also await the disposition of the first instance and 
determine whether intervention might be more useful on appeal. 
All these matters fall to be examined.
<P>
	In the meantime we are considering the position and I hope to be 
in a position in the coming days to make clear the course we will 
take.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government is throwing up a legal smoke 
screen to justify its intervention in the Bertrand case, which seeks 
to deny Quebecers the right to make a democratic decision about 
their future. And yet, lest it be forgotten, the federal government 
participated actively in both Quebec referendums.
<P>
	Since the government has allowed itself the luxury of a Minister 
for Intergovernmental Affairs, and since he is here, it is to him that 
I address my question.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs justify the 
fact that the federal government has never, until today, attempted to 
challenge the legality of the two referendums held in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, referendums in Canada, and this was also pointed out 
in the white paper on consulting the people of Quebec, are advisory 
in nature. When the Government of Canada participates in a 
referendum, it is because it wishes to give its point of view in this 
consultation. That is what the Government of Canada did during 
the two referendums in question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, would the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs admit 
that as long as his government thought it would win the 
referendums, it did not challenge their legality, but now that its 
back is to the wall, now that it knows it is going to lose the next 
referendum, it is trying everything it can think of to prevent 
Quebecers from making a decision about their future? That is the 
explanation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada had no reason to consider 
consultative referendums illegal, because by law a referendum 
must be consultative.
<P>
	But since the hon. member is looking for contradictions, he will 
find them in the interpretation of victory and defeat, during the last 
referendum, by the leader of the yes camp at the time, Jacques 
Parizeau, who said, should his camp lose, that the next time would 
not be so very far off, and that the yes side would then have its 
revenge, but, should his camp win, that it was time to turn the page, 
that the die is cast, that the decision was final. There is the 
contradiction.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

to-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

just very pleased the leader is here now. I really welcome-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The answer please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
members of the Reform Party first came to the House they made a 
very clear promise to the Canadian people about a new style of 
politics. Yet we have seen in the past two and a half years a series of 
Reform members of Parliament making what can only be most 
charitably described as the most inelegant, inappropriate, 
unacceptable statements ever heard in the Chamber.
<P>
	It would seem that if ever there has been a promise broken it has 
been broken by the leader and the members of the Reform Party in 
the way they have abused the House with that kind of language and 
the statements they have made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians will not be diverted from the issue at hand, and 
the issue at hand is the integrity of the government.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition they denounced NAFTA. 
Once in power they accepted it. When in opposition they said the 
CBC budget was sacred. Once in power they slashed it by $377 
million. When in opposition the Liberals wanted to kill the GST. 
Once in power they hid and harmonized it. In opposition the 
Liberals slammed every single policy the Conservatives dreamed 
up. Once in power they dressed up legislation and claimed it as 
their own.
<P>
	Which Liberal Party should Canadians believe, the Liberals in 
opposition who denounced every Tory policy, or the Liberals in 
government who have adopted those policies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. leader of the third party talks about what is to be 
believed.
<P>
	We can think of an example. About a month ago the member of 
Parliament for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley stood up in 
the House and outside the House and denounced with a most 
foolish allegation the existence of moles in intelligence operations. 
Now the same member totally denies those allegations and said 
they did not happen at all.
<P>
	When it comes to veracity and integrity, the Reform Party has 
nothing to tell anybody in the House or any Canadian. It shows day 
in and day out total disrespect for any form of integrity whatsoever.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister can bluster and fume all he wants, but for 
Canadians the issue is the integrity of the government and they will 
not be diverted from that.
<P>
	During the last election the Prime Minister promised to restore 
honesty and integrity to our institutions. He said that if it is in the 
red book it will be done.
<P>
	The government has kept less than 25 per cent of its red book 
promises. The Prime Minister now says it is unrealistic to expect 
the rest to be kept.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also said last week that politicians should 
not sign contracts to keep their promises. Correct me if I am wrong, 
but is the Prime Minister's signature not on page 1 of the red book?
<P>
	By failing to live up to its election promises, is the government 
now saying the Prime Minister's signature is not worth the red 
book it is written in?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the election campaign the hon. leader of the third 
party made a very clear commitment to the Canadian people that 
his party would stand for a degree of fairness, equity and justice of 
all Canadians. Yet we have seen repeatedly members of his caucus 
totally and completely disregard that commitment.
<P>
	When will this member and this party stand up and give 
Canadians and members of the House a very clear statement and 
undertaking on their belief in human rights in Canada? Or will they 
simply have to rely on the statement made by the Reform member 
from Kootenay East when he said nothing will be done about the 
situation?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources

response to a question that this was a serious matter. It is because of 
the number of people waiting and who have been informed 
improperly of their situation. They do not need to be made more 
anxious. They already have enough problems.

resolve the matter. I have been checking constantly on this. We 
have been calling people. We staffed the office even over the

writing, whichever was most appropriate.
<P>
	There is no excuse, as I said last week, for these kinds of errors. 
We attribute them to glitches in the technology the department has

they were trying to get elected and promises they broke once in

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

take in the messages and the answers we provide.
<P>
	Surely by this time the hon. member has had the opportunity to 
look at the red book, page 22, and understand the commitment we 
made to replace the GST and to come out with a different tax is 
being fulfilled by the Minister of Finance and by the government. 
That is very clear.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	As for the other promises, the latest estimates show we have 
accomplished well over 60 per cent of the commitments in the red 
book. Considering we are just halfway through our term, it seems 
we are ahead of schedule.
<P>
	I can commit to the hon. member that by the time we reach the 
election we will be able to tell her fully what is in the red book, 
being able to provide all those commitments we made. I know she 
will be glad to take the red book in hand, with the commitments 
made, when she applies for unemployment insurance after the next 
election.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
Minister of Finance actually kept his promise, I would be interested 
to know why he said in his press conference: ``We made a 
mistake''. It would seem incongruous.
<P>
	The promises the government has tried to keep have cost 
Canadians dearly: $1 billion to harmonize the GST, $2 billion to 
cancel and replace the EH-101 helicopters, and close to $1 billion 
for the privatization of the Pearson airport, all of which are 
Conservative policies from the last government. That is $4 billion 
of taxpayer money to try to keep a few red book promises, and the 
meter is still running.
<P>
	How much is the government willing to spend to cover up the 
fact the red book does not mean anything any more?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is clearly being very selective in her 
examples. The reality of the examples she used is that the major 
reforms and changes being made to the GST will provide enormous 
savings to small business. They will provide a harmonized tax 
which will save administration costs.
<P>
	The cancellation of the Pearson airport contract has meant untold 
millions of dollars for the Canadian consumer and taxpayer who 
would have been hosed by the previous government. On the 
cancellation of the Cadillac style helicopters, we were able to get 
Canadians a much better deal.
<P>
	It seems getting a good deal for taxpayers is the hallmark of a 
good government.

question is for the minister of immigration.
<P>
	Saturday's <I>La Presse</I> confirmed that the federal government 
mounted an exceptionally huge operation to award as many 
immigrants as possible their certificate of citizenship before 
October 20. However, on October 16, in response to a question by 
the Bloc Quebecois, the minister of immigration said, and I quote: 
``What is being done with respect to citizenship processing in the 
province of Quebec is nothing different from any lead up to any 
provincial campaign''.
<P>
	Given that the fears of the opposition are now confirmed, how 
does the immigration minister explain it as routine business? Was 
the government trying to hide this information?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us get the facts straight. Was it a dirty trick, as a 
major Quebec daily called it, a dirty trick in the usual sense of the 
word? Generally, the expression is used to describe something 
underhanded or illegal. Was citizenship granted to people illegally? 
The answer is no.
<P>
	Everyone who received a certificate of citizenship was entitled 
to one and was entitled to vote. Did my predecessor, now the 
Minister of the Environment, deny that the department was making 
a special effort to issue citizenship certificates? No.
<P>
	He said in this House, on October 16, that we were issuing 
citizenship certificates in this case as in any other government 
campaign. Those are the facts.

that in this case an unprecedented operation was mounted. They 
went into overdrive and worked every moment, including holidays.

operation run on the eve of the Quebec referendum was exactly the 
same as the one run in Ontario last year and the one currently

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On June 9, 1993, as opposition leader during a meeting with 
farm leaders, he stated: ``A Liberal government would call a 
producer plebiscite on barley marketing issues''. Would the Prime 
Minister still honour that result and call that question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman knows that he 
is not reflecting accurately the meeting on the date to which he 
refers.
<P>
	What the Prime Minister did say on that occasion, if I remember 
it correctly, are words to the effect that: ``no fundamental change in 
the Canadian Wheat Board would be undertaken or contemplated 
without the benefit of some kind of producer consultation.
<P>
	If the hon. gentleman recalls correctly, at that time the previous 
government was very much in the process of fundamentally 
altering the Canadian Wheat Board without the necessary legal 
authority to do it.
<P>
	We have put in place a consultative process through the western 
grain marketing panel, which is now completing its work. I expect 
to have its report before the end of June. Once that report is 
available for all to review and scrutinize, we will all have a more 
thorough, thoughtful and factual basis on which to make any future 
decisions that are required.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, politics sure is a strange animal.
<P>
	Immediately after the election, on November 13, the agriculture 
minister said at an annual meeting with Manitoba pool elevators 
with regard to plebiscites: ``They are the most appropriate vehicle 
by which to determine what farmer preferences are''. Does the 
minister still believe this or was that just a shot from the lip?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. gentleman knows from 
other questions in the House which I have  answered, I have not 
ruled out

the possibility of a plebiscite in appropriate circumstances in the 
future.

divisive and can make the problem worse rather than helping to 
solve it.

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Yesterday, thousands of Liberians were cramming on board a 
ship to flee chaos in Monrovia while rival factions kept on fighting. 
Civil war in Liberia has reached unsurpassed levels of violence, 
claiming many more victims. The number of casualties since 1989 
is estimated at more than 150,000.
<P>
	Can the minister give us an update on the situation in Liberia and 
tell us whether the peace talks planned for tomorrow and 
Wednesday in Accra, Ghana, will go ahead as scheduled?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member properly points out, the serious 
situation in Liberia has become even more extreme. The hoped for 
settlement was shattered this weekend by a major disruption and 
the emergence of a new conflict.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	The United Nations is seized with the matter. UN peacekeepers 
are still in the area and are attempting to restore order. All we can 
offer at this time is the strongest encouragement and support for the 
negotiations to take place.
<P>
	Because it is such a troubled situation and there are so many 
factions now in conflict, one cannot be overly optimistic other than 
to say that we support every initiative in Liberia by the United 
Nations at the present time. We certainly hope for and support the 
efforts being made to bring about negotiations in the next two or 
three days.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

<P>
	I have a supplementary for the minister. What is the exact role 
the Canadian government intends to play to facilitate the ongoing 
peace initiatives and diplomatic negotiations aimed at reaching a 
lasting ceasefire agreement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not a circumstance in which the Canadian government 
takes a direct role. That matter has been undertaken by other 
parties, particularly through the United Nations.
<P>
	I could comment that through the efforts of my colleague, the 
Minister for International Co-operation, we have been offering 
funds for democratic development to help in west African countries 
that are prepared to start developing support for democratic 
institutions for better government. We are prepared to continue to 
offer that support so there can be a ceasefire or an agreement to end 
the conflict.

extend that kind of democratic aid and assistance to that country to 
help rebuild its institutions.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as

the last year, appointed ombudsmen, one per bank.
<P>
	However, this morning Mr. Michael Lauber was named as the

The specific goal of the first Canadian banking ombudsman is to 
ensure that the banks live up to their responsibilities to the small

of the red book was jobs, jobs, jobs. The Liberals have also 
promised that they would stand behind seniors and protect their

reveals that their proposal to fix the Canada pension plan will kill 
thousands of jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2363"> 2363 </A></B>
<P>
	Is the Minister of Finance going to maintain benefits for seniors 
or is he going to increase payroll taxes, thereby killing thousands 
of jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the reason the government set up, along with the provinces, the 
commission which is currently going across the country to examine 
the CPP is precisely to deal with the question of the survival of the 
CPP. How will the CPP be maintained? The government stands 
four square behind it, as in fact do the provinces.
<P>
	At the same time, we are dealing with very real problems which 
have resulted from the inattention paid to them over the course of 
the last decade. It may well be that premiums will have to rise. It 
may well be that there will be changes in the benefits.
<P>
	The government has said very clearly that it will not accept the 
recommendations of the Reform Party which would eventually 
lead to the evisceration of the Canada pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
getting somewhere. We have an acknowledgement that benefits are 
going down and premiums are going up.
<P>
	This month, 150,000 young Canadians will be graduating from 
our universities. Hard working, educated and motivated young 
Canadians are going to find that their jobs are in serious jeopardy 
because the government will be raising payroll taxes.
<P>
	I want to know which promise the government is going to break. 
Is it going to break the jobs, jobs, jobs promise to young Canadians 
or is it going to back off on its commitment to seniors because that 
basically is what it is going to come down to?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member may think that he has torn some incredible 
admission from the government.
<P>
	This government, many months ago at a finance minister's 
meeting with the provinces, set out very clearly that premiums may 
have to go up, that there may have to be a change in the benefits.
<P>
	It may well be that the member is only now coming to this 
conclusion, but it is one that most Canadians realized after the chief 
actuary issued his report some time ago on the CPP.
<P>
	On the question of jobs, if members take a look at what is 
happening at the present time, over the course of the last three 
months nearly 135,000 new jobs have been created. Since this 
government was elected, well over 500,000 jobs have been created.
<P>
	We are providing jobs in the new economy. We are providing 
jobs for young people. We are providing the kind of jobs that are 
permanent. That is what the statistics demonstrate.

question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	On March 29, the Minister of Finance admitted in this House 
that the new Canada-U.S. tax treaty was unfair to Canadians and 
Quebecers receiving U.S. pensions and that he did not agree with 
the Americans' way of doing things. However, he is not doing 
anything to help his fellow citizens.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Finance tell the House about the 
discussions he has had on this matter with his American 
counterpart, Mr. Rubin, by disclosing among other things the 
various options put forward by this government to resolve the issue 
of U.S. pensions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member's question is quite relevant. I should mention that 
the problem lies in a new interpretation of the American 
legislation.
<P>
	As the hon. member has just pointed out, I met with Mr. Rubin in 
Washington about two weeks ago. We discussed this matter at 
length. We have still not found a solution, but the Americans are 
working on it, as the matter is in their hands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
will the Minister of Finance compensate pensioners in Canada and 
Quebec who are paying for the unfair tax treaties signed by their 
own government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the problem lies in the American legislation. The Canadian 
government is certainly very concerned about this problem. There 
is no doubt that great injustices have been created for Canadians. 
We will continue to work on this, but it must be said that the 
Canadian government is in no position to compensate all 
Canadians affected by changes in foreign legislation.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as was reported to the 
House, the Solicitor General of Canada took active steps to make 
sure that the safety of those around the institution was addressed by 
transferring almost 20 inmates to provincial institutions.
<P>
	We have looked at the security features of the institution. We 
announced concrete measures to make sure that safety was 
addressed, such as a fence and cameras. We are taking the 
necessary steps to address that. It is going to take six to eight 
weeks.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	In the meantime we are looking at the security features. More 
important, we are reviewing the whole premise of medium and 
high risk offenders and whether they should be brought back to the 
institution. It is under review currently and we will make sure that 
is properly followed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government is not interested in fixing the problem. It is not 
interested in punishment or deterrence. If it was, it would not be 
building comfort cottages like the Edmonton institution. It would 
be building prisons capable of keeping maximum security inmates 
inside the gates.
<P>
	The Edmonton institution is a proven failure. When one-quarter 
of the inmates escape then there is no hope. Will the government 
sell the prison to the Holiday Inn-I am sure they can use it-and 
then build a prison that will ensure the safety of Edmontonians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is 
giving Canadians the false impression that inmates are getting a 
free ride.
<P>
	I would like to quote from a recent article from the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> 
which states: ``What is clear though is that the Reform Party is 
misleading the public when it claims that convicts are having it 
good''. It goes on further to say: ``Credit for reducing costs must go 
the Corrections Canada managers who amazingly cut 15 per cent 
from their headquarters budget, instead of hitting the hard working 
guards''. It concludes: ``The bottom line is that, for the most part, 
the perception that Canada's inmates are getting a free ride is 
untrue. There will be horror stories to be sure but it's important to 
note that our prisons are well-managed and our governments are 
not soft on crime''.

hon. member had not yet allowed the 45 day response period to 
lapse. If after 45 days the hon. member's questions have not been 
answered, Standing Order 39(5)(b) provides him with the 
mechanism by which he can raise the subject matter in the House 
during the adjournment proceedings.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Of particular concern to the hon. member was not so much the 
delay in the delivery of the responses to his questions but rather 
comments about the questions allegedly made by an unnamed 
spokesperson for the government House leader's office. According 
to a newspaper article of April 21, cited by the hon. member, an 
official in the government House leader's office was quoted as 
having said that the request was outrageous and that the 
government had no intention of diverting personnel to answer the 
questions.
<P>
	The member argued these comments showed contempt of 
Parliament and noted that if the government had no intention of 
responding to these questions he was being hindered in the 
performance of his duties. This is a very serious matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As Speaker Sauvé noted in a ruling given On December 16, 
1980, at page 5797 of the <I>Debates</I>, if there was a deliberate attempt 
to deny answers to an hon.  member, and if it could be shown that 
such action amounted to improper interference with the hon. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2367"> 2367 </A></B>
<P>
member's parliamentary work, then this could constitute a prima 
facie question of privilege.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In their interventions both the deputy House leader and the chief 
government whip explained that the questions posed by the hon. 
member were complicated and detailed in nature but assured him 
responses were being prepared and would be made available when 
ready.
<P>
	Given the response of the deputy government House leader, it is 
very difficult to accept the veracity of the remarks allegedly made 
by an unidentified person in the government House leader's office. 
As such, I cannot find that the member has been obstructed in 
performing his duties and hence there is no question of privilege.
<P>
	Let me point out to members and officials alike that the minister 
has indicated that responses to these questions are being prepared. 
Written questions posed by members are an important tool at the 
disposal of members of the House and are used to solicit 
information as well as to help hold the government accountable for 
its actions. It is precisely for this reason that the members of the 
ministry are responsible to the House for the actions taken 
regarding the preparation of the responses to these questions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their input.

have the honour to present a petition. These petitioners believe 
privileges accorded to heterosexual couples should not be extended 
to same sex relationships. They also believe the undefined phrase 
sexual orientation in the proposed human rights legislation could 
do just that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to present a petition from 49 of my constituents. The 
petitioners request that Parliament refrain from passing into law 
any bill extending family status or spousal benefits to same sex 
partners, and that  Parliament not amend the human rights code, the 
Canadian Human Rights Act or the charter of rights and freedoms 
in any way which would tend to indicate societal approval of same

<P>
	The first petition comes from Saskatoon. The petitioners would 
like to draw to the attention of the House that managing the family 
home and caring for preschool children is an honourable profession 
which has not been recognized for its value in our society. They 
also state that the Income Tax Act discriminates against traditional 
families who make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from Sarnia, Ontario. The petitioners would 
like to bring to the attention of the House that consumption of 
alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or impair one's 
ability and specifically that fetal alcohol syndrome and other 
alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable by 
avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a petition signed by 28 people from my riding. Based on biblical 
teaching they point out the prohibition against homosexuality. It is 
their humble request and prayer that no initiative to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act to include the term sexual orientation 
be considered or allowed by this honourable House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this petition is signed by people from my constituency and across

<B><A NAME="2368"> 2368 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian  Human Rights Act to prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions. On the first petition those who signed want to draw 
the attention of the House to the following. Acts of discrimination 
against lesbian, gay and bisexual Canadians are an everyday reality 
in all regions of Canada. This kind of discrimination is 
unacceptable in a country known for its commitment to human 
rights, equality and dignity of all citizens.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to act quickly to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit discrimination 
on the basis of sexual orientation and to adopt all necessary 
measures to recognize the full equality of same sex relationships in 
federal law.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the second petition is also from people in 
Peterborough riding who are concerned about the effect of 
proposed changes in human rights legislation on the family.
<P>
	They request that Parliament refrain from passing into law any 
bill extending family status or spousal benefits to same sex 
partners. They further request that Parliament not amend the 
human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in any way which would 
tend to indicate societal approval of same sex relationships.

petition was signed by approximately 400 residents of the Berthier

<P>
	These petitioners are dead against this project, which they feel is 
only shifting the problem from the south shore to the north shore of 
the river. They call upon the government to show respect for the 
quality of the fauna and flora and, if the project must proceed, they 
demand that the polluted sludge be disposed of on land. It is not 
good enough to just shift the problem, possibly to another federal 
riding.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-12, an act respecting 
employment insurance in Canada, as reported (with amendments) 
from the committee; and of Group No. 3 of motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on this bill. Not many of us will 
have this opportunity, since the government decided to gag us by 
resorting to time allocation, as it did in committee. This is indeed 
what the government did in committee and it is doing the same 
thing now, at report stage, in the House.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	In the nine or ten minutes at my disposal, I want to stress a 
number of points concerning which the government's approach in 
this bill is very ill considered. But first I want to congratulate the 
250 to 300 people from my region who came Saturday to protest 
against the unemployment insurance reform, now called 
employment insurance, and to tell this government that it is headed 
the wrong way and that it must go back to the drawing board.
<P>
	Of course these people are upset that, through all sorts of 
schemes, the government will take $5 billion from the 
unemployment insurance fund and use it to reduce the deficit in a 
somewhat artificial way. The government will appropriate $5 
billion from the UI surplus and use it to reduce the deficit. This is 
tantamount to a hold-up by the government. Yet, Liberal members 
rise one after the other in support of the bill. People are obviously 
upset by such manipulative techniques.
<P>
	Again, it must be stressed that, while the government wants to 
appropriate this money, it does not even contribute to the 
unemployment insurance fund, which is totally funded by 
employees and employers. Employers and employees' 
contributions are administered under an act of Parliament, and the 
public would have liked to take part in the debate so that, together, 
we could decide the future of the unemployment insurance 
program as a whole, not unlike Quebec is currently doing via its 
socio-economic summit, where we first agree on the goals and then 
try to come to an agreement on the terms and conditions.
<P>
	This would have been the ideal course of action. Instead, the 
government conducted all kinds of so-called consultations to 
finally substantiate its position and make it look like what the 
people wanted. That is not what I heard last Saturday in my riding 
and what was heard in most Quebec ridings either. Demonstrations 
were held in many places in this regard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2369"> 2369 </A></B>
<P>
	We have missed an excellent opportunity-with the 
government's several initiatives to amend the unemployment 
insurance scheme in recent years-to finally reach a consensus 
about the main goals. For instance, should unemployment 
insurance funds be used to stimulate job creation or only to operate 
a real insurance scheme? This would have made for a healthy 
debate. Instead, the goal set by the Minister of Finance was the 
following: ``Do as you please, but just make sure a $5 billion 
surplus is maintained for us to dip into year after year''. As a 
result, the surplus is added to the consolidated fund, giving the 
illusion that the deficit has been reduced.
<P>
	But something bothered a number of people, and on Saturday I 
had the chance to explain in some detail one of the main reasons I 
oppose this bill. This reason is that, at a time when the year 2000 
draws near and when we are looking at new ways of sharing the 
labour market, here comes a piece of legislation which will have 
the opposite effect by encouraging people to work more extra hours 
and employers to have employees do more overtime instead of 
hiring more employees, which would make the labour force grow.
<P>
	At a time when the unemployment rate is extremely high, when, 
at the social level, the gap between the wealthier and most 
disadvantaged segments of society is widening, there is food for 
thought here.
<P>
	Let me explain in more technical terms the effect of reducing 
maximum insurable earnings from $42,000 to $39,000. When an 
individual has exceeded the maximum insurable earnings or is 
about to exceed them, neither he nor the employer pays any more 
unemployment insurance premiums. So, if you put yourself in the 
place of the employer, you will say: ``Well, I have work to be done, 
what shall I do? I can take an employee who has already reached 
his limit and make him work more hours, and, what is more, I will 
not pay any more premiums on his new hours''. Or, you could hire 
a new employee. But if you do that, you have additional employer 
costs to pay and you will pay unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	So, automatically, to avoid all the bureaucratic paper work 
already required of businesses, employers say: ``So, we will give 
our employees even more hours of overtime''. It is a vicious circle. 
More overtime, more fatigue, more accidents, and so it goes. This 
is totally opposite to the way things should go into the 2000s.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	This represents a serious problem and there is nothing in this 
reform which will mean that the job market will be better shared 
under this new arrangement which goes by insurable hours instead 
of weeks.
<P>
	Another point, without going into worker training in detail, is 
that the total muddle that already exists in this area is being 
maintained; that perhaps, one day, they  would consider turning 
training over to the Quebec government, that this will be discussed.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the department brings in supposedly transitional 
programs, but these are planned for three years, so little confidence 
is there that any real agreement can be reached with Quebec about 
turning training over to the province.
<P>
	In short, the government would have the opportunity with this 
reform to have what our colleagues over there are talking about so 
often, an administrative reform. They could preach by example, 
going beyond mere words, and ensuring that this bill transfers the 
administration of active employment measures and the 
unemployment insurance fund to the Government of Quebec, in the 
case of Quebec.
<P>
	But there seems to have been the usual slip between cup and 
lip-a big one. This leaves people somewhat cynical about politics. 
That on top of all the unmet commitments and unkept promises 
makes any confidence in this bunch impossible. I see you are in 
agreement with me on that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	A last point: a problem that is still cropping up in the 90s in 
many places, and one from which our region is not exempt. There 
are many businesses that have been around a long time. In some 
sectors of economic activity there have been major changes, 
speeded up by the arrival of free trade. Certain economic sectors, 
the textile industry among others, have not been extremely 
competitive, except in certain subsectors, so massive layoffs are 
now taking place and major businesses are being restructured. 
Some people who have been working for the past 15, 20 or 25 
years, a number of years in the same job, are finding themselves at 
age 40 or 50 faced with plant closures and not much hope for the 
future. They are extremely worried, yet they have a number of good 
working years left to give. Work is, after all, part of our lifestyle 
and impacts on all other aspects of our lives. We have missed the 
opportunity here to look at the changes to see how we might adapt 
an employment insurance program, as they want to term it, and as 
they want to really make it, to that new reality.
<P>
	It should be remembered that when we were sold the idea of free 
trade, and I was one of those who believed in it and still do, they 
said that there would have to be transition mechanisms. These are 
not just to support business, but also to support individuals. Here, 
we have a number of years where absolutely nothing has been 
done, and the impact on people has been tragic.
<P>
	So why was provision not made for longer periods of 
unemployment insurance, for manpower training to be turned over 
to the provinces, which, if they had had increased resources, would 
have been able to offer longer training periods that were more 
adapted to needs? You do not just go from working in textiles to 
working with computers overnight. This is quite a leap, as I was 
saying earlier. So, nothing in that sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2370"> 2370 </A></B>
<P>
	There are many things missing from this bill. In the minute I 
have left, I am going to look at the real purpose of this reform. 
Is it to make cuts that will enable the Minister of Finance to save 
$5 billion, or is it to adapt our social programs to the reality of 
the next century? If it is for the latter purpose, we would have 
a different sort of bill before us. The sole purpose of the bill we 
are now looking at is to bring down the deficit temporarily by 
dipping into the unemployment insurance fund, and not to adjust 
to the new reality of the job market.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to remind hon. members that this 
money belongs to employees and employers. This must always be 
pointed out, because people often have the impression that the 
government contributes to the fund. Since 1990, it has not 
contributed a red cent, and yet it uses the unemployment insurance 
funds, manages them, and they have become an employment tax.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that in a reform such as this, those who provide 
the money that goes into this fund are not involved to a greater and 
more genuine extent. That is why there were 250 demonstrators 
Saturday in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, and a number in other 
locations in Quebec, and that is why people will continue to 
express their disagreement, because they do not believe that the 
government is capable, in this and in many other areas, of adapting 
to the reality of the next century.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to support Bill C-12, an act respecting 
employment insurance.
<P>
	The proposed employment insurance system is the result of more 
than two years of consultations with Canadians. This legislation 
will help Canadians get back to work. It will strengthen work 
incentives, ensure fairness and help workers adjust to economic 
change.
<P>
	Today I will focus my remarks on the effects of the legislation, 
the effects it will have on women in the workforce and on seasonal 
workers.
<P>
	The idea that women will be penalized by changes to 
employment insurance has become a familiar refrain from the 
opposition benches, but do not believe it. One of the two overriding 
goals of the new system is to make it more inclusive than the old 
one.
<P>
	Employment insurance legislation recognizes the importance of 
the participation of women in the workforce. Women make up 
nearly 70 per cent of Canada's part time workforce. Many of those 
women are not insured for UI or maternity benefits. Only those 
women who work for one employer 15 hours a week for 20 weeks 
are ensured for UI and maternity benefits. Many women hold two 
or three part time jobs but  together they do not have the benefits, 
but they make work 30 or 40 hours a week or more.
<P>
	Under the new system, however, an additional 270,000 Canadian 
women who work less than 15 hours per week at any job or who 
juggle several jobs at once will finally be eligible for employment 
insurance and maternity benefits.
<P>
	Employment insurance provides opportunities for women to 
increase their employment by lifting the 15 hour glass ceiling. 
Under the UI system many employers restricted part time workers, 
particularly women, to less than 15 hours a week in order to avoid 
paying premiums. With the new EI system all hours count toward a 
claim. This means men and women who hold down several jobs 
will now be fully insured if they take sick leave, maternity or 
paternity leave or if they should lose one of their jobs for any 
reason.
<P>
	Employment insurance also guarantees that anyone who earns 
$2,000 or less a year will have their premiums refunded. This 
initiative alone will benefit 1.3 million young Canadians. An hour 
based system ensures all workers are treated equitably and that 
non-standard workers are brought into the system.
<P>
	More important, the hour based system will benefit seasonal 
workers. Under the current UI system it makes no different whether 
a person works 15 hours a week or 50, the result is the same. The 
hour based system is a better measure of work effort and therefore 
provides greater incentive for seasonal workers to remain 
employed as long as they can.
<P>
	A good example are the workers in the fishing and forestry 
sectors who work long hours during the weeks of available 
employment. Under the current system there is no incentive to 
work longer than the minimum number of weeks required. More 
often than not someone has come into my office and told me: ``I 
worked 14 weeks and I thought I was qualified. I learned that this 
month I need 15 weeks because the level of employment and jobs 
available are a little higher''. They have worked to jerk the system 
around to what would meet their needs. This no longer will be 
acceptable. The more hours worked, the more available the benefits 
will be.
<P>
	It is important to remember that 96 per cent of current UI 
claimants will continue to be eligible for benefits. Furthermore, all 
claimants start with a clean slate on July 1, 1996. That is, they will 
not be penalized for previous use of the UI system.
<P>
	Three recent amendments to the legislation to ensure that 
Atlantic Canadians and seasonal workers are treated more fairly 
have been brought forward. The first amendment answers concerns 
about gaps or breaks in employment. This amendment will allow 
claimants to count back 26 weeks to find the minimum number of 
work weeks specified by the divisor in their area. In these cases 
claimants will be eligible to ignore weeks of no  earnings and 
instead have only weeks of actual employment. This amendment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2371"> 2371 </A></B>
<P>
alone will bring $246 million into certain regions where there is 
more difficulty with employment and more seasonal work, and it 
will be spread evenly across the country.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The second amendment modifies the divisor to calculate those 
weekly benefits. This amendment will also benefit high 
unemployment areas and result in $95 million extra coming into 
those poorer regions.
<P>
	The third amendment addresses Atlantic Canadians' concerns 
about the intensity rules. This will exempt those families of low 
income, less than $26,000 a year. Those people who receive a 
reduced benefit as a result of working while on claim will be given 
a credit for the purpose of the intensity rule.
<P>
	There are additional assets and benefits to this new legislation; 
the family income supplement, the wage subsidies, the 
self-employment assistance program and the skills and loans grants 
as well as earning supplements. Additionally, child care support 
will be available for women receiving employment benefits.
<P>
	This legislation is an enhancement to encourage work, to 
encourage longer periods of work and to ensure a fair, equitable 
disbursement of wages throughout our system. It will actually 
create work for Canadians. The government promised to create 
jobs for Canadians and this legislation is part of that commitment.
<P>
	For more than two years now I have been holding town hall 
meetings. I have sat with labour leaders in Nova Scotia, as well as 
the membership. I have travelled to the rural coastal communities 
throughout my riding to hear from seasonal workers. Some of those 
workers said ``the system has been there and we have used it, 
perhaps even abused it''.
<P>
	One fisherman said to me: ``I earn $40,000 to $50,000 a year as a 
lobster fisherman and my wife helps out so we both are eligible for 
benefits. Therefore through the winter months, after a two month 
lobster season of earning that much money, we go on to the UI 
system and we have a steady income coming all year. I am ashamed 
to tell you that because the kid over on the gas pump who is earning 
$5.15 an hour pumping gas pumps gas all year long, 52 weeks a 
year. That kid is subsidizing me; he on minimum wage and me 
taking $50,000 out of the system as an employer, as a fisherman, 
plus UI benefits.
<P>
	``I am ashamed to say it, but it has been the system and I have 
continued to use it. I am glad to see you are correcting these 
inequities so that our young people, women and those who have not 
had as much opportunity will now have a sense of fairness and part 
in the system where they can work''.
<P>
	My constituents want this bill passed. They have been part of the 
discussions and part of the debate. I congratulate the minister for 
his sense of fairness, his determination, as well as the committee 
for listening because we have brought amendments forward and we 
have listened to those people, in particular where there are more 
seasonal workers and where there is a higher rate of 
unemployment.
<P>
	The legislation is long overdue and we have spent too long 
actually discussing it, almost up to two years. I have no problem 
with suggesting all members support this bill and I encourage their 
support to pass it as quickly as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very happy to have once again the opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-12, more specifically to Motion No. 4, which would delete 
clause 2 in this bill in its entirety. This clause contains a number of 
definitions that shed new light on the intentions and the hidden face 
of this government.
<P>
	As the small-minded manager it is, this government intends to 
resort to drastic measures to put its fiscal house in order. This bill 
shows all the prejudices stirred up by this government against those 
in financial trouble, those who have just lost their jobs. They want 
to use affidavits as defined in the bill: ```Affidavit' means an 
affidavit sworn or affirmed before a commissioner of oaths or any 
other person authorized to take affidavits''.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	This shows the kind of attitude behind this eminently dreadful 
bill. It also tells us about the means this government intends to use 
to discourage those who want to prevail themselves of something 
they paid for, unemployment insurance. Clause 2(3) shows its 
intention to use modern means of communications, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) A document or other communication under this act or the regulations may 
be in electronic form and a reference in this act or the regulations to a form, 
record, book, notice, request, demand, decision or any other document includes 
a document in electronic form.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those who watched oral question period saw what can happen 
with electronic means. We can see it today in the problems with 
guaranteed income supplement. We know that this government is 
set to install computer terminals across the country. We know that 
the government is about to introduce infocentres. We in the 
Mauricie region and all of Quebec know something about this.
<P>
	In his great wisdom, the Prime Minister has decided to establish 
in his own riding-what a coincidence-an infocentre, thereby 
taking these services-if one can speak of services-away from 
regions already receiving them so they could be consolidated in his 
riding. This brings us, as you will have figured out, to discuss the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2372"> 2372 </A></B>
<P>
implied administrative restructuring within the Department of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Let us not forget that this technology is to be used by the 
Department of Human Resources Development. We all know how 
impersonal contacts are between a machine and a human being. 
Such a system leaves something to be desired. Based on first-hand 
information received from the department, the use of such 
computerized systems is not giving good results. Still, the 
government wants to impose such systems on people who are 
vulnerable, workers who lost their jobs and who may be 
emotionally affected.
<P>
	This brings us to discuss the decision to move the employment 
centre from Trois-Rivières to Shawinigan. The city of 
Trois-Rivières is the capital of the Mauricie region. Until now, as 
logic would have it, the regional centre serving the whole region 
was located there. However, the Prime Minister, in a display of 
smart thinking and wise leadership, decided to change all that. The 
questions I put to the minister regarding this issue are on the Order 
Paper. I am still waiting for answers. There are four of them. I will 
summarize them quickly.
<P>
	Was there any recommendation to the minister by public 
servants or public officials, who can think for themselves and who 
are not biased, regarding the location of the new regional centre? 
Yes or no? This is what we want to know.
<P>
	If a recommendation was made, did the Prime Minister's office 
or the Privy Council intervene to change that recommendation, 
along with the decision that should normally have been made by 
the department following such recommendation?
<P>
	Were comparative studies made on the advisability of 
establishing this regional management centre in Shawinigan 
instead of Trois-Rivières? Was some sort of impact or cost-benefit 
study done regarding the decision to move from Trois-Rivières to 
Shawinigan? Were the costs of the move, including relocation 
costs, to Shawinigan-Sud, taken into account, given that there are 
no public transportation services between Shawinigan and 
Shawinigan-Sud, and given the impact of vacating facilities for 
which, according to sources, the government has a lease running 
until 1999, and which will remain empty until further notice, again 
according to sources, particularly in the context of streamlining 
government operations? This is the sort of measure being applied 
by this monstrous Department of Human Resources Development, 
in its attempt to modernize its structure.
<P>
	Personally, the more I look at this bill, the worse it seems. It is a 
dreadful bill because it makes culprits out of victims. Let me quote 
the following sentence we find in the summary of the bill: ``This 
creates a system that better accommodates the variety of work 
arrangements in today's labour market''.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Instead of referring to the variety of work arrangements, it 
should speak about the insecurity of the labour market these days. 
The true reality of work is unemployment. They pretend they are 
improving the situation with a bill making victims the guilty ones. 
A bill whose climate unfortunately stems from an ideological 
trend-we must not hide the fact; on the contrary, we must 
recognize it-a trend called neo-liberalism, a school of thought 
whereby people are increasingly blamed for their own situation, 
under the pretence of individual accountability.
<P>
	The rich get richer, the poor poorer, the middle class is 
challenged through this type of highly modern, highly generous 
measure we used to call unemployment insurance. Slowly but 
surely, we are questioning the fundamental concepts of the 
collective workings of our society.
<P>
	The recent comments of the Minister of Industry, with which I 
agree wholeheartedly, should be proof enough of the seriousness of 
the situation. I can easily comment on this point because, during 
my career, I worked with businesses going through such hard times 
that they had to contemplate massive layoffs. At the time, I would 
step in on behalf of the Quebec government, and in cooperation 
with an employee committee, I would try to identify the root causes 
of the problem and develop a recovery plan, with a view to saving 
jobs.
<P>
	What is happening these days? Something quite new, something 
outrageous and quite immoral in my opinion; imagine a major 
corporation-in a sector such as banking, the oil industry, forestry 
or the automobile industry-posting record profits, huge profits, 
and the same month shamelessly announcing the layoff of 
thousands of workers due to streamlining and foreign competition. 
These reasons make sense internally, but in social and collective 
terms they are indefensible and must be condemned. If the situation 
is left unchecked, it might eventually trigger social and economic 
upheaval. It is high time for this country to hold a debate to put 
public morality back in its rightful place.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to comment on Bill C-12. This is progressive 
legislation that will bring in a much improved, modern, fair and 
balanced employment insurance regime and basically remove the 
inefficiencies and inequities of the unemployment insurance 
system.
<P>
	Further, the employment insurance regime introduces an 
important measure in the government's jobs and growth agenda. 
The employment insurance plan not only provides income support 
for unemployed Canadians, but it is a powerful tool to put them 
back to work. It creates a balance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2373"> 2373 </A></B>
<P>
	As the secretary of state for youth, I am particularly pleased 
about the effects of Bill C-12 on Canada's young people. The 
speech from the throne signalled the government's priority 
concern for youth, and the budget followed through with positive 
action.
<P>
	Young people are particularly challenged in today's economy, 
many of them experiencing a catch-22 situation. No experience 
means no job and no job means no experience. Unemployment for 
people under 25 is one and a half times the national average.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We recognize that there is much to be done. I believe the words 
of the Prime Minister bear repeating: ``Above all, we want young 
Canadians to become active participants in our economy. They 
want jobs. They deserve jobs. Young people want to embrace the 
future and not fear it. And it is up to all of us to create that hope and 
opportunity for them''.
<P>
	Following this vision, the government has appointed a 
ministerial task force on youth which has begun consultations with 
Canadians on the issues facing young people in making the 
transition from school to work. The report of the task force will 
form the basis of the federal youth strategy to be announced this 
fall.
<P>
	The task force will be attending town hall type meetings across 
the country, hosted by local members of Parliament and senators. 
Members will seek the views of young people, local youth service 
organizations, local business representatives and other interested 
Canadians.
<P>
	I am happy to say that such a town hall will be held soon in my 
home town of Yellowknife. I encourage all members to take an 
active interest in these very important discussions. Indeed, 
ensuring that young people have a strong foothold in the labour 
market is vital to Canada's future prosperity and global 
competitiveness.
<P>
	In the meantime, we will have employment insurance that will 
be of great help to Canada's young people. There are special 
provisions within the bill for young people. The new employment 
insurance provisions contained in Bill C-12 are amended not only 
to be fair and balanced, but they are particularly beneficial to 
young people.
<P>
	One of the difficulties with the current UI system is that it 
measures work in terms of weeks. Weeks are often a poor measure 
of time spent on the job, particularly for part time workers and 
multiple job holders, which many young people are. With the hours 
based system of Bill C-12, part time workers' earnings are insured. 
Four out of ten of our part time workers are under the age of 25.
<P>
	Under unemployment insurance, employers have tended to limit 
part time employment to less than 15 hours per week per person in 
order to avoid having to pay UI premiums. This has meant that no 
only did these  workers get less work, their earnings were not 
insured. Employment insurance eliminates the 15-hour job trap, 
since all hours will now count toward eligibility. More young 
people who enter the labour market after leaving school and who 
must rely on a number of small jobs to earn a living, will now have 
insurable employment.
<P>
	On the other hand, employment insurance also reduces the risk 
of young people developing a dependency on employment 
insurance. Many young people enter the labour market and end up 
on UI benefits before completing their education. They put 
themselves on the all too often familiar treadmill, short periods of 
work followed by periods of unemployment insurance. That is 
what Bill C-12 will discourage. It will encourage young people to 
complete their education rather than dropping out to take insecure 
work.
<P>
	The higher entrance requirements under employment insurance 
mean that young people must develop a stronger attachment to the 
labour market. Measures of this sort have been recommended by 
two recent government reports. The report of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development recommended 
longer qualifying periods to encourage young workers to remain 
attached to the workforce longer and to improve their career 
prospects. The Working Group on Seasonal Work and UI also 
recommended stiffer entrance requirements for young people.
<P>
	As for contributions to EI, premiums will have a minimal impact 
on young people. A student working 14 hours a week at $7 per hour 
would pay less than $3 per week in premiums. The hours will now 
be insured, which will help meet entrance requirements when 
entering the labour market full time. Further, premiums will be 
refunded to about 625,000 young people, 49 per cent of all those 
who receive rebates. Of the total young people receiving rebates, 
400,000 will be full time students.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	On the benefits side, whereas total benefits paid out under EI 
will be somewhat less than under UI, benefits paid out to young 
people by the year 2001-2002 will decrease by 6 per cent, 
considerably less than the expected overall decrease of 9 per cent.
<P>
	Young people will also benefit from the employment benefits 
provided under EI. Several of the employment tools will be of help 
in getting young people back to work. For example, targeted wage 
subsidies will help young people who qualify for employment 
insurance benefits to get needed work experience to qualify for 
more stable or permanent jobs.
<P>
	Like some of the other measures I mentioned earlier, Bill C-12 
firmly supports a top priority of the government, the jobs and 
growth agenda. A key element of that strategy is the investment in 
Canada's youth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2374"> 2374 </A></B>
<P>
	Measures are already in place to address the needs of young 
people: youth service Canada, the youth internship Canada, the 
student summer job action program, the Canada student loans 
program. The budget introduced a learning package with tax and 
savings incentives, as well as child care support for single parent 
students.
<P>
	The learning package provides an additional $165 million in tax 
assistance to students and their families. Additional tax assistance 
is provided to students by increasing the base for the education tax 
credit by 25 per cent, from $80 to $100 per month. There is also a 
25 per cent increase to the limit on transfer of tuition fees and 
education credits to family members who provide support to 
students.
<P>
	Saving for education is further encouraged by increases to the 
registered education savings plan limits. The low income, single 
parent students are helped through child care expense deductions. 
The budget took further immediate action by increasing the 
summer career placement program funding from $60 million to 
$120 million.
<P>
	The government is on track with the jobs and growth agenda. 
More than 600,000 jobs have been created since 1993 and 
unemployment is down by two percentage points. With a youth 
strategy in place we will be able to ensure that Canada's young 
people share fully in economic growth.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to meet with many groups. Yesterday 
afternoon I met with an Elks club, members of community 
organizations and an RCMP officer, as well other interested 
citizens. They are people from all walks of life who share an 
interest in the wellness of young people, in their futures, in the 
investments we make as families and leaders to the well-being and 
the future of young people.
<P>
	We met to discuss how to ensure a better future and a better 
quality of life for young people in our community. That desire is 
not particular to my riding but is something we all share as 
members. Communities take other initiatives. Government is the 
facilitator. It provides the legislative tools, the resources.
<P>
	We have been able to encourage the public to take the leadership 
and the responsibility. Some members opposite have said that this 
bill in some sense refers to victims. It is not so much that people are 
victims but that they should take personal responsibility for their 
futures. If young people are encouraged they will not be afraid to 
do that.
<P>
	There are many young people out there working, learning and 
securing a better future for themselves. They need our support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak once again to Bill C-12. However, I would have 
preferred to give my views on a bill that would really address 
unemployment problems everywhere in Canada and in Quebec. A 
bill that would have proposed concrete measures to stimulate 
employment and thus have given back hope to thousands of people 
who are desperately trying to enter or re-enter the work force.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Let me tell you that I am always a little surprised, since we have 
been debating this reform for such a long time, to hear colleagues 
from the other side of the House extol the virtues of this reform, 
when everybody in Quebec and Canada is protesting daily to 
condemn the perverse effects of this reform.
<P>
	So, let me say that I do not understand these members of 
Parliament who represent the people, the constituents of their 
riding. These people must also go to their member of Parliament to 
say: ``What the government is doing to us does not make any sense. 
This reform is creating poverty''.
<P>
	There is no concrete measure for job creation in this 
unemployment insurance reform. Furthermore, the government is 
taking billions of dollars, for the sake of being a good government, 
and after that, in the next budget, it will brag: ``We have been a 
good government, we have reduced the deficit by so much''. But it 
did it by emptying the people's pockets.
<P>
	Frankly, I would like to warn people when they hear government 
members say absolutely absurd things, and say that this reform is 
really the best there is at this time, that they really did a reform. I 
do not think they did a good reform. They are creating poverty. 
This reform is unfair, regressive, anti-employment, and it is 
creating poverty.
<P>
	I would like to explain to our viewers how this bill will penalize 
the unemployed and those who are without a job, especially young 
people and women. The eligibility criteria are tougher. Previously, 
12 to 15 fifteen hour weeks were all that was required to qualify, 
depending on the region. You had to work 15 fifteen hour weeks, or 
a total of 180 to 300 hours per year. Those who accumulated 
between 180 and 300 hours of work, depending on the region, 
qualified for benefits.
<P>
	Now, between 12 and 20 weeks at 35 hours per week, or a total of 
420 to 720 hours per year, will be required. In other words, an 
individual has to work, depending on the region, between 420 and 
700 hours, or more than double the time, to qualify. For 
newcomers, that is to say those joining the labour market, the 
number of hours of work required to qualify will increase 
threefold, which means they will be expected to accumulate 910 
hours before 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2375"> 2375 </A></B>
<P>
becoming eligible. This is really an unrealistic  expectation, given 
that there are no jobs. None have been created and no steps have 
been taken in that regard. The government is just hitting the 
unemployed over the head.
<P>
	What is ever more appalling about this measure, this reform, is 
that once again women, because of their precarious condition, and 
young people will bear the brunt of a bad reform. Why? An impact 
assessment carried out by the federal government shows that the 
hardest hit will be individuals whose annual income is under 
$25,000. That takes the cake. It is a well known fact that women 
and young people are the ones who earn the least. Women still earn 
70 per cent of what their male counterparts make. Once again, 
women will be the big losers.
<P>
	Second, we are told that eligibility requirements will be tighter, 
eligibility being determined on the basis of the total number of 
hours worked over a given time instead of the number of weeks 
worked. In addition, contributions will have to be paid starting with 
the first hour of work. This means that the young student working 
for a fast food chain, not to name any names, who, as is often the 
case, was hired to work between six and ten hours per week, will 
have to contribute to the unemployment insurance fund starting 
from his first hour of work. While he is forced to contribute to the 
fund, this student will never get to draw a penny from it during all 
his years as a student employee.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	They will dip into-not to say steal-his premiums in order to 
reduce the deficit. This money is really being misappropriated. 
Then they claim that, this year, they doubled the amount of money 
set aside for students, for youth employment projects, and that they 
really want to help students. This is a smoke screen because as soon 
as they start working, they will pay UI premiums without ever 
qualifying for benefits.
<P>
	Bill C-12 will greatly reduce the number of people eligible for 
benefits. Furthermore, as I showed you earlier, even those who do 
not qualify must contribute to the fund, getting poorer in the 
process. Another reason why this bill is unacceptable is because it 
would consider spousal income in determining if someone is 
entitled to receive the supplement. That takes the cake.
<P>
	Unemployment benefits will be calculated on the basis of 
income, when we know that women have always earned less than 
men. If both spouses lose their jobs, the man will receive benefits 
because of his higher income, while the woman will be forced, 
once again, to beg for the money to buy a pair of stockings. This is 
an unacceptable policy that takes women back 50 years. This bill is 
highly discriminatory. I cannot understand why the women in this 
House did not rise against this bill. This is appalling. Once they 
understand the clause concerning the penalty they will have to pay, 
all women will rise against this bill.
<P>
	Finally, the bill seeks to reduce the maximum benefit period, 
which would inevitably result in a more rapid transition to social
<P>
assistance. Only 55 per cent of those who are jobless will be 
eligible for benefits. Where will the others go? They will go on 
welfare. This is called dumping the deficit into the provinces' 
backyards. The provinces will once again have to foot the bill.
<P>
	And what about maintaining duplication and overlap? This will 
promote neither an effective employment policy nor employability, 
including for women.
<P>
	There is unanimous agreement in Quebec regarding the need for 
an employment development policy. This bill will have tragic 
consequences everywhere in Canada and in Quebec, because the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, with the quiet 
complicity of the Minister of Finance, has decided that a reform of 
the unemployment insurance system was in order. We never 
opposed the idea of a reform, of modernizing the system, of 
making sure that the moneys are used in the best interests of 
workers. This is what we advocated.
<P>
	Since you are indicating that I only have one minute left, I now 
come to my conclusion. Protests were held everywhere and there 
will be more, because the victims of this measure realize what the 
government is doing and they simply cannot accept it.
<P>
	How could they accept, with an annual income of $10,000, 
$12,000, $15,000, or even less, that the federal government is 
targeting these people and ask them to pay for its mismanagement? 
When people have to make do with the meagre income provided by 
a system such as the unemployment insurance system, how can 
they quietly accept the government's decision to reduce benefits, 
even though there is a surplus in the fund?
<P>
	This government will have to answer for its actions at the next 
general election.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill C-12.
<P>
	As a member of the human resources development committee, I 
was able to participate in the hearings on the bill which were 
carried on this spring over a five week period and during which 
time we heard from 79 witnesses, individuals and groups. In 
addition, there were numerous written briefs considered by the 
committee.
<P>
	When the bill was tabled late in 1995 my initial reaction was to 
oppose it because it proposed substantial cuts to the UI system 
which in my view were unfair and unjustified. For seven years, 
from 1984 to 1991, I was the employment critic for the Liberal 
opposition and during that time with the support of my party 
severely criticized the Conservative government for similar cuts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2376"> 2376 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, during the 1993 election campaign the Liberal 
Party made no mention in the red book or elsewhere of proposed 
cuts to unemployment insurance. Quite to the contrary, we 
condemned the Conservatives for their attacks on this and other 
social programs.
<P>
	Despite my initial opposition, I decided to participate 
objectively in the committee process, to listen to the arguments on 
both sides and then decide what position to take to oppose or 
support the bill in whole or in part.
<P>
	I was encouraged by the minister, who said that within certain 
limits he would accept amendments to improve the bill, which he 
has done, and I congratulate him for it. In particular, I refer to the 
amendments presented by the members for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury and Halifax West to change the 
method for calculating benefits, which amendments will 
substantially reduce the cuts to benefits as set out in the original 
bill. Also, amendments were presented by the hon. member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore to exempt low income families from the 
intensity rule.
<P>
	The original bill would have cut $2 billion from the 
unemployment insurance program. These amendments by my 
colleagues will put back approximately $400 million. All in all the 
committee did good work. It did the best it could within the fiscal 
framework, but there is the problem.
<P>
	One provision of the 1995 budget was to cut the unemployment 
insurance program by 10 per cent. Consequently, despite the 
goodwill and amendments of the committee, the bill still results in 
serious cuts to unemployment benefits at a time when a large 
number of Canadians are unemployed.
<P>
	I decided to participate in the committee to honestly listen to the 
arguments on both sides. The more I listened to the evidence in 
committee the more I became convinced that on the whole the bill 
was wrong.
<P>
	It is true the bill does contain some improved measures such as 
the hourly base for qualifying for and calculating UI benefits. 
Under the present law a person must work at least 15 hours per 
week in order to qualify with the result that many employers hire 
workers part time at less than 15 hours per week simply to avoid 
paying their contributions. Under this bill, all hours of work will 
count for qualification with the result that part time workers will 
have a better chance to qualify. This is definitely an improvement.
<P>
	There are other improvements as well. However, the net result 
when the improvements and the cuts are added up is that fewer 
people will be covered and the benefits will be lower than under the 
present system.
<P>
	As a result of earlier cuts by the Conservatives prior to 1993 and 
by the Liberals since 1993, the percentage of the unemployed 
covered by unemployment insurance dropped from 87 per cent in 
1990 to approximately 50 per cent to 52 per cent today. 
Unfortunately this bill will  make it worse. In addition, even with 
my colleagues' amendments, benefits will be lower for most 
claimants who qualify.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	My main concerns about this bill are the following. First, 
although the move to an hourly system is good in itself, the number 
of hours of work required to qualify is too high for both regular and 
special benefits. As a result it will be more difficult for workers to 
qualify under this bill than under the present law. While some part 
time workers will gain under these new rules, many workers will 
lose and will not achieve coverage.
<P>
	My second concern is that benefits will be reduced for 
three-quarters of unemployment insurance claimants as a result of 
three provisions in the bill. The first is the new method of 
calculating insurable earnings and benefits through the divisor rule. 
Even with the improvements of my colleagues the benefits will still 
be less. The second is the intensity rule which reduces benefits for 
those who are obliged to make repeated claims. I say obliged to 
make repeated claims. I have in mind seasonal workers and 
workers who are hired on a temporary basis. The third is the 
provision in the bill to reduce the maximum insurable benefit from 
$448 per week to $413 per week. That is the maximum benefit.
<P>
	My third concern is that the bill reduces the duration of benefits, 
the time for which benefits are paid, from a maximum of 50 weeks 
to 45 weeks. As a result there will be more unemployed persons 
with no benefits. They now qualify for up to 50 weeks; they will be 
cut off at 45 weeks.
<P>
	Some supporters of the bill believe that these measures, the 
measures to restrict coverage, to reduce benefits and to reduce the 
duration of payments, will force unemployed workers back to 
work. This belief presumes that work is available which is certainly 
not the case everywhere. It also presumes that most workers prefer 
unemployment. Again, there is no evidence to support that. I would 
say that a great number of workers want to work. There are some 
who do not and would live off welfare or unemployment insurance 
but they are a very small number.
<P>
	These measures might also force the unemployed to take lower 
paid jobs. With economic growth increasing, such as was stated in 
both this year's budget and last year's budget, this only continues 
to widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Why should we 
force people into lower paid jobs if economic growth in the country 
is in fact increasing? This is not economic justice.
<P>
	Another major concern I have with the bill is that it allocates a 
greater percentage of the UI fund to training and employment 
support measures. I fully agree that these measures are absolutely 
essential but until recently they have been paid out of general 
revenue and not out of the UI fund.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2377"> 2377 </A></B>
<P>
	What has happened is the government observed that this year 
the UI fund would have a surplus of approximately $5 billion so 
it decided to take some of that money to pay for training which 
had been previously paid out of general revenue. In the budget 
last year the government decided to cut approximately $2 billion 
from the unemployment insurance system, reallocate $800 million 
of that to training and employment and at the same time the 
government reduced its funds for training out of general revenue. 
In fact, the government is solving its general deficit problems by 
cutting expenditures for training which were made out of general 
revenue and then taking money for these same purposes from the 
UI fund.
<P>
	I must remind the House that the UI fund is made up of payroll 
contributions from employers and employees. Not all Canadians 
contribute to this fund. The original and principal purpose of the 
fund was to sustain the unemployed while temporarily out of work. 
It was to help the unemployed to pay their bills, to pay their rent, to 
pay for their food and to keep their children in school. That was the 
principal purpose of unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Training, like education, was always paid by all taxpayers 
because in the long run it benefits all taxpayers. The payment of 
primary and secondary education is not restricted to parents and 
students. Why should training then be paid only by workers and 
employers?
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the proposed system leaves individuals who do not 
qualify for unemployment insurance without the same training and 
employment opportunities. In particular, immigrants and women 
who have been at home taking care of their children and go back to 
work would not qualify for this training and these employment 
benefits because they have no attachment to the unemployment 
insurance system.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would support any measures which would 
correct abuse and encourage a return to work. However, in my view 
this bill punishes the innocent with the guilty. I will support the 
government's amendments to improve the bill but I will also 
support other amendments that will improve the bill. I must say 
that I will have to oppose those parts of the bill which reduce 
coverage and benefits.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would kick myself if I did not begin my remarks by 
mentioning that at least one government member has shown some 
understanding in his analysis of this bill. Incidentally, he is from 
Quebec. I congratulate him even more for that. Thus at least one 
Liberal member from Quebec has understood. What the member 
said is exactly what we keep hearing in demonstrations and in our 
ridings.
<P>
	This is a bill that, yes, has some improvements in some respects, 
but that, all in all, is a bad piece of legislation, a bill we must vote 
against. Hats off to the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
who stood in the House to say so.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Another thing that bothers me somewhat 
about all this analysis and about the whole issue of unemployment 
insurance, is when they limit or try to limit my right to stand up and 
express my views. I feel this has been done many times with regard 
to this bill. It was done right at the start when we skipped second 
reading to allow members to study the bill in committee and hear 
people before making recommendations. The aim of this process 
was to enhance the members' contribution. However, what did the 
government members do in committee? They gagged us so that we 
could not work at this bill, which is unacceptable.
<P>
	Or course, the government did not want to see people like the 
hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce come to every hearing and 
say that this is a bad bill for such and such a reason, with very 
specific cases. Obviously, the government did not want to hear that.
<P>
	Nor did it want to hear Bloc members echo their constituents' 
views that women and young people will not benefit from this bill, 
and that the unemployed will get clobbered. The government did 
not want to listen. It introduced a gag motion, and it is doing so 
once again at report stage. It is turning a deaf ear to people's views.
<P>
	The government's goal is quite specific. It wants to save money 
on the backs of the unemployed. So we can understand why the 
government is doing what it is doing.
<P>
	The government and the minister just sound ludicrous when they 
say these amendments are good, because unemployment insurance 
will be replaced by employment insurance. When one looks at the 
outcome of these amendments, it would be more appropriate to call 
it poverty insurance, because the only sure thing with this bill is 
that the unemployed will have a hard time, and in more ways than 
one.
<P>
	I have been trying to determine what this bill's goal is. With all 
the nice speeches we have heard day in and day out, would it be to 
create jobs? I think the evidence of expert witnesses in committee 
makes it clear that this bill will kill jobs. Nothing in this bill can 
create jobs. So that is not the goal.
<P>
	Would it be to help the unemployed? How could it be, when the 
bill takes money right out of their pockets. Demonstrations and 
briefs to the committee leave no doubt. It is clearly not the goal. 
Would it be to improve the quality of life for women and young 
women? It is equally clear that this is not the goal. Even the true 
Liberal member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce just told the House that 
it was not.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2378"> 2378 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I did look at the situation women are in, but since I am not that 
old, I looked even more closely at the situation our young people 
are in to see if this bill is going to be any help to them. Well, the 
answer is no. Nothing, whether it is in the rate or the premium 
calculation, is of any benefit to young workers.
<P>
	So, why bother with this reform? It is easy to understand once 
you are aware of the financial situation of the government and of 
the calculation method used by the Minister of Finance. The main 
objective of the federal government is to grab $5 billion to pay off 
the debt. It is rather hard to see that the only way for the 
government to reduce the deficit is at the expense of the poor. It is 
shameful from a party that claimed to be close to the people and 
have social democratic leanings. It is disappointing to see that the 
only money the government has been able to grab was, again, at the 
expense of the poor.
<P>
	The government is doing the very opposite of what Robin Hood 
did. It steals from the poor to be in a better position to help the rich. 
That is what this unemployment insurance reform is all about. Yet, 
in the red book and during the election campaign, the government 
did not, to my knowledge, say that it would pick on the 
unemployed, that it would grab them by the throat, as the Liberals 
love to say. I did not hear any such thing.
<P>
	To do so, the government introduced Bill C-12. Look how thick 
it is, and the government wants us to pass it at full speed. The bill 
has over 100 clauses, and countless subclauses. There are many 
changes. We need go no further than clause 2, which is covered by 
some of the amendments we are considering today. In clause 2, the 
government gives a whole series of definitions, for things as simple 
as an affidavit. If you want to confuse the public, you might as well 
go all the way. Everybody knows what an affidavit is, but the 
government felt the need to define it.
<P>
	There is also a definition of an interruption of earnings, a labour 
dispute and documents. There is a whole series of definitions 
whose objective and, maybe, only positive aspect is to make a 
living for lawyers. Since I am a lawyer, I may talk for them. 
Lawyers will use all those definitions to slow things down as much 
as they wish. The other side of the coin is that public servants will 
also use those definitions but not necessarily in the best interests of 
the unemployed, obviously.
<P>
	The interpretation will be to the effect of restricting even more 
eligibility for unemployment insurance. We, the official 
opposition, cannot agree with that. That is why we are against 
clause 2 and asking that it be abolished. In any case, the legislator 
does not talk for the sake of talking. If a series of definitions is 
provided, they will have to be interpreted.
<P>
	Even more important is the last point where the government says 
that this reform will help the unemployed as regards their employ
<P>
ability. In a clause which, again, goes against the pretensions of the 
government, it is clearly said that programs will raise the 
employability level of recipients.
<P>
	Any decision by a public servant regarding the eligibility or 
non-eligibility of an unemployed person for a training program 
cannot be appealed. This is what this bill is all about. A public 
servant will make an arbitrary decision that the unemployed will 
not be able to appeal. Today, 75 per cent of appeals made by the 
unemployed are successful.
<P>
	Why do you think the government has thought it necessary to put 
that in the bill? Simply because public servants will be instructed to 
crack down harder on the unemployed so that the government 
reaches its objective, which is to reap $5 billion. This is clear.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	When the minister tells us that he will propose this or that 
amendment to improve the bill, this is hogwash because, 
ultimately, the $5 billion target remains. Let us reduce this $5 
billion target, let us talk about a target of maybe $1 billion, and 
then the amendments might be significant. But ultimately, what 
good does it do to rob Peter to pay Paul?
<P>
	The minister still has these $5 billion to artificially reduce the 
deficit, and to do it at the expense of the unemployed. This is the 
price we have to pay because the government does not care about 
the unemployed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today on this important restructuring of the current 
unemployment insurance system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to congratulate my colleagues who sat on the 
parliamentary committee and worked on this complex problem. 
This bill is about modernizing our unemployment insurance 
program, that was created in the 1970s. Because more and more 
Canadians are affected by rapid economic transformations and the 
government's budget for social programs is already stretched to the 
limit, no one can deny that these changes were needed.
<P>
	I would like to focus on three topics today, which are the 
computation of eligible hours, the effect on small businesses and 
the application of this system to high income earners.
<P>
	First, this bill constitutes, in my opinion, a fundamental change 
as far as eligibility to the system is concerned. From now on, 
eligibility will be based on the  number of hours worked and not 
weeks. In today's labour market, a system based on the number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2379"> 2379 </A></B>
<P>
weeks worked creates unfairness. For many workers, one week 
does not mean 40 hours from Monday to Friday any more.
<P>
	When establishing the eligibility of workers according to the 
number of hours worked, the government wants to ensure that 
every hour of work counts. Thus, it would be more advantageous to 
work as long as one can. The new system takes into account the fact 
the labour market has changed and that millions of people now 
have work patterns that no longer correspond to the traditional 
work week. They deserve the same protection as their fellow 
citizens holding regular jobs get in case of a layoff.
<P>
	The new system is a lot fairer for people working part time or in 
seasonal industries. For example, people working less than 15 
hours a week will be insurable from now on. With employment 
insurance, 90,000 part time or seasonal workers will become 
eligible for benefits. Many will become eligible earlier and for 
longer periods and will see a bigger part of their earnings insured.
<P>
	Second, I would like to talk about the effects of the bill on 
economic growth. The government's objective is to create an 
environment that is good for business, economic growth and job 
creation. That is the main objective of our employment strategy.
<P>
	That objective will be met in many ways. I will cover only two. 
First, the lowering of the maximum insurable earnings will match 
more closely than the present system insurable earnings and 
salaries in Canada.
<P>
	That change will lower the payroll charges, thus increasing the 
revenues of employers as well as those of employees. The 
reduction in employer and employee contributions will be 
particularly apparent in high salary sectors.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Second, one element of the employment insurance program will 
constitute an important support program for small businesses. You 
will agree with me that small businesses are vital to Canadian 
economic renewal.
<P>
	The small business support program will reduce the impact of 
any increase in the contribution level. This will be aimed at 
companies with fewer than 25 employees that will pay less than 
$30,000 in premiums in 1996. Any raise in the contribution level 
representing $500 or more as compared with the base year, 1996, 
will give the employer a partial rebate. Companies affected will get 
a rebate of up to 50 per cent of any raise in 1997 and 25 per cent in 
1998. This two-year program will begin in January 1997 to 
coincide with the implementation of the first dollar earned policy 
and the annual calculation of maximum insurable earnings. 
Employers whose 1996 contributions are less than $25,000 will be 
entitled to a maximum yearly rebate of $5,000. Those whose  
contributions are between $25,000 and $30,000 will see their 
maximum rebate reduced dollar for dollar.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to talk about this system as it applies to 
high-income people. Some of my constituents have mentioned the 
fact that, under the present system, it is possible to work a few 
months during the year and to increase one's income by drawing 
unemployment insurance for the rest of the year, and to do so year 
after year. This inequity was raised by several Canadians during the 
consultations that led to this bill.
<P>
	The employment insurance program will have stricter clawback 
provisions. Claimants who will have received more than 20 weeks 
of benefits over the last five years and whose income exceeds 
$39,000 will have to reimburse a greater portion of their insurance 
benefits than is the case at the present time. These people could 
have to reimburse up to 50 per cent of the benefits that were paid to 
them.
<P>
	High-income earners who contribute to the program will 
continue to have access to reasonable benefits in case of unforseen 
job loss. However, those who work only part of the year and whose 
income is still higher than average will not be able to increase their 
income by drawing considerable amounts in employment insurance 
year after year.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think this bill makes necessary changes to the 
unemployment insurance system to modernize it. The new system 
confirms the value of work since every hour of work counts. So the 
system will protect 97 per cent of the labour force. It will be more 
fair and more balanced. It provides for recovery of benefits, thus 
guaranteeing that people with high incomes receiving benefits 
frequently will no longer benefit from the system unfairly. Finally, 
the move to employment insurance will be gradual so that small 
businesses will have the time they need to adjust to the changes. 
This bill represents a compromise between our budget constraints 
and our desire to offset the negative effects of unexpected loss of 
employment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleagues, I must also state that this bill is a poor one.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the only government member who seems to 
have understood something and who had the courage to rise in this 
House and honestly speak his mind.
<P>
	As I have already said, this bill dealing with employment 
insurance in Canada, which is now at report stage, is a real 
injustice. It is unfair, regressive, anti-job and it will only cause 
poverty. Never before has any government so seriously challenged 
the social safety net essential to citizens. Employment insurance, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2380"> 2380 </A></B>
<P>
or rather  poverty insurance, will offer the unemployed less and less 
support; they will be left to fend for themselves.
<P>
	With a $5.5 billion surplus and an unemployment rate exceeding 
20 per cent in some regions, I cannot fathom how we can call this 
bill an employment insurance bill.
<P>
	One point particularly close to my heart goes back to the last 
unemployment insurance reform. I remember the Liberals, then in 
the opposition, had raised quite an uproar when the government 
changed the system so that workers willingly quitting their jobs, or 
being fired, were excluded from the unemployment insurance 
system.
<P>
	And what will the present bill change? Absolutely nothing. The 
government is not correcting the injustice it denounced so strongly 
when it was in the opposition. Clause 33 of the bill confirms the 
principle. It says claimants will not be entitled to benefits if they 
voluntarily quit their job or lose it because of so-called misconduct.
<P>
	Did the government consider those who hold several jobs? This 
new system will take into account each hour worked. Three hours 
at McDonald, four hours at Harveys, one week-end at Loblaws. 
According to the government, this is the way low income earners 
will be able to become eligible for employment insurance.
<P>
	But what will happen if a worker who is holding several casual 
jobs decides to voluntary quit one to readjust his work schedule? 
Will this voluntary departure be entered in his file? Will he be 
eligible for employment insurance?
<P>
	This is only one small example of the many flaws of this reform. 
It has all kinds of flaws. Eligibility criteria are being tightened. 
Before, 12 to 15 fifteen-hour weeks, for a total of 180 to 300 hours, 
depending on the situation, were needed to become eligible. With 
this bill, to become eligible will require from 420 to 700 hours of 
work, or 12 to 20 thirty-five-hour weeks. In the case of new 
entrants to the labour force, the number of hours necessary is three 
times higher that it was.
<P>
	From now on there will two categories of unemployed workers: 
the regular ones and the frequent ones. Those with an attachment to 
the system will see their benefit rate drop from 55 to 50 per cent, or 
1 per cent for every 20 weeks they were paid benefits. This measure 
means that people will have to work longer to be entitled to lower 
benefits for a shorter period of time.
<P>
	This bill is regressive because there will only be one premium 
rate, a fixed rate for all workers, and maximum insurable earnings 
will be $39,000 instead of $42,380 as under the current system.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I will give you an example of the consequences of this measure. 
A worker who earns $39,000 or less pays 2.95 per cent of his salary 
in premiums. A worker who earns over $39,000 a year will stop 
paying premiums once the  threshold is reached. The more a 
worker earns, the more his percentage of premiums drops.
<P>
	The employment insurance bill is also an anti-employment 
measure. In fact, the five-cent reduction in workers' premium 
rates, from $3 to $2.95, and the establishment of the $39,000 
ceiling on insurable earnings, gives capital intensive businesses an 
advantage over labour intensive businesses, which are essentially 
small and medium size businesses that create jobs. This measure 
encourages overtime among high income earners.
<P>
	This is a motion that really hurts workers. The load is lightened 
for high income earners, while those who earn less are asked to 
carry a greater burden. As I have just said, higher wage earners are 
simply being given an opportunity to work extra hours, which will 
automatically eliminate jobs.
<P>
	Not only does the reform encourage overtime, but it also 
encourages people to hold down two or more jobs. Despite all that 
has been said about reducing the work week in order to create 
employment, Bill C-12 is headed in a completely different 
direction.
<P>
	Finally, this bill will lead to poverty. By reducing benefit rates, 
taxing workers from the first hour and tightening eligibility 
criteria, thus cutting off certain clients entirely, the new measures 
will result in an increase in the number of people forced to turn to 
welfare.
<P>
	This bill has wide ranging effects: young people, women, 
immigrants, new claimants, the regions, family benefits, eligibility 
and the calculation of benefits, seasonal workers, self-employed 
workers and the handicapped. To sum it up, this bill is just like this 
government. It dabbles with everything and solves nothing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the report stage debate on the 
employment insurance legislation, Bill C-12, which will surely 
have a positive impact on all communities of Canada, including my 
riding of Lambtom-Middlesex.
<P>
	It should be mentioned from the outset that the old 
Unemployment Insurance Act has not been revamped for 25 years. 
The technological revolution that has been sweeping over the 
economy during this period of time has also been a force in 
reshaping, reconfiguring and redesigning our jobs.
<P>
	Let us be clear. Changing technology does not mean there are no 
jobs. It does mean there are different jobs often in different places 
and often requiring different skills. The result is that people today 
change jobs more frequently not only within the company or 
industry but  crossing into new industries and occupations as whole 
industries are reshaped and new ones spring up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2381"> 2381 </A></B>
<P>
	This new economic renewal has its positive side. It has brought 
new opportunities, new growth, new jobs, over 600,000 new jobs 
since the government was elected two and one-half years ago. An 
innovative economy also requires innovative social policies and I 
strongly believe Bill C-12 delivers.
<P>
	Today I will address two key structural changes which are 
important features of the bill. The first is the switch from using 
weeks of work at UI covered jobs to using hours of covered work as 
the main unit of account for the new employment insurance 
program. The second is the new intensity rule whereby the 
replacement rate for insured earnings would fall with increased use 
of the program over the previous five years. I strongly support both 
of these innovations. Each is a made in Canada solution to 
important problems with our present unemployment insurance 
program.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The first of these two key proposed changes, the shift to using 
hours of work as the main unit of account, is a forward looking 
provision that will greatly affect program coverage in years to 
come. We currently have a program that excludes jobs offering less 
than 15 hours of work per week from UI coverage. Part time 
employment is on the increase for many reasons. However, as part 
time employment continues to grow, the portion of total 
employment in our economy that is UI or EI covered would also 
continue to fall.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance programs in Canada and in other 
developed countries have been in place long enough that most of us 
have come to take for granted the important economic stabilization 
functions of these programs. For example, when any country slips 
into an economic recession, those who are laid off must cut back on 
their expenditures far more severely if they are ineligible to collect 
earnings from insurance benefits. In addition to the damage to them 
and their families, the large decreases in expenditures also translate 
into lower levels of sales and even more layoffs.
<P>
	This circular spiral of layoffs leading to sales decreases which 
lead to more layoffs can potentially result in deep economic 
depression. I believe this is every bit as possible now as it was back 
in the 1930s without powerful economic stabilizers like our UI 
program that push up the standard of living of those who have this 
coverage. Thus, the value of UI or EI programs as an automatic 
stabilizer depends on the broadest coverage possible.
<P>
	The proposed move to an hourly as opposed to a weekly unit of 
account will, I believe, reverse the erosion of our present UI 
program due to the increasing numbers of part time jobs that are 
ineligible for coverage under the present program rules. This will 
definitely help to  preserve the important economic stabilization 
rule of this program.
<P>
	The change will lead to greater equity of treatment for part time 
versus full time workers. This is increasingly important in an 
economy where growing numbers of people can only find 
employment in part time jobs though they may be working full 
time when their hours of work and all jobs are counted.
<P>
	Before offering my comments on the proposed intensity rule in 
Bill C-12, it is worth mentioning that the 1971 changes to the UI 
Act set our UI program on a course toward becoming an income 
transfer rather than a social insurance program, characterized by an 
unwieldy mix of regional equalization and federal welfare transfers 
in a social insurance program format. I am convinced that the 
intensity rule would help re-establish UI or EI as a true social 
insurance program.
<P>
	I use the term social insurance to mean a program that provides 
insurance coverage against specified perils, with those paying for 
the program receiving fair personal value for their money. True 
insurance coverage is not the same as having individual rainy day 
accounts that eventually can be used by individuals for other 
purposes if the insurance peril does not occur, in other words, if 
what was paid in is not fully used to cover peril related damages for 
the individual.
<P>
	True insurance means that those who are covered by the 
program, who are unlucky and suffer the insured peril, whether it 
be fire, theft or unemployment, can draw out more than they paid in 
according to stated rules. On the other hand, those who are lucky 
and never do suffer the peril they are insured against must be 
satisfied with having enjoyed the peace of mind of knowing they 
were insured.
<P>
	All true insurance programs involve some sort of experience 
rating or other risk related adjustment of the premium payments 
versus the coverage levels. There are essentially two forms of 
experience rating in most insurance programs. Those in higher risk 
groups either must pay higher premiums for the same coverage 
levels as is common for automobile collision insurance or get less 
coverage for the same premium rates.
<P>
	The proposed intensity rule in C-12 adopts the latter approach. 
That is, all claimants with more than 20 weeks of regular benefits 
in the previous five years would have their benefit rate gradually 
reduced. It would decline by one percentage point for each 20 
weeks of past benefits collected to a floor of 50 per cent of 
insurable earnings.
<P>
	The maximum benefit rate under Bill C-12 would be 55 per cent 
of insurable earnings. I believe this is more than fair. This is true to 
the experience rating adjustment of any real insurance program. It 
is also worth mentioning that everyone would start EI with a clean 
slate. Previous use of UI benefits before July 1, 1996 will not 
count.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2382"> 2382 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Our present UI program is not means tested and is not paid for 
out of general tax revenues. It is entirely funded by payroll taxes on 
those covered by the program and their employers. Yet it is not 
experience rated either and is thus not really an insurance program. 
In fact, all those covered by the program are taxed according to the 
same schedule.
<P>
	Those at greater risk of becoming unemployed because they live 
in regions with higher unemployment rates are given more rather 
than less coverage. Those in high unemployment regions become 
eligible to collect UI benefits with fewer weeks of insured benefits 
and can continue to collect benefits for more weeks.
<P>
	At present the use of our UI program is constrained by neither 
experience rating nor means testing. The intensity rule addresses 
this by introducing a mild degree of general experience rating in 
the UI program.
<P>
	Rather than largely excluding seasonal workers such as those 
engaged in the construction trades, as was the case prior to the 1971 
changes to the UI program, Bill C-12 will provide high risk 
workers with coverage. However the degree of coverage would 
diminish with increased claims over the previous five years. In this 
way broad coverage would still be maintained without risking a 
runaway growth of program costs.
<P>
	I am convinced that the intensity rule would successfully change 
the current UI system by transforming it into a real and much fairer 
insurance program. Of course many of those in intermittent 
employment truly cannot find other work.
<P>
	Canadians have demonstrated time and again that they are 
willing to make personal sacrifices to provide financial assistance 
to others who are in real need. That is why Bill C-12 contains a 
number of provisions to address this reality. For up to three years 
those who have exhausted their benefits will have access to target 
employment benefits such as wage subsidies, earning supplements, 
self-employment incentives, and skills and loans grants.
<P>
	Experts have looked at all aspects of how the old UI system 
operated. They know it can affect the behaviour of employers and 
employees in ways that Canadians simply do not accept any more. 
Bill C-12 is a good piece of legislation that successfully addresses 
some of the more current aspects of our system.
<P>
	After 25 years of the status quo, it is time Canadians had an 
employment insurance system that better reflects the realities of 
the 1990s and beyond.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again this 
marks a sad moment in the life of a member of Parliament, to have 
to stand up in this House to speak on a bill with such devastating 
effects on the lives of our  fellow citizens. We have said many 
times, and are forced to say again today, this is a sad day. People 
are not yet properly aware of the consequences, and that is what I 
find surprising. Unemployment insurance-let us call a spade a 
spade-is a tool of economic stabilization. It is something that is 
necessary and useful in most of our ridings. I do not think it is just a 
coincidence that it is a Canadian invention.
<P>
	How can we make people understand? How can we ensure that 
the hon. members across the floor understand, when the time 
comes to vote on these motions, on this bill? What can we do to 
ensure that people will understand all of the importance of what is 
at stake. The hon. member across the way, in some bits of her 
speech on this group of motions, referred to a program that has not 
changed in 25 years. I may perhaps be in agreement with certain 
points. We ought perhaps to have started changing a few things, but 
changing unilaterally, and in the way that has been adopted, means 
that the only beneficiary of this reform will be the coffers of the 
government. It can hardly be a surprise that the opposition is 
making an outcry. It is hardly a surprise that there has been an 
outcry in certain ridings that have to live with serious 
unemployment. Their outcry comes as no surprise.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	How is it that here, in this House of Commons, in this 
Parliament-and yet we have in front of us some educated 
people-we are unable to make them understand that?
<P>
	I can hardly believe it, and I am not anxious to see the effect all 
this will have. We have unemployment insurance as it exists 
currently, and we have the problems. I would like to be told once 
again, but where do we see in this bill that people will really be sure 
to get a job? The government is only playing on words. It has only 
been window dressing, to introduce measures to reduce the 
amounts given to claimants and the length of time they will receive 
them.
<P>
	As was said earlier, everyone will be affected. I come from a 
remote riding, the Gaspé Peninsula. Incidentally, I think that is the 
most beautiful part of Quebec and of Canada, the nicest riding. It is 
not only people who make their living from the fisheries and 
forestry who will be affected. People who work in construction, 
whether in Montreal or in Toronto, are also experiencing some 
fluctuation in their field, and they will be seriously affected.
<P>
	I can give you an example in that regard. With this new bill, a 
person working in construction will find himself trying as much as 
possible to put together his work hours or work weeks in a given 
time, because if he is not careful, the amount of benefits he will 
receive when he is not working, that is, when he is on 
unemployment insurance, or employment insurance, will be 
reduced.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2383"> 2383 </A></B>
<P>
	Consequently, people will only want to work during periods 
where it will be to their benefit, but not necessarily when the 
customer needs their services. A Montreal customer might need 
a door handle fixed on a Saturday morning in February, but it 
might unfortunately be more convenient for the worker to do it 
in May, because he could then add it to his hours of work during 
the summer. This is just one example.
<P>
	I know that this group of motions refers to it without referring to 
it. I am trying to see where it is mentioned in the definitions. But 
the details on how to calculate the hours of work-for fishermen, 
for example-will be in the regulations. This is just to show you 
how obscure the process is at this time. It is easy to see why both 
the opposition and the people want as much time as possible to 
discuss and study this bill.
<P>
	I was going to give some examples concerning fishermen, 
self-employed workers and lumberjacks. Under the current 
legislation, benefits are based on the number of weeks. The people 
in my region are used to quantifying their work. This is something 
tangible. A vat of fish is not the same as a given number of hours. 
That is how pay is determined and how benefits are claimed at the 
end of the year. As for lumberjacks, they chop 1, 10 or 20 cords of 
wood. Again, this is something tangible. How will this be 
converted to hours of work, after the bill takes effect?
<P>
	The current definitions and regulations do not specify how this 
will be done. They say it is coming. It is coming so fast that we will 
get run over because we could not see it coming. The people have a 
right to know exactly how all this will be calculated, because it is 
their lives that will be affected.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I know that you, too, come from a region with 
many forestry workers. You know how hard these people work. I 
cannot see them walking around with notebooks in their hands, 
saying: ``Hey, boss, I worked in this part of the forest for an hour''. 
No. They will say: ``I cut so much wood''. Will there be a 
conversion? How will all this be calculated? I do not know. The 
vast majority of people do not know.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	One thing that is becoming clear to them is the impact the cuts 
will have. We are told right away that there will be a dividing 
factor. The effect of this dividing factor will be to reduce the 
benefit amounts. What good does it do the public to get fleeced like 
that?
<P>
	I would have expected a bill of this importance to rely on 
partnership with the public, to call upon the public's co-operation. 
From the outset, the public is told: ``You will receive benefits over 
a shorter period, your benefits will be lower and, if you claim 
benefits too often, we will get on your case and impose another 
penalty on you''.
<P>
	All this is quite disheartening and does not leave much leeway to 
try to amend the bill. That is why, with the  group of motions before 
us, we hope to review all the proposed definitions contained in the 
bill. There is nothing in there to make people feel secure and to 
give them an idea of what could be done to protect them. It is all 
going one way and one way only, straight in the government's 
pockets.
<P>
	But the people cannot in turn dip into someone else's pockets 
when they go shopping after work, looking for a product that they 
need. They have worked, they have learned to live with the 
shortage of employment around them and to supplement their 
monthly income with unemployment benefits, but overnight all 
this will change, yet they are expected to believe that it will be 
good for them, while it has been made clear from the beginning that 
they will receive less money. That is beyond me.
<P>
	I raised this point last week, but now that I have found the 
quotation again, I would like to read it once again. The person who 
used to sit in front of me, the former Minister of Fisheries, Mr. 
Tobin, broke his silence last week. He made a statement on May 1. 
He said to the Prime Minister: ``No more cuts please''. He is very 
polite, but he still asked that no more cuts be made. He said that, 
while his province collected a disproportionately high amount of 
money, because of its disproportionate reliance on federal transfer 
payments, it has reached its limit. The Prime Minister's best friend 
is giving him a warning while they are still friends: ``Enough is 
enough''. We are already hit hard because we lack jobs. Now, in 
addition to that, the victims of that job shortage will be targeted.
<P>
	The one thing I deplore is: Why did the member for 
Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte wait until he was gone? Why did 
he wait until he left Ottawa to make himself so clearly understood? 
He is now the premier of his province and he sees how the lack of 
jobs affects his population. He says: ``What Ottawa is doing is not 
right''.
<P>
	But he is no longer here. Will I have to wait until others leave 
before saying these things? The damage will have been done. The 
government imposed time allocation. We are being gagged. This is 
what it means. We are forced to contain ourselves, to not speak 
longer about a bill that will deeply affect society in Canada and 
Quebec.
<P>
	We are told: ``Yvan, shut up, you said enough''. But those who, 
not long ago, had the power to speak in this House and are now 
gone say: ``What Ottawa is doing is not right. Enough is enough''.
<P>
	I hope that some members opposite will rise and will not wait 
until they leave Ottawa to say to the Prime Minister: ``We cannot 
go ahead with this reform. We must find a partnership with the 
opposition and with interest groups to rebuild this system in a 
climate of confidence and dignity''. Currently, given the bill before 
us, the government is only helping itself.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2384"> 2384 </A></B>
<P>
	For these reasons, I cannot support this legislation and I will 
rise again, as soon as other motions allow me to do so, to voice 
my opposition.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very glad to have another 
opportunity to speak on Bill C-12, which will bring forward a new 
employment system for Canada.
<P>
	I was very ashamed of some of my colleagues opposite with 
regard to the HRD hearings. For two and a half years we travelled 
across the country listening to more than 1,000 individuals and 
groups of people. We were there. This legislation reflects a lot of 
what we heard.
<P>
	I remember being in Alberta. Sure, we might have been a little 
tired at the end of those 12 and 15-hour days. We had walk-ons, 
where any individual who showed up could appear before the 
committee. As Liberals we were willing to listen to people.
<P>
	People appeared before us with tears in their eyes. There was no 
press. They were not trying to impress anyone. They were asking 
for help.
<P>
	Tomorrow, in Ontario, there is going to be a reformatory budget. 
The budget brought by this group of people in Toronto, as in 
Alberta, will attack the working people, or the people who thought 
they were going to be working.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> There is pride in Alberta in balancing the 
budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Yes, there is a lot of pride in Alberta, but I 
have neighbours in Ontario. I have friends in Alberta who taught 
school for five or six years. They have given of themselves for their 
education. Today, these people are gone. We are not investing in the 
children. We are not investing in our future. Its reformatory tactics 
are disgraceful. Thank goodness, we have a Liberal government, a 
government that will give people an opportunity to help 
themselves.
<P>
	There are many benefits available in part II of the bill to help 
people help themselves. The former minister for HRD is from the 
Winnipeg area. I remember at committee being frowned at by a few 
of my Liberal colleagues and being applauded by some of the 
Reform Party when I said that there was some abuse in the system.
<P>
	Finally, I said to the former minister: ``If you want the public,'' 
this was my humble opinion, ``to accept what we were trying to do, 
I think we should at least acknowledge the abuse''. Today, the 
minister has done that.
<P>
	From looking at the direct abuse, we are going to be able to take 
that money and offer it to people who want to help themselves. In 
all the provinces of this country,  45 per cent of the people who 
have fallen through the cracks-it can happen-are friends and 
neighbours of ours to whom it happened. If these people worked 
one day in the last three years, if they had a work attachment, five 
days following the birth of a child, they now qualify to access any 
one of the five tools in part II.
<P>
	There are the targeted wage subsidies. This is not just subsidized 
jobs, but on the job training that will make a difference in their 
lives. It gives people some heart. We will not be cutting at random 
like the Ontario government will do tomorrow.
<P>
	There are targeted earning supplements and self-employment 
programs. As a small business person I have attended some of the 
classes under HRD that are available since I do not know how long 
this job will last.
<P>
	I have seen people attend the classes to get ready to start their 
own businesses. It has made a difference. Statistics show when a 
person starts a business usually he or she will employ one more 
person. We have to give people a chance to help themselves.
<P>
	There will also be job creation partnerships, skills loans and 
grants. For my hon. colleagues and friends opposite, yes, the 
provinces will be able to make the decisions.
<P>
	I have heard many people talk because of the misinformation out 
there about this reserve fund being used to pay part of the deficit. 
As we all know, that is not allowed by law. It will not make any 
difference to the deficit in the long run. A reserve is a very 
necessary part of this bill.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The other day the department furnished us with a table that 
showed the cumulative interest charges. More than $1 billion had 
to be repaid out of UI premiums because of outstanding deficits 
between 1991 and 1995. By contrast, twice that amount, $2.3 
billion, was repaid following the previous recession in the early 
eighties. It makes much sense and will create jobs to have a cushion 
there if there is another recession.
<P>
	Many witnesses appeared before us. I quote one witness who 
was among the last 85 to appear. Professor Alice Nakamura, a 
distinguished doctor in the faculty of business at the University of 
Alberta, put a lot of work into this bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I committed a great deal of time and effort to the Axworthy social security 
reform task force. Many of those around me told me I was foolish to do that. 
``Look what happened to previous attempts for reform attempts'', I was told. I 
knew what they were talking about.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This doctor had committed time and effort to the MacDonald 
royal commission on the development prospects for Canada. She 
continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2385"> 2385 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was advised that the different political parties and the provinces would not be 
willing to pass up the opportunities for partisan gains that a UI reform attempt 
invariably brings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You have proven wrong all those who told me this reform effort was a waste 
of time. Bill C-12 tackles serious problems with our present UI program, 
making use of the best available research about how our labour markets and 
social programs function. And it is a bill that pays careful attention to the real 
life problems of transition. It strikes a careful balance between the desperation 
of people who cannot find enough work and have depended on the income from 
UI benefits, and the desperation of economic analysts who recognize the threat 
which trends in our present UI programs pose for our economy and the future 
employment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The prospects for these people will be dim, but now there is hope 
for many people. As the doctor reminded us, she believes future 
generations will look back on our efforts in deep admiration and 
gratitude.
<P>
	Many witnesses from across the country appeared in front of the 
committee. We heard from unions. They complained. They said we 
did this wrong and that wrong, that we were going too far. We heard 
from other social groups that said we were not going far enough, 
vice versa. This is an excellent piece of Liberal legislation in which 
we show we have listened to the people, that we care about the 
people. We are not just looking after people from one province.
<P>
	That would not be a fair shot to my hon. colleague. I do want to 
recognize that the members from the Bloc who have sat on our 
committee for the last two and a half years were there. I saw them 
burning the midnight oil listening to people in all 10 provinces, two 
territories and the eastern Arctic with concerns.
<P>
	There is a third party in the House. I would not say its members 
were not present at hearings. However, I do not think it is 
commendable to go on hearings across the country, stay for an hour 
or so each day, then go on to the street to campaign and hold press 
conferences. It is very shameful.
<P>
	With my small business background I spent time looking at this 
bill. There is really good news. I did many miles on the weekend. I 
talked to a lot of people. I talked to small business people about the 
GST. I would like to have seen us go further with the GST but, as 
the Minister of Finance says, if we do one thing wrong and we 
waste a dollar we cannot bring the deficit down very steadily as we 
are doing now.
<P>
	The interest rate today in Canada is a bargain and is creating 
jobs. The low interest rate we have today is putting confidence 
back in the marketplace. Friends of mine have said they would not 
want to have a business because there is too much paperwork.
<P>
	After Mr. Harris gets his reformatory budget on the floor 
tomorrow, I am sure he will start thinking about how he can help 
the province for the right reasons.  Regarding the GST, putting the 
two taxes together will make for half the paperwork.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	This bill does a lot for small businesses. The record of 
employment, the one page form I spoke about the other day, comes 
with a 30 page instruction manual on how to fill out the one page. 
This will not be necessary anymore. There will be straightforward 
records where the regular payroll records can be followed and put 
on the sheets to report them; great progress.
<P>
	No wonder the bill has been endorsed by the chambers of 
commerce and many business groups across the country. Again, it 
is unfortunate that members of the parties opposite feel it is their 
responsibility to take misinformation from this place. For once I 
would like to see the second party and especially the third party 
support what is good for the country and for individuals and give 
these people an opportunity.
<P>
	With this legislation we are giving people an opportunity to help 
themselves. What more can we do? People do want to work and 
take part in the workforce. They want to feel they contribute to 
their country. This EI bill will make it possible for them.

	She said: Mr. Speaker, we have heard many speeches from the 
members opposite who, after agreeing to limit the debate, have 
decided to respond to our arguments because they see how this bill 
is indefensible.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I just heard that this bill will help people help themselves. The 
things we hear in this House. True, Part II of the bill provides for 
employment benefits under five programs. However, what 
members opposite are not saying is that, over five years, there will 
be only $200 million in new funds and that these provisions are 
designed mainly to allow money from the unemployment insurance 
fund to be used to pay for employment programs that are currently 
funded through the consolidated revenue fund. So such an 
interpretation is totally unacceptable. It is not true to the facts.
<P>
	The facts are the unemployment insurance fund will pay for 
employment programs presently funded through the consolidated 
revenue fund and the government will  be able to use the money 
saved to reduce the deficit. Yes, money from the unemployment 
insurance fund will be used for employment benefits, but this is not 
on top of but in replacement of what exists now. There will be only 
$200 million in new funds, and they will also come from the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	The government says this bill will help people help themselves, 
but you cannot tell Canadians this kind of thing. You have to add 
that, right now, nobody is entitled to the training or so-called 
employment programs available because there is no possible 
recourse for people who are refused participation in such a training 
program. The government can refuse to help you and you do not 
even have the minimum right of appeal provided for in the 
legislation.
<P>
	According to unemployment insurance umpires and the Federal 
Court of Appeal judges, that right of appeal is highly ineffective. 
For example, Ms. Reed, an UI umpire, said: ``In fact, there is no 
doubt that umpires see only a tiny proportion of these errors 
because the majority of claimants will never take their complaint to 
a board of referees, much less before an umpire''. What is difficult 
to accept, however, is that it is claimants who bear the burden of the 
board's errors.
<P>
	In this case, at least, claimants have some recourse, described as 
ineffective by the umpire, because the umpires and courts cannot 
overturn a decision; they can only ask the board to review its 
decision, but at least they can have this decision reviewed, even if it 
is only minimal recourse. People who want training courses do not 
have this minimal recourse. This is the nature of the amendment we 
brought to the bill before us. It is not a question of being told that 
this modern bill should be amended. It is not a modern bill. It is a 
bill the purpose of which is to exclude more people from benefits, 
and an hon. member across the way, the member for 
Notre-Dame-de Grâce, has admitted it. No, it is not a bill that is 
trying to give more people access to unemployment insurance.
<P>
	When we hear that 90,000 more people will be covered, what 
does that mean? That means that the only thing these people can be 
certain of is that they will be paying premiums. That is all they can 
be sure of.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	I also heard that this bill would be good for small and medium 
size businesses, which, as we know, create more jobs. Here again, 
they must not have scrutinized the bill very closely. On the 
contrary, small and medium size business are the ones which will 
have to open the till wider, while large businesses are being given a 
gift in the form of an exemption from paying premiums for workers 
earning between $39,000 and $42,400. There is a gift for workers 
who are now paying premiums up to $42,400. Henceforth, that will 
stop at $39,000. It is absurd. It makes no sense.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2387"> 2387 </A></B>
<P>
	And who foots the bill for this present? Precisely those who 
work 0 to 15 hours, not now paying into the fund nor eligible for 
benefits, it is true. And their employers, who do not make 
contributions on their behalf, but now they will. These employers 
and employees will both pay for this, but the problem is that the 
majority of them will not really have access to unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	If the government had wanted to make the assistance of 
unemployment insurance benefits available to the people working 
0 to 15 hours, if would not have tripled eligibility conditions for 
those returning to the work force and more than doubled the 
requirement for those already in the work force. They are taking 
advantage of the hour-based system, under the pretext that it will 
cover more people, whereas it will cut back the system's 
accessibility. Yes, they will be forced to pay. That is the only thing 
they can be sure of. As for offering them a bridge between two jobs. 
That is something else again.
<P>
	There is another worrisome trend in this bill. It encourages 
people working 0 to 15 hours to hold down two jobs. Everyone, in 
fact, is encouraged to have two. Generally speaking, then, while 
there is a universal trend to cut back the length of the work week, to 
encourage people to job share, this bill is encouraging people to 
hold down two jobs, rewards people who have two jobs, rewards 
overtime.
<P>
	But I must add something, something that many will find a 
dramatic revelation. People must know that, if someone holding 
two jobs and with insurable weeks behind him quits one of them, he 
immediately loses all the weeks of insurable work accumulated 
until then, even if he was on the verge of having enough weeks to 
be eligible for unemployment insurance, or on the verge of being 
eligible.
<P>
	By quitting one of his own accord, he will lose eligibility on both 
and will have to start from scratch again. In 1990 and in 1993, the 
Liberals created an uproar because the Conservatives imposed total 
loss of eligibility when someone left a job voluntarily.
<P>
	What are they doing today? Not only do they approve of what 
they had knocked then, they are taking it even further. Indeed, from 
now on, according to the double requirements of this bill, someone 
who has two jobs and quits one because he is no longer able to go 
on, will lose all his weeks of insurable earnings if he quits for 
reasons other that those specified in the bill because he will be 
considered to have left voluntarily. The fault will be theirs. This is 
a real scandal. I will stop here, but if I listened to my heart I could 
go on for a long time.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
members of this House should take their responsibility to meet 
Canadians' real needs very seriously.
<P>
	During the election campaign, people told us of real needs, of the 
hardship, the suffering people face when there is no more money 
coming in. Those of us in this House who took part in local debates 
know what suffering is all about. This is why it is important that all 
members of this House take the proposed improvement to these 
people's lives seriously.
<P>
	I was a member of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, and we have been debating this subject 
for a long time. I want to congratulate the members of this 
committee for the great job they have done, particularly those who 
made suggestions. The way members of the opposition talk about 
it, it is as though they are making people's suffering a political 
matter, which it is not.
<P>
	It is tragic and most unfortunate to see people so preoccupied 
with their political future that they put the future of people in 
serious trouble at risk.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of sending Bill C-12 to committee after first reading 
was to create an effective opportunity to look for areas of 
improvement that would still be consistent with the goals of the 
bill. The committee has done an excellent job and has focused on 
one key concern: impact on workers in communities that are 
dependent on seasonal industries.
<P>
	The minister and committee members saw the many benefits for 
seasonal workers in the move to an hours based system instead of a 
weeks based system, the use of tools such as the family income 
supplement to better assist low income workers supporting families 
and a range of innovative employment benefits. These alone will 
bring 45,000 people benefits they could not get under the old UI. It 
will extend benefits for another 270,000 workers. Many of these 
people are in seasonal industries.
<P>
	They also identified three issues at the heart of the concerns felt 
by many Canadians about this big step forward: treatment of gaps 
in earnings; the divisor used to calculate benefits; and the impact of 
the intensity rule on people with low incomes. They listened, they 
looked for solutions and they found workable ideas that will 
increase the fairness of this new program for workers in seasonal 
industries.
<P>
	Now people will be allowed to use income within the 26 week 
period prior to filing a claim when calculating average income for 
employment insurance benefits. That will increase benefits by 
about $246 million, much of it to seasonal workers.
<P>
	The divisor that is used to calculate benefits will be two weeks 
above the regional minimum entrance requirement. That will 
increase benefits by about $95 million for workers in seasonal 
industries in high unemployment regions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2388"> 2388 </A></B>
<P>
	The intensity rule will not apply to people who are receiving 
the family income supplement. Other workers who can pick up 
some work while on claim will be able to earn credits that will 
reduce the impact of the intensity rule on them too. Those steps 
will increase benefits by about $24 million for low income 
workers.
<P>
	Government members have listened to seasonal workers and 
they have responded with fair and balanced changes that will make 
this new legislation work even better.
<P>
	Employment insurance reform is not a once and for all step. It is 
an ongoing process of feedback and adjustments. We will assess 
the impact on people, not just measure whether or not they are 
adjusting to the system.
<P>
	The government will use a series of objective tools to monitor 
the impact of measures in the new act on individuals, employers 
and communities. It will monitor the performance of the economy 
and the job markets. It will monitor the ways in which workers, 
employers, industries and communities adjust.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	About a dozen communities across Canada will be selected for 
an in depth study. They will be chosen to represent different types 
of labour markets. Some will be urban, others will be smaller cities 
and towns. Some will be rural and some will be seasonal 
economies.
<P>
	The employment insurance commission will monitor and assess 
how individuals, communities and the economy are being impacted 
by the changes and what type of adjustments they are making. The 
commission will report annually to Parliament. The monitoring 
process will assess the degree to which individuals are finding 
additional work in the new system and how much employers are 
providing more work. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development told the committee and Canadians that if the bill is 
not performing up to expectations we will see it clearly and take the 
necessary actions.
<P>
	These monitoring steps will allow an assessment of how this new 
employment insurance system has resulted in changed behaviour 
by individuals, employers and communities. For example, we 
know the old system sometimes led people to refuse work that was 
available because the old UI rules could mean people could 
actually lose money from a claim they were going to file by 
working at less than their previous average weekly wage. We 
believe the new system will correct these problems. It will make 
work pay.
<P>
	The department has provided us with a great deal of research that 
suggests this bill will achieve its goals. However the monitoring 
will ensure that what we sincerely believe will happen after Bill 
C-12 becomes law actually does. It will allow us to check our 
predictions against results.
<P>
	In closing I commend and thank the members of the committee 
who contributed positively to the bill being presented today. This 
bill could have been presented to the House sooner had the 
government received co-operation from the opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the amendments discussed today are on the 
mandate that will be given to the Canada Employment and 
Immigration Commission.
<P>
	We find in this mandate the whole spirit of the act. This is why 
we wish that it be modified. I will read you briefly a few lines that 
express very clearly how the government wants things to be done. 
It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3 (1) The Commission shall monitor and assess how individuals, 
communities and the economy are adjusting to the changes made by this Act-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They take people for some kind of guinea pigs. ``We will see 
how you will live with that, but, as a government, we will not take 
on any obligation. We do not assume any responsability''. It is the 
whole spirit of the act that it expressed in the mandate given to the 
commission. ``Give us your money, we will take care of it. The 
system is financed only by you, the employers and the employees, 
but it does not matter, we will put all the obligations on your side, 
and we, as a government, will make no commitment''. It would 
have been a nice place to find a commitment by the government to 
say if the measures really have an effect on employment.
<P>
	Will the unemployment insurance reform, in one, two, three 
years, have the impact expected by the government and help people 
find a job more easily? There is no obligation of this type in this 
clause. All that will be done will be to check how people have 
adjusted. It is truly the bureaucratic approach. Punitive action will 
be taken, the commission will see how people react to this action 
and, one year from now, the government will be in a position to say 
that there are more abusers than before because the act will have 
been made more complicated so as to produce more abusers.
<P>
	This is an absurd way of thinking, because the unemployment 
insurance fund is fully financed by employers and employees. They 
are the ones who should have their say in the reform. There should 
be something about employment in the bill. Since the commission 
is asked to report to the minister, to produce an annual report of its 
assessment and the additional reports that the minister may request, 
do you not think that it would have been normal to say somewhere 
in the bill that the government will adopt unemployment reduction 
objectives, labour utilization objectives, that it will try to give 
people more jobs and that the commission will have to report on 
the effectiveness of the measures taken to meet those objectives?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2389"> 2389 </A></B>
<P>
	No, according to the bill, the reports will deal with the success 
of the follow-up on people. It says, for example: ``How the 
benefits and other assistance are utilized by employees and 
employers, their effect on the obligations of claimants to be 
available for and to seek employment''.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The whole bill is based on the principle that people are abusers. 
In our society, it has been proved by statistics that only 4 per cent of 
the three million people having claimed UI benefits were abusers. 
Let us look at any other legislation, the Income Tax Act, for 
instance, to see if there is no more than 4 per cent of dodging. Is it 
normal to pass a bill imposing on all workers, in a deliberate and 
exaggerated way, rules that are specifically intended to deal with 4 
per cent of Canadians? The government could have drafted a bill 
which looked at things differently.
<P>
	The first thing it could have done is state that the commission is 
allowed to let employers, employees and all those concerned have 
their say. When the bill states that ``The commission shall monitor 
and assess how individuals, communities and the economy are 
adjusting to the changes made'', why is the burden of proof not 
reversed to let people come to testify and share their experience?
<P>
	Nowadays, when we hear accounts like the one we heard at the 
demonstration in Rivière-du-Loup, where a young woman told us 
that her brother and her spouse committed suicide because of a lack 
of jobs and of the insecurity created by the UI reform, I think there 
are questions we must ask ourselves. We are not here simply to 
manage millions and billions of dollars. We are also here to create 
systems which will make people as happy as they can be and give 
them the opportunity to earn a decent salary to support their 
families. This should be part of the objectives of any government. 
We are not only accountants. We are people who have to make sure 
that laws promote development for everyone.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to a new element 
the government is trying to slip through with this bill. It has 
decided that those who would refuse training programs would no 
longer have the right to appeal. Let us take the example of young 
people who have studied and graduated, then landed a first job, but 
now find themselves in an impossible situation. There are no jobs 
in their field. They must decide if they will accept another training 
program and find out if there will be programs offered in their 
region, if they will have to move and what exactly they will be 
offered. If they refuse, they are automatically penalized and cannot 
appeal against that decision.
<P>
	We know that, in legislation as complex as this bill, many 
decisions are interpreted differently depending on the official, not 
because government officials are not skilled, not because they do 
not know their subject well  enough, but simply because provisions 
can be interpreted in different ways. The 45 or 50-year old 
employee who just lost his job because of technological changes 
and who is offered training in an area he knows nothing about is 
told by the official that the training will help him find a new job.
<P>
	A worker aged 45, 50 or 55 who has just lost his job and needs 
unemployment insurance, may not need specialized training but 
rather some training to face the labour market, to find out what is 
coming and what kind of choices he will have to make. If we tell 
him: ``Well, you always worked in construction, but the area where 
we expect employment in the future is tourism, you must go and 
take a 52-week course in tourism'', this person, who never worked 
in that sector and thinks he might not have what it takes and would 
rather think about it a little longer and find out whether there are 
other programs or other things which would interest him more, is 
going to face a situation where he will not be at liberty to refuse.
<P>
	It is more and more the state that is going to move people about, 
like pawns on a chess board, to get them to take a training course. If 
we, in our riding offices, are not aware that a fifteenth person is 
needed to complete a group so the course can be given, could the 
counsellor, at that time, be faced with a situation where he must 
steer someone in that direction, to fill the fifteenth slot, even 
though that training course might not really meet his needs 
according to his abilities, simply to be able to go ahead with the 
course, so that the 14 others to can receive their training?
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	According to the legislation, that person will have no other 
choice because if he refuses, he will be penalized and will not have 
the right to appeal. Others will come knocking on our doors 
because of a legislation that will not have corrected this kind of 
situation.
<P>
	In clause 3, when it says that
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Commission shall monitor and assess how individuals, communities and 
the economy are adjusting to the changes made by this Act to the insurance and 
employment assistance programs-</BLOCKQUOTE>
it means the commission will have many things to monitor. There 
are many human factors, many variables in this bill. There will be 
significant secondary effects and numerous unforeseeable 
consequences.
<P>
	Let us take just one example: the change from a system based on 
the number of weeks to one based on the number of hours. Will this 
change be good? Will it really make it possible for more people to 
qualify, as the government claims? Are there not secondary 
effects-for instance, the 910-hour requirement for new entrants, 
the increased number of hours compared to the old system-that 
will systematically force people onto welfare?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2390"> 2390 </A></B>
<P>
	Will there not be increased pressure on transfer payments? Will 
this not gradually lead to an absurd situation, in which the UI fund 
runs a surplus while reducing training for claimants and providing 
fewer services to those who need them?
<P>
	The mandate given the commission in clause 3 will not help us 
reach our goal. To do so, we must find a way for the commission to 
report directly to Parliament so we can get to the bottom of this.
<P>
	One only has to remember the myriad studies-there is talk of 
26 studies-that were done on the employability of seasonal 
workers. It was like pulling teeth. The government put on the table 
the studies it was interested in, but several of them were never 
released.
<P>
	In conclusion, it will be very important to make sure the 
commission has a clear mandate that does not simply reflect the 
financial consequences of the reform, but really assesses its impact 
on employment. That is why we are urging the government to 
approve our amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, on this 
grouping of motions I listened again very intently, as I did the other 
day, to the human resources development critic for the Bloc party. I 
hoped to hear members opposite give some good, reasoned 
arguments for the amendments they are proposing in this section. 
Sadly their arguments were wanting.
<P>
	We are reasonable people on this side of the House. We listen to 
reasonable arguments. As I said the other day, we listened to the 
reasonable arguments put forward at committee and as a result 
substantive changes were made to the bill. Several problem areas 
have been fixed. This bill is substantially improved and will meet 
much better the needs of seasonal workers and the needs of the 
regions of the country.
<P>
	The member for Mercier in her remarks talked about cutting off 
entitlement. I want to refer to some of the numbers that were used 
by myself and others the other day. The fact is that more part time 
workers will be in the system: 500,000 more individuals will have 
their work insured. The 45,000 seasonal workers who, despite 
paying premiums, were not eligible for UI, will be eligible for EI. 
The hours based system is beneficial. In high unemployment areas 
somebody working a 45-hour week will now qualify with just over 
nine weeks of work.
<P>
	This bill is actually improving the entitlement of people who are 
getting into the system. I want the member for Mercier to 
understand that.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	The argument that puzzled me most was the member saying the 
bill supposedly gave a gift to corporations. Any of us who sat at 
committee, as did some of the members opposite, can recall what 
the representative groups from the big corporations, the Canadian 
Chamber  of Commerce, and so on, were saying. They certainly did 
not see it as a gift. They were concerned that perhaps too many 
benefits in the system were going to the less well to do and to 
seasonal industries.
<P>
	Let us look for a moment at the maximum insurable earnings 
that the member talked about. They are being reduced to bring the 
MIE into line with the average industrial wage. That makes sense. 
When the UI system first came in, the maximum insurable earnings 
were at the industrial wage level but they have gone out of line over 
the years. They have to be brought back into line. That is what this 
bill does.
<P>
	The maximum insurable earnings have to be brought into line 
gradually with balance so that people are not unduly affected. 
Dropping them to $39,000 means that they will fall to about 17 per 
cent above the average wage in the year 2000 versus growing to 
about 47 per cent above.
<P>
	When I talk to the people in my area, they cannot understand 
why some people cannot live on over $40,000 a year or slightly 
higher and why they need to draw unemployment insurance at that 
level.
<P>
	This bill is trying to come to grips with that and better balance 
the system. We will admit that while this results in some high 
income earners and their employers paying less in premiums it also 
means that there are substantive savings on the expenditure side as 
such workers will receive substantially less in benefits.
<P>
	Keep in mind that the benefits are less at the high income level, 
bringing better balance to the system. The people who need the 
system in the regional industries can continue to take advantage of 
it. I see that as a major improvement to the system, one about 
which people have come to me and asked be changed.
<P>
	I hate to accuse members of the Bloc Quebecois of throwing a 
red herring into this debate but I have to. They say there is no 
appeal for training programs. They are trying to negate the bill on 
the basis of that point. Let me ask, is there an appeal process under 
the current system that they seem to accept without criticism? 
There is not.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at it. The appeal mechanism in place for 
EI claimants and part I benefits is a formal process to ensure that 
regulations spelled out in legislation governing the EI fund are 
being adhered to, and that individuals are not being denied the 
benefits to which they are entitled. That is under Part I.
<P>
	There is an appeal process at that level. I do not like to see this 
kind of fearmongering going on, and people saying there is no 
appeal process. There is one under part I.
<P>
	Part II is substantially different. Part II is based not on an 
individual entitlement but on a framework of benefits and 
measures that can be implemented with discretion  and judgment 
according to local and regional needs and priorities. Decisions are 
made, not on objective criteria bound by strict rules and regula-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2391"> 2391 </A></B>
<P>
tions, but within guidelines and strategies developed to respond to 
labour market conditions and the needs of the local work force.
<P>
	Individuals, groups, employers and others may all be recipients 
of program resources. It would not be appropriate or practical to 
introduce a formal appeal process to such a framework. It is not in 
the current system. This is what I find absolutely amazing. I have 
never heard that complaint about the current system.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Given the fiscal framework, it is not possible to meet the 
expectations of every group and individual. While exercising 
flexibility and discretion, local offices must at the same time 
ensure that decisions are made fairly, equitably and transparently 
within an overall strategic planning process. Officers are held 
accountable for results, including participation by priority groups.
<P>
	I wanted to raise those points because there is some strange 
information and a little bit of fear mongering which is being put on 
the record by members opposite.
<P>
	I will raise one last point. I believe the last speaker mentioned 
the zero to 15 hours as if moving to the hours based system was a 
problem. We had this debate previously. I must remind the member 
again that by moving to the hours based system we improve the 
system substantially.
<P>
	We will be getting out of the 15 hour trap which mainly affects 
women and to a great extent people who work in fast food outlets. 
The new system allows multiple job holders to get into the system 
and to draw benefits if needed, which we hope they are not because 
we are working very strenuously on the side of employment. 
However, the hours based system will help people get into the 
system if they need to. The benefits to a great extent will help 
women who are presently not entitled to get into the system. That is 
an improvement.
<P>
	At least once during the debate members opposite should 
recognize some of the improvements in the system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I liked the 
speech made by my colleague from Malpeque, because it really 
spurs me on. Being gagged can lead to yawning and dozing off, but 
the previous speaker really gets us cracking, because for someone 
who was disappointed by the arguments heard so far he really used 
some very poor counterarguments. Let us dwell a little on what he 
said.
<P>
	First of all, I have been a member of the human resources 
development committee ever since the Liberal Party was elected, 
along with the hon. member for Mercier and also my colleague 
from  Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, the last three speakers. Two 
years and a half ago, we travelled throughout the country and the 
hon. member for Malpeque says that he listened carefully to the 
views expressed during the last phase, that is consideration of the 
bill since it was introduced in the House. Let us see what he has to 
say. We ask for clause 3 to be deleted, because we think that it does 
not provide for a better role for the commission to play than it has 
now. So, we want clause 3 to be deleted.
<P>
	Why? Here is the first argument about clause 3. What does the 
clause say?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1)The Commission shall monitor and assess how individuals, communities 
and the economy are adjusting-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We wanted to know the real impact of the legislation, not the 
way people are adjusting to it, because that is the whole issue here. 
The main hypothesis behind the reform proposed by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is that individuals should adjust to 
the cuts and the commission will assess how they are adjusting. But 
what we wanted to find out is the real impact these cuts have on the 
regional and local economy. This is outside the mandate of the 
commission.
<P>
	The hon. member says he is disappointed by our amendments. 
For the member's information and others' as well, let me point out 
that, at report stage, the opposition cannot move amendments that 
can incur expenditures. This means that, under the parliamentary 
rules presently in force, this type of amendment must be proposed 
by the government in order to be admissible.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The best evidence of this is the fact that, in committee, three 
members proposed amendments; I do not remember the name of 
their ridings, but they proposed three amendments. Because they 
implied financial changes, these amendments could not be 
proposed during clause by clause consideration of the bill; they had 
to be submitted in this House, by the government.
<P>
	One must be careful before criticizing the opposition's 
behaviour. One must understand the rules. The opposition respects 
the rules. This is why we did not propose amendments that would 
have had financial implications. If it had been possible for us to do 
so, we would have proposed several amendments of this type. For 
example, there is the $2 billion cut resulting from the reform. We 
would have seen to it that the reform had no impact at all, in other 
words that there would have been no $2 billion cut. Unfortunately, 
the Liberal Party did not understand that.
<P>
	There is also the consequence of reducing maximum insurable 
earnings. There are people, employees as well as businesses, who 
will benefit from this $900 million gift, since there is, by lowering 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2392"> 2392 </A></B>
<P>
insurable earnings from $42,430 to $39,000, a loss of $900 million 
to the government. It must be said, though, that the target  group 
used to benefit in the past from $200 million in unemployment 
insurance benefits.
<P>
	For the time I have left, I will dwell on a significant point raised 
by the hon. member. Speaking of rights of appeal, it is said that Part 
II on employment services has a collective rather than an 
individual scope. I believe this is misunderstanding the problem. It 
must be remembered that the unemployment insurance claimants 
who will be affected are individuals.
<P>
	I will give you an example of what exists presently in 
employment services. We, in the opposition, have deplored it. We 
spoke at length about it in committee, and I believe the member 
was there. We said that in the program SEA, which helps people set 
up their own businesses, there is presently no right of appeal. I will 
give you a concrete example in my riding.
<P>
	We have two employment centres in my riding, two centres 
which presently administer this program, which, by the way, was 
put in the new bill, under the same form. They changed its name, 
but it is essentially the same program. In the past, two people who 
knew each other decided to set up a business together. One went to 
one employment centre and the other went to the other for himself 
because the service is provided on an individual basis, even though 
they wanted to start a new company together. The first one's 
application was accepted while the other's was rejected. When the 
latter learned it, he mentioned to the employment service officer 
that his friend's application had been accepted, but the answer he 
got was that the decisions concerning that part of the program 
cannot be appealed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Malpeque argues that it is collective and so 
on. Those are workers who, after losing their job, go to an 
employment centre to receive their benefits. After unsuccessfully 
looking for a job, they come to the conclusion that it is difficult for 
them because of their age or for other reasons. They then think of 
starting a company, so they devise a business plan that allows them 
to get benefits for a longer period.
<P>
	After that, there is an assessment by a public servant or a 
committee but the decision cannot be appealed. In this specific case 
that occurred in my riding, the individuals could not even be heard. 
The decision was made by a committee without the individuals 
being able to argue before the committee.
<P>
	If there is one thing I want as a Quebecer and I wish for all 
Canadians, it is that in all government programs, a person never be 
subjected to a decision made by one person or even by a committee 
without having the right to appeal. I think that by denying that right 
of appeal in Part II of the bill, the government is not showing the 
will to improve the system for the people.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Why are the appeal procedures important? According to the 
unemployment action groups, when a case goes to  arbitration,
<P>
three out of four decisions are in favour of the recipient. Let me 
repeat something that can never be said often enough: this bill is 
intended to seek out UI cheaters. As the Minister of Human 
Resources Development told the committee the other day, ``It is 
dreadful''.
<P>
	The figures the opposition has asked for and obtained tell us that, 
in 1991-92, 130,000 people were found guilty of defrauding the 
system in Canada, while the figure for 1995-96 was 116,000. That 
means there was a decrease of 14,000. This is not a growing 
problem, but a lessening one. What premise is the new 
unemployment insurance reform based on? Certqinly not on this.
<P>
	Let us look at recovery. Of the $272 million recovered in 
1995-1996, that is last year, only $93 million were recovered from 
individual cheaters. The remaining $179 million were due to 
honest mistakes on the part of claimants or of the Human 
Resources Development Department. Mistakes.
<P>
	While it is still possible, we should change the spirit of the 
reform to make it not a hunt for so-called cheaters or potential 
cheaters, but a hunt for mistakes and delays.
<P>
	This brings to mind the guaranteed income dupplement paid to 
some seniors. We know that there have been delays again this year. 
Last Friday, the minister apologized for the problems caused by 
this situation. Meanwhile, the government reduces the number of 
employment centres and increases the number of computer 
terminals.
<P>
	Our goal should be to eliminate errors, to improve the system so 
that people do not get penalized. I also believe that we should go 
back five or six years and remedy to errors done by the Department 
of Human Resources Development in three cases out of four by 
giving refunds.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I too want to say a few words on Bill C-12.
<P>
	I want to support the legislation as I did earlier in this House 
because I believe the time has come for a change in the legislation. 
The past system was not working, not doing the job it was intended 
to do and just was not good enough. The system had served its 
purpose fairly well over the years but the time had come where it 
had outgrown itself and it was time for a basic structural change. I 
am not the only one who believes that of course. We are told that 
fully four out of five Canadians believe that the existing system is 
not working and needs to be fixed.
<P>
	The legislation, initially introduced last December by the now 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, is meant to address the calls of four out 
of five Canadians for a structural change in the system. The 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2393"> 2393 </A></B>
<P>
legislation is also meant to  make the system more workable, 
affordable, modern and more functional.
<P>
	I want to talk particularly about the impact of the changes on 
seasonal workers because I proudly represent the constituency of 
Burin-St. George's. This riding has a number of industries which 
by their very nature are seasonal, for example, logging, fishing, 
mineral extraction, construction. The overwhelming majority of 
my constituents earn their living from seasonal work activity.
<P>
	The downturn in the fishery of course has not helped the 
situation. When I first came to Parliament I would stand in the 
House and brag that my riding had the same unemployment rate as 
Alberta at the time, which was about 4 per cent. The disaster in the 
groundfishery has changed all of that, of course. The 
unemployment rate in Burin-St. George's is the highest anywhere 
in Canada. It is 35 per cent, to the degree that it can be measured at 
all. Therefore, members will understand my particular emphasis 
today on how the bill will impact seasonal workers.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I believe that many seasonal workers will find the new 
employment insurance program to be a big improvement over the 
old UI program. One of the most important changes is the shift to 
calculating eligibility through hours of work, not weeks, which was 
the old, arbitrary method. Many people in seasonal industries work 
long hours when the work is there, far beyond the normal work 
week of 35 or 40 hours. People in those industries tend to work 
much more than 40 hours when work is available.
<P>
	More workers in seasonal industries will qualify. Some will 
qualify sooner because of the extra hours I have just mentioned. 
Many will get benefits for a longer period. These are some of the 
good features of the legislation.
<P>
	This change alone will bring benefits to 45,000 workers in 
seasonal industries who are now shut out of the system. It will add 
about three weeks more benefits for an additional 270,000 workers. 
I are talking about people like construction workers, fishery and 
forestry workers. They can all put in more than 50 hours a week. 
Under UI they never received credit for those additional hours of 
work. Now they will because the eligibility is based on the number 
of hours worked.
<P>
	The new system will benefit workers in a a number of other 
ways. However, the benefits of the program are fairly well known 
and I believe I have an obligation to focus on some of the concerns 
which my constituents and I have had with the legislation.
<P>
	As good a piece of legislation as it is, it was never carved in 
stone, as the former minister said. I want to give credit to the new 
minister for the efforts which he has made and for the success he 
has had in bringing improvements to what was a fairly good piece 
of  legislation in the first place, but needed some wrinkles taken 
out. Through the amendments, of which the minister is supportive, 
which we will be dealing with in the next day or so in the House, it 
is a much better piece of legislation now than when it was 
introduced in December.
<P>
	For example, I had real concerns about the intensity rule. That 
rule would penalize people who, through no fault of their own, 
could not find enough work on a continuing basis and, therefore, 
would have more recourse to drawing benefits than would other 
people in other parts of the country. I felt from the beginning that 
was wrong. I still believe it is wrong.
<P>
	The amendments which are being proposed will largely address 
that rule, particularly for the person who draws less than $26,000. 
However, I still say that the principle is wrong. It is a principle that 
I cannot support, when two people who engage in the same work 
activity at the same rate are paid different rates of benefits. I have 
had difficulty with it from the beginning. I could not support it then 
and I cannot support it now.
<P>
	What I can support is the marvellous progress that has been 
made to address the needs of the low income worker, the worker 
who earns less than $26,000. Without taking the House through the 
details, members will be aware that marvellous strides have been 
made to address the situation of the low income earner.
<P>
	I had concerns about the so-called divisor method. I am 
delighted that the amendments address that issue. My people and I 
have felt from the beginning that their benefits ought to be based on 
weeks worked, not on some arbitrary divisor which factored in 
weeks that they did not work, for example.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I had some concerns about the eligibility rules as they affect new 
entrants. I had some concerns about the clawback of benefits. I 
believe these matters are being addressed, explained and 
understood better by people who will be directly affected.
<P>
	The impact on seasonal workers in my riding and in 
Newfoundland will be good. It will be a positive impact. They will 
be better off in a number of ways than they were before. There are 
particular pockets of people it would have impacted adversely but I 
believe the amendments that will be put before the House will deal 
largely with those issues. For that reason I am very pleased to give 
my support to the principle of the bill and to the various provisions 
in it.
<P>
	However, as I said and will continue to say and act accordingly, I 
cannot support the principle that says we pay people who earn at 
the same rate different benefits on the basis that they accessed the 
employment system more frequently over the previous five years. I 
will not dwell on that at length. I believe everyone in the House and 
outside the House knows my feelings on that issue.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2394"> 2394 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
standing committee deserve a lot of credit for the improvements 
they have made to the initial legislation. As a result it is a much 
better bill, one which will benefit my constituents and others 
throughout the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise and speak to Group No. 4 of the amendments to the 
bill. Naturally, I agree with the proposals and amendments 
submitted by the Bloc Quebecois on the Unemployment Insurance 
Commission.
<P>
	I was an unemployment insurance referee for eight years in 
Montreal. What the commission needs is real powers, a real system 
for appeals to both the board of referees and the umpire as well as 
to the Federal Appeals Court.
<P>
	The board of referees comprises three persons: an employee 
representative, appointed by the union; an employer representative 
appointed by employer associations and a chairperson. The chair of 
the board of referees is appointed by the government, that is, by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, and the appointment 
involves patronage.
<P>
	Had this bill made provision for the end of the patronage system, 
I would have no trouble supporting it, but it makes no such 
provision. Neither does it contain any provision to shorten the time 
period involved. We know that if a person is not satisfied with a 
decision by the board of referees, an appeal must be made to the 
umpire, which takes two or three years. A lawyer is involved, and 
justices from Ottawa go around hearing these cases.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Effective measures should have been taken to establish a real 
appeal system for those who are not satisfied with the decisions 
taken by officials. Many people consider that the commission 
members often make arbitrary decisions. Their decisions are made 
lightly, without meeting nor hearing recipients. There are errors in 
law or errors of facts. So, for all these reasons, I think that clause 4 
cannot be agreed to as is.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to regret and condemn the government's 
actions in gagging Parliament once again on this crucial bill. It 
gagged the committee on human resources development and even 
the House, when we have almost reached the end of the debate. 
This is not democratic. A government cannot suppress freedom of 
speech. A government cannot silence the opposition. It has no right 
to do so, especially about a bill as crucial as Bill C-12.
<P>
	I never saw any change as fundamental as these ones since 1935, 
when the first Unemployment Insurance Act was passed. 
Unemployment insurance was a necessary  system at that time, it 
still is and will remain so for workers. It is in existence in every 
country of the world, including the developing countries. I 
condemn this lack of democracy in Parliament. Many people who 
want to share their ideas cannot do so because the government is 
arbitrarily limiting the time.
<P>
	In any case, I oppose this reform because it is unfair and 
regressive. Once again, I wish to express solidarity with the 
unemployed. I have been in Canada for 22 years, I have always 
worked, I have never been on unemployment insurance, but I have 
seen, as an arbitrator on the arbitration board, hundreds of human 
tragedies, people who were coming before us and whose only 
income was unemployment insurance.
<P>
	They are already penalized because they were fired or laid off by 
their employer, sometimes after 25 or 30 years. They will not be 
able to find another job, because for people who are 45 years old 
and over, it is so difficult to find another job. These people were 
penalized by being laid off and they are penalized even more today 
by this bill, especially, as was said earlier, women, seasonal 
workers and immigrants.
<P>
	This is a bill that is creating poverty. With regard to immigrants, 
an issue on which I have been working since 1980, the poverty 
level among immigrants is much higher than among people who 
were born in Canada. In 1994 for instance, 17.8 per cent of all 
families headed by an immigrant and 42,9 per cent of single 
immigrants were poor. By comparison, the poverty rates for 
families and individuals of Canadian stock are 12.6 per cent and 36 
per cent respectively. As you can see, there is quite a striking 
difference between Canadians who were born here and those who 
came here. This bill will only make things worse.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that I, and the Bloc Quebecois 
as a whole, demand that Bill C-12 should be withdrawn 
immediately.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being 6.30 
p.m., the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow, pursuant 
to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
