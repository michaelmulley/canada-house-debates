	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, March 5 to 11 is ``Save your vision week'' in Canada. 
This is an annual event to foster public awareness sponsored by 
the Canadian Association of Optometrists.
<P>
	This year's theme is: ``Hope is in sight. Good vision and 
literacy: There is a clear connection''.
<P>
	Many Canadians are unable to read simply because they do 
not see well. Children do not learn to read if they cannot focus on 
the blackboard or on the words in a book. One child in six has a 
vision problem, which makes it hard for him or her to learn and 
to read. The key is prevention. Early detection of vision 
problems really helps improve literacy. It has been established 
that three quarters of adults with literacy problems also have 
vision problems.
<P>
	I join, therefore, with the 2,800 optometrists in Canada to 
remind Canadians that good vision is a must for good reading.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the president 
of the Public Service Alliance called upon his members 
yesterday to make a decision on a work-to-rule action and other 
pressure tactics to protest the public service cuts.
<P>
	The Liberal government refuses to enter into a constructive 
dialogue with the Public Service Alliance. Yet the alliance has 
stated its willingness to join forces with the government to 
ensure better management of staff reductions and to maintain 
services to the public. In deciding against negotiations and 
partnership, the Liberal government is in essence denying the 
very principle of collective bargaining.
<P>
	With a work-to-rule action by civil servants on its hands, the 
government is now reaping what it has sown. All Canadians and 
Quebecers will pay for the contempt displayed by the Liberal 
government.

gives me great pleasure to recognize the mayor of Dauphin, 
Manitoba, Mr. Inky Mark.
<P>
	This gentleman took upon himself to compile resolutions 
from approximately 200 municipal governments from all 
provinces and territories. These resolutions support the 
principle that all Canadians now and in the future shall continue 
to enjoy the lawful, responsible and safe use of all firearms.
<P>
	He took these efforts upon himself because he felt the voice of 
the tax-paying, law-abiding citizen was seldom heard. He has 
consistently asked for the establishment of a national firearms 
advisory council whose members would be made up of a 
cross-section of non-partisan people.
<P>
	I would like his message to be heard loud and clear and to pay 
tribute to his tireless efforts on behalf of responsible 
recreational firearms users.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has finally admitted with his budget that his 
government has no intention of maintaining national standards 
in our health care system. Today the Prime Minister was quoted 
as saying: ``Social programs such as medicare will revert to 
meeting more basic needs as they did when they were started 
half a century ago''.
<P>
	Fifty years ago someone in my family suffered from a major 
illness. We were fortunate as a family that it only took us 10 
years to pay off the bill. Fifty years ago others lost their farms 
and businesses for reasons of health and health expenses. 
Because of that they also lost hope for the future.
<P>
	It is clear now that this government is intent on doing away 
with national standards with the national health care system. In 
fact rather than building Canada, the Prime Minister has con-

very pleased to announce to the House that, as of next 
September, the Simcoe County Board of Education's intensive 
French language program will be offered at Bradford West 
Gwillimbury elementary school.
<P>
	Five out of the six major centres in Simcoe county now offer a 
bilingual curriculum to their English speaking students. This 
year, over 500 elementary and secondary school students 
registered for the program, which is in its sixth year. I wish to 
congratulate the school board, its staff, and above all, the 
parents of Simcoe county for participating in this program and 
for their contribution to bilingualism in Canada.
<P>
	The intensive French language program is another example of 
the importance placed on the French language in Ontario and 
elsewhere in Canada.

Speaker, today I rise in the House to congratulate Mr. Michael 
Barnes, a constituent from my riding of Timiskaming-French 
River.
<P>
	Mr. Barnes is a teacher and historian who has chronicled the 
history of northern Ontario. This region is as rich in exciting 
history as any other in Canada but is often ignored by the 
majority of Canadians.
<P>
	Mr. Barnes has researched our history from the early days of 
the gold camps and the construction of the railways. In all his 
works Mr. Barnes has celebrated the resilient and rugged people 
who came from across Canada and the world to settle and 
prosper in this bountiful region of our great nation.

Michael Barnes. I call upon all members of Parliament to join 
me in congratulating him today as he rightly becomes a member 
of the Order of Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
I would like to bring to the attention of this House a long and 
storied Canadian tradition, that of the lighthouse keeper. 
Recently, Transport Canada announced that the remaining 
lighthouse keepers in Canada would be replaced by an 
automated system.
<P>
	Today I would like to speak about two historic and treasured 
stations located at Cape Spear and Cape Race in my riding.
<P>
	Cape Spear, Newfoundland is the most easterly point in North 
America. It is where man meets the sea. The lighthouse station 
at Cape Spear, in operation since 1835, is still manned by a 
lighthouse keeper. Yet on the 160th birthday of this lighthouse, 
Transport Canada wants to have machine meet the sea at this 
historic point.
<P>
	The second lighthouse, Cape Race located in southeast 
Newfoundland, has for decades been the reference point for 
European ships bound for the Americas. Since 1856 European 
ships have approached a manned lighthouse station at Cape 
Race.
<P>
	I urge Transport Canada to re-examine its decision regarding 
the demanning of these lighthouses. One hundred and sixty 
years of history and tradition-

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
move of extraordinary cynicism, the Liberal government has 
decided to impose what amounts to an immigration tax. The 
members of the Bloc Quebecois deplore this virtual tripling of 
the fees required upon submission of an immigration 
application. In addition to the basic $500, an adult immigrant 
will have to pay a tax of $975 to have his application considered.
<P>
	This government, which has loudly proclaimed its openness 
to immigration, which wants to boost its citizenship profile, 
which produces one overblown speech after another on Canada 
as the country of choice for immigrants, is practicing the exact 
opposite of what it preaches.
<P>
	The message sent by this fee hike could not be clearer: Canada 
is no longer interested in taking in immigrants, and is 
particularly uninterested in those with low incomes. It has 
decided to close the door and exclude those whose contribution 
has been and is still so important for Quebec and Canadian 
society.

<P>
	Can you imagine if all of us who wear glasses went without 
them for a day or even half a day? That would put us in the 
position of those I am addressing today.
<P>
	Many Canadians cannot read well because they cannot see 
well. Children will not learn to read if they cannot focus on the 
chalkboard or on the words in a book. One in six children has a 
vision problem.
<P>
	Not all vision problems are easy to detect, therefore the 
earlier problems are detected and corrected, the better. 
Prevention is the key. The fact is that three-quarters of adults 
with poor literacy skills also have problems with their vision.
<P>
	As literacy critic for the Reform Party, I join Canada's 2,800 
optometrists in reminding Canadians that good vision is 
necessary to become a good reader.

Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, now that the federal government has 
tabled its 1995 budget, a tough budget that will suit the wishes of 
international investors, it is time to get down to the serious 
business of controlling our financial destiny.
<P>
	The federal government must instruct the Bank of Canada to 
bring the effective interest rate down from the present 
superficially high level. A lower interest rate will result in 
increased job growth for Canadians. It will greatly assist small 
and medium sized businesses.
<P>
	Interest rates should be brought down by at least 2 percentage 
points. One result of this move would be lower interest 
payments to foreign investors. Another would be that small and 
medium sized businesses could afford to borrow money for 
expansion, thereby creating jobs.
<P>
	We need a made in Canada interest rate. We have to control 
our interest rates in order to achieve a balanced budget in the 
long run.

is why I rise today to pay tribute to all Canadian women from 
coast to coast.
<P>
	Let us look around us. There are now 54 women sitting in the 
House of Commons. We have come a long way since Agnes 
McPhail became the first woman elected to the House of 
Commons in 1921; since the judiciary committee of the Privy 
Council finally recognized, in 1929, that women were persons in 
the eyes of the law; since Carine Wilson became the first woman 
appointed to the Senate in 1930.
<P>
	Women have left their mark in all their fields of activity 
despite the obstacles that keep springing up in their way, simply 
because our society is still tainted by widespread and offensive 
sexism.

my riding in London, Ontario.
<P>
	On February 16, Mr. Dusky received the Prime Minister's 
award for teaching excellence in science, technology and 
mathematics. This award recognizes teachers across Canada 
who have had a major proven impact on student performance 
and interest in these areas. Mr. Dusky was nominated for this 
award by one of his former students.
<P>
	Mr. Dusky has been a teacher for 32 years and has been 
teaching science and chemistry at London Central Secondary 
School since 1987. Most notable in his achievements is ``The 
Mentor Connection''. This program twins high school students 
with professionals from the community in order to support and 
enhance the autonomous learning projects of the students.
<P>
	This program has been a tremendous success locally. Mr. 
Dusky is presently in the process of trying to expand the 
program so more students can benefit from this unique 
opportunity. It is through these types of initiatives and teachers 
such as Mr. Dusky that our children have the skills and 
knowledge to effectively compete in the constantly changing 
workplace.

However, we had to be suspicious of that smile, which was more 
akin to the kiss of Judas.

when he is considerably limiting the financial margin of the 
provinces by reducing transfers, while at the same time 
maintaining national standards for welfare, health and

pleased to present the third instalment of the Liberal's copy 
Reform awards.
<P>
	Today's winner is the member for Vancouver Quadra whose 
personal proposals for pension reform are suspiciously similar 
to the Reform blue book. At a time when the cabinet has 
approved a two tier pension plan that will make millionaires out 
of defeated politicians, it is indeed outstanding to have a 
government backbench MP suggest that the treasured gold 
plated pension plan be based on the principle of matching funds.
<P>
	Imagine a Liberal actually saying that MPs should live by the 
same rules as other Canadians, collecting their pensions at age 
65, or that they should be forced to tighten their belts like those 
living outside planet Ottawa. Reformers have been calling for 
these changes for four years.

Mr. Speaker, in its budget, the federal government is

Quebec alone will lose $650 million next year and $1.9 billion in

Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we intend to sit 
down with the provinces to discuss how we will approach the 
changes in transfer payments. There is only one correct figure: 
In 1996-97, compared with this year, there will be a cut of $350 
million.
<P>
	If we consider the potential for eliminating duplication and 
overlap, I think this can be absorbed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I beg to differ with the minister on a matter as basic 
and simple as arithmetic. If the budget had not interfered with 
transfer payments this year, Quebec would have received $300 
million more, according to the estimates for transfer payments. 
The minister cancelled the $300 million increase and cut an 
additional $350 million. According to what I learned in school, 
300 plus 350 equals 650 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> The Minister of Finance cannot count.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The minister tells us that as far as the $2.2 
billion over a three year period is concerned, there is some 
uncertainty, since the $4.5 billion that will be cut in the third 
year will have to be distributed among the provinces, after 
negotiations with the federal government.
<P>
	If there is any uncertainty, and in fact there is not, since the 
technical document published by the Department of Human 
Resources Development says this will be done on a per capita 
basis, and the minister says, on page 17 of the budget speech, 
that he will apply the same criterion-if there is any uncertainty, 
then it should be cleared up.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday and again today, the minister said that he was ready 
to meet the provinces the very next day. Perhaps the minister 
would like to tell us whether he agrees the provinces should be 
summoned immediately to a formal federal-provincial 
conference, where he would clarify the issues and tell us what 
the repercussions will be for Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, when I met the 
provincial finance ministers before the budget and we discussed 
the changes in transfer payments, I told them I would be ready to 
meet them as soon as the budget was brought down.
<P>
	So the answer to your question is yes. In fact, I have already 
made that clear to the finance ministers. The Leader of the 
Opposition mentioned arithmetic. Well, there is a difference of 
at least one billion dollars between the figures quoted by the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois and those quoted by the Quebec 
finance minister, so you will have to check with headquarters.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate a clear answer. I would like the 
minister to tell us whether he will immediately call a 
federal-provincial conference to discuss how the cuts in transfer 
payments will be distributed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I certainly intend 
to schedule a meeting with the finance ministers. They asked me 
to wait until they had all tabled their own budgets, so let me 
know when Mr. Campeau tables his, and I will tell you when we 
will have this meeting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the 
Minister of Transport having problems? I think this is my 
question and not his. If the Minister of Transport misses being in 
the opposition, he will be back here soon enough. In the budget 
speech, the Minister of Finance proposed that the funds paid into 
the Canada Assistance-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Give him his valium.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10188"> 10188 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I realize today is Wednesday, but, 
nevertheless, it is the hon. member for Roberval's turn to ask 
a question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the budget speech, the 
Minister of Finance proposed that transfers under the Canada 
assistance plan for social assistance now be allocated among 
provinces in the same way as established program financing 
transfers for health and post-secondary education-by 
combining, in 1997, all transfers into a single one: the Canadian 
social transfer.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance acknowledge that his 
government's intention to pay the amounts involved in the 
Canada assistance plan according to the criteria for the 
established programs will deprive Quebec, in 1997, of several 
hundreds of millions of dollars in social assistance, in favour of 
Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is as follows. In his budget, the 
Minister of Finance announced that he will change the bases, the 
criteria for allocating money under the Canada assistance plan. 
He said himself that the transfer will be on the same basis as for 
the other programs, that population will be the criterion for 
allocation.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance is using population as the Canada 
assistance plan allocation criterion in order to transfer to 
Quebec the money involved as a lump sum, will he acknowledge 
that this approach will take hundreds of millions of dollars away 
from Quebec in favour of a province like Ontario? If he will not 
acknowledge this, will he tell us what basis he is using?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I indicated very 
clearly that we intend to sit down and negotiate with the 
provinces. We are bringing about changes in federalism. I think 
that this will require face to face discussions. I have a hard time 
understanding the questions. I think the hon. member has been 
briefed by Bob Rae.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday officials of the Department of Finance were 
telling investors that Canada would balance its budget by the 
year 2000. Today they are reassuring those investors that even a 
downturn in the American economy will not stop the 
government from balancing the budget because the effects will 
be offset by cuts to social programs and transfers to the 
provinces.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Why were 
Canadians not given more details about the impending social 
cuts in Monday's budget? Will the minister reveal his real 
agenda for social spending reductions, a hidden  agenda which 
must exist if the budget is to be balanced by the year 2000?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the second 
day in a row on which the leader of the third party has referred to 
apparent briefings or statements by unnamed Department of 
Finance officials.
<P>
	I think we should make the record clear. I do not know what 
the leader of the Reform Party is talking about. That makes me a 
fairly typical Canadian.
<P>
	The fact is that I am really not able to respond. I would like to 
respond to the leader of the third party's statement, but I do not 
know about the briefings that he is raising and that he raised 
yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I refer to stories in a number of the financial papers 
about assurances being given-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> There are also broad hints in the budget that 
the minister is obviously contemplating deeper cuts in social 
spending and transfers if he is going to balance the budget.
<P>
	If these plans are in progress they are being developed behind 
closed doors, without Canadians knowing. We even wonder 
whether the Minister of Human Resources Development knows 
about them. The finance department is planning major cuts. The 
human resources minister yesterday said that what they were 
going to do was reshuffle existing funds to his department.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Is that minister personally aware of the changes 
the finance department has in store for social programs? If so, 
will he share that agenda with the Canadian people and with the 
House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have read very carefully 
the document that was tabled in the House on Monday. I am 
prepared to share it with the hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
because obviously he has not read it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the chief financial officer of a publicly traded 
company put out a prospectus on Monday and it was found out 
on Wednesday that they had hidden plans which affected the 
bottom line and all the shareholders, that CFO could go to jail 
under Ontario securities law.
<P>
	None of us would like the Minister of Finance to go to jail, so 
my question is: Will he come clean and tell Canadians what 
social program cuts the government is planning in order to 
balance the budget after 1997?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> It is somewhat incongruous 
watching the Reform Party trying to defend social programs. It 
is like watching an elephant tap dance.
<P>
	The Reform Party has to be very desperate and it is quite clear 
it is so disconcerted by the very favourable reaction that the 
financial markets have given to this budget but it has lost its 
issue and is trying to make one up.
<P>
	There is no hidden agenda. The only agenda that people are 
looking for today is the Reform Party's and they cannot find it.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister announced in his budget that he 
intends to tackle old age pensions. One of the budget documents 
states that the reform of old age security will be based primarily 
on the following principle: old age security benefits will be 
calculated on the basis of family income, as is the case with the 
guaranteed income supplement.
<P>
	Can the finance minister confirm that calculating old age 
security benefits on the basis of family income will mean that, in 
the future, old age pensions will no longer be the same for 
everyone and that thousands of senior citizens will see their 
pensions drop?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, to answer the 
question directly, the exact opposite is true.
<P>
	Having said this, the federal government and indeed the 
provincial governments are duty bound to protect old age 
pensions, the Canada and Quebec pension plans. We intend to sit 
down no later than this fall to work out a sustainable system. You 
have seen the actuarial report on this subject.
<P>
	So I cannot understand the position of the hon. member who 
would not protect Canadian seniors' old age pensions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the finance minister protects old age pensions the 
way he has protected unemployment insurance, we are not out of 
the woods yet.
<P>
	Will the finance minister admit that calculating old age 
pensions on the basis of family income will directly penalize for 
the most part women whose financial independence will be 
compromised?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no firm decision 
has been made on this matter. We intend to consult, and it is 
indeed our duty to do so, but nevertheless let me answer your 
question directly.
<P>
	According to the study by the Caledon Institute of Social 
Policy, women are not only protected, their pensions are in fact 
increased. It is a good thing for women.
<P>
	I put the following question to the hon. member: He is against 
seniors, is he also against women? The hon. member should get 
his numbers right before asking questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
centrepiece of the government's budget is the creation of 
something called the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	The government's motive for creating this transfer is that this 
government was planning to make larger and bigger cuts to 
sacred cows like health, post-secondary education and welfare 
in this and possible future budgets.
<P>
	To clarify the situation and to clarify the answers that the 
minister just gave, will there be any additional cuts to this new 
super transfer beyond those announced in the current 1995-96 
budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we set out a very 
clear plan to preserve our social programs. The Canada social 
transfer provides us with a basis to do that. It provides us with 
the basis to do that in very straightened circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	I continue to have some difficulty understanding the nature of 
the question. I have a great deal of respect for the member but he 
must understand that he is with a party that recommended two 
weeks ago that we take $15 billion out of those social programs 
which would effectively gut them. We are certainly entitled to 
have a little consistency on economic policy in this country by at 
least one of the two opposition parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly appreciate the answer by the hon. minister.
<P>
	The Reform Party was up front. We laid it out that we would 
reduce by $15 billion the social program spending.
<P>
	What I am asking the minister and the government of this 
country to do is to lay it out for Canadians and tell them the truth 
about what is going to happen. That is what we want.
<P>
	If we look at this 1995-96 budget, the government's transfer 
proposals provide no additional tax points and actually cut cash 
transfers to provinces by 20 per cent to 25 per cent. What else is 
going to happen?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10190"> 10190 </A></B>
<P>
	Is this one of the ways that the government is planning to 
decentralize the deficit but there is a hidden agenda that 
provinces do not understand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have had 
numerous meetings with the ministers of finance of the 
provinces. The minister of HRD has had numerous meetings 
with his counterparts in the provinces. The provinces 
understand full well the nature of the federal fiscal dilemma. 
They understand also that it is very important that the federal 
government get its fiscal house in order because that has 
enormous benefits for them.
<P>
	What the provinces said to us was no surprises and there are 
no surprises. They said hit yourselves first and we have. They 
have said hit yourself harder than you hit us and we have. We 
have lived up to every one of our commitments. There is no 
hidden agenda. There is one very public agenda and that is that 
we are going to preserve the social programs of this country and 
clean up the nation's finances.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	In the budget speech, the federal government announced that 
it will be setting up a human resources investment fund of 
several hundreds of millions of dollars, which the federal 
government will use to meddle in the area of job training.
<P>
	Will the minister concede that this fund infringes on the 
powers of the provinces, does nothing to decentralize 
government and, in fact, increases even more overlap and 
duplication between governments?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know how the hon. 
member arrived at that conclusion because what we are 
proposing to do is eliminate many of the old programs that were 
under the Canadian job strategy which no longer are relevant to 
the kind of situation we face.
<P>
	By consolidating our existing resources into one human 
investment we can then sit down with the provinces, as we are 
doing now on issues of child care and literacy, and work out new 
partnerships and new arrangements with the provinces, the 
municipalities and private sector partners. It gives us the 
flexibility we need to now engage in a new generation of social 
programming that really fits both the reality and the changed 
circumstances the country finds itself in.
<P>
	That is the same kind of flexibility we are achieving through 
the new form of Canada's social transfer. We are also achieving 
this by putting up a new form of funding  resource in our own 
department so that we can undertake those kinds of partnerships 
I just outlined.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, will the minister also admit that the human 
resources investment fund goes in the opposite direction of 
where Quebec wants to go regarding job training, since, instead 
of withdrawing from this sector, the federal government plans to 
infringe more and more on Quebec's jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is in some 
strange vapour today. He is drawing a conclusion that has no 
basis in any kind of fact. I have just told the hon. member that 
creating a new kind of investment fund puts us in a position of 
being able to start with a clean slate to sit down with the 
provinces and other stakeholders and work out new partnership 
arrangements.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member that we have already tabled 
with the provinces, including the province of Quebec, offers for 
serious transfer responsibilities in the area of training and the 
province of Quebec has not responded in a positive way. 
Certainly other provinces have and I would issue the invitation 
again to sit down and we are prepared to turn over responsibility 
for managing institutional training. I would hope that the hon. 
member would use his good offices with his colleagues in 
Quebec to say come back to us with a good offer.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Yesterday Tony Manera, the president of the CBC, resigned 
because the Liberals broke their red book promise for stable 
multi-year funding to the CBC. Manera says that in the next 
three years the government plans to cut $120 million more from 
the CBC than the $45 million that was stated in the budget.
<P>
	The minister has a secret agenda about the future of the CBC 
which he has failed to disclose. Why has the minister failed to 
provide this information to Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our colleague is out of luck. Her assistant is 
no better as a researcher than he was as a candidate in 
Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10191"> 10191 </A></B>
<P>
	The information she put forward is false. The government has 
given a clear indication of what it will do in the budget and that 
is to fix the CBC budget for next year. All the rest is invention. 
Mr. Manera has resigned because of personal reasons.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with all due respect to the minister, cheap political shots against 
an honourable and professional candidate in an election are 
clearly out of order in this House.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage did send a secret 
document to the president of the CBC confirming its plans to cut 
the CBC over the next three years. That includes $120 million in 
the cuts that the minister has failed to report.
<P>
	How can the minister justify wasting more taxpayers' dollars 
on another review as stated in the budget plan when according to 
the president of the CBC the government has already made up its 
mind?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, talking about cheap shots, let me quote the 
hon. member: ``Mr. Manera is not staying to fight. It is an 
abdication of leadership which means that he is not up to the 
challenge of developing a blueprint for changing broadcasting''.
<P>
	The only figures that have been passed on by my department 
to Mr. Manera and the CBC are the figures of the program 
review. The government established one year of budget for the 
CBC, the next fiscal year. The other figures amount to 15 to 10 
per cent for the next three years. They were contained in the 
program review of last August.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the minister of heritage.Mr. Manera agreed to become president of the CBC after the 
minister had assured him that there would not be any cuts to the 
CBC's budget.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Instead of claiming that Mr. Manera resigned for personal

related-

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to put her 
question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Instead of claiming that Mr. Manera 
resigned for personal reasons, will the minister admit that this 
resignation is directly related to his failure to honour his 
commitment as heritage minister not to make further cuts to the 
CBC's budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dupuy:</B> -about ``whited sepulchres''. Only a few weeks 
ago, our colleague rose in this House, loudly demanding that Mr. 
Manera resign. Did she undergo a conversion? She is now 
defending him. Did she undergo a conversion and decide to 
defend the CBC, this great federalist, national institution?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, does the heritage minister admit that he is no 
longer either a friend of the corporation, as he himself claimed, 
nor, as heritage minister, a friend of cultural organizations and 
the arts community, whose interests he has been unable to 
protect, since culture is one of the sectors hardest hit by the 
federal budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition referred to the 
fact that arithmetic is taught in grade school. I am surprised that 
a former teacher cannot do simple arithmetic and realize that if 
there is one sector that was not hit hard, it is the cultural sector.
<P>
	I therefore categorically deny our colleague's allegations and 
I can reiterate that Mr. Manera did not resign because of the 
budget. He said so himself in writing. She is in fact questioning 
the good faith of the former President of the CBC.

question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Since Monday's fiscally responsible and fair budget we have 
heard speculative statements about how the budget impacts on 
Ontario. After four and a half years, the current premier of 
Ontario will soon have to do his own accounting to the people of 
Ontario.
<P>

affects Ontario, a province with 37.5 per cent of the nation's

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the member for London West for her question because it 
gives me the opportunity to correct the exaggerated claims 
being made by the Government of Ontario.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10192"> 10192 </A></B>
<P>
	We have gone to great lengths, we have taken great pain 
within the budget to make sure that it is fair and equitable and 
does not impact disproportionately on any single region of the 
country.
<P>
	Ontario's share of the downsizing of the public service is in 
line with its share of the national population. We could go one 
step further. Nearly 161,000 jobs were created in Ontario last 
year. We are going to maintain this recovery with a good budget 
so we can create jobs in Ontario at the same level next year. That 
is why we acted the way we did.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	The member has asked me to deal with the facts. Ontario's 
share of budgetary actions is in the same range as its current 
share of federal spending and it is actually less than its share of 
Canada's population. If Bob Rae wants to play politics, he can 
do it. However, he should stop playing politics with the facts 
because he will never get re-elected that way.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> May I appeal to hon. members once again? All 
questions put in the House are deemed to be reasonable 
questions. I believe that all hon. members should have the 
chance to hear reasonable answers. I would ask please, when 
questions are put to give enough time for the answer to be given.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today the 
Prime Minister, when speaking of the budget changes said: 
``Social programs such as medicare will revert to meeting more

<P>
	What exactly does the Prime Minister mean by basic 
services?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
means what he said this morning and what he has repeated. He

the size of your pocket book but on the serious illness you face.
<P>

	Will the Prime Minister recognize in front of all Canadians 
that his budget will gut health care?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the absolute hypocrisy 
of the Reform Party is never more evident than when its 
members rise to defend the benefits of universal health care. 
This is the very party that would have cut the heart and soul out 
of the health care system.
<P>
	We are not going to let them do it because they will never form 
the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. In the budget tabled on 
Monday, the minister decreed that a $975 fee will now be 
charged to every person who wishes to immigrate to Canada. 
This large amount of money is on top of the $500 processing fee 
all immigrants already have to pay.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that it makes no sense to ask 
prospective immigrants to pay $975, as this may represent up to 
a year's salary or more in their countries of origin?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Why do future immigrants have to pay for the government's 
deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think the hon. 
member is in any position to lecture the government on how it 
treats immigrants when members of his party in the PQ would 
not even extend democratic rights to immigrants in Quebec.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance said on Monday that all Canadians, 
fishermen, farmers, public servants, business people, Canadian 
families had to sacrifice for nation building and to maintain 
Canada's prosperity. We have chosen to extend that invitation to 
those wishing to join the Canadian family and also to recover 
some of the costs for immigration settlement.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	There are two options. Immigrants either share with us in the 
cost of settlement or we go the route of the United States of 
America where there is no settlement. Like the commercial 
says: ``You can pay now or you can pay much more later''. We 
prefer settlement because it is the best way of integrating 
immigrants. We also believe that the landing fee is worth the 
price to come to the best country in the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister not realize that the message of openness Canada is 
trying to convey to future immigrants to this country is greatly 
compromised by this immigration tax, which can represent more 
than $3,000 for a family of four?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member did not mention 
that the Minister of Finance has also instituted a loan program 
that would allow those individuals who believe that the $975 
would be a hardship to apply for a loan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10193"> 10193 </A></B>
<P>
	Just like refugees since 1951 have been able to absorb a 
transportation loan, we believe that this fee will not cause 
hardship. We are prepared to implement the loan program.
<P>
	With respect to other countries that ask immigrants to help 
shoulder the costs, Canada is in the middle of the spectrum 
where it ought to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	In the budget the government announced the elimination of 
the public utilities transfer tax rebate. Since 88 per cent of the 
$250 million tax grab hits Alberta, the elimination of this rebate 
is a discriminatory tax hike aimed directly at Albertans and will 
cost them at least $170 million.
<P>
	As the senior federal minister representing Alberta, does the 
minister support this measure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this nation has a 
very large deficit and a very large debt. It was incumbent upon 
the government to deal with it in the fairest and most 
expeditious way possible. That is what we have done.
<P>
	In this case we have followed the lead of a number of 
provincial governments, including the Government of Alberta. I 
believe the member for Lethbridge was a member of the 
Government of Alberta when it took away the equivalent tax 
exemption for the public utilities in that province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view 
of the discriminatory nature of this tax grab and the fact that the 
socialist power companies of Ontario and Quebec get away scot 
free, does the finance minister view this as fair and equitable?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply 
refer the member to the statement by the premier of Alberta, in 
which he said that the federal government had to face up to its 
responsibilities. We did so and basically this is a good budget.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has been very successful and 
encouraged all levels of government to work together. In my 
riding of Vancouver East the projects were enthusiastically 
received and put many people to work.
<P>
	Could the Minister responsible for Infrastructure inform the 
House of the status of the programs following Monday's 
budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the program on infrastructure is being extended from a 
three-year to a five-year period. This comes about as a result of 
two things: first, many municipalities with major projects have 
asked for extra construction time to be able to complete their 
projects and, second, the fiscal needs of the Minister of Finance 
as announced in the budget.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to say that this coming construction season will 
be the biggest by far in terms of the infrastructure program. 
Sixty per cent of all the funds under the program will be 
allocated within the two years. The $2 billion from the federal 
level and the $6 billion in total will stay intact over that 
five-year period of time. It will lead to even more jobs than we 
had predicted: over 100,000.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister for a 
clear answer about his government's intentions on a question he 
was asked yesterday in the House.
<P>
	Will women 65 years of age and older lose their OAS because 
of their spouse's income as implied on page 58 of the budget 
plan? Yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the single most damaging element of this week's 
federal budget will be the devastating effect on the regional 
economy of the prairies, that is the elimination of the Crow rate 
including declining land values and the lack of investment for 
value added production.
<P>
	Has the minister given any thought at all to the long term 
implications for the prairie economy of the decision to end the 
transport subsidy? If so, could he identify the sources in which 
he has so substantially misplaced his optimism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note that a number of farmers 
in western Canada over the course of the last two days in 
commenting on the budget have noted that the change with 
respect to freight rates in western Canada has the potential to 
encourage diversification and value added production in the 
west.
<P>
	I would point out that the hon. gentleman, coming from 
Saskatchewan, should perhaps know with respect to the $1.6 
billion ex gratia capital payment that something in the order of 
$800 million or more of that total will find its way into the 
province of Saskatchewan because of that province's historical 
share of grain movement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10194"> 10194 </A></B>
<P>
	It does not include Saskatchewan's share of the $300 million 
adjustment fund. It does not include the capital gains tax 
advantage. It does not include the time cost of money that will 
accrue to the recipients of those payments and not to the 
government. It does not include the impact on efficiency in the 
transportation system.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in response to a point of order raised by the hon. 
member for Skeena on February 9, the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development stated that I held a meeting in my 
riding of Prince George-Bulkley Valley entitled ``Let the 
people speak'' and that natives were neither notified nor asked 
to sit on a panel at the meeting.
<P>
	I held no such meeting in my riding. The minister has 
confused my riding with another and I would ask him to 
withdraw these remarks.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand as a minister but first 
I stand as a member of Parliament who does not pick and choose 
which constituents I speak for.
<P>
	One of the purposes of the House is for the views of those who 
have the least voice, who are the most oppressed and who need 
our help the most to come before Parliament. The silence of the 
Reform Party on aboriginal issues is so profound that it is 
deserving of respect.
<P>
	There have been four critics; I have gone through four critics. 
They sit there like a Greek chorus.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> In my view the point of order is a dispute as to 
facts. From time to time in the course of debate-and I am not 
saying this happened here-sometimes errors are made. I would 
hope hon. members would give each other enough latitude in 
debate so that if errors are made inadvertently they are accepted 
as such.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept the explanation of the hon. 
member but of the two critics one represents the Nishga-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> I take it from the acceptance of the statement 
that perhaps an error was made. I am hopeful this will close the 
matter as of now. I would like the matter to be closed as of now.
<P>
	This point of order is finished. If the member has another 
point of order I would like to hear it. Is this on the same point of 
order?
<P>
	On a point of clarification, the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of all members of the House, would 
you clarify whether or not it is in order for a member to ask for a 
retraction and either the member retracts the statement or 
refuses to retract the statement and then, I suggest from my 
understanding of the standing orders, you, Mr. Speaker, make a 
decision on which member had the right position?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> Sometimes the Chair is faced with both 
positions being correct.
<P>
	In this particular instance we had an hon. member saying that 
it was said that he held a meeting of some kind in his riding. I 
now have the minister involved who says he accepts that it was 
an error.
<P>
	I accept the minister's statement and I consider the matter to 
be closed.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
different point of order. I think you would agree that one very 
controversial issue facing the House at the moment is the gun 
control legislation.
<P>
	Because of the imprecise nature of the discussion a lot of my 
constituents are wanting access to the legislation. I have been 
told that I am only allowed to get 10 copies. Could you indicate 
that this is not true and where my constituents can go to get more 
copies of the legislation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the spokesman for the Board of Internal 
Economy I informed the House last Friday that in addition to the 
copies being made available by the minister, the House had 
taken it upon itself to purchase an additional five copies per hon. 
member according to a decision taken last week unanimously by 
the Board of Internal Economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> This then is the response. I do not want to get 
into a debate about the matter but I will hear the hon. member for 
Kamloops.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would not want to get into a debate on 
the issue. I appreciate the decision that has been made. I am 
seeking confirmation though.
<P>
	In the words of the member who just spoke, he said that it was 
a unanimous decision. Does that mean that all political parties 
represented on the Board of Internal Economy agreed to limit 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10195"> 10195 </A></B>
<P>
the amounts of information given to our constituents on this 
critical issue?
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Members of the Board of Internal Economy are 
well known; those appointed to the board are well known. It was 
unanimous among members of the board as are all decisions of 
the board.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member once sat on the board. I think he is 
familiar with the procedure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, just to add briefly to this information session in the 
House, last week when I raised the issue in the Chamber and the 
member speaking on behalf of the board responded to me, he 
gave information about additional copies being available should 
I wish to purchase them out of my office budget.
<P>
	I inquired about the purchase price and discovered that 
although I was willing to purchase copies from my office there 
were not enough printed in any case for me to purchase them. 
Then I found that the price itself would be exorbitant to absorb 
within my budget.
<P>
	I approached the printing office on Parliament Hill and asked 
how much it would cost to print that number of pages, 
double-sided, one staple in the top, and I was informed the cost 
was roughly one-third the cost of buying it from the 
government.
<P>
	I can print through the House of Commons. I have a quote 
from the House printing unit to print enough copies to satisfy my 
demands in my constituency for close to $400. I am prepared to 
pay that amount if the House will allow me to ask printing to 
produce that copy.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With regard to the copies that are made 
available to members of Parliament, these copies are available 
at distribution. They are for legislative use, not for general 
distribution.
<P>
	However the point the hon. member raises might be of interest 
to all hon. members in terms of the costs. I would ask the House 
spokesperson to the Board of Internal Economy if it might be 
possible to have that discussion raised at the next meeting of the 
Board of Internal Economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, we could bring the issue to the 
attention of the board. If the member would correspond with the 
board, I am sure we would be pleased to receive his 
representation.
<P>
	I have a point of order on another issue.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The point will be brought up at the next 
meeting of the Board of Internal Economy.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUESTIONPERIOD">QUESTION PERIOD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, earlier in question period today an hon. member 
asked a question of a minister in relation to the responsibility of 
the minister being responsible for a province.
<P>
	I want to refer members to article 412 of Beauchesne's which 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A question may not be asked of a Minister in another capacity, such as being 
responsible for a province, or part of a province, or as spokesman for a racial or 
religious group.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a 1968 decision of the Speaker. I would submit the 
question was in fact out of order. I believe there were a number 
of cries across the way as to why the minister did not respond to 
a question that was clearly out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is also clear that any question put is directed 
to the government. As such, it is my understanding and has been 
the practice for years in the House that any minister of the crown 
can answer the question.
<P>
	Although the question may be put to a specific minister, 
another minister who so desires can answer the question.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would just note for the Chair's enlightenment that in this case 
the question was put to the Minister of Natural Resources. This 
matter is a natural resource matter, broadly speaking.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I repeat that it is the 
longstanding tradition of this house that any question that is put 
to the government per se can be answered by any minister on the 
government side. I would like to let that rest at this point.

Canada Act (other pension income).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the bill which I am introducing today is 
entitled an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act (other 
pension income). It will require all pension or retiring 
allowance payments received by a member of Parliament that 
are paid from public funds to be deducted from the member's 
sessional allowance.
<P>
	This bill will deal with another dimension of the issue of 
double dipping. Members of Parliament who receive publicly 
funded pensions while at the same time receiving a full member 
of Parliament salary will be affected. The bill asks that the 
House of Commons subtract pension income from a sitting MP's 
salary, thus preventing double dipping, or receiving two 
incomes from only one taxpayer. This bill would make all MPs 
declare all public pension income they receive while sitting as 
an elected member of Parliament.
<P>
	Those members with publicly funded pensions for previous 
service in: provincial legislatures; municipal governments; the 
public service at the federal, provincial and municipal levels; or 
as former judges; members of the Canadian forces; former peace 
officers; crown corporation employees; and former employees 
of school boards, hospital boards or any other publicly funded 
organization will forgo receiving two incomes for doing one job 
as a member of Parliament.

member of Parliament receive a full salary while also receiving 
a public pension.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to table my first private member's 
bill, an act to complement the present laws of Canada that 
protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal 
information about themselves obtained by certain corporations.
<P>
	For several years Canadians have enjoyed the protection 
offered under the Privacy Act giving them better access to the 
federally held personal information. Yet in the private sector the 
use and abuse of personal information continues.
<P>
	In 1994 the Quebec government passed a historic privacy law, 
Bill 68. It gave Quebecers greater control over their personal 
information. My private member's bill would complement, not 
compete with Quebec's bill by extending privacy protection to 
businesses under federal jurisdiction. For the rest of Canada, 
citizens for the first time would be given the control they need 
over their privately held personal information as we speed 
toward the creation of an information highway.

Question No. 129-<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With a minimum security prison already located in the riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka and a medium security prison to be operational by 1997, 
what is being done to ensure the proper assignment of classification to prisoners 
who will be located at these prison facilities?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> In so far 
as the Correctional Service of Canada is concerned, the answer 
is as follows:
<P>
	All federal inmates entering the Correctional Service of 
Canada's jurisdiction, including those coming from the courts 
as well as those who have violated a conditional release and 
whose release has been suspended, are admitted to a maximum 
security institution for assessment. In Ontario, all new federal 
inmates are admitted to the assessment unit at Millhaven 
maximum security institution.
<P>
	All new inmates undergo a comprehensive assessment to 
identify those issues which have contributed to criminal 
behaviour and which must be addressed. Violent offenders 
receive psychological assessments and sexual offenders are 
offered a comprehensive assessment aimed at establishing 
appropriate treatment interventions and level of risk to public 
safety. The results of these assessments, and case specific 
information (such as documents from the police, courts, family, 
etc.) are examined and analysed to determine the level of 
security required for the management of the case. As well, a 
correctional plan for the inmate is produced which becomes the 
blueprint for the sentence, against which progress toward 
correctional goals are measured. At the end of the process, 
which may take up to eight weeks, a placement decision is made 
which reflects both the security and program needs of the 
offender.
<P>
	Inmates are assigned a minimum, medium or maximum 
security classification. Part of the overall assessment is the 
custody rating scale, a tool which was developed to provide a 
statistically based placement opinion. The elements included in 
this tool are considered to be effective predictors of behaviour. 
On the basis of the entire assessment, including the custody 
rating scale, a placement decision is made by assessment staff, 
and the inmate is sent to a receiving institution classified at 
his/her level of security.
<P>
	Three critical factors are taken into consideration in 
determining the security level of the inmate; namely, 
institutional adjustment, escape risk, and risk to public safety. 
Each factor is given a rating of low, moderate or high, and each 
is significant to the overall assessment of the inmate.
<P>
	Once an inmate has been placed at an institution, the inmate's 
security classification is reviewed at least once a year. Any 
additional information which was not considered at the previous 
placement may result in a change in the classification level. 
New factors which may be considered are the inmate's current 
attitude, behaviour, motivation and progress in his/her 
treatment programs. In preparation for any critical decisions 
concerning transfer, temporary absence, or work release, CSC 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10202"> 10202 </A></B>
<P>
policy requires that the inmate's classification be reviewed and 
confirmed or amended. Case managers must use their 
professional judgment, in conjunction with  available 
assessment tools, in reaching a final conclusion as to the 
appropriate security classification.
<P>
	In addition to the individual inmate's classification, 
institutions are also classified by security level. Beaver Creek 
Institution, in Parry Sound-Muskoka, is classified as a 
minimum security prison. The new institution, to be located on 
the Beaver Creek reserve near Gravenhurst, Ontario, is expected 
to be completed in 1997, and will be classified as a medium 
security prison.
<P>
	The rationale for placement of all federal inmates is found in 
section 28.i.(e) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, 
which states that the Correctional Service of Canada shall take 
all reasonable steps to ensure that the penitentiary in which the 
person is confined is one that provides the least restrictive 
environment for that person, taking into account: (a) the degree 
and kind of custody necessary for (i) the safety of the public, (ii) 
the safety of that person and other persons in the penitentiary, 
and (iii) the security of the penitentiary; (b) accessibility to: (i) 
the person's home community and family, (ii) a compatible 
cultural environment, and (iii) a compatible linguistic 
environment; (c) the availability of appropriate programs and 
services, and the person's willingness to participate in those 
programs.
<P>
	When the new institution is opened, only those inmates who 
have undergone careful assessment and meet the criteria for 
placement at the medium security level will be transferred there.
<P>
	Public safety is the paramount factor in any decision relating 
to the management of inmate cases.

	The House resumed from February 28 consideration of the 
motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy 
of the government; the amendment, and the amendment to the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I begin, Reform members will be splitting their time 
today.
<P>
	I cannot say I am honoured but I feel responsible to join in this 
budget debate and to speak against both the budget and the 
amendment on the floor. I remind the House that it was only one 
year ago that we in the Reform caucus were saying several 
things about a budget which had just been tabled.
<P>
	Those things were that the targets contained in the 
budget-the target of a 3 per cent deficit to GDP-were not good 
enough. Even if those targets were to be achieved they would 
add billions of dollars in cuts to deal with the accumulated 
interest payments that would be realized as a consequence of 
adding to our national debt. In so doing, we were assured time 
and time again that the targets and the measures laid out in that 
budget were good enough and that they could be achieved with 
no additional budgetary action whatsoever.
<P>
	What we have this week is a budget with spending cuts of $12 
billion and tax increases of $1.5 billion, all in a period of 
exceptional economic growth, even above what was foreseen in 
the previous budget.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	It is in order to achieve the very targets that we started out 
with, the very targets that are inadequate and that we were 
supposedly going to be able to achieve with no cuts whatsoever. 
Why? Because on this particular budget path we have added 
interest payments of $12 billion.
<P>
	The interest costs on the government's debt will rise in this 
same period from $38 billion to $50 billion. We are cutting $12 
billion in spending now to achieve what? It is to achieve a stable 
debt-GDP ratio at the top of an economic cycle, so that it will do 
nothing but rise when we face the inevitable downturn. It is 
called an achievement. It is the government's belief that this is 
its ticket for re-election.
<P>
	This reminds me so much of what the Progressive 
Conservatives did in 1988. They reached exactly the same point, 
except at a much lower level of debt and then said all was well.
<P>
	What do we say now? We say that this is not adequate. We say 
that this path will continue to add interest charges that will come 
out of program spending. What are we told? We are told that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10203"> 10203 </A></B>
<P>
there will be no more cuts  to achieve our targets, especially not 
in the area of social programs. We will achieve these targets 
nevertheless.
<P>
	The finance minister knows this is not true. There is such a 
gap between what the Liberal government says and what it does 
that it is just astounding. It explains why the finance minister 
must on a daily basis so grossly exaggerate Reform policy in 
order to cover his real agenda.
<P>
	In fact my Bloc colleagues in question period today were 
calling his statements demagoguery. That is the only way to 
describe his desperate defence of the course he is leading us 
down.
<P>
	Some of the cuts in the budget should have been made a long 
time ago and I agree with them. However it is interesting and 
necessary to compare them against what the Liberal government 
said versus what it meant. I am not talking historically but just in 
recent memory.
<P>
	As recently as a year and a half ago the Liberal Party said it 
was against free trade and it would pull out of the free trade 
agreement. What it meant was it would strengthen free trade, 
continue those agreements and expand them on a scale that was 
not foreseen before.
<P>
	When the Liberal Party said it was committed to keeping 
Petro-Canada and would not privatize it, what it really meant 
was it would finish the job of privatization.
<P>
	When the Liberal Party said it would guarantee funding for 
the CBC what it meant was it would guarantee that its funding 
would be continually cut.
<P>
	The Liberal Party said a Liberal government would never cut 
the civil service, but what have we got here? Not only do we 
have retro-cuts, but what the Liberal government really meant 
was that it would cut the civil service at record levels and do it 
retroactively by reopening collective agreements.
<P>
	The Liberal Party said a Liberal government would never cut 
transfer payments to the provinces. What it will not transfer to 
the provinces is additional authority or additional tax points, but 
it will cut the transfer payments to the provinces at a record 
level.
<P>
	The Liberal government said it would never raise the tax 
burden on the middle class. That apparently did not include gas 
taxes which are paid by ordinary citizens of every class. It did 
not include limiting RRSP contributions which hit certainly at 
members of the upper middle class which I would distinguish 
from the rich. It would raise utility taxes on ordinary consumers, 
providing they live in Alberta and a few other select areas of the 
country. It is now prepared to raise tobacco taxes which fall 
generally on those with lower than average incomes. The 
Liberal Party said it would never raise taxes on the middle class 
but what it really meant was most of the tax increases will be on 
the middle class.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister said he would never allow a society where 
we see beggars in the streets. What he really meant was he would 
never walk to work but instead drive by in his limousine so he 
never sees the beggars that we all meet every single day that we 
come here.
<P>
	The Liberal Party now says that it will never cut health care, 
unemployment insurance, old age security, the Canada pension 
plan, child care or any of those plans. It says it will never cut 
them like the Reform Party intends to cut them. What the Liberal 
government really means is that it is not going to tell Canadians 
what those cuts are until they come. It is not going to bring them 
in them until the debt and the interest has drained off every red 
cent necessary to have a program of any kind.
<P>
	What the Liberal government also said was that generally it 
will never cut the social security of Canadians. What do the 
Liberals really mean when they say all these things about 
compassion and sacrifice? They mean they will never take MPs 
off their gold-plated pension plan and you will never see MPs 
begging in the streets.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party proposed last week a plan for a 
balanced budget with social programs that are clearly smaller 
and more decentralized than we have today. These are not 
popular measures and we know that. Those programs are based 
on clear objectives and values with dollars that are available 
today.
<P>
	As bad as the Minister of Finance will paint this, these 
programs are going to look very good by the time we find out 
what the government really plans to do with social programs.
<P>
	The choice is very simple. Canadians will have accept the 
tough medicine necessary to get us back to fiscal to health. The 
alternative is to buy the same snake oil from the same snake oil 
salesman at a price that is going to go up and up and up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
listened to the member speak all I heard were negatives and 
misinformation.
<P>
	The member somehow painted the reduction of the civil 
service by 45,000 jobs as a negative when in fact the government 
is refocusing through program review the downsizing. There 
will be surplus staff. The member clearly cannot be opposed to 
eliminating surplus staff in a compassionate way.
<P>
	The member complains about the transfers to the provinces, 
yet in the Reform alternative budget the amount of hit to seniors, 
to the disadvantaged, to those who need health care, is 
drastically heavier. He paints the RRSP alternatives as if 
something is wrong. The RRSP limits in fact will be increasing 
to $15,500 from the current year of $13,500.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10204"> 10204 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You'll flip-flop on that one too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Not flip-flop. The member says the Reform Party 
has all the answers.
<P>
	If the member feels that the budget presented on February 27 
was a draconian budget, how does he square the fact that instead 
of cutting $7 billion from the transfers to provinces Reform was 
going to cut some $15 billion from the social programs of 
Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member raises 
the issue of cuts to the civil service, asking how I can condemn a 
program that reduces the civil service and tries to do so in a 
compassionate manner.
<P>
	Reformers would not try and do that. In fact, Reformers told 
the civil servants in this city in the last election that these kinds 
of cuts would be necessary. We told them we would try to do it in 
a compassionate manner and we lost that election.
<P>
	The Liberal Party candidates who won told civil servants 
precisely the opposite. They guaranteed collective agreements 
they are now breaking. They guaranteed jobs they are now 
removing. They guaranteed wages they are now taking away.
<P>
	Now Liberals tell us that will not cut social programs by $15 
billion. By the time the Liberal government is done, the cuts 
proposed by the Reform Party in last week's alternative budget 
will look very minor and the programs we proposed will look 
very good.
<P>
	I am not surprised at anything that comes from people who 
will run on one thing and a year and a half later say the opposite 
on every single area of public policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member in his speech referred to snake oil. 
What he neglected to mention was the snake oil in the budget 
that the hon. member's party presented last week.
<P>
	The last questioner, my distinguished colleague from 
Mississauga South, did ask a question. Of course, the hon. 
member evaded the answer, as every member of his party has 
when pressed on this issue. What proposals did the member put 
forward in the budget last week to gut Canada's social 
programs? Tell Canadians about those. In not one speech in the 
House have we have heard any clear reference to those guttings 
of social programs proposed in the Reform budget-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Calgary West has the 
same amount of time, about a minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the budget 
proposals that the Reform Party prepared last week and tabled 
were done publicly and in a manner that is open and available, 
unlike the plans being made by the government. Any Reform 
member's office can be contacted by any Canadian and the 
information will be provided.
<P>
	There were $15 billion in cuts to social programs, leaving a 
social program envelope of $65 billion. That $65 billion will not 
be available when we learn how the government is really going 
to eliminate a deficit of $25 billion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
budget process has been most fascinating. For the first time in 
the history of Canada the people have become involved in the 
process. We had a member presently in the House say yesterday 
that Reformers were trying to create a tax revolt.
<P>
	I for one-I can speak on behalf of all my colleagues-was 
invited to these events, as were many Liberal members who 
chose not to turn up because they were afraid. It is really 
interesting that in a small city in my constituency, the town of 
Golden with 2,371 households, four women I would like to name 
here today in one week got 2,500 signatures from those 2,371 
households: Gert Shewchuk, Stephanie Braul, Cheryl Kofluk 
and Merle McKnight.
<P>
	These are common, ordinary Canadian women who are 
concerned about their country. This was the kind of activity that 
was going on. This was the kind of involvement that Canadians 
were demonstrating in this process.
<P>
	However, when we come to the budget where the government 
in its own cynical way-although over a three-year period-is 
taking over $3.5 billion out of Canadian taxpayers' pockets 
without raising individual income tax rates, it would appear as 
though the hard work of these women and many others who were 
involved in the tax protest was successful. When I woke up on 
the morning of the day following the budget I turned on the radio 
and was confronted with a song that might be familiar to some 
members in the House. It goes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bye, bye Miss American pie<BR>
 Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry<BR>
 and good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye<BR>
 saying this will be the day that I die<BR>
 This will be the day that I die.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	That was the way I felt after I had an opportunity to take a look 
at the budget.
<P>
	This is a budget of despair. This is a budget that is not 
straightforward by any form of measurement. This is a budget 
that is to have public debt charges increase from $38 billion to 
$51 billion.
<P>
	Government members have the audacity to say that they are to 
protect social program when the largest single increase at 17.3 
per cent is spending on funding the public debt. How can they 
say they are to protect social programs when they are increasing 
the spending on public debt by 17.3 per cent?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10205"> 10205 </A></B>
<P>
	I took a look at their documents. They frequently say that 
they do not know what the facts are. I have the budget speech 
of the minister and I read on page 32 that personal income tax 
is to go up from $51.1 billion to $56.8 billion, to $60.4 billion, 
to $64.5 billion in a four-year period. Corporate tax is to go 
up from $9.8 billion to $13 billion, to $15.5 billion, to $16.3 
billion. As a matter of fact gross budgetary revenues in the 
same period are to increase from $116 billion to $137.4 billion. 
These are numbers provided by the finance minister.
<P>
	We do not have a revenue problem; we have an expenditure 
problem. It is so obvious it is just absolutely amazing.
<P>
	Another interesting point on the expenditure side is that my 
colleague just referred to the fact that 45,000 civil servants are 
to be laid off over the next three-year period. He very clearly 
pointed out that the government was not elected to cut 45,000 
civil servants. It was elected on the promise that civil servant 
jobs were to remain. That promise has been broken.
<P>
	Furthermore business has also taken a hit in the budget. 
Business grants have dropped from $3.7 billion down to $1.9 
billion. While the premiums remain constant, unemployment 
insurance payouts are to decrease from $17.6 billion to $15.3 
billion, to $14.3 billion, to $13.7 billion.
<P>
	There is more and more of a take because they are not to 
decrease the amount they are taking from the unemployed. They 
are to decrease the payouts and put $5 billion into a slush fund 
for themselves. There we have it: we have expenditure cuts and 
the inevitable social program cuts.
<P>
	Why do I say this is a budget of despair? In spite of all the 
harsh medicine and in spite of the fact it will be reducing the 
total amount we are going into the hole by $10 billion, the 
government has permitted annual interest charges in the same 
period of time to increase by $10 billion.
<P>
	In other words we are treading water. Rather than swimming 
and getting somewhere, we are treading water. I think of another 
verse of the song:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's been 10 years<BR>
 I've been on my own<BR>
 and moss grows fat<BR>
 on a rolling stone.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is a song of despair; it is a budget of despair.
<P>
	We have to ask the following question. If we look at the cuts 
that have occurred to this point, where else is there to cut except 
in the social envelope in a responsible manner so that the people 
at the bottom end of the scale are protected? Where else is there 
to cut? There is no place else. In that respect the budget is not 
only a budget of despair. It is a budget of dishonesty.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We are taking a look at the fact that it is hidden within these 
documents. The downloading is where it is hidden. It is hidden 
because they are to combine the Canada Health Act with the 
Canada assistance plan and post-secondary education funding. 
They are to rename all those things the Canada social transfer 
and then they are to reduce it by $4.5 billion.
<P>
	When it is transferred to the provinces and the $4.5 billion is 
removed we have a choice as Canadians. Either we downgrade 
health care, post-secondary education and the amount of 
funding for the Canada assistance plan, or we increase taxes at 
the provincial level. We cannot have it both ways. It is just that 
simple.
<P>
	I asked myself, in listening to the budget debate, what was the 
problem here. Is there some difficulty in terms of understanding 
common ordinary English? I asked a question of the 
parliamentary secretary last night. His response was rather 
interesting. My question was exactly what I have been 
developing here. If we are increasing the amount we are 
spending from $38 billion to $51 billion in our debt service 
charge, where is the money to come from? That is a very valid 
question.
<P>
	When I said that I do not see how the government could 
possibly do the job of continuing to fund social programs-and 
it keeps on saying that it is-his response as reported at page 
10181 of <I>Hansard</I> was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government of Canada will be able to keep its commitments and pay 
pensions to seniors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The difference is that the Reform Party sees everything black; it is the end of the 
world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	No, it is just a little despair at this point.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The member acknowledged that we have made real cuts. We have a balanced 
budget in terms of real cuts and it will encourage economic growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When the documents say that we are to be overspending $32.7 
billion, how in the world could the parliamentary secretary say: 
``We have a balanced budget?'' Obviously he does not 
understand ordinary English. He said: ``The deficit will 
disappear''. By magic? He also said: ``The deficit will be 
reduced by creating jobs''. That was a promise in the last 
election. Obviously it is another promise they believe they can 
drop.
<P>
	I close by quoting in despair:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I still remembered how I cried<BR>
 When I read about his widowed bride<BR>
 But something touched me deep inside<BR>
 The day the music died.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reform Party members took a big risk in terms of the strategy 
they were to use with regard to the budget. They went out and 
incited Canadians on the issue of no new taxes and cutting 
spending. That is exactly what the finance minister did with $7 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10206"> 10206 </A></B>
<P>
of cuts to $1 of increases, and those revenue increases included 
no personal income tax increases.
<P>
	Reformers presented a budget to the House which said that we 
had to keep the poor poor and make the middle class poor. They 
said to Canadians: ``Just stop eating for a year and use that 
money to pay down your mortgage. Then everything will be 
fine''. That is like saying the operation was a success but the 
patient died.
<P>
	The question I have for the member concerns the Canadian 
social transfer. That social transfer is a combination of the CAP 
and the EPF. The member would well know that as there is 
growth in the economy and as the value of tax points goes up, the 
amount of cash transferred to the provinces will go down. In 
some cases the amount of cash will be zero. That being the case, 
what leverage would the federal government have over the 
provinces in terms of maintaining standards?
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Would the member not agree that consolidating those transfer 
programs under one umbrella allows the federal government 
continued leverage to ensure that the national standards of 
health care, environment and others are maintained in Canada, 
the best country in the world?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, the rhetoric of my hon. colleague is 
reminiscent of what we ran into during the last election: the only 
politicians of virtue in Canada are Liberal federal politicians; 
the politicians in provinces are terrible people as well as 
anybody who is not a Liberal.
<P>
	What is this? I do not understand. Perhaps it is just a case that 
members of that party have been in power for so long, have been 
building up the debt for so long, and have had the reins of 
government for so long that as we slide off the edge it has gone 
to their heads.
<P>
	To answer the member very simply, if the government is not 
decreasing the amount of money available to social programs, is 
decreasing the cash transfers by $4.5 billion, and is not 
transferring the tax points to the provinces, how can the 
government possibly try to convince Canadians that it is not 
simply shifting the burden and that it is able to keep its false 
promise of being able to look after social programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the last half hour or so I 
listened to presentations by two members of the Reform Party. I 
am reminded of a movie I saw recently called ``The Madness of 
King George''. We have heard a version of paranoid economics 
where there is a hobgoblin behind every bush and a shadow 
behind every budget. It reminds me very much of King George 
who suffered from a similar malady. He would find himself very 
much at home in the present day Reform caucus.
<P>
	There is an interesting scene in that movie that I think is worth 
commenting on. James Fox, leader of the opposition at that 
time, was seen strolling along the lawns of Westminster with 
Mr. Pitt, who at the time was prime minister. He was a somewhat 
straight-laced and dour gentleman according to history; that 
certainly was how he was portrayed in the movie. As they were 
walking along, James Fox said to the prime minister: ``Mr. Pitt, 
is there anything you admire at all?'' Mr. Pitt said: ``A balance 
sheet, Mr. Fox. I like a good balance sheet''.
<P>
	Mr. Pitt would be very happy with our Minister of Finance 
today because he has come up with a good balance sheet. He has 
been able to come up with a balance sheet to escape the malady 
and the problems faced by governments over the past decade 
that have promised much and delivered little. He has come up 
with a balance sheet that has now been acknowledged and 
recognized by financial markets both here and internationally as 
meeting the test of restoring integrity in our fiscal system.
<P>
	A few short days ago the leader of the Reform Party, the 
chicken little of Canadian politics, screamed that the sky was 
going to fall and that the clouds were going to roll in? All of a 
sudden comes the budget and interest rates begin to fall, the 
dollar stabilizes and financial markets say that the government 
has met the test.
<P>
	Not to be daunted by that illusion, he must now find himself a 
new form of vapour to chase after. He is now pretending there is 
``a hidden agenda''. The only hidden agenda is the one we 
recently read about in the book about the Reform Party that says 
the hidden agenda of the hon. member for Calgary Southwest is 
to rule the world.
<P>
	The message of the budget is to get beyond the immediate and 
the superficial, as we have heard this afternoon. We must deal 
with the specifics and put aside some of the grand statements of 
moral indignation we hear coming from certain provincial 
premiers such as: ``woe is me, the world is gone'' and get down 
to what the government is attempting to do.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	It has provided in this budget the first major step in 
restructuring the economy of this country to provide a way of 
ensuring a fiscal, economic and monetary system that prepares 
us and gives us the kind of foundation we need upon which we 
can then begin to build a new social reform, a new system of 
cultural programs to provide certainty and stability to Canada, 
on which we can then begin to build the new Canada and the new 
economy. That is what this budget is all about.
<P>
	It is very important to emphasize that modernization, 
re-engineering and restructuring are not the object of one day or 
one week. They must start and must continue. It is going to be 
work that I certainly believe will engage members of Parliament 
from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10207"> 10207 </A></B>
<P>
our side of the House and I hope it will engage members of 
Parliament from all sides of the House.
<P>
	This is what Canadians want and demand. They do not want 
the kind of voodoo analysis we are constantly hearing. They 
simply want people to quit playing with black magic and get 
down to reality and deal with the real issues such as how to 
maintain a balance of programs and begin to respond to the 
transformations in the workplace and in the global economy, 
how we preserve integrity economically and socially and the 
sovereignty in order to make our own decisions.
<P>
	Clearly the statement has been made. As much as we have the 
fulmination of the Reform Party wishing it were otherwise, 
wishing and hoping that the sky had fallen as its leader 
predicted, hoping that there would be a cataclysm in Canada, 
that catastrophe would be visited upon us, as much as it has been 
urging and praying that the sky would fall, it has not.
<P>
	What is happening is that Canadians and people 
internationally have seen that this government is the best 
economic manager this country has had in a long time.
<P>
	That is why every Canadian has a crucial stake in the budget 
we brought forward. The government moved decisively to 
restore our nation's integrity and is now beginning to put us in a 
position where we can do the real work of rebuilding we were 
elected to do. We had to get the economics right and the Minister 
of Finance has accomplished that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to maintain the social safety net offered by programs 
like old age pension, family allowance and welfare. It is 
absolutely essential that our financial house be put in order. We 
will take any action necessary to protect social programs today 
and in the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to illustrate to members in the House and others 
listening exactly how that budget has been the catalyst to begin 
that reformation, that new resolution of programs and 
developments in our country.
<P>
	In the budget we announced that we were going to 
fundamentally reorganize the funding of programs in the very 
large Department of Human Resources Development to bring 
together, as we heard during the course of the committee 
hearings, a new human resources investment fund so that we 
could consolidate a number of existing programs that may have 
had value at one time but no longer had the same relevance or the 
same impact. We wanted to bring them together into a common 
pool so we could begin to organize a new social reform package.
<P>
	When hon. members opposite ask where the social reform is, 
it is happening now. The member from Calgary when she made 
her presentation on behalf of her party said: ``I apologize. It was 
not all that well thought out because I did not have much time''.
<P>
	We have a plan. The human resource investment fund is the 
beginning of that because it now gives us the flexibility to put in 
place a good child care program in this country, to deal with the 
question of literacy with our partners in the provinces, to begin 
working on new approaches to help people get re-employed, to 
sit down with the private sector as we are doing in something 
like 16 human resource councils in things like electronics, 
tourism, horticulture, logistics, car repair and auto parts.
<P>
	We are now putting in place a partnership with business and 
labour in each of these sectors to start new training for young 
people. Since the summer close to 10,000 young people have 
been enrolled in these new internship programs in which we are 
sharing our resources with the private sector to begin providing 
new job opportunities and training opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	It is not the old jurisdictional wars between federal and 
provincial governments. We are getting away from the old turf 
disputes. We are now sitting down with the private sector and 
community sector, the women's resource centres, the YWCA, 
the local communities and asking how to become partners to get 
people trained.
<P>
	I heard from one of the Reform members ``too little too late''. 
That is coming from a party which said it was going to take the 
unemployment insurance fund and rip up all programs for 
women with children in the unemployment insurance program. 
He says we are too little too late. Talk about taking a dagger to 
the heart of the vampire. The vampire is taking the dagger to the 
heart of the Canadian people. That is what is going on.
<P>
	Those kind of partnerships are now going to be facilitated by 
this kind of reorganization. The single drawer we have now put 
in place, which we promised to do when I stood in this House for 
social reform and said the first major initiative is to put a single 
drawer of financing in this federal department so we could being 
to work out these new partnerships. It has happened in this 
budget and social reform is well under way.
<P>
	Let me talk for a minute about the Canada social transfer. 
There have been a lot of balloons and a lot of assumptions made 
about what is being proposed. Basically what we are proposing 
in this particular area is to ensure the continuation of an 
effective national approach for the funding and support of social 
initiatives by developing a new set of partnerships with the 
provinces.
<P>
	We are proposing to do exactly what every single province has 
been asking us to do, to ensure they could have the flexibility to 
provide innovation and new approaches, to allow the provinces 
to become incubators of good social reform. That kind of 
freedom has been on every single premier's list until we do it. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10208"> 10208 </A></B>
<P>
Then they say: ``Oh, God, the devil made us do it. Please do not 
do it to us''.
<P>
	Do they want the responsibility or not? We have given them 
the responsibility and for those who have said for some reason or 
other that this means there is going to be a withdrawal of the 
federal government from responsibilities, that is not the case.
<P>
	Every member of the House knows that the present program, 
the existing program, is the one that creates the problems. 
Because it was designed 30 years ago it really means that in most 
cases there is no conditionality. There are no common 
principles. There are no standards. We simply write the cheques 
and they make the decisions.
<P>
	As a result we have created in many cases large numbers of 
bureaucracies that have chewed up the money not in delivering 
directly to people but simply providing services for themselves.
<P>
	I am most surprised by the objection of Bloc Quebecois on 
this matter because it is the one party which I thought would 
endorse fully a new system of federalism that would allow 
provinces to make more decisions for themselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The budget lays the foundations of a new federalism, a new 
partnership with the provinces and communities. At present, we 
have a government organization that has remained unchanged 
since the 1930s and 1940s; it is too centralized, too heavy and 
far from meeting the needs of the people.
<P>
	The provinces, and Quebec in particular, have been asking 
that changes be made for quite some time. What the new 
Canadian social transfer will give the provinces is flexibility 
and the power to make decisions, less paperwork, yet better 
results.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What we are basically trying to do is ensure that we would 
still maintain very clearly the commitments under the Canada 
Health Act. We still maintain very clearly in the budget papers 
the responsibility to maintain full mobility. We will sit down 
with the provinces over the next year to work out a new 
framework in which we can provide more coherence to our 
programs, provide more co-ordination of what they are doing 
among themselves and with us so we can begin to tackle the high 
priority that Canadians have placed to deal with things like child 
poverty and to deal with the problems of families.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	For the first time as the federal government we are saying let 
us sit down as equals to work out how we can bring all our 
resources together in a new way to provide a new framework for 
social reform.
<P>
	Again, when members opposite and others say that social 
reform is on the shelf, they have not read the budget. It started 
Monday night with a brand new way of working with the 
provinces to bring about social reform in a collective, 
co-ordinated, co-operative community way which is what 
Canadians want. That is what the Canadian social transfer is all 
about.
<P>
	I issue an invitation to all members of this House. It is going 
to be absolutely essential and important that every member 
representing all the regions be prepared to put forward those 
kinds of proposals and ideas about how they can see this new 
Canadian social framework taking place, the kind of priorities 
that are there, where we allocate the money and to encourage 
and endorse in their own provinces and their own regions the 
willingness of the provinces to come to the table.
<P>
	I was encouraged this morning to hear Roy Romanow, the 
premier of Saskatchewan, say that we are going to sit down and 
talk with the provinces, to watch the kind of courage expressed 
by Clyde Wells, the premier of Newfoundland, last night on 
television when he said: ``Sure, we're the poorest province in 
the country but we realize the federal government had to take 
tough steps and we're prepared to sit down and work with 
them''.
<P>
	The proposal, for example, in Newfoundland for the new 
income security proposal looking at a way of providing income 
supplements to top up basic benefits to encourage people to go 
back to work is one of those ideas that we can work together on, 
that we can come together with the province of Newfoundland 
and other provinces that want to engage in that same kind of 
joint enterprise to provide more work and more incentives for 
people to go back to work to restore their sense of dignity and 
their sense of hope. I applaud Premier Wells for the kind of 
initiative he has taken.
<P>
	It is important that we get this right and not engage in the 
vocabulary and the language of old Canada, to talk about the 
way things used to be which I hear too many doing and by 
equating social reform with the amount of dollars that we spend. 
I heard members in the opposition today standing up saying we 
are going to take this money and the provinces do not have as 
much.
<P>
	Have they never considered that by changing that program we 
will put an entirely new regime in place where we do not have to 
have duplicating bureaucracy, where we do not have to waste 
money on people pushing paper, where we do not have to have 
people stumbling over one another to administer the same 
program? What we can begin to do is save money that we can 
recycle and restore back directly to people by getting rid of the 
superstructure and infrastructure built up over the years. That is 
the key point.
<P>
	This is not only a way of bringing down the expenses of 
government but also making it more efficient, more effective, 
more competent and more relevant to the people who really need 
help and support. That is what this budget is about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10209"> 10209 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me for the moments remaining speak of a third initiative 
that emerges directly out of the budget in terms of undertaking 
the kind of reform of our social network that we want to initiate. 
That is proposals to look at the unemployment insurance system 
or, to frankly use the term that the Prime Minister used, an 
employment insurance program, to retool, redesign the program 
as a way of enabling people to get back to work, which is the 
fundamental mandate we received as a government.
<P>
	That means taking a program which over the years has 
allowed or acquired a certain number of disincentives that 
discourage people from working, that provide alternatives to 
working, that do not provide the resources to get the kinds of 
skills and the training required to meet the kinds of new 
challenges in our economy.
<P>
	It is fascinating to see how many good ideas are out there. 
This country is so full of people with good innovative ideas. We 
have to provide the encouragement, provide the incentive and 
provide the framework to let them flower.
<P>
	Let me speak for a moment about the New Brunswick job 
corps which was a joint project between us and the province of 
New Brunswick for older workers who had lost their jobs in the 
forest industry. The forest industry was shrinking. We have 
come together as part of our strategic initiatives plan and put 
together a New Brunswick job corps for older workers.
<P>
	Many of them went back to the forest to plant trees, to do the 
reforestation, to restore the resource. Others worked in a wide 
variety of other areas. I received one of the most encouraging 
letters last week from a gentleman from Moncton, New 
Brunswick who as part of his job corps experience has been 
working with the boys and girls clubs of Moncton, sitting down 
with young people, using his well honed, well developed talents 
from his years of working in forestry to impart that same kind of 
skill and that same knowledge to young people.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	He wrote to me saying it was the best job he had ever had 
because he is back working with young people, giving them the 
skills they need. Rather than telling a 55-year old man he no 
longer is of use and is simply going to draw his benefits for the 
next year or two and will live out his life asking where is the 
meaning and purpose, we have given him new hope through the 
New Brunswick job corps. He is now back working in a job that 
gives him an enormous sense of satisfaction.
<P>
	That can be done not just for one, but for tens of thousands of 
people, if we can take money spent through unemployment 
insurance purely for benefits and convert it into money for 
things like the New Brunswick job corps.
<P>
	It can provide wage supplements for people to go back to work 
in the private sector. It can provide earned income supplements 
to get people off social assistance and back into employment. It 
can provide better training programs working with the private 
sector. It can provide  good counselling in our programs so that 
people can understand what their choices and options are.
<P>
	It can provide a new labour market information system from 
coast to coast to coast so that people will know exactly where the 
jobs are. They can plug their resumes into that system and an 
employer will know exactly who is available. They can do it 
right across Canada.
<P>
	That is what we mean by social reform: re-engineering our 
system of unemployment insurance into an employment 
insurance system. We would be using the resources to give 
people the kind of incentive, the kind of support and the kind of 
encouragement they need to get back to work. We believe that is 
what Canadians want. They want to go back to work. The best 
kind of social security enables them to go back to work.
<P>
	There is a transformation going on in today's workplace. 
Technology has an enormous impact in changing the way we 
work and in changing the kind of work available. We have to 
change with it. We cannot stay with the old programs and the old 
ways. Reform and change are essential to enable people to 
understand that this new workplace is something and that they 
have a real place to occupy.
<P>
	My plea today is to let us use this budget as the launching pad. 
Let us use it as the foundation upon which we build a new 
employment system, a new work system and a new job system in 
Canada. With scarce resources and by working closely with the 
provinces, the private sector and community organizations, we 
would create new job opportunities. We would create new 
partnerships and would combine our skills and aptitudes to give 
Canadians real hope. Most important, we would use those 
resources so that Canadians individually could have choices. 
They could choose what kind of job, what kind of training, what 
kind of school and what kind of community they would build.
<P>
	We launched social reform as a public consultation. It is now 
coming into practice as a program as of Monday night's budget. 
Its whole purpose is to give and restore to Canadians the choices 
about the kind of work they do, the kind of community they 
build and the kind of country they are going to live in.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
anyone who is not aware of the government's real situation, of 
the figures, anyone who does not know the real intentions and 
the mess this government finds itself in, would be tempted to 
vote for a minister so eager to speak about job creation and 
training, would be tempted to vote for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development after such an enthusiastic speech.
<P>
	What enthusiasm. What a man, with his desire to put young 
people back to work. What a man who wants post-secondary 
training for students. What a man who wants the transfer of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10210"> 10210 </A></B>
<P>
funds to give the provinces the power to make their own 
decisions.
<P>
	People do not take these political speeches at face value. 
People know very well that debts are being offloaded in this 
budget. They also know very well that these transfers mean that 
the provinces will receive less over the next three years. For 
Quebec, the shortfall will be more than $2 billion.
<P>
	When the Minister of Human Resources Development speaks 
about putting young people back to work, giving young people 
the chance to be trained, how can he explain that his reform 
plans would send young people right into debt? Since there is no 
money left, student loans and grants are of course frozen. But 
credit is to be extended more readily. At the same time, while 
responsibilities are being transferred, transfer payments are 
being reduced. This forces the provinces to come up with very 
tough budgets also.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	This dynamic minister who would offer fine training through 
his plans for job-related training in conjunction with employers 
and with the workplace, does he know that this has been planned 
for a long time in Quebec? Does he know that in Quebec the 
University of Sherbrooke has a co-operative training program 
in which all students are not merely trained, but are also sent on 
regular placements with potential employers? Does he know 
that this approach was taken by what some call factory schools 
where students get practical training, long before the minister 
announced his plans, long before the minister suggested that 
such things should exist? No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	How can the minister, in such an ardent speech, maintain this 
hope for young people when his budget consists solely of 
reducing transfers and offloading the federal debt onto the 
provincial budgets?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
sure liked the first part of his comments. I will certainly do my 
best to answer his question.
<P>
	First, it is important to get the facts right. I know the hon. 
gentleman is an honourable and respected parliamentarian who 
never wants to get confused by misinformation. As we pointed 
out in the House today, the changeover in transfers in the 
province of Quebec for example only amounts to 3.1 per cent, 
not the vast figures used, but 3.1 per cent in 1996-97. It is a 
reduction of about $350 million, at most.
<P>
	I want to underline the point I made during the course of my 
remarks because I know the hon. member takes this very 
seriously. That amount is far less than the reductions we are 
taking ourselves as a federal government, which is on average 
about 7 or 8 per cent. The national average of reduction on 
transfers is about 4.4 per cent and in Quebec alone it is 3.1 per 
cent. I would be quite happy to share further that information. It 
would be very useful for the member to know those are the real 
facts and not those that have been put forward by other sources.
<P>
	It means we have to work at what I have heard the hon. 
member speak of quite eloquently in his own way. We need to 
eliminate a lot of the duplication which takes place between 
levels of government. We need to eliminate a lot of the build up 
of bureaucracies and the program administration which are in 
the way of the direct delivery of programs. I have always said 
that one of the major objectives we have in social reform is to 
eliminate many of those barriers and hurdles that have built up.
<P>
	This puts the onus and responsibility on the provinces to 
figure out ways of doing that. They now have far more freedom 
and far more choice about how they can reorganize their 
programs to get those kinds of things because we are taking the 
restrictive rules off.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, the Canada assistance plan had a 
whole set of rules about what could not be done. A good example 
in Quebec is the APPORT program which has been a very good 
incentive to enable people on social assistance to go back to 
work. We could never fund APPORT under the old rules of the 
Canada assistance plan. Under our new transfer proposal 
Quebec can now use funds from the federal government for the 
APPORT program and therefore have a lot more flexibility.
<P>
	It seems to be a real example of contradiction to have it being 
opposed by the Bloc Quebecois when it is in the interest of 
Quebec to have access to those funds for use in Quebec's own 
innovative programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now that I listen to the minister I can understand why 
some people call him the head dinosaur in the Liberal stable of 
those who believe that all the solutions to the economic and 
social problems of Canada are found with the government.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	The issue of this budget is one of credibility. One year ago the 
Minister of Finance said: ``We have now made all the cuts that 
we have to make''. It is a matter of credibility not relative to 
what we have proposed. I think that we have been honest. What 
is at issue is the untruth, the smoke and mirrors we got in the last 
budget. It was said that there would be no cuts and especially 
that social programs were sacrosanct.
<P>
	The budget speech gives the expenditure reductions by 
category. Would anyone believe there are cuts planned in health, 
in Canada Mortgage and Housing which serves the poor, and in 
veterans affairs? The people who served this country will now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10211"> 10211 </A></B>
<P>
be asked to make sacrifices by this government which promised 
there would be no cuts at all. One of the biggest cuts has been in 
heritage and cultural programs. There are cuts in international 
assistance as well. All of those things were promised to be 
sacrosanct.
<P>
	The issue is one of credibility. I stood and applauded these 
cuts, but the story was given that there would be no cuts in the 
future. Now we are hearing all kinds of wonderful stories. Why 
should we believe them this time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
the way, I want to make an official announcement. It is well 
known that in the next week the Reform caucus room will be 
renamed Jurassic Park. I hope we will be invited to the opening.
<P>
	The real question of credibility is what Canadians take as 
being the honest efforts of a government to balance out its 
priorities. Those are to make sure that we can start living within 
our means and using our fiscal system to restore health while at 
the same time maintaining the kind of justice and compassion 
that we have.
<P>
	I think the credibility of the hon. member's own party fell 
apart in its alternative budget. The Reform Party talks about 
clawbacks of $3 billion on seniors pensions. It talks about taking 
away maternity benefits from women. It also talks about 
virtually doing away with the Canada assistance plan and 
turning it into some kind of investment program. Imagine a 
single parent with three children in downtown Toronto saying: 
``Yes, I have a few thousand dollars. I am going to invest in my 
own registered retirement savings income security program''. 
That shows no credibility.
<P>
	We are trying to balance the two off. We know we have to 
make some cuts. At the same time, we believe in the kind of 
social reform we are initiating. It enables us to sit down with the 
provinces and the private sector to establish partnerships for 
new training programs and new job programs. We all share in the 
cost. We eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and we get rid of 
duplicated programs. It is under those kinds of initiatives that 
we can begin to use our valuable resources in a much more 
effective way.
<P>
	It seems to me that members of the Reform Party have 
completely and entirely abdicated the notion that good, 
effective management can bring about better results. Maybe it is 
because they know they will never have the opportunity to 
manage anything in the federal Government of Canada at any 
time, anywhere. Therefore they do not focus on the requirement 
to ask how to do things better.
<P>
	The Reform Party has given the name Reform a bad currency. 
The real meaning of reform is to be able to make effective 
changes without losing one's values. We have maintained our 
Liberal values and we are going to make effective changes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. Excuse me, but I must make the 
following announcement before 5 p.m. It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-gun control; the hon. 
member for South Shore-tourism; the hon. member for 
Frontenac-the budget.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure as the member for Richmond-Wolfe and the 
official opposition's critic for regional development to speak on 
the occasion of the tabling of the budget.
<P>
	I would ask permission to first remind this House of one of the 
major causes of the Canadian deficit, because the aim of this 
budget is to resolve the problem of the deficit in order to tackle 
the problem of the debt. Let us have a look at one of the causes of 
this great catastrophe of the Canadian economy-the debt.
<P>
	Liberal Pierre Trudeau came to the position of Prime Minister 
armed with a national vision that was impervious to the many 
representations made with respect to provincial jurisdiction. 
This national delusion of grandeur on the part of one political 
party would take the country of the 1970s down the road to a 
national debt that is today out of control.
<P>
	The Liberals' Canadian nationalism formed the ideological 
foundation for government intervention, given the lack of a real 
social democratic policy. National unity in the face of rising 
provincialism provided one vocation for the party and its leader; 
the other was Canada's independence from the United States. 
Thus involvement by the central government with the aim of 
ensuring a Canadian presence in all regions of this vast country 
gave birth to a monstrous government apparatus, the cost of 
which is being felt today in the national debt.
<P>
	Canada's debt is the hidden side of this national liberalism. It 
is the expression of the collapse of the Liberals and of Canada's 
economic and political systems. Yes, Mr. Speaker, the Liberal 
Party of Canada is responsible for the national debt.
<P>
	Having said this, Canada's debt is now $550 billion, and will 
climb to $650 billion by 1997-98. The federal government's 
debt will continue to grow faster than the economy. The net debt 
will grow from $546 billion in 1994-95, to $578 billion in 
1995-96 and will reach $603 billion in 1996-97. The debt, as a 
percentage of gross domestic product, will peak at 73.5 per cent 
in 1995-96 before easing off slightly to 73.4 per cent in 
1996-97.
<P>
	Canada's problem is structural. It is directly linked to the 
Liberals' desire to centralize everything and to stake out an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10212"> 10212 </A></B>
<P>
imposing presence for itself throughout the country. Quebec 
should have dragged itself out of this quagmire a long time ago.
<P>
	In the Minister of Finance's 1995-96 budget, the state takes a 
hands-off approach to this bankrupt country's economy. 
However, the federal Liberals still have the same desire, the 
same delusion of grandeur: they have stuck with the same 
flawed vision they had in the seventies, which was the dream of 
a unified nation taking its place among the greatest western 
capitalist countries.
<P>
	In 1996-97, the government will cut $650 million in transfer 
payments to Quebec for health, education and welfare, but has 
no intention of withdrawing from these jurisdictions. The 
central government is beginning its great withdrawal by 
merging established programs financing with the Canada 
assistance plan to create one global transfer program, dubbed 
the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	Despite budgetary constraints and the spectre of national 
bankruptcy hovering over our heads, Ottawa firmly clings to 
national standards. Abiding steadfastly to federal principles, 
that is the rampart the government is defending in the budget, 
with Quebec's referendum looming on the horizon. Make no 
mistake, this budget is, above all, about decentralizing the 
deficit accumulated by Liberals Trudeau, Chrétien, Lalonde and 
Turner, about decentralizing the Liberal debt, starting with cuts 
in federal transfer payments for post-secondary education, 
health care and social assistance.
<P>
	The federal government has withdrawn from its funding role, 
but the departments where duplication exists remain in place. 
Did anyone say the Department of Health would be abolished? 
And when do we get this sweeping structural reform of the 
federal system? Despite the government's claims since the 
beginning of this year that it wants to decentralize, the Liberals 
are still flying the centralist flag. Thanks to national standards, 
the centralist option is alive and well.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	A withdrawing from its funding role in the provinces does not 
mean the central government has withdrawn its administrative 
structures. Even if these become increasingly symbolic, they are 
still costly and, as such, even more damaging to the initiatives of 
the provinces. The trouble is, the federal withdrawal creates a 
vacuum. There is a lack of real job creation measures. People are 
upset about drastic cuts, and there is a consistent lack of regional 
development policies. For instance, general cuts in transfers to 
the provinces will have an impact on access to university. This is 
tough for our young people.
<P>
	Certain regions may have trouble supporting their 
universities. This was said by Claude Lajeunesse, president of 
the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. And he 
should know. The Eastern Townships, where I have the privilege 
of representing the riding of Richmond-Wolfe, is one of the 
regions that will be particularly affected by the federal 
government's new policy, the so-called Canadian Social 
Transfer, and the attendant cuts in transfer payments. This 
region, which has two universities and five hospitals, will suffer 
as a  result of these cuts. Let the federal government withdraw, 
let it disappear and with it the departments of Health and Human 
Resources Development, let full responsibility be transferred to 
the regions, with the appropriate tax revenues.
<P>
	Canada is the G-7 country that invests least in research and 
development, but the Minister of Finance cut the budget for 
research and development. In the agricultural sector in Quebec, 
$10 million will be cut annually over the next three years. This 
will have a particularly dramatic impact on the development of 
regions in Quebec that are known for their flourishing dairy 
industry. We see the same thing happening to the National 
Research Council of Canada, whose budget will be cut by $76 
million over the next three years. Do not try to understand why. 
The Liberal Party which, throughout its election campaign and 
in its red book, focused on jobs, advanced technology and 
competitiveness, is now withdrawing from research and 
development in Quebec, making the regions poorer in the 
process.
<P>
	Another example of a regional catastrophe. The Gaspé and the 
Maritimes will be particularly affected by the repeal of the 
Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act, since $99 million worth 
of subsidies will be cut.
<P>
	I would like to welcome my Liberal colleagues, who are 
coming from behind the curtains to listen to what I have to say.
<P>
	The federal withdrawal announced in Monday's budget may 
be described as typical of a routed State, a government that has 
become so fat that it can no longer move except to reduce this 
government-made deficit on the backs of others: Quebec and 
the provinces. For example, Henri Massé, secretary general of 
the FTQ, reminds us that the total payroll for federal civil 
servants accounts for only eight per cent of the deficit and he 
concludes that this is a very cruel budget for the little people. It 
attacks the most disadvantaged segment of our society, namely 
the wage earners, while protecting the friends of the regime. The 
powerful capitalist leaders of the Liberal financial community 
in Canada are like the angels of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, ask federal public service 
employees: ``Do you not think that your jobs will be safer in a 
Quebec public service set to expand in a new sovereign country 
than in this declining federal public service?'' Who says that 
laying off 45,000 employees will produce efficiency gains? 
What guarantee do we have that, as my hon. colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot said, the ``bosses'' across the way will 
not decide to replace the career civil servants who will be laid 
off with friends of the regime, friends of the Liberal Party?
<P>

<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Again, one of Quebec's regions will have to bear the brunt of 
indiscriminate federal cuts, as 12,000 federal jobs will no doubt 
be eliminated in the Outaouais region.
<P>
	Going once more against what it had announced during the 
election campaign in terms of employment policies, the Liberal 
Party is about to cut the budget of its industry department by 
$560 million. This measure is all the more harmful because it 
affects peripheral regions.
<P>
	With respect to the regions, while maintaining a presence, the 
Liberal government is planning to reduce the budget of regional 
development agencies by the modest sum of $0.6 billion over a 
three year period.
<P>
	The Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, the 
FORDQ, becomes an empty shell that eventually will merge 
with the Federal Business Development Bank, as indicated in 
the budget, and play the role of a financial institution.
<P>
	The implications of the budget are obvious: regional 
development agencies will channel their assistance to small 
business. Subsidies will be systematically replaced with 
refundable contributions and loans. Apparently, the Liberal 
Party of Canada thinks it can treat regional small businesses and 
big multinational corporations the same way, because when it 
cuts 60 per cent of its subsidies to business, it seems to think this 
should affect regional small businesses as well. And remember, 
they cut only 60 per cent, when everyone in the official 
opposition, including Quebec employers, wanted to cut them 
100 per cent.
<P>
	This approach will be very damaging to regional development 
in Quebec. That being the case, with the FORDQ an empty shell, 
the federal government should withdraw from regional 
development altogether, with full compensation for Quebec. 
The FORDQ is a typical example of duplication and overlap. 
Programs to help small businesses already exist in Quebec in all 
administrative regions, including a secretariat for small 
business at International Affairs.
<P>
	Quebec cannot afford to remain in a system that maintains 
duplication and overlap. In any case, Quebec has generally had 
gained very little as a result of federal regional development 
policies, and the Minister of Finance's latest budget is a case in 
point. In fact, we are been advised by the minister that operating 
budgets of regional development agencies will be cut, and again, 
Quebec is being hit, this time to the tune of $40.3 million.
<P>
	Monday's budget is typical of the Liberal philosophy of 
Canada's financial community. This budget does nothing to 
relieve the tax burden on the middle class, but maintains tax 
shelters for the very wealthy and large Canadian corporations. It 
continues to attack the neediest in this country. In 1995-96, 
social programs will see their budgets cut by 7.3 per cent; 
industrial, regional and scientific support programs, 1.8 per 
cent; heritage and cultural programs, 6.9 per cent; and 
Transport, 11.4 per  cent. Meanwhile, debt charges are expected 
to increase by 20.7 per cent over the same period.
<P>
	It is pretty obvious that Canada's financial community is not 
helping to pay the debt. The job market and the neediest in our 
society are bearing the brunt of these debt charges. The figures 
prove it: Over 27 per cent of the cuts to job creation and social 
programs will be used to pay the 20.7 per cent increase in the 
cost of servicing the debt.
<P>
	The budget hits big business and corporations with a 
disproportionately small share of the deficit and debt fighting 
measures. Surtaxes on incomes of approximately $115 million 
were raised from 3 to 4 per cent, income tax rates for large 
corporations were raised slightly from 0.2 per cent to 0.225 per 
cent of capital used in excess of $10 million.
<P>
	Let us not forget the banks. They do not get a permanent tax 
increase, but a temporary one. A minimal and insignificant tax. 
The Royal Bank of Canada, you will remember, pocketed $1.2 
billion in profits last year. These are but a few examples of how 
the federal Liberal budget has spared the middle class, only to 
hit the big Canadian capitalists with mere micky-mouse tax 
measures, and thus passes by funds that are needed to reduce the 
deficit.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	That is where the money is coming from to reduce the federal 
deficit. There is nothing in this budget for job creation, which is 
particularly dramatic for Quebec's regions. The Liberals even 
have the gall to say that the unemployment rate is expected to 
remain unchanged over the next few years, at approximately 9.5 
per cent, that is to say about 11 per cent for Quebec and its 
regions. The people of Quebec should know the time has come to 
say ``yes'' to a sovereign Quebec. It is more important than ever 
that our powers and decisions be in our own hands and not in the 
hands of others, like the federal Liberals.
<P>
	Quebecers will pay dearly if they decide against having a 
country of their own, a real country that will take control over its 
public finances and operate the administrative changes 
required. Unless Quebecers vote for sovereignty this year, 
unless they choose budget efficiency and structural change, they 
are headed, as a society, for a situation where Quebec will have 
less and less control over job creation and will loose all ability to 
put in place an efficient regional economic recovery plan.
<P>
	A negative vote at the upcoming referendum will signal the 
decline of regional development in Quebec, because the present 
Liberal federal government is showing its true colours in this 
budget with disastrous consequences for the regions. What the 
Federal Office of Regional Development, this capitalistic small 
business loan agency, will become is a parody of regional 
development. As the Bloc Quebecois critic for regional 
develop-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10214"> 10214 </A></B>
<P>
ment, I fully support the amendment put forth by  my hon. 
colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot to defeat this budget.
<P>
	In closing, what it this budget about? What does it mean? This 
is a pre-referendum budget that does not even let us see right 
away, in practical terms, that, once again, the federal 
government is hurting Quebec. The pain it getting pretty 
unbearable and this pain is like a wound, a wound that will not 
heal in this federal system. In order to heal, we have to decide 
for ourselves. Quebec has to choose its own remedies, so that it 
can be on its way to economic recovery.
<P>
	It is up to the people of Quebec to choose a positive solution 
and find a cure to they own ills. To remain in this federal system 
is to leave our cultural and economic future, which is already 
seriously compromised, in the hands of individuals who look 
after and stand for interests other than those of ordinary people 
in Quebec. The unemployed, the disadvantaged, the ill, the 
aged, the young, these are the people for whom the federal 
system never does anything.
<P>
	No! They work for the financial elite, the big corporations, the 
banks, the family trusts that will not be taxable until 1999, all 
close friends of this government, the majority of whom 
represent English Canada and the financial elite. That is what 
Canada has always been.
<P>
	The people of Quebec must take responsibility for their own 
future, with confidence and openness. Confidence in 
themselves, in their resources, their strengths and capabilities; 
open to others as they always have been in their cultural and 
business relations with Canada, the United States, South 
America, Europe and the rest of the world.
<P>
	Confidence and openness are Quebec's two greatest assets for 
the future. They are what it needs to recover from this incurable 
federal disease. The future of Quebec, if the people really want 
it, depends on pride. Pride in the fact that we decide to have a 
country, in the fact that we are all prepared to be responsible for 
our economy, our social programs and our culture, and pride in 
our own perception of the future, the future of generations to 
come, of our sons and daughters. We put our trust above all in 
our children, and we must do everything we can to prepare their 
future and ensure that our contribution in this respect is 
exceptional and worthy of the responsibility we have as their 
parents, as their elders.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	History is in the making, and we should be proud to be a part 
of it and to make this exceptional contribution to our joint 
future. We say yes to this future, for the sake of our children first 
of all, and we want the people of Quebec to be a strong and vital 
force in a country that is Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the speech by 
the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe. I know he listened with 
interest himself to the words of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development earlier, when he spoke about the 
overtures made to the provinces to work out a new framework 
for the social security system, as described in part in the budget, 
and in other government initiatives to involve the provinces and 
work with them in a spirit of partnership, so that together they 
might develop a new social security system that will meet the 
needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	Given these initiatives and the position the hon. member has 
just expressed on Quebec sovereignty, I would like to know 
whether he thinks there is a happy medium. Would it be possible 
to work in partnership with the government of Quebec in 
developing a new generation of social and other programs, 
which might, in his view, enable the people of Quebec or the 
government of Quebec to really participate with the rest of 
Canada in these programs?
<P>
	Given that the referendum, if the government of Quebec ever 
sets it in motion, is not a foregone conclusion and that there is a 
good chance, if not a strong possibility, that Quebecers will say 
``yes'' to Canada, as they have always done, and ``no'' to 
separation as proposed by their provincial government, is there 
any way, in his opinion, consistent with his option, to work 
together with the government of Canada, other provincial 
governments and in the other partnerships involved, to improve 
and renew Canada's social security system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I 
would like to thank my colleague for this very long question 
with its many parts. First off, I must say that the words dialogue, 
partnership and co-operation are not just words but are 
underlying principles in Quebec, underlying principles used by 
elected members, used in the communities. In Quebec we have 
always worked through dialogue, partnerships and in 
co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	To my mind, this is a very clear characteristic of Quebec and 
in this regard, my hon. colleague, you must have seen the 
numerous socio-economic summits held in all regions since the 
1980s, you must have seen dialogue and partnerships develop 
between university communities and economic communities. 
Since then, you must have seen strategic plans evolving for each 
region in response to the difficult economic situation and to 
meet development needs.
<P>
	Yes, my hon. colleague, we have these deeply rooted qualities 
and we have also worked through partnerships, in co-operation 
and openly with a great variety of partners in Canada, the United 
States and other countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10215"> 10215 </A></B>
<P>
	However, my hon. colleague, we are not attempting to give a 
history lesson, but we do have a very great deal of patience. 
Quebec has demonstrated that it has a lot of patience. Quebec 
has shown that it is a very peace loving nation. We have 
discussed this Canadian partnership for a very long time now. 
We have had repeated discussions about many areas of 
jurisdiction. One must consider that we have suffered heavy 
blows as a result of these discussions. You will remember that 
the greatest and most serious blow ever dealt to Quebec was the 
unilateral patriation of the constitution in 1982.
<P>
	This unilateral patriation of the constitution, to remind you, 
followed a major debate in Quebec when honest people believed 
the speeches stating that a ``no'' meant ``yes'' to fundamental 
change to the system described as a partnership, involving 
give-and-take and co-operation, when they were told that a 
``no'' meant ``yes'' to profound reform and to a serious 
re-affirmation of ties with Quebec. Quebec had the constitution 
rammed down its throat. Even though the National Assembly 
voted almost unanimously against patriation. There are limits.
<P>
	Quebec nevertheless took the ``beau risque''. We tried to 
come back, to resume dialogue, to get back into the debate with a 
partner called Canada and the other provinces. We went through 
different stages. We survived the Charlottetown experience, we 
survived Meech, despite the many wounds they inflicted.
<P>
	Partnership, openness and association with our neighbours 
are qualities that are still part of the make-up of Quebecers, but 
it is hard to conceive that association could coexist with 
renewal.
<P>
	Yes indeed, dear colleague, Quebec, which will take on the 
qualities of a sovereign country, will be extremely interested in 
economic association. Please keep in mind one very important 
point regarding Quebec's trade balances with the other 
provinces. In 1989, Quebec bought goods and services for a total 
of $26 billion from Ontario, $2.2 billion from the Atlantic 
provinces and $5 billion from the Ottawa region alone. Trade 
links between these regions do exist.
<P>
	Yes, dear colleague, we are prepared to work in partnership 
with friendly countries and in a spirit of openness, co-operation 
and collaboration, but only on the basis of economic association 
and only after we have established our sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, I would ask you to 
address the Chair next time. This enables us to depersonalize the 
debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, have we 
gone through 10 minutes with one question and answer? Did I 
misunderstand you?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary is correct. 
Perhaps that will be a record in this Parliament, that one 
question and one answer went about nine and a quarter minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to advise you that I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Cape Breton Highlands-Canso.
<P>
	It is my privilege to rise in the House today to participate in 
the budget debate. I compliment the Minister of Finance on a 
masterful budget the addresses the concerns of the business 
community, the international markets and the Canadian 
taxpayer. He has made great strides to bring our deficit under 
control and meet the targets we set in our election campaign. In 
1996-97 we will reach the 3 per cent of GDP target we outlined.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Over the last few days a great deal of speculation about the 
budget has been replaced by some pretty confident and solid 
comments about the Canadian economy. They have been 
addressing the positives in terms of what we have seen in the 
budget.
<P>
	Mr. John Bulloch, president of the Canadian Federation of 
Business, said that it was very believable and very credible. The 
powerful Canadian Manufacturers Association called the 
budget the first serious attempt at resolving Canada's books and 
balancing them properly. The Montreal based bank, the 
Laurentian Bank of Canada, led the way in cutting its prime rate 
by one-quarter of one per cent on budget night. Since then and 
through this week we have seen the Canadian dollar go to a solid 
72 cents. At the same time most of our lending institutions 
announced that they would be cutting their lending rates from 
one-quarter to one-half per cent. Mortgage rates will be down.
<P>
	What does this mean to the average Canadian taxpayer? It 
means that we will have more money in our pockets. Average 
Canadian taxpayers are making payments on loans and on 
mortgages. When they come up for renewal they will be paying 
less for borrowing that dollar. It is a positive point about the 
Canadian economy. It is the point that will create more 
spending, bring back consumer confidence and lead us to more 
jobs.
<P>
	Over the past 10 years Canadians heard finance ministers 
Wilson and Mazankowski give budget speeches that promised to 
reduce the debt and the deficit. Their assumptions and targets 
were so far off base that year after year we fell well below the 
targets. They mismanaged the economy badly. When they were 
elected in 1984 the debt of the country was $168 billion. In nine  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10216"> 10216 </A></B>
<P>
short years from 1984 to 1993 they tripled the debt, going from 
$168 billion to $500 billion.
<P>
	At the same time, the Canadian government under Wilson and 
Mazankowski had to keep interest rates high to attract the 
bulging demand for foreign capital. We as a country became 
more and more subject to foreign investors. We became more 
and more a country with rising foreign debt. As a result we 
needed a major change and the Canadian public was well aware 
of it. Our Liberal government when elected in 1993 set realistic, 
achievable goals.
<P>
	This year's budget, with a total saving of $29 billion over 
three years, is realistic. It is achievable. As a result, because we 
based our budget on basic, realistic, achievable goals in our 
economy, we as a government will create a positive climate that 
will move forward in a very positive way. I forecast that not just 
three years down the line but in five years from today, by the 
year 2000, we will be looking at a no deficit budget. We will be 
looking at a balance sheet where we can start digging into the 
debt and reducing it.
<P>
	What does the budget mean to the average Canadian 
taxpayer? As I said, money is going to be in their pockets 
through reduced interest and borrowing costs.
<P>
	I have heard the opposition complain very bitterly that 
Canadian taxpayers will have to pay an excise tax on gasoline. 
Yes, we added 1.5 cents to the cost of a litre of gasoline. There is 
no question about that. I would suggest that when average 
Canadian taxpayers fill up their cars once a week they probably 
put 50 litres in their gas tanks. The increase will amount to 75 
cents a week or the price of a cup of coffee. Would they rather 
pay the price of a cup of coffee and see their mortgage rates go 
down or, as Reformers would state, have absolutely no 
expenses? I do not see their logic. I do not see their reasoning. I 
have talked with a lot of Canadians and they are not upset by the 
1.5 cents per litre increase.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	There are, however, other people in this dimension. Over the 
last several months large corporations and banks have 
announced record profits in their businesses in Canada. They 
have been targeted to help reduce our deficit, as well they should 
be. Over the next three years we expect to generate $910 million 
from tax increases to very prosperous institutions. They as a 
group have been demanding that the government get spending 
under control, and they are the group that has a responsibility in 
helping us do so.
<P>
	My riding of Essex-Kent in southwestern Ontario is very 
dependent upon agriculture for its livelihood. It is an industry 
that producers over half a billion dollars in the two counties of 
Kent and Essex that I represent. We are very mindful of the 
partnership between government and the agri-food industry 
working together in that sector.
<P>
	The government in streamlining research has designated 
some areas as centres of agricultural excellence. In 
southwestern Ontario the Harrow Research Centre will become 
a national centre of excellence for research in the greenhouse 
industry and the food processing industry. Streamlining services 
in Harrow will centre the research where the high concentration 
of greenhouses and processing crops is. The value added and tax 
initiatives that very instrumental to Essex and Kent counties 
will help our economy a great deal.
<P>
	In the Chatham area we will see an ethanol plant that will have 
a great impact on the economy. The plant is a result of a real 
desire on behalf of the government to improve value added 
production in Canada. The benefits of the initiative have great 
potential across the country. There are very serious concerns 
about MMT that is presently being used to boost the octane of 
most Canadian gasolines. Ethanol is far more environmentally 
friendly and will be the choice of Canadians in the future.
<P>
	Liberals can take pride in our legacy of caring for people and 
ensuring that our seniors will be financially secure. Measures 
have been introduced to guarantee their incomes and to make 
certain that over time in the future they will have definite 
pension plans that will pay to support them. They can be sure 
that with the studies and discussions presently ongoing the old 
age security and guaranteed income supplements will remain. 
The government will remain committed to providing a fair, 
reasonable and equitable situation for them.
<P>
	Cash transfers to the provinces have been questioned very 
much. I was a little appalled this morning when I saw Bob Rae 
on television complaining about Canadian support to the 
provincial government. Bob Rae, the premier of Ontario, has 
totally mismanaged the economy of Ontario. Between 1990 and 
1994 the federal government increased its funding for Ontario 
hospitals, colleges and universities by 26 per cent, while Bob 
Rae only increased funding to hospitals, colleges and 
universities by 17 per cent.
<P>
	What does that mean? It means that Bob Rae did not 
participate in those services as the federal government has and 
did not carry his fair share. He mismanaged the economy and 
downgraded services, accepting totally the transfers from the 
federal government but not spending them within the province 
with matching funds.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	It has to be made clear in looking at the services that above all 
we are trying to make certain Canadians across the land get fair 
and equitable treatment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
some questions for members of the government. They talk about 
wanting to be fair and treating all regions of Canada fairly. I 
would like them to take another look at the budget and what they 
have really done to the Atlantic region.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10217"> 10217 </A></B>
<P>
	The Atlantic region last time around took 27 per cent of all 
the cuts in the last budget and we have 8 per cent of the 
population. This time around someone has to tell me how they 
can justify taking away the freight rate subsidies to get our 
product to market. When they brought down the budget on 
Monday, 15,000 jobs were jeopardized in the Atlantic region. 
Members do not know this and backbenchers do not know this, 
but the Minister of Transport knows it. He made promises to 
the people in the Atlantic region. They held public meetings. 
Our people said they would give up ARFAA, the interprovincial 
subsidy, but that they must have the westbound one in order 
to keep working. They were led to believe the Minister of 
Transport agreed.
<P>
	Does anyone know how they heard that the ARFAA and 
MFRAA were to be taken from them? They heard it from Peter 
Gzowski on CBC interviewing the Minister of Transport. I have 
a list of companies in the Atlantic region that will be affected. 
The Canadian Manufacturers Association wrote to the Prime 
Minister about the fact that there had been no dialogue from the 
Minister of Transport.
<P>
	We want to be fair and responsible in the Atlantic region. I get 
tired of hearing people refer to us as have not provinces. Our 
people believe in the family unit and in work. They want to 
work.
<P>
	What are they going to do for all the people in manufacturing? 
What are they going to do today? I represent a city that has a 
nuclear power plant and the largest privately owned oil refinery 
in Canada, and the government took away the weather office. 
Does the government not know what it is doing? I do not believe 
it does. This is a very serious situation.
<P>
	I ask hon. members to revisit what they have done. What has 
happened to the Atlantic region is devastating to our people. The 
people are sitting at home today wondering what is going to 
happen tomorrow because they have not had all the bad news 
yet. They took the bad news the last time and said: ``We are good 
Canadians. We will accept it''. However we cannot accept any 
more.
<P>
	I ask members to take another look at it. Where are the 31 
members in government from the Atlantic region? Why are they 
not speaking out for good, honest people who want to work? 
That is all they are asking for. Government members say they 
will create jobs; we are still looking for them. They know our 
transportation costs have been increased by 40 per cent with 
what they have done by taking away the freight rate subsidies. 
They cannot compete. They are finished.
<P>
	I ask hon. members to take another look at what they have 
done to the Atlantic region, a part of this country. They did not 
state that the St. Lawrence Seaway would no longer be ice free. 
When that project came into play it affected my international 
port. What will you do for the Atlantic region?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask all hon. members not to refer to 
other members as ``you''.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question was a little longer 
than requires a brief reply.
<P>
	The point to be made is that every region in this country has 
equal treatment in this budget. There has been a tremendous 
effort on behalf of the finance department, the minister and the 
government to make certain every section of this country does 
have fair and equal treatment.
<P>
	It is interesting that the member did note that they are losing 
transportation payments. She was very upset about that. I 
remember the Mulroney government which took the At and East 
bill and destroyed travel in the east, in Ontario and all through 
eastern Canada. I certainly saw it destroy the economy of this 
country.
<P>
	Jeffrey Simpson, who is really no friend to the Liberal Party, 
did support the Tory government and stated very clearly that if 
Wilson and Mazankowski under the Mulroney government had 
taken some reasonable action about the economy of this country 
in the 1980s we would not be in the problem we are today. It is a 
sin we are here. They created it and they got ripped by the 
Canadian public for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Saint John wondered where 
the 31 other Atlantic members were to speak on this budget. I am 
one of those members and I am proud to support this budget.
<P>
	It is a very fair budget. It is a budget that responds to the needs 
of Canada, including Atlantic Canada. It is a budget that will 
build a strong foundation for future growth in Atlantic Canada 
and it is the budget that does what nine years of Tory government 
failed to do, which is the reason why it only has one member 
from Atlantic Canada in the House of Commons and only one 
other member in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget that was 
tabled on Monday. My remarks will come from two 
perspectives, as my experience as chair of the House of 
Commons committee which recently carried out extensive 
public hearings across Canada on the future of Canada's social 
programs and as an Atlantic Canadian.
<P>
	For many, perhaps most of the hundreds of Canadians who 
appeared before our committee last fall, this budget and what 
would happen to social programs and to the historic federal 
commitment to social programs as a result of the growing 
preoccupation with the deficit was very much on their minds.
<P>
	Many witnesses expressed suspicion that the comprehensive 
review of the social security system in Canada which they 
acknowledged was necessary was nevertheless being used as a 
smoke screen to slash spending on social programs as a way for 
the government to achieve its deficit targets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10218"> 10218 </A></B>
<P>
	They wondered about the choice of programs that were being 
included in this review. Why was the government not focusing 
more on tax expenditures, in particular about tax breaks to 
wealthy Canadians and corporations? Should they not be made 
to shoulder their fair share of the task of deficit reduction?
<P>
	The report of the human resources development committee 
which I tabled in this House on February 6 paid careful attention 
to these concerns and had some specific recommendations for 
the Minister of Finance to consider as he prepared his budget.
<P>
	In particular, we urged him to ensure that the balance of 
deficit reduction measures in his budget addressed the issue of 
tax fairness in Canada. As well, we urged the government to 
proceed with the reform of social programs as part of its jobs and 
growth agenda.
<P>
	The country's difficult fiscal situation only makes the need to 
address the accumulated problems which have occurred in our 
social security system more and not less urgent. We did not say 
that there should never be any reduction in social spending in 
Canada. That would have been unrealistic in the current fiscal 
climate. What we did say was that savings in this area should be 
achieved as part of a fundamental, comprehensive reform to the 
system of social security in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	It is one that would respond to today's social security needs 
like addressing the pressing problem of child poverty, fostering 
the kind of life long learning culture that will support 
employment and assist Canadians to find the kind of well paying 
jobs that have a future in this country and, most important, by 
stabilizing the overall finances of the federal government by 
removing the distortions and the disincentives that have grown 
up around government programs that have been built with the 
best of intentions for another era and by focusing the resources 
and the energies of government to those areas where government 
is best placed to be effected. In short, by getting government 
right.
<P>
	The Government of Canada can provide the leadership and the 
fiscal framework needed to ensure that the social security 
system and the programs which Canadians across this country 
told the committee they were so proud of and were so necessary 
and so much defined our country would be preserved and 
enhanced for the future.
<P>
	Does the budget that was released on Monday respond to the 
concerns of Canadians as reported by a committee? In large 
measure I believe it does. The committee urged the government 
to balance efforts to reduce the deficit with measures to promote 
tax fairness. This budget does that. For example, there are no 
increases to general income taxes, yet measures are taken to 
ensure that taxes that are owed are paid.
<P>
	The large corporations tax is increased by 12.5 per cent and 
the existing corporations surtax from 3 to 4 per cent. In addition, 
banks and other large deposit taking institutions will pay a tax 
on capital, raising $100 million between now and October 1996.
<P>
	The budget takes dead aim at the system of family trusts. All 
tax advantages that flow from the establishment of family trusts 
will be eliminated. The infamous amendment to the so-called 
21-year rule that was introduced by the previous government to 
allow the wealthy to shelter tax through family trusts will be 
repealed.
<P>
	In addition, the budget adopts a specific recommendation of 
the committee that would open up tax expenditures as well as 
direct expenditures of government to regular parliamentary 
scrutiny.
<P>
	With the budget the government reaffirms its commitment to 
reform of the social security in Canada not as a reckless exercise 
in slashing programs but as an orderly and thoughtful process of 
renewal in full partnership with the provinces and in 
consultation with Canadians.
<P>
	This budget makes no immediate cuts to the principle 
elements of the social safety net. What further spending cuts 
occur only begin in 1996-97 and then only once a framework for 
a renewed and reformed unemployment insurance system and 
the implementation of the Canada social transfer are fully in 
place. These reductions are less than the reductions that have 
been made in other areas of government. The social programs 
will have more room in a government which is more rationalized 
and where the fiscal part of the government is more organized.
<P>
	The consolidation of the Canada assistance plan and the 
established program finance transfers into a uniformed block 
transfer to the provinces follow in the spirit of the committee's 
reports which recommended that the Canada assistance plan be 
made into a block transfer in order to give the provinces more 
flexibility and in order to design reformed and renewed ways of 
helping people who are on social assistance provide basic 
supports for their families, also to enhance their access to the 
job market.
<P>
	In addition to that the committee also recommended that there 
be an enhanced effort toward working with the provinces to 
enhance the child tax credit, working income supplement and 
other measures that would be made in order to work together to 
provide more assistance to poor families with children.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition, the redesign of the unemployment insurance 
program announced with this budget is also something that is 
absolutely necessary. Our committee recommends ways in 
which the unemployment insurance program can be redesigned 
and rebuilt in order to foster employability, in order to promote 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10219"> 10219 </A></B>
<P>
lifelong learning, in order to allow Canadians to have access to 
the supports they need to get the jobs of the future.
<P>
	As an Atlantic Canadian, particularly one who comes from a 
region where unemployment insurance and other social 
programs are a very important part and preoccupation, I know 
they realize there must be changes to this program in order to 
help Canadians get into the workforce and to help our people 
relinquish their dependence that has grown on unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	If we as Atlantic Canadians can participate in a renewed 
unemployment insurance system or an employment insurance 
system, which is really what it is all about, we could help to 
create a better foundation for our economy in Atlantic Canada, 
creating the kinds of jobs we need to have in order to have a 
stable future there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I too was on the tour with the committee on social 
program reform with the hon. member for Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso. There are some things he has not said, 
because what everyone talked to us about, everywhere, and the 
budget makes no mention of, is the matter of job creation.
<P>
	One of the questions I would like to ask him is why the budget 
contains no objectives for job creation. There are criteria for the 
deficit. They decided that, to control the deficit, it had to be 
brought down to 3 per cent of the GDP. Why did the government 
not set objectives for itself in terms of job creation? There is 
nothing about that anywhere in the budget.
<P>
	At the same time, we are told that banks are going to be taxed 
in the amount of $100 million. When, however, during the tour 
of the committee on social program reform, did people tell us 
that another $700 million should be cut from the unemployment 
insurance program? As for the block transfer, yes, a possible 
block transfer for social programs was recommended, but did 
the committee recommend cutting $7 billion in this area in the 
next two years? There is a difference between a block transfer 
and a transfer after cuts are made. There is a significant 
difference between the two, which I consider important.
<P>
	I have another question and, in this regard, I can sympathize 
with the issue raised by the Conservative member who spoke 
earlier about transportation subsidies and the people who live in 
the east. It is true that they said: ``They want to get us off 
unemployment insurance''. Everyone in Canada knows that 
nobody goes on unemployment insurance for the fun of it. They 
are on it because of the way the economy is. At the same time, 
however, they said: ``Give us a period of transition to do it''.
<P>
	Why did the government, in its transportation assistance 
program for the Atlantic region, not follow the 
recommendations made by the industry, by the people locally 
and by the economic development officers and why was there 
not a gradual decrease in these types of taxes, so that, in three or 
five years, a new economic  situation could be achieved, over 
which the people in the community would have total control?
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague for his 
questions.
<P>
	Firstly, many jobs have in fact been created since the 
government has been in office, more than 433,000 jobs have 
been created. These jobs were created thanks to the confidence 
the government has inspired across Canada, especially in the 
private sector, and the budget brought down by the finance 
minister on Monday evening will increase the confidence felt by 
the private sector, the business community, because the 
government is taking the necessary measures to tackle Canada's 
deficit directly, thereby creating jobs and lowering Canada's 
unemployment rate.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The targets the government has set its sights on are necessary 
to stabilize public finances and create jobs. We can see the 
effects already in the falling unemployment rate. Our program's 
objective is to create jobs.
<P>
	Among the reforms suggested, we will have the opportunity to 
work on those relating to unemployment insurance. The new 
Canadian social transfer will allow the government of Canada, 
in conjunction with the provinces, to create a new social security 
net with a greater emphasis on employability.
<P>
	To repeat, we are laying the foundations necessary for a strong 
Canadian economy which will result in new jobs being created 
throughout the country.
<P>
	That is the government's strategy. We have forged ahead with 
it, it is working and it will continue to work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I listened to the various Liberal members who 
have spoken about this marvellous budget of theirs today only 
one thought comes to my mind, they do not understand 
fundamental arithmetic.
<P>
	The Canadian people, the taxpayers, who have been funding 
all these programs that previous governments have put in based 
on election promises and credit card funding, have been saying 
that overspending has to stop. They want to see a balanced 
budget down the road. They want to see some tax relief down the 
road.
<P>
	This red ink budget that the Liberals have delivered by 1997 
will add another $100 billion to the debt and will increase the 
interest payments on that debt to some $51 billion to $52 billion. 
Can they not get it straight? It is the mountainous debt and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10220"> 10220 </A></B>
<P>
mountainous interest payments on that debt that are ripping the 
heart out of the social safety net of the country.
<P>
	It is not enough today to nibble at the edges of overspending. 
We need a positive, progressive plan to decrease the deficit to a 
zero budget. That is what the Canadian people want. They will 
not get it from the government. It has not been listening to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I beg to differ with the hon. member. We cannot start 
eliminating the debt until we start to get the deficit down. That is 
what the government is doing.
<P>
	Does the hon. member actually believe that by slashing social 
programs in one fell swoop the deficit will be eliminated faster?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we in the House should spare a moment of sympathy for the 
Canadians who, for unknown reasons, are watching the debate 
on television. We have members opposite saying that it is a 
wonderful budget, a visionary and perfect budget for the 
country. Then we have members of our party who are responding 
to the budget with grave concern and alarm. It is only fair for 
Canadians to know why there are real concerns about the budget.
<P>
	It is true that the budget reduces the deficit. Unfortunately the 
budget and the so-called rolling targets that it contains 
substantially increase the interest burden. That is the real threat 
to social programs.
<P>
	I do not think the finance minister should get a lot of credit for 
reducing the deficit. As a matter of fact, he had absolutely no 
choice. Not only are Canadians telling their political leaders that 
their number one concern is the debt and deficit, our creditors 
have been sending us strong, unmistakable messages that we had 
better get our fiscal act together. According to the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I> Canada ``has now become an honorary member of the 
third world in the unmanageability of its debt problem''.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The debt is about $550 billion. By the time the government is 
finished with us it will be $650 billion. Where is a country like 
Canada going to be with that kind of debt loading down its future 
and its young people? Moody's has threatened to remove our 
coveted AAA bond rating. International lenders everywhere 
want assurance from the government that a $25 billion deficit is 
just an interim goal. In fact, the budget sets $25 billion as the 
goal. Then there is some very nice talk about good intentions 
down the road. The good intentions of the Liberals for the last 30 
years have paved a lot of roads and they all lead down into the 
debt hole.
<P>
	Our real concern, which Canadians share, is that the budget 
will have a profound effect on the future of social security. 
Contrary to popular belief, Reformers are going to get old. Some 
of us are quite close to that goal. Reformers get sick. Reformers 
have disasters strike them. Reformers become unemployed. We 
are very concerned about the security of every single Canadian. 
That is why we brought in a plan to stop the horrible interest 
drain on the social security resources.
<P>
	The finance minister's refusal to deal with the financial mess 
that is being caused to social programs by ever-burgeoning 
interest payments is a missed opportunity for which all 
Canadians will pay a heavy price. Much of our social program 
spending is funded and has been funded for years on borrowed 
money. Every year we borrow money, and that has been every 
single year, unbelievably, for the last 25 or more years. We 
increase the size of our interest obligation.
<P>
	Every increase in the amount we are forced to pay in interest 
decreases the amount we have left to fund the programs we offer 
to Canadians. The only hope we have to break this vicious cycle 
of higher interest payments and less cash for our programs is to 
quit borrowing. That is exactly what Reformers have proposed; 
to quite borrowing as fast as possible, in fact by the end of three 
years.
<P>
	In order to quit borrowing, social program spending has to be 
reduced. That is because fully two-thirds of non-interest 
spending by the federal government is on the social side. Even if 
we virtually wiped out every other program and function of 
government, we would still barely balance the books.
<P>
	Of course many essential government programs cannot be 
eliminated. Although there is some fat in other non-social 
spending government programs-and the taxpayers' budget 
starts by cutting government operations by a full 25 per cent for 
a $10 billion savings-simple arithmetic dictates that some 
spending reductions must take place on the social side.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, even our human resources development 
minister has figured that out. On page 8 of his discussion paper, 
which as we know went nowhere, it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the interest costs on that debt are choking governments' ability to deliver 
services that the public needs and depends on-The larger the debt gets, the bigger 
the interest costs and the smaller the budget for services-The status quo is not an 
option.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the government's own minister. We have to ask 
ourselves why is status quo social spending precisely what the 
finance minister brags he has given us in the budget when 
another minister is saying that the status quo is not an option? 
The clue is in the rhetoric with which he has chosen to surround 
this sensitive issue.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Instead of providing a plan, the finance minister, like the 
human resources development minister, has again chosen to 
delay addressing Canada's ailing social programs, letting the 
cancer spread, letting the patient get sicker and sicker. Why? 
Because the Liberal government does not have the political guts 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10221"> 10221 </A></B>
<P>
and fortitude to do the job, to get social spending under control 
so that we can preserve social programs for the future.
<P>
	The Liberal government, knowing full well that the future 
security of Canadian citizens is in peril, lacks the political 
fortitude to take bold and decisive steps to effectively address 
the issue. Even worse, not only are Liberals afraid to deal with 
the problems in this critical area, they work hard to make 
Canadians afraid to have it dealt with at all.
<P>
	How do they do this? By telling Canadians again and again 
that any plan to safeguard the ability to provide long term 
security by some reductions in social spending today is too 
cruel, too heartless, too harmful even to consider. Anyone 
suggesting such a course of action is immediately set upon and 
labelled as lacking in compassion and uncaring about the poor 
and needy.
<P>
	Clearly Liberals cannot honestly believe this to be true 
because they are saying, and I quote again from the human 
resources development minister's discussion paper: ``The 
interest costs on the debt are choking government's ability to 
deliver services that the public needs and depends on''. They 
know this. One can only conclude that the government is 
anxious to make a virtue out of what can only be termed a 
shameful failure to get a grip on its deficit spending habits.
<P>
	We are treated to loud protests by members opposite. In fact, 
they can be heard even as I speak, in the background nattering on 
and on. Any suggestion of spending reductions on the social 
side, even though they clearly know that government must 
reduce its expenditures in all areas if we are to have any hope of 
curbing the interest haemorrhage from the national treasury, is 
cloaked in inaction with a lot of talk about their commitment to 
compassion, fairness and equity. However, Canadians are 
beginning to see through all this nice talk to the lack of 
substance within.
<P>
	Nowhere is this made more clear than in last week's unveiling 
of the Liberal so-called reform of MP pensions. Canadians were 
treated to the unseemly spectacle of government ministers flatly 
refusing to lose a nickel of their incredibly rich pension 
benefits.
<P>
	This year the Canadian government paid $42 billion in 
interest. Just think for a moment what we could have done with 
$42 billion to spend on the citizens of our country. It could have 
doubled all guaranteed income supplement payments to needy 
seniors. It could have cut income tax by 20 per cent. It could 
have given free tuition to 100,000 students. It could have 
provided $10,000 to 100,000 newly married couples for 
mortgage down payments. In addition, it could have totally 
eliminated the GST, something the Liberals promised to do. To 
put the icing on the cake, it would have paid to build a $500 
million skydome in every province, including P.E.I.
<P>
	We did not have that $42 billion because we had to pay it to the 
Liberal interest debt they have built up.
<P>
	The real threat to social spending is Liberal borrowing and 
deficit. It is not changing in this budget. If not now, when? 
Canadians and their children will remember the 1995 federal 
budget as the one which could have and should have but failed to 
provide a plan to ensure personal security in the years ahead. 
That it failed to do so will be seen as one of the greatest tragedies 
of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened to my colleague's comments. What she seems to 
ignore in her comments is the reaction from all the financial 
experts, both at home and abroad.
<P>
	Almost universally the reaction to this budget from everyone 
except members of the Reform Party is very positive. In fact, in 
many glowing terms we hear how the finance minister has 
turned the corner on this country's debt and deficit problem. Yet 
the member says there should be no credit for the finance 
minister. I would remind the hon. member that for nine years the 
previous government was not able to meet its targets, yet this 
finance minister has done so two years in a row.
<P>
	Quite frankly a misstatement was made that $25 billion is the 
ultimate goal of the finance minister. It is not even fair to say 
that on the floor of this House. The minister has been quoted 
publicly many times as stating that the ultimate goal is the total 
elimination of the deficit and debt. That is the ultimate goal. The 
minister has made that eminently clear. The research by the 
Reform Party seems to be awfully selective on these points.
<P>
	Now to my question for the Reform Party member and the 
Reform members heckling as I speak. If there is such concern 
and compassion in the Reform Party for this country's social 
security system, why did the blue budget plan, the so-called 
taxpayers' budget of the Reform Party-if ever there was a 
misnomer that is one-slash so severely the seniors' pension 
plan? How can that be offered as some concern for the citizens of 
this country?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the points raised by 
my hon. friend opposite because they are important issues to 
address. They are ones that hon. members opposite are always 
using to justify their position. It is important that Canadians 
know it does not do that.
<P>
	First of all, the reaction of the financial markets was positive. 
It is kind of sad, is it not, that financial markets are so used to 
governments that do not do anything that there is great relief 
when there are any cuts in our borrowing.
<P>
	Not only that, my friends who work in the financial industry 
tell me that financial markets discount government actions. 
They are way ahead of government. They are weeks ahead of 
government and they discounted this budget long ago. They did 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10222"> 10222 </A></B>
<P>
not do it the day after; they did it weeks before. That is how 
financial  markets work. Those familiar with financial markets 
know that.
<P>
	The hon. member brags that the government has reached its 
targets although previous governments have not. If you make 
your targets low, of course you will reach them. It is like a 
cigarette smoker who cuts back from two packs a day to a pack 
and a half and then says: ``I am quitting smoking''. He has a long 
way to go and so does this budget.
<P>
	There is no plan to get to zero deficit in this budget. There is 
nice talk by the finance minister on the side that of course, yes, 
this is the ultimate goal. If it is a goal, there should be a plan. 
Instead, the government always refers to its red book target of a 
$25 billion dollar deficit which is huge.
<P>
	Our plan is to cut social spending by $15 billion for the simple 
reason that if you do that, you get to zero borrowing. If you get to 
zero borrowing, the interest levels off. The interest gets flat. If 
you do not cut your borrowing, then the interest keeps rising. 
Once the interest levels off, you know you have the rest of your 
money to work with. However, if the interest keeps going up, 
then you have less and less money to work with every single 
year.
<P>
	That is exactly what is going to happen under this plan. If 
members opposite think that cutting spending now to get to a 
zero deficit is bad, just wait until they see the cuts that will have 
to be made when our interest gets to $50 billion, $55 billion, $60 
billion because this government will not take that kind of action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on the budget. It is a budget 
that in the opinion of those who get past the initial media 
kowtowing, the interest group moaning and the Liberal back 
slapping, is dishonest. It is overrated. It is underachieving and 
hypocritical. It fails to attack the efficiency and the internal 
wastefulness of the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget deserves no praise. It lacks will. It lacks 
solutions. It is not an answer. It is only prolonging the inevitable 
demise of our social programs, our financial security and our 
way of life, including that of our children.
<P>
	What the finance minister has done is altogether typically 
Liberal. He has made some token reductions which he thinks 
will placate voters. He has increased taxes in such a way that 
taxpayers will not know they are being hit hard. Furthermore, he 
has done some things that, had they been done by any other party 
with the Liberals in opposition, would have caused the Liberals 
to explode in outrage and violent criticism. That is the hypocrisy 
of this budget.
<P>
	The Reform Party's taxpayers' budget laid out a series of 
reasonable, manageable cuts to transfers and established 
programs financing, cuts that would ensure  long term health 
and the continuation of these programs. The Liberals assailed 
us, as the hon. member is doing right now. They accused us of 
being heartless, of being uncaring, of bashing the poor. What is 
the Liberal alternative to this imagined Reform Party 
heartlessness?
<P>
	The Liberals will double the fees of refugee claimants. That is 
really something. That is without a doubt the most blatant 
hypocrisy I have ever seen from this government or that party. 
They have done nothing in any promise for the future.
<P>
	Look at what is going on within the department of 
immigration. Look at those increased fees that are coming. For a 
moment, look at the increased fees and the recipients of those 
fees, the immigration department. If you take an honest look, 
you will come away with a very different impression about the 
seriousness of this government, the willingness of this 
government and the party across the aisle to make real change. 
You will come away with a very different impression of the will 
of that party and the intestinal fortitude of the finance minister 
and especially the immigration minister.
<P>
	There are two reasons the finance minister together with the 
immigration minister have decided to increase fees. One is 
stated and the other is not.
<P>
	The stated reason is to raise revenue to offset the cuts. In other 
words, they want to bring more money into the coffers. Charge a 
little more up front and recover more of the costs of processing 
and resettlement, as the minister points out. Fair enough. Why 
should those who apply for immigrant status not pay their way? 
We are not objecting to that.
<P>
	There is no good reason for the taxpayer to subsidize the 
processing of immigrant applications. Remember that if any 
other party had done this, the Liberals would have fallen all over 
themselves moaning about taxing the poor, charging more to 
those who are unable to pay.
<P>
	The other reason for almost doubling the fees, the unstated 
reason that observers from both sides of the immigration debate 
recognize, is to quietly cull a certain percentage of the 
applicants for immigration. Changing the immigrant mix is a 
good idea certainly. Both the C.D. Howe Institute and the Fraser 
Institute agree with the Reform Party that we need to do that. 
However, doing it this way is cowardly and devious on the part 
of the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Because you are not stating the reasons.
<P>
	The immigration minister has had all sorts of opportunities to 
make changes to immigration that make sense and that are 
honest but he will not do it. He has had every opportunity to save 
the Canadian taxpayers a huge amount of money through 
immigration reform. He did not do it. He would not. He does not 
have what it takes. If the minister wanted to save money for the 
taxpayer, he would have saved literally hundreds of  millions of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10223"> 10223 </A></B>
<P>
dollars by taking some advice from the Reform Party on refugee 
determination in Canada.
<P>
	A month ago, we released our proactive proposals for refugee 
determination. Those proposals, if enacted, would ensure that 
the refugee system was more fair to genuine refugees. That was 
our first goal. The proposal would have ensured that the system 
was more fair to the taxpayer by cutting back on legal aid and 
social services for people who had been refused as refugees and 
were appealing.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	We proposed that the Immigration and Refugee Board, that 
$80 million a year hotbed of patronage, pork and foolish 
decision making be abolished. We proposed that a refugee 
determination system, which presently costs $1 billion or more 
a year to determine a handful of claims, be fundamentally 
restructured to reduce the number of bogus claims. Accept more 
genuine refugees from abroad. Doing so would have saved the 
taxpayers millions of dollars, but the minister would not hear of 
it.
<P>
	Here is a short list of some other costs the immigration 
minister has been afraid to deal with. The total cost of the 
department has gone up from $581 million to $592 million. Do 
you call that cost cutting? The corporate service budget has 
increased from $33 million to an unbelievable $78 million. Is 
that the minister's idea of government efficiency, to double the 
budget in one year?
<P>
	The cost of failed sponsorship is $700 million. Welfare for 
refugees as estimated in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> a few days ago is 
$600 million. Teaching English or French and other settlement 
services for new immigrants costs $450 million. Quebec's gold 
plated immigration settlement program costs $90 million. No 
adjustments are made there at all, one year after another.
<P>
	On top of all that the justice department will spend an 
additional $11.6 million on immigration and refugee cases. The 
Federal Court will spend an additional $11.9 million on 
handling refugee cases. The RCMP will have to allocate an 
additional $2.3 million to clean up the messes made by lousy 
immigration policies. There is $60 million in legal aid.
<P>
	Of course, there was last year's stupid expenditures: $2,000 
for a pizza party hosted by the minister; $2,000 for bookmarks 
with the minister's photo on them; $100,000 for office furniture 
for one member in the IRB; another $100,000 for a golden 
handshake to get rid of that member.
<P>
	In light of all of these numbers, the increased user fees are just 
a drop in the bucket. Until this government and this immigration 
minister come to terms with the fact that Canada's immigration 
and refugee programs are so lax, so broad, so inefficient and so 
ridiculously generous as to cost Canadians up to $3 billion a 
year to accept and settle refugees and immigrants, we are just 
wasting time.
<P>
	The government is tilting at windmills. If this government 
really wants to fix the immigration budget it should not jack up 
fees before it gets on top of the real problem: Liberal 
immigration policy. That is the problem.
<P>
	I say to the people of Canada, to the media, to interested 
observers of Canada's immigration system around the world, 
that before they congratulate the finance minister and the 
immigration minister for taking tough action to fix a tough 
problem, before this back slapping gets too intense, tell me what 
is wrong with this picture.
<P>
	A refugee claimant has just been paid $1,000. Now he sits 
before an $85,000 a year patronage appointee. Each hour of 
hearing and preparation time is being run up as a profit by his 
legal aid attorney. His acceptance is virtually guaranteed since 
the IRB is little more than an $80 million a year rubber stamp. If 
he is sick, there are no worries, he has a health card.
<P>
	In the extremely unlikely event that he is found not to be a 
refugee, there are no worries. He will just ring up a few more 
hours for his legal aid attorney, appeal to the taxpayer funded 
courts, get another hearing before another $85,000 a year IRB 
member. After this charade has been carried on for three years, 
the minister gives him an automatic amnesty. It is not a bad deal 
for $975. Most of us would not even get inside the courtroom 
door for $975. The refugee claimant and his lawyer can tie up 
our courts for three years.
<P>
	This is no exaggeration. Members may not like the 
illustration. They do not like it because they know it is true. The 
most tragic aspect of that scenario is that all the time this 
charade is being played out at the taxpayers' expense, the UN 
tells us that the most genuine refugees from overseas are being 
systematically ignored by countries like Canada. Refugees we 
could process more easily and far more cheaply are being 
ignored. These are genuine refugees.
<P>
	People may start realizing now how much of an opportunity 
there was in 1995 to really rethink government and make 
fundamental changes. They will realize what a golden 
opportunity there was to make things work better. Then they will 
wake up to what was not done and they will be sorely 
disappointed.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 10, I asked the Minister of Justice if he 
would ban two new hyper-destructive handgun bullets 
developed in the United States. One of these bullets was 
designed to do maximum damage to human tissue, while the 
second could penetrate body armour. We are told this rhino 
ammunition, as it is called, is designed to break into thousands 
of razor-like fragments when it hits flesh. The creator of these 
bullets stated that: ``These fragments become lethal shrapnel as 
they are hurled into vital organs, lungs, circulatory system 
components, the heart and other tissues. The wound channel 
becomes catastrophic and death is nearly instantaneous''.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I was pleased with the answer given to me by the Minister of 
Justice when he told the House that these two new types of 
ammunition had been banned in Canada. However this incident 
reminded us that if we are serious about gun control, we must 
also control ammunition. Without ammunition, you cannot do 
too much damage with guns.
<P>
	It is especially important when you consider that 65,000 guns 
have been lost or stolen since 1974. The RCMP report that about 
3,000 are lost or stolen each year. If you cannot get the 
ammunition with which to use a stolen gun, then you might be 
preventing a crime from taking place. That is why it is so 
important to control ammunition.
<P>
	I would like to ask the government tonight whether in the new 
legislation which is before the House-I have examined the said 
legislation-it is correct that in order to buy ammunition in the 
future, a person will require a firearms possession certificate or 
a firearms registration certificate.
<P>
	I ask this because in some of the publicity material 
accompanying the bill, there was a suggestion that a person 
might be able to buy ammunition simply with a driver's licence. 
I could not accept that but since it will be necessary to obtain a 
firearms possession certificate or require one to own, use or 
purchase a gun then I do not see why it could not be presented as 
well when purchasing ammunition.
<P>
	I would like to have some clarification on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last December newspapers reported that a United 
States company had produced two highly destructive bullets; the 
black rhino, a plastic bullet allegedly capable of piercing 
armour and the rhino-ammo, a highly fragmenting bullet 
designed to cause maximum damage to human tissue.
<P>
	Government officials have been in contact with U.S. officials 
and in fact the black rhino does not exist and technical experts 
highly doubt that an armour piercing plastic bullet could be 
produced.
<P>
	As regards the rhino ammo bullets, the potential 
destructiveness was highly inflated and in fact they resemble 
hollow point bullets currently available in the United States 
markets and under limited conditions in Canada.
<P>
	Armour piercing and exploding or incendiary cartridges are 
now prohibited in Canada and have been since October 1, 1992 
under prohibition order number 10. The possession, sale or 
import of such ammunition is subject to Criminal Code 
penalties of up to 10 years.
<P>
	I want to particularly address the question of the hon. member 
with respect to how ammunition is to be purchased. To purchase 
ammunition, it will be required to have the registration 
certificate once the registration certificate period of five years 
ending December 31, 2003 has elapsed.
<P>
	Until then everybody may not have a registration certificate. 
In the interim, where possible it will be the requirement to 
provide another certificate, a driver's licence or perhaps a 
firearms acquisition certificate. This is yet to be determined 
exactly but there will be requirements.
<P>
	This will be brought forward and stipulated in the regulations.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOURISM">TOURISM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to expand on my question of February 
24 to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry on 
the matter of tourism.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10226"> 10226 </A></B>
<P>
	Tourism plays a major role in the lives of my constituents 
on the south shore of Nova Scotia. It is important that tourism 
continue to be promoted as it is serving to revitalize 
communities that have been devastated by the downturn in the 
fishery.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	In the South Shore tourism generates $100 million annually 
while providing employment for thousands of people. It is an 
industry that can and will play a leading role in the economic 
recovery of my area.
<P>
	For instance, in 1994 the South Shore experienced a 20 per 
cent increase in room sales. This was the largest percentage 
increase in Nova Scotia. More than 127,000 people signed guest 
books at the South Shore tourist bureaus. This represented an 
increase of 19 per cent over 1993. The South Shore is popular 
but it has potential to be even more so. I say this because 30 per 
cent of visitors were from inside the province of Nova Scotia, 29 
per cent were from other parts of Canada, 28 per cent were from 
the United States and 5 per cent were international visitors.
<P>
	There is so much to see and do along the South Shore. I am 
partial to the charms of Chester, having chosen to settle down 
there over 20 years ago. There is colourful Lunenburg, home of 
the <I>Bluenose</I> and the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic currently 
seeking a designation of world heritage status. There is Oak 
Island with its hidden treasure which is celebrating its 200th 
anniversary this year.
<P>
	In Queens county there are spectacular white sandy beaches 
and several ecotourism sites, including the Keji seaside adjunct 
and the bird sanctuary in Port Joli. These treasures have been 
left largely untouched for the public to enjoy. At the western end 
of my riding is Shelburne with its historic waterfront which is 
gaining a good reputation as a destination for movie makers.
<P>
	As a representative for an area like the South Shore, I am sure 
members can understand that I was pleased to hear the Prime 
Minister announce last fall that he had accepted the 
recommendations made by his special advisor on tourism. The 
creation of the Canadian tourism committee and the allocation 
of base funding totalling $50 million certainly has the potential 
to allow for effective marketing of Canada at home and abroad. I 
do, however, have some concerns about how this is all going to 
work.
<P>
	First, in addition to the very successful South Shore Tourism 
Association, there are many local tourism committees that have 
been established to formulate strategies to increase the amount 
of tourism traffic in their respective areas. I am constantly being 
asked if and how they can access this tourism promotion money. 
I am having difficulty answering these questions because that 
has never been made clear. Media reports make it sound like 
there is a pot of money for these people to access. Yet the 
material I have received is vague on how the money will be 
allocated.
<P>
	Second, I would be interested to know how the Canadian 
tourism commission will benefit rural areas like mine when to 
date efforts seem to be rather metro driven. Will the interests of 
small businesses, which comprise a large proportion of the 
tourism industry, be appropriately represented?
<P>
	Finally, I am concerned about an overlap of effort. The 
Canadian tourism commission seems to be just a larger scale 
version of the Atlantic Canada tourism partnership which was 
established in late 1993. I would hope that these groups will be 
working together rather than at cross purposes.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to reiterate that I support the intent 
behind the establishment of this commission. Because I have 
seen the positive benefits that tourism can have in an area, I want 
to see Canada eliminate its tourism deficit. However, first I want 
specifics on how this will be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for South Shore for his question and also his keen 
interest in a sector of our economy that has been sadly neglected 
over the last 10 to 15 years.
<P>
	The tourism industry is a sector of our economy which, after 
automotive, employs more Canadians than any other sector. 
This government has made a serious commitment to not only 
maintaining but virtually quadrupling the tourism budget.
<P>
	We did not just quadruple the budget, we also gave guidelines 
and said to the Canadian tourism commission that we wanted 
this money to be levered, joint ventured. In other words, it is not 
Industry Canada and the tourism team going out and doing work 
on their own. It is this commission which is made up of private 
sector experts from the tourism industry from all over Canada. 
The Minister of Industry appointed these people on February 1.
<P>
	I have to say to the member for South Shore that this is a new 
commission and no doubt there will be some glitches until we 
get it operating perfectly. If the member, in his community of 
South Shore, is having difficulty in partnering or accessing his 
tourism operators with the commission, I would invite him to 
come to the House of Commons industry committee. About two 
weeks from now the executive of the Canadian Tourism 
Commission will appear before the committee. We will deal 
with the overall plan and objectives but, more important, we will 
deal with the specific concerns and the specific challenges the 
member for South Shore raised this evening.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	I do not want to suggest that at the moment the commission 
has all of the answers. It is a new commission. It is a new 
experiment where we are partnering with the private sector.
<P>
	However I invite the member to the committee. His specific 
concerns will be addressed. There is great hope for this sector 
putting Canadians back to work, which is the number one 
responsibility of the government.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise now at the end of the day to point out that, in my question of 
February 28, I spoke of the gross injustice in the budget which 
the Minister of Finance brought down this Monday.
<P>
	To clearly define this injustice, I would like to repeat part of 
the question I put to the Hon. Minister of Finance this week. My 
question was for the finance minister and was more or less as 
follows: Yesterday, the finance minister announced that grain 
transportation subsidies would be eliminated, adding that a 
generous compensation of close to $3 billion, which includes 
direct subsidies, would be given to western producers.
<P>
	I have done some research since then and have in fact found 
that grain producers in the west, and only in the west, would be 
offered between $15 and $18 per acre, or an average of some 
$15,000 to $18,000 per grain producer.
<P>
	Of course, the Crow rate was intended for grain transportation 
from point A to point B, with point B located near the ocean, 
most often in Vancouver. Looking again at WGTA issue, we 
found that many producers stockpiled their grain in railway 
hopper cars. The railway cars went to Thunder Bay to be eligible 
for the subsidy before returning to Vancouver. This was costly to 
the government.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the unjust and unfair way that 
farmers in the east of the country have been treated. On the one 
hand, the government cuts $560 million in subsidies to farmers 
in the west and, to clear its conscience, offers them a 
compensation package of close to $3 billion to help them 
diversify their crops; on the other hand, in the same budget, it 
trims industrial milk subsidies by 30 per cent.
<P>
	I did my math and realized that a 30 per cent cut will result in 
losses. As we all well know, Quebec and Ontario produce 80 per 
cent of Canada's industrial milk and the cut will result in losses 
of anywhere from three to five thousand dollars. What 
compensation will farmers in the east get from the Liberal 
government? None.
<P>
	This inequity in the budget is noteworthy, and I expect an 
explanation now and not a canned response.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to comment on the question of the member for 
Frontenac.
<P>
	Yes, the annual $560 million western grain transportation 
subsidy is being completely eliminated on August 1. However I 
point out to the hon. member-and I know he realizes it-that 
the dairy subsidy is only being reduced by 15 per cent this year 
and 15 per cent next year. As of August 1, 85 per cent of that 
support will still be there.
<P>
	Eliminating the so-called Crow subsidy addresses a 
longstanding equity concern that has been raised by eastern 
farmers. The adjustment package reflects the potential impact of 
eliminating a 96-year old commitment to the western grain 
sector.
<P>
	In addition to the $1.6 billion, a multi-year adjustment 
package of $300 million is being put in place to facilitate the 
transition to a more efficient transportation system. The amount 
is not excessive. It is necessary to help grain producers adapt to 
the change and to compete effectively in international markets 
against subsidized foreign competition.
<P>
	It is important to note the dairy industry does not face 
international competition because of supply management for 90 
per cent of its production. Equally important, this government 
package of reforms to grain transportation is consistent with the 
position set out by the Quebec coalition on the WGTA.
<P>
	The package of reforms is fair and balanced with respect to 
the different situations in different regions and different sectors. 
Everyone has done his or her share in contributing to deficit 
reduction. The government does not have a double standard as 
the hon. member for Frontenac has suggested. It is not true.
<P>
	Rather, through the budget we offered all Canadians a single 
standard to strive for that will ensure future growth of the 
agriculture sector and maintain our competitiveness on the 
global field.
