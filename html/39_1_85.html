      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion the Bloc Québécois is putting before the House today will enable parliamentarians to recognize that Quebeckers form a nation. It is the recognition of a simple fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We formulated this motion in such a way as to make it acceptable to everyone. We thus did not link the recognition of the Quebec nation to any other consideration. No condition is attached to this recognition. We also did not formulate the motion in such a way as to permit its interpretation to mean recognition of a sovereign nation, which Quebec is not—at least not yet. We are therefore presenting a motion respectful of one and all, without making recognition of the Quebec nation subject to partisan conditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister, did the exact opposite. He introduced a motion recognizing the Quebec nation while imposing a condition—a partisan condition. That is absurd. It is clear that the Prime Minister is simply trying to save face. The only respectful approach to take towards Quebeckers is to recognize them for what they are—a nation that does not stop being one when it is no longer part of Canada—clearly, an unconditional nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not up to the Prime Minister to decide what option Quebeckers will choose. It is not up to one particular party to decide how Quebeckers will choose. The future of Quebec belongs to Quebeckers—period. Quebeckers will decide their own future under the standing orders of the National Assembly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat. Quebeckers form a nation, not on the condition of their remaining in a supposedly united Canada. They constitute a nation, not on the condition of their forming a country. Those are political options. They are both respectable, because they are both democratic. In neither instance can the existence of the nation of Quebec be predicated on a particular action or option.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a nation because we are who we are, whatever future Quebec chooses. The recognition of Quebec as a nation by the House of Commons is more than symbolic, and certainly above partisan politics. For Quebec, there is no other issue more fundamental than this. It is also a fundamental issue for Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proof of this lies in the very debate taking place here today and across the country, both in Quebec and in Canada, and in the media. It is an issue which is taking up a great deal of energy. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years, federally elected representatives have wanted to avoid this thorny issue and sweep it under the carpet. Yet the issue resurfaced recently with the adoption of a related motion by the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party of Canada. It also came up following the adoption of an NDP declaration at its convention in September in Quebec City, and yet again following the Bloc’s motion and yesterday’s motion by the Prime Minister. We cannot ignore this issue when so many people are talking about it, and this is to be expected. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many commentators and federally elected representatives have dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge this evidence that Quebeckers form a nation. Many surveys have found that a large majority of Canadians are not interested in officially recognizing that Quebeckers form a nation, neither better nor worse than Canada, but certainly different. This refusal to recognize Quebec for what it is is why Quebec is not a signatory to the Constitution. This refusal to recognize Quebec as a nation is also why Quebec is considered a province, no different than the rest and not as the place that is home to a nation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By adding his coda to the Bloc Québécois motion, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister </A> is trying, clumsily as he put it, to delude Canadians. In the Quebec National Assembly, sovereignists and federalists alike agree that Quebeckers form a nation. The motion adopted by the National Assembly in 2003 is respectful of the people of Quebec. I will read it to you. It says, “That the National Assembly reaffirm that the people of Quebec form a nation”. This motion was adopted unanimously, by both sovereignists and federalists. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion does not subject our identity to one political option or another. If the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is acting in good faith when he says he recognizes Quebec as a nation, he will support and vote for the Bloc Québécois motion. If he does not, everyone will know that the Prime Minister sees Quebec as a nation subject to Canada’s rule. Everyone will know that his true interest lies in political sparring. If he votes against this motion, which, I would like to remind you, is identical in every respect to the one adopted by the National Assembly, then it is because he does not believe that the Quebec nation is free to decide its own future. If this is the case, then the statement the Prime Minister made yesterday is just empty talk. I hope this is not the case. I hope he will have the courage to openly recognize Quebec as a nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our intention with this motion is to stop elected representatives from sweeping the matter under the carpet and to have them take a stand on this fundamental issue. There is no question of setting conditions on this recognition. It is not a matter of saying that we recognize the Quebec nation as long as Quebec remains in Canada, or of saying that Quebec forms a nation only if it becomes a sovereign country. We are what we are, period. That is all. And that is the question that is being asked. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that, by introducing this motion, the Bloc Québecois has forced the issue and is making us all look in the mirror. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, there was a range of viewpoints in the Canadian media. Some agreed with the Prime Minister’s position. Others are deeply dismayed and saying it is not possible to recognize the Quebec nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the members of this House to see this through to the logical conclusion and to free themselves from those psychological barriers that prevent them from recognizing the Quebec nation, simply, without any second thoughts, without any ulterior motives and especially without petty partisanship. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge Quebeckers to pay close attention to the debate and take note of how each member of this House votes. </div>

It says what it says. It says what the members of Quebec's National Assembly, federalists as well as sovereignists, have already said unanimously. It speaks of a fact that no one should contest or think of contesting, and says it so clearly that in my view there is no room for interpretation or ill-conceived amendments involving any kind of conditions. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebeckers are rather surprised this morning to see that, in this House, the Conservative government and some members from Quebec did not spontaneously agree to recognize that Quebec and Quebeckers form a nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> tried yesterday to introduce his own motion, bringing in partisan political considerations, referring to the federalism option and the sovereignty option, saying that it means inside a united Canada. The government's behaviour in this matter is so astonishing that I would like to take the liberty of explaining something to you. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the second-longest-serving House leader in the history of Canada's Parliament. Usually when there is a minister’s statement, the government sends it to the opposition. The reason for this is easy to understand: it enables the opposition parties to react to a statement made in the House. Every time a minister has made a statement in this House, the content has been transmitted in advance, whether several hours, 15 minutes, or even just 10 or 12 minutes in advance. But yesterday, something exceptional happened in this House and I would like to raise it in today’s debate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past 13 years, the government has always given the opposition a copy of statements by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. For probably the first time in history, that copy was a fake, a statement that did not contain the most important element in the Prime Minister’s remarks, about which all the media in Canada are talking today, in other words, his motion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Ministe</A>r has insulted not only the Bloc Québécois and the other parties in this House, but all Quebeckers. The people of Quebec are humiliated. I see that the Minister of Transport, a Quebec member, seems to find it funny that his Prime Minister and his government deceived the entire population of Quebec, by deceiving their representatives with a sneaky little trick. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time in this House, because the matter at issue was Quebec and the Quebec nation, the government sent a truncated and misleading statement that did not contain the essence of what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> was going to state in the House. I leave it to Quebeckers to judge this government’s tactics. Not so long ago, we had the “night of the long knives”, when Quebec was betrayed during the constitutional discussions. We have just experienced a black afternoon, an afternoon where the representatives of Quebec and the people of Quebec were deliberately deceived by the Prime Minister of Canada, whom I accuse of having sent us a faked version of his statement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing can justify the use of techniques like this. As parliamentarians of all shades of political allegiance, we should be able to discuss issues honestly and openly, and to judge motions like ours on their merits. That is how a parliament should function. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should be entitled to some measure of openness from the government, from members from other parts of Canada and especially from members from Quebec who are part of the government, some interest in discussion, comparing ideas and working objectively together to do justice to the people of Quebec.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservative government has behaved in exactly the same way as the previous Liberal government when Jean Chrétien plotted behind Quebec’s back.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I feel that we are debating issues here that speak to the reality of the situation in Canada.

Indeed, based on our knowledge of history and the cultural elements that make each of us the person we are, based on realities and clear definitions found in the dictionary, based on a reality that is both historical and geographical and social, quite simply, without any dirty tricks, without trying to change the nature of the debate, without moving it on to another stage—a stage we are not currently at—we should be able to talk, observe and tell Quebeckers that we feel that they form a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see no objection. It poses no problem for us. We feel that if it were not for a kind of pathological obsession typical of some people in this House and which was illustrated, yesterday, by the Prime Minster, who tried, by a kind of motion, to add to the Bloc’s motion the idea of a political debate on the future of Canada, this could be simple.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it not that simple? Why is it not that clear? Why did the Prime Minister try to change things? Why are we not able, you and I, with the Speaker, in accordance with the Standing Orders, to discuss this question simply and in all fairness to Quebeckers? I think that to ask the question is to answer it. Those who wish to transform this debate in order to take it to another level are, in my opinion, making a serious mistake.</div>

    </p><a name="Para293724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a political party devoted exclusively and obsessively to the cause of Quebec's separation from Canada asking Canada's Parliament to acknowledge that it is on the right track. The leader of the Bloc is, in a way, calling for a resolution on clarity. Indeed the political about-face is pretty spectacular, even for the Bloc.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what one of the co-founding leaders of the independence movement is asking of Parliament. “Who would you allow us to be?” “What do you want us to become?” No member from Quebec having earned the privilege of sitting here has ever felt the need to ask his peers why he was here. Not Papineau, not Cartier, not Laurier, not Trudeau, not Mulroney nor any other Quebec leader has ever asked his provincial counterparts, “Who am I?”</div>
    </p><a name="Para293726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. They have each said in turn at various points in time, “This is who we are, this is what we want for ourselves and what we can do together for our fellow citizens”.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para293727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt that anybody in a Canadian Parliament ever said to the representatives from Lower Canada, from eastern Canada or from the province of Quebec, that this is who they are and that this is how we will recognize them from now on.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para293728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1792, when Canada's first Parliament met in Quebec, right up to the present, we have been called first Canadians, then French Canadians and now Quebeckers. It was not other people who named us, however. We have never asked our partners in the other provinces who we are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself have no problem recognizing that Quebeckers form a nation, since we share a common language, culture and history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already said so and I have no difficulty saying it again today. I am, as an Irish Quebecker, very proud to belong to the Quebec nation as are thousands of other Quebeckers from backgrounds other than that of the majority. I am, however, just as proud of my Canadian citizenship. These feelings are not contradictory. In fact, I think the Quebec nation the Bloc is so keen to celebrate would not perhaps exist today had French culture and language and our legal institutions not been protected in our various Constitutions. The surest guarantee of the continued growth of the Quebec nation is our participation within Canada as a whole.</div>

Those four little words “within a united Canada” contain our entire history as a society, as a people and, yes, as a nation. We will soon be celebrating the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City, the place where I was born and the city where past generations of Cannons and Powers, my ancestors, were able to make their dreams and aspirations come true. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sincerely hope that this anniversary will remind all Canadians, wherever they come from, that, for four centuries now, successive generations of French-speaking men and women founded a country here, in America, a country that still allows them to tell the world about pride and solidarity. They not only asked others for recognition, they built a country in their own image, with the sweat of their brow, that reflects the scope of their ambition. This country is still their country and it will remain so as long as there are francophones in America. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that, at times, Quebeckers have suffered under a kind of paternalistic, even antagonistic, federalism, but the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has proved that he wanted to and has been able to bring in a new, open federalism that would allow the Quebec nation to express its rich personality and bring all its potential to the fore in a respectful relationship with our partners. That is not what the Bloc Québécois wants. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long ago, another Conservative Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, poured his heart and soul into the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society within Canada. After years of heroic efforts, that recognition was never achieved. And whom do we find among the people who sabotaged the Meech Lake accord? The future founding father of the Bloc Québécois, Lucien Bouchard, who was consistent enough to go to Quebec City and take over the helm of the Parti Québecois. Then there was Jacques Parizeau who did everything he could, along with Bernard Landry, to tear down Brian Mulroney's government. They did it for the same reason that the current leader of the Bloc Québécois is doing it. The sovereignists fear one thing above all—that the Quebec nation will become stronger within Canada. But it is the nation itself that chose its future, and that is why, in both of the referendums run by the supporters of separation, a majority of Quebeckers chose to remain in Canada, in their own country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When René Lévesque's Parti Québecois was elected 30 years ago, it was first and foremost because it promised better government, not immediate separation. We cannot criticize a citizen of a nation for being a nationalist. Like a majority of my francophone constituents no doubt, I consider myself a nationalist. Nationalism does not mean separatism. We can love Quebec without wanting to destroy Canada. This is why the majority of Quebeckers, when they felt that their place in Canada was threatened, wanted to uphold and affirm it. Of course, Quebeckers have elected Péquiste governments and Bloc members in the past, but they have never given up their place in Canada, the country that they dreamed of and created and that they continue to improve. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Prime Minister said yesterday, we must not mistake the real intent of the leader of the Bloc Québécois and his members, which is to recognize not what Quebeckers are, but what the sovereignists would like them to be. To them, “nation” means “separation” and that is that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Quebec National Assembly recently reaffirmed that the people of Quebec form a nation. The Prime Minister of Canada has just done so, and I hope every member of this House will do so as well by supporting his motion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we forget the dignified, reasonable and resolute attitude of Robert Bourassa, whom I had the honour of serving, along with the hon. member for Westmount—Ville-Marie, when he said, at an extremely critical and important moment in our history:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving a name to things is not what is most important. We recognize those who contribute to Quebec society by what they achieve. Quebeckers want action and accomplishment, not words and declarations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois, which wants to plunge us into yet another existential debate, has been around since 1990. What concrete, lasting achievements has it been able to deliver to Quebeckers since then? How has it advanced the Quebec nation it claims to serve and represent? It has done nothing because it can do nothing but talk.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it has provoked major debates like this one, but has it passed a single piece of legislation in this House? Seen a bill through? The answer is no, of course, because the Bloc does not form the government and never will. Conversely, in only a few months, Canada's new government has addressed almost all of the major priorities announced during the election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all we have opened the way to a better future for the Quebec nation by defining a new federalism of openness, which is already bearing fruit. We are working on eliminating the fiscal imbalance, a topic that the Bloc has enjoyed going on about for years. But is it the Bloc that will be solving the problem of the fiscal imbalance? No, it’s the current government that will be doing it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made it possible for Quebec to participate fully in the work of UNESCO, something Quebec has wanted for a long time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made a commitment to respect the spirit of the Canadian Confederation faithfully by respecting the division of provincial and federal powers. We will be putting an end to abuse of the federal spending power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc denounces, and tries to bring down, all governments that do not advocate separation, but our government is maintaining sustained and productive relations with the Quebec government, relations that are resulting in agreements and achievements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Division has never helped the Quebec nation. “Let us cease our fratricidal fighting” said the great Honoré Mercier more than a century ago. He wanted to unite all Quebeckers, blue, red or whatever, so that the only French society in the Americas could forge ahead. </div>

So it is hard to see the subject as one that it is absolutely astonishing to see raised in this House, given that the previous Conservatives devoted many debates to it. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the minister had this to say, and I clearly heard it. I am quoting from memory, but I am pretty sure this is what he said. “I personally have no problem accepting the fact that the House recognizes that Quebeckers form a nation.” </div>

So when my colleague asks me to recognize reality, I firmly believe that the resolution that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> of Canada tabled yesterday is a recognition of reality. </div>

And I thought it was fairly obvious. For decades now, Canadians, French Canadians, Quebeckers themselves have defined themselves as they were, as they are. They have not asked the Canadian Parliament to define who they are, what their make-up is, and so forth. They know. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time we have tried to do it, who are the ones who have clearly tried to throw up roadblocks. Who? It was the sovereigntist movement in Quebec—in Quebec City; here, it was always the case. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ones who tried to hamper the evolution of Canadian federalism, who tried to get something out of it, were none other than my friends across from me, it is they who, each time, invoked the humiliation of Quebeckers or other arguments that did not hold water. In fact, they are the champions of the status quo. That is what they are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On our side, we want to see Canadian federalism evolve, because we believe that federalism is the best political arrangement and the best thing for Quebeckers. In fact, Quebeckers chose us: they chose us six times.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we are saying that Quebeckers form a nation. The minister says he recognizes this.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fail to see how the minister can vote against recognizing a nation in Canada's current context, a regime he currently prefers, never mind that it was the Bloc Québécois that submitted the proposed amendment. It is his right. It is his right at present.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a federalist political party in Quebec City, right? It has been there for the last six elections. This is why I am returning to this subject. Even if the leader of the Bloc Québécois plays some dirty tricks, the fact remains that tomorrow morning, Quebeckers will not vote in favour of his motion, thinking that maybe they are part of Canada and maybe they are not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His motion says “maybe, maybe not”. Our motion says that Quebeckers form a nation within a united Canada. This is what we are saying and it is reality. It does not say that maybe they will still be part of Canada in a few years or maybe they will not. That is the Bloc’s real intention. I am pleased that they moved this amendment today because essentially they are telling us exactly what is behind their motion. That is what they are telling us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In closing, let us recall the Bélanger-Campeau Commission. This exercise was conducted with the utmost respect for Quebeckers’ dignity.

Two options were presented to Quebeckers: continue to evolve within Canadian federalism or propose sovereignty association. The sovereigntist leader in Quebec City decided to remove the hyphen between “sovereignty” and “association.” The sovereigntists even repudiated what they had done in the Bélanger-Campeau Commission. They even repudiated that. What is their real intention? Now we see. </div>

It is a matter that lies at the very heart of Quebec's identity. Clearly it is a matter of great importance. In my opinion, a people's identity must never be the subject of political games. Unfortunately, that is the very intent of the Bloc.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask ourselves why, in November 2006, the Bloc Québécois has put this motion before the House of Commons. What would prompt a sovereignist party to put such a motion before the House of Commons? I think this is worth thinking about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois has never hidden the fact that it openly seeks Quebec's separation. Now it is asking the House of Commons, representatives from all across Canada, to recognize Quebec as a nation. Permit me to say that the situation is rather ironic. Quebeckers know very well who they are. They know their history well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Pontiac</A> recalled the time when we sat together under the leadership of Mr. Bourassa, who had stated very clearly that Quebec was a distinct society capable of making its own choices. Why is the Bloc asking all the representatives of the people of Canada here to pass this motion? The fairly obvious conclusion is that by tabling this motion the Bloc Québécois is simply trying to create division among us here in the House of Commons. It is pretty clear. It is another trick to try to cast us in an unfavourable light and then proclaim to Quebec and Quebeckers that Canada's parliamentarians did not want to accept the fact. This seems obvious to me. This is the Bloc's only reason. If it is not the case, why is a sovereignist party that wants Quebec to separate asking the House of Commons to define Quebeckers? It makes no sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I remind members that this is the same party that in 1995 voted against the distinct society within Canada. Let us be clear: the ideology of the Bloc Québécois, and the Bloc is explicit about this, is purely and simply Quebec separation, full stop. While the leader of the Bloc Québécois always says that Canada can continue to function as it wishes, it is obvious that Quebec is part of Canada. When he brings in motions that seek to divide the people, I have to conclude that he does not want Canada to function well. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider that the Bloc is playing a very dangerous game, and one that leads nowhere. The Bloc tried to set a trap for the other parliamentarians. By chance, its own foot has been caught. There are seasoned parliamentarians in this House. There are specialists in parliamentary strategy, I would even say in parliamentary tactics. That is exactly what the Bloc tried to pull, but it has not succeeded. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially, by attempting to take control of this debate, the Bloc members are trying once again to make out that they are the only ones defending Quebec’s interests. I really cannot hear that said one more time in this House. I have been hearing it for over 10 years. They dare to say when they get up in this House to defend some issue or other, some program or piece of legislation, “We are acting in the name of Quebeckers”. Excuse me, but I am a Quebecker too. The member for Bourassa is a Quebecker, the member for Pontiac is a Quebecker. By what right do they make this preposterous assertion? It has been the same story ever since the Bloc started sitting in the House of Commons. It thinks it speaks for almost 7 million Quebeckers, but that is not so. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are federalists in this House who also represent Quebeckers. The Bloc has trouble accepting that there are federalists here who defend the interests of Quebec, but who are also committed to promoting Quebec as a part of our great country. That is the fundamental difference. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc members may find it hard to believe, but there are federalists in the Quebec National Assembly as well. I was one, and my colleague from Pontiac was another, and today the Liberal Party of Quebec is leading the province, a federalist party that defends the interests of Quebec while promoting Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc should perhaps admit this reality: there are a number of people who as elected representatives speak for segments of the Quebec population and care about Canada. I realize that the Bloc may also have difficulty accepting that there are federalists within my own party, the Liberal Party of Canada, who also care about defending Quebec’s interests within Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot pass over in silence the fact that this motion that has popped up in November 2006, as if by chance, follows the debate that is currently taking place in Quebec within my own political party. So I would really like to ask the members of this House not to forget that the rank and file of the Liberal Party of Canada in Quebec are really the ones who opened this debate. In my party, we have never shied away from debating important issues and new ideas, with a view to finally reaching consensus. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105">(1105)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para293784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is truly the sign of a party that is listening to its rank and file, and that rank and file comes from all parts of Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, I would like to pay tribute to these men and women of the Liberal Party of Canada in Quebec who were courageous enough in recent weeks to put this debate on the nation at centre stage again. It took nerve. They did it and they deserve some credit today. I think these Quebec federalists have demonstrated that this is an important issue that can help us continue to modernize our federation and make Canada a more united country. They listened to people from all parts of Quebec in their consultations and they raised the issue. They reached out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do all these Quebec federalists have in common? It is what Canada represents to them. They legitimately expressed the attachment that a majority of Quebeckers feel for Canada, in their daily lives and in their hearts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The founders of our country sought to create a land where two languages and a number of cultures and religions can peacefully coexist. I firmly believe in the presence of francophones in Canada; because of their attachment to their language and culture and Quebeckers’ determination to defend their identity, this country has learned to appreciate differences. Not only to appreciate and respect them but indeed to celebrate them. It is because of the French fact in Canada, Quebeckers who have defended their identity, that this country is open to other cultures. We now welcome people from all over the world to our country and accept them as citizens. Now other countries look at us and wonder how we have achieved this success in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, the greatest contribution of francophones and Quebeckers is that this country is now open to all cultures and dimensions. This is why our country is so original compared to others around the world and why all eyes are on us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is fairly clear that the Bloc is trying to question everything we have achieved over the years. Yet the federalists in Quebec went through two referendums. Never mind the ambiguity of the question. I campaigned during these two referendums. I must say that when we went door to door during the last referendum—and I am sure the members from Bourassa and Pontiac would say the same thing—and tried to explain this issue to people, some Quebeckers said, “We will vote yes, but we will always be Canadian citizens”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was mass confusion. Yet, the outcome was no both times. Why did people vote no twice? Why are the Bloc and the Parti Québécois asking us to choose between our two identities? I am a proud Quebecker and a proud Canadian. Why ask us to choose between our identities? Why?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para293791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer was “no thanks”. No thanks: we are proud to have a number of identities. I am a proud Montrealer, a proud Quebecker and a proud Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The members of the Bloc have always had trouble accepting this reality. They continue to refuse to admit that, for the majority of Quebeckers, Canada is a country with a future, a country they still intend to keep building. For me, it is very clear that Canada would not be what it is today without Quebec, and conversely, Quebec would not be what it is without the participation of other Canadians in this collective project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of my experience since entering politics. I will always remember that, before I did so, the Quebec Justice Minister at the time, Herbert Marx, told me that if I decided to enter politics, I would have to move ideas forward step by step. When you try to rush things and not let them proceed at their own pace, that is when you may fail. That is what is happening. Step by step, we are advancing Canada's recognition of the place of Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived in federal politics, in this very House, in 1995. You may have been there, Mr. Speaker. I think you were, because you have a lot of experience as an MP. At that time we voted in this House to the effect that the people of Quebec are a distinct society within Canada. Let us not be surprised that the Bloc once again, naturally, voted against.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall that under the leadership of the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, we took action on many issues to recognize Quebec's difference. Quebec had the opportunity to introduce its own parental leave, and we recognized the innovative initiative of the Quebec day care system. First and foremost, there was the desire—and I want to salute the very firm resolution shown at that time by the hon. member for LaSalle—Émard who was then Prime Minister—to record in an agreement the concept of asymmetrical federalism in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see that this is being done step by step. The hon. member for LaSalle—Émard even said, in response to the leader of the Bloc during the leaders’ debate, that he had always recognized that Quebec was a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is happening today? Why has the Bloc tabled this motion? That is really the question we should be asking ourselves, and we must not fall into the trap. I repeat that I am proud that the rank and file members of the Liberal Party of Canada have been bold enough to bring this debate back to the forefront. I am proud to see that the federalist parliamentarians of this House have not fallen into the trap set by the Bloc Québécois. But above all, as a Quebecker, I am very proud to see that my parliamentary colleagues from all across the country are prepared to recognize the distinctiveness of Quebec. Truly, this warms the hearts of all Quebeckers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, I ask the Bloc to accept the following subamendment to the amendment that has been tabled. </div>

    </p><a name="Para293812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the feeling that adding the concept of “united Canada,” as the leader of the Bloc agreed to, could have settled it. Still, since you say there was no consent, I will return to the essence of the member’s remarks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am astonished by something I have just heard. The hon. member said that when her party formed the government, it submitted the question of a distinct society here, in this House, and voted on it. She was proud of that. Yet, in the same breath, she condemned the Bloc Québécois motion asking that the question of nationhood be submitted to the attention of this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I am having trouble understanding something. Why is it that, when the Liberal Party submits the question of a distinct society, it does not cause division, but when the Bloc talks about a nation, that causes division and is wrong?</div>
    </p><a name="Para293815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, she says that the Bloc Québécois is divisive and is not entitled to bring such a matter before Parliament. I find that very intolerant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, a colleague in her own party, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78667,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78667&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</A>, raised this issue publicly during the leadership race, and the issue has been widely debated within the Liberal Party. But today, we must listen forlornly to someone saying that we are not entitled to submit this question. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I understand the member correctly, it is appropriate for the Liberal Party to ask Parliament whether it wants to vote for a distinct society or not. However, the Bloc is not entitled to ask for a vote on recognition or non-recognition of a nation. It is fine for the Liberal Party to talk about a nation; but it is despicable when the Bloc Québécois raises the issue. I am having trouble following the logic.</div>

I merely questioned the motivation. Why would a party that calls itself sovereignist, that wants Quebec to separate, choose to seek the approval of all parliamentarians from across Canada? It seems rather ironic. This appears to be another gimmick, which is why I really asked the question. What is the motivation behind all this? The hon. member for Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean is now suddenly quoting one of our candidates. I feel justified in saying this is what they are trying to do: they are seeking to divide the federalist forces in this House. They were mistaken to think that we would not vote together on a motion that would recognize Quebeckers as a nation within a united Canada. That is exactly what happened. It does not take a genius to figure this out, especially since the hon. member for Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean is a specialist in parliamentary strategies. We must give him credit. He is a brilliant strategist and loves this. He knows all the standing orders of this House. He thought he could make the Liberal Party of Canada look bad. Well, he was wrong. </div>

If we look at this country’s history, there are many examples of Quebeckers who helped build the country we know today and who want to continue to do so. At the same time, and this is not contradictory, they want their distinctness and specificity recognized. They also want to continue to share common values and build this country together. These desires are not at odds with one another. It is the same thing when we speak of Quebeckers taking pride in having two identities. There is nothing contradictory about this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hon. member said that he had lived in Quebec. Everyone will agree not only that most Quebeckers have a distinct culture and language, but also that over the years we have become a very inclusive society, like Canada, welcoming thousands of immigrants, and we have developed unique institutions. Even though Quebeckers and Canadians share a way of thinking and a set of social values, Quebeckers as a whole have developed even stronger ones. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will always remember that, when this Parliament and the then Liberal government decided not to participate in the war on Iraq, Canadians everywhere applauded, but Quebeckers applauded even louder. When we signed the Kyoto protocol, Canadians everywhere applauded, but Quebeckers applauded even louder. Ask any immigrant who settled in Quebec and who is now a Canadian citizen how much he feels a part of Quebec and Canadian society. This is what we are trying to achieve together, unlike the Bloc Québécois, which is trying to divide Quebeckers. </div>

In fact, I am very proud to stand today and speak in favour of a strong Quebec nation within Canada. That is the reality. Quebec is part of Canada at present. The NDP and I will continue to fight to keep Quebec in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself am a francophone with Quebec and Acadian roots who was born in Saint-Boniface, in Manitoba. I lived in Ottawa for many years. I also lived in Montreal and Calgary. I became a city councillor in Victoria, British Columbia, where I now live. I know what a beautiful and diverse country Canada is. That diversity is an integral part of our identity as Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe strongly in the Canadian federation. I am a federalist through and through. I entered politics partly so that the federal government would hear and consider my community's priorities and voices and partly so that the federal government would not be a centralizing force, but a unifying force, protecting the social, cultural and environmental rights of all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I entered politics, it was also because I believe in the importance of a strong presence of both cultures in a united country. I greatly appreciate the contribution of the Quebec people to the social fabric of our country, both in the past and to date. I appreciate the Quebec culture and language, its sense of humour, music, literature and politics. These are part and parcel of what it means to be Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I cannot speak for Quebeckers. I believe that the Quebec nation will define itself as it wishes. The Quebec National Assembly unanimously proclaimed, as was stated this morning, that Quebeckers form a nation. That is why I wholeheartedly support the NDP acknowledgement that Quebec is a nation. I believe that we must recognize a simple fact, an obvious fact. My conversations with Quebec members of our party and my Quebec friends have convinced me that a good number of Quebeckers firmly believe that the Quebec nation can realize its tremendous potential, and its destiny, in a united Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They believe that Quebeckers can be masters of their own destiny while being part of the Quebec nation. They do not approve of the Bloc Québécois option of a separate Quebec.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para293835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I believe that the vast majority of Canadians outside Quebec want to see Quebec culture and language to be protected and thrive. We are not the same country without them. One need only think of how oversubscribed for example immersion schools are on the west coast in Vancouver and Victoria where parents have to camp outside in the fall at the time of registration to ensure that their kids can learn French. They even take part in lotteries, again to ensure that their children have the opportunity to become bilingual.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultural context of British Columbia is favourable to French to the extent that I was able to teach my own children to speak French and now I see my grandchildren learning French. There are many francophone associations. French music and shows are appreciated and that is also part of the contribution of Quebec to the rest of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of Canadians from coast to coast to coast in October 1995 was an extraordinary display of kinship. It reflected the overwhelming sentiment among Canadians that to lose Quebec would be to lose a part of ourselves, for Canada with Quebec is how we define Canada. I believe we are allowed, as federalists, to define our country as we see.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening of that famous referendum I was deeply saddened and I thought how rudderless I would feel without Quebec. Nor did I think that as a francophone my viable option was to leave western Canada to live in Quebec because I need both parts of Canada to feel truly Canadian. How can we be Canada without its intrinsic parts, without Quebec? Such a reality could not exist.</div>

As I said, some Canadians and francophone Canadians of French origin have chosen to settle in the west, or outside Quebec, for all sorts of reasons. This does not prevent them from appreciating Quebec and the fact that Quebec has fought over the years. I agree that it was not always easy. We have a lot of respect for these efforts, because they enabled all of us to thrive and to be who we are. Personally, it has enabled me to keep my language and to be the person that I am.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not expect to rise and speak to the House of Commons when I decided last week to come here today to renew my experience of this House where I have already spent a great deal of time and where I am still proud of representing the citizens of La Pointe-de-l'Île. I am here today and this debate concerns me deeply. I will try to speak of that in the short time I have, and I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to tell me when I have one minute remaining. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to remind members that Quebeckers have formed a nation for a very long time and that, unfortunately, Canada as a whole has never agreed to recognize that fact. Today, I am astounded to hear certain arguments from members, whom I otherwise very much respect, speaking of this trap that the Bloc Québécois is setting for Parliament by tabling this motion today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, Quebeckers have formed a nation for a very long time. My first field of study was history. At that time, people spoke of the history of Quebec and of Canada. We can believe—and there are quotations to that effect — that from the time of the French regime, before the British conquest, the Canadiens—because Quebeckers of that period called themselves Canadiens to distinguish themselves from the French—already formed a nation. The Americans had given themselves a country, they had claimed their independence, but even if they had not declared their independence they would have been different from the British. They were Americans. They made up the American nation. In the same way, the Canadiens of that period, in the Canada that was a French colony, made that distinction and there was already that difference. There was this nation that was there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say that in the British conquest—the fact that the very great majority of colonists were settled, according to the wishes of British governors, on the Ontario side for one part, and in the Eastern Townships for the other part—the high birth rate of those Canadiens, who later became French-Canadians, emphasized even more this feeling of difference. I could speak about that at length. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to remind members that when Lord Durham—of unhappy memory in Quebec—came after the 1837-1838 insurrections, he said, in speaking of Quebec, referring to what was then Lower Canada following the insurrection—and I learned it from my history professor during a session on Lord Durham: <i>“I found two nations warring in the bosom of a single state”</i>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Durham, after his report, concluded that the most urgent requirement was to turn those Canadiens into a minority. Once that was done, they could be given responsible government later. From that flowed the forced union of what is today Ontario and Quebec which later became Canada. But before giving self government to the colony, which was the seed of independence, Lord Durham said: “These Canadiens must be put into a minority”. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Quebec nation, recognition of which is said today to be a trap, simply expresses itself and grows differently. It is. It is, not because Canada is united. It just is. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I travel a lot and there are multinational countries, countries that have more than one nation within them—Belgium recognizes that it is one. A nation like the Quebec nation, whether it forms a country or not, is a nation. So saying that it is a trap to recognize it is extremely surprising, to say the least. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also surprising that for all this time, from the British conquest to today, with all of the progress by Canada and the self-satisfied image that Canadians often project, they have never wanted to recognize the Quebec nation as a nation, as a group of people united by history, by language, by culture and by a body of laws. This is as true in English as it is in French. Certainly, it is not a country. That is why Quebec cannot join the United Nations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, for all this time, has Canada had such difficulty recognizing it? We need only think of the epic tale that some of us, and I myself, lived through, the tale of recognition of the distinct society and the provisions of the Charlottetown accord. Why find it so difficult to recognize the characteristics of this nation, no matter where its future lies? Once again, I am astonished to hear it said that this is a trap, or a trick. To my mind, the words I have read are much more of a trick. I read those words because I was not here yesterday, for reasons I can explain outside this chamber. And so I read what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a trick anywhere, it is in what “united Canada” is intended to mean.

    </p><a name="Para293886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the debate hinges on the concept of the Quebec nation, I think it makes sense to define what we mean by “nation”. The term “nation” can apply to two different things. When it applies to a state or a territory, it is synonymous with “country”. That is what we mean when we talk about the United Nations, an organization that Quebec can unfortunately not be a member of because it is not sovereign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if the motion as written says that Quebec is a nation, some might claim that means Quebec is a country. But that is not what the motion says. The motion is asking this House to recognize that Quebeckers currently form a nation within Canada, according to the latest amendment introduced by my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78890,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78890&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</A>. However, when it applies to people, the term “nation” is not synonymous with the word “country”. Dictionaries offer a wealth of information on this subject. I feel that we do not refer to them often enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the <i>Petit Larousse</i>, the term “nation” means “Large community of people, typically living within the same territory and having, to a certain extent, a shared history, language, culture and economy”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the <i>Petit Robert</i>? It defines the term “nation” as a “Group of people, generally large, characterized by awareness of its unity and a desire to live together”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exactly the meaning of the motion before us today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members may have noticed that neither of these definitions refers to origins. They refer to “desire to live together” and shared culture and territory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who claim that the term “nation” does not mean the same thing in French as it does in English, we checked with the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, which says:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition is exactly the same in French. However you put it, it is clear that Quebeckers form a nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Canada prepared, and that is the gist of the motion, to unconditionally recognize this obvious fact, contrary to the motion put forward by the Prime Minister? Because that is precisely what the word “united” in the Prime Minister's motion is: a condition set by the federal government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a broad consensus in Quebec that Quebeckers form a nation, and there has been for years. I will remind members that, as my leader indicated, on October 30, 2003, Quebec's National Assembly unanimously passed the following motion:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does unanimously mean? On October 30, 2003, at the National Assembly, it was the very same Parliament as the one sitting today. We have a majority Liberal Party government in Quebec, with the Parti Québécois as the official opposition, and a third party, the Action démocratique, which has not been recognized as a registered party because it did not get enough candidates elected, but which did vote in favour of that motion. All three parties represented at the National Assembly, regardless of federalist or separatist allegiance, unanimously voted in favour of the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion does not state that Quebeckers form a nation provided that Canada remains unchanged, or that Quebec will be a nation if it achieves sovereignty. I defy the Chair or any member of this House to find any such conditions set out anywhere in the motion before us. This motion states that Quebeckers form a nation, period. There was a reason for the National Assembly to specifically state the existence of the Quebec nation. Members will understand that, when I talked about the National Assembly reaffirming that the people of Quebec form a nation, I was referring to the motion it unanimously passed on October 30, 2003.</div>

    </p><a name="Para293942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have often marvelled at the construct of Canada. Why have we succeeded in the creation of such a great country? </div>
    </p><a name="Para293943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attempt to answer this question personally, I have often turned to the Confederation debates and the words of our Fathers of Confederation at the time they created this wonderful country. The Fathers of Confederation chose a form of government uniquely suited to expressing and accommodating regional, linguistic and religious diversity. The most important example of this diversity was undoubtedly the existence of the two major language groups.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para293944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our linguistic diversity, we are the envy of many countries that are still unable to resolve their cultural differences.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para293945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major factors in the creation of Canada as a federation was the presence of Quebec. The founders of our country wanted to build a nation which embraced our diversity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no doubt that in the heart of this country and all that we have achieved lies the compact that was defined by the Fathers of Confederation. This compact was based upon the recognition of the nationhood of les Québécois, the uniqueness of their language, their culture, their tradition and their history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of this was in dispute at the time of Confederation, as the British American provinces united freely, voluntarily and with the fullest intent to protect and advance those very characteristics. The concept of Confederation has always been that les Québécois and other Canadians would be stronger in unity than we would in division.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the concept of Canada. It is that very respect, tolerance and acceptance which not only lies at the heart of this country but which has in every way permeated the character and the philosophy of what we have created.</div>
    </p><a name="Para293949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quote for illustrative purposes H.L. Langevin, after whom the edifice across the street is named, who said:</div>

On the other hand, we do not wish to do away with our different customs, manner, and laws; on the contrary those are precisely what we are desirous of protecting in the most complete manner by means of Confederation.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central to the Confederation debates was George-Étienne Cartier. He was described at that time as the finest statesman in North America. His oratory carried the day in the conferences leading up to Confederation. In 1864, he asked this question:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc, on the other hand, posits that Quebec itself is a nation and that it is a nation extraneous to Canada.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Canada is a prosperous and politically stable country because we have made diversity an asset rather than a problem.

    </p><a name="Para293965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our capacity to adapt as a society and to build institutions that respond to the demands of our citizens has served us very well. Federalism is the natural response to governing a large, demographically and regionally diverse country. With 10 provinces, 3 territories, 6 time zones and bordering on 3 oceans, Canada's regional diversity is obvious. </div>
    </p><a name="Para293966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our diversity is also reflected in the two official languages. Almost all Canadians speak English or French, and one in five also speaks a non-official tongue. In Newfoundland and Labrador, 98% of the people have English as a mother tongue, while in Quebec, 81% have French as a mother tongue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am extremely proud to rise and speak to the motion introduced by the Bloc Québécois that reads as follows:</div>
    </p><a name="Para294002"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para294003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a fact that has long been recognized by Quebeckers themselves. It is also a fact that has often been reaffirmed by all the parties in the Quebec National Assembly, whether federalist or sovereignist. The Bloc’s intent, in tabling this motion, was to give the House an opportunity to recognize a reality that Canada has always refused to recognize. We introduced a motion, therefore, that was as neutral and objective as possible and simply recognizes that Quebeckers form a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Prime Minister wanted to play with words and tabled his own motion yesterday afternoon. He subverted the debate and deflected it from its true intent in order to introduce another idea—which was not at all what the Bloc wanted—about the constitutional future, the future that Quebeckers will have as a nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really think that this manoeuvre was downright dishonest. He diverted the real debate. This was obvious in what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79007,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79007&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</A> had to say. This is not a debate about whether we want to have sovereignty or keep the Quebec nation part of the Canadian political federation. It is simply about whether Canada is capable, once and for all, of recognizing that Quebeckers form a nation. This is obviously no longer possible because the debate has been subverted. They are incapable of telling us what this concept of nationhood, as recognized by the House of Commons and Canada, actually means. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>’s tactics or manoeuvres, which I would describe as dishonest, avoid once again providing real, formal, clear recognition. Everything has been all mixed together in the speeches I have heard this morning. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a spirit of goodwill, the Bloc Québécois amended its own motion to be even more objective and neutral. That is why we said: “...Quebeckers form a nation currently within Canada”. That is a reality. We are a nation and we are still within Canada. I really cannot see, therefore, why the Conservatives, Liberals and NDP would vote against a motion that simply states a fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, what is false is what we find in the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>’s motion when he says that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada. That is not true. Those are not the facts. That is imagination. It is perhaps what he wants or what he dreams of, but it is not true.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we go back to the beginnings of Confederation and the beginning of the history of Canada and Quebec, Canada was never a nation, even less united. As we know, since 1982, no Quebec government, whether federalist or sovereignist, has agreed to sign the 1982 Constitution, which was unilaterally patriated by the Liberal government of the time headed by Pierre Elliott Trudeau. There is a reason why Quebeckers have never elected a Liberal majority in Ottawa since that time. For a few mandates, they elected Conservatives under the leadership of Brian Mulroney. Since the departure of Mr. Mulroney and after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, Quebeckers have decided to elect the Bloc Québécois. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> included “a united Canada” in his statement is not only contrary to reality, it is in fact disdainful of the positions adopted by the National Assembly and the various Quebec governments since 1982. By manoeuvring in this fashion, by including in his motion the word “united” before the word “Canada”, supposedly to recognize the Quebec nation, he has trivialized the decisions taken by the National Assembly and the governments that have refused to sign the Constitution.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245">(1245)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para294011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are closing their eyes to the reality of Canada, whose political system is currently in crisis, as is clearly reflected in this House. There is a reason why we have had a minority government for the last two mandates. It is because Canada is in crisis. The fact that Canadian federalists, particularly those outside Quebec, are refusing to recognize that reality does not change anything: far from it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois has tabled a motion that is intended to be objective and neutral, so as to permit the House of Commons to recognize the reality once and for all, that reality being the existence of a Quebec nation within the Canadian political arena. Unfortunately, they have fallen into petty manoeuvring, and unfortunately, we will probably be unable to close this discussion, unless this House adopts the motion tabled by the Bloc, a motion which does nothing more than reflect reality. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would point out once again that, by adopting the Bloc’s motion, we will not be deciding on the future of the Quebec nation, but simply leaving the doors completely open. I and my colleagues in the Bloc, like a good many Quebeckers, have already drawn our conclusions about what that future should be, but the debate is not over. That has nothing to do with the debate that is going on here, because it will in any case be Quebeckers—the Quebec nation—who will alone decide on their future, in accordance with the rules democratically established in the National Assembly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that we can do here, in this place, is to recognize the Quebec nation and the particular role of the Quebec state. Of course, this House and the governments sitting here in Ottawa can also provide this Quebec nation with tools to help it develop, particularly with respect to its most profound identity. Obviously this is not the direction we are taking with the Prime Minister’s motion. If the motion of the Bloc Québécois were adopted, however, that would create an opening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would point out that in political spaces that are states and countries, more than one nation can coexist. Canada is an example of this. There are others in the world. Russia, Spain and Great Britain are examples. But in order for such countries to develop harmoniously, there has to be mutual, respectful recognition. The minister said so, but it is not how things really are. There is no respect for the Quebec nation. The motion introduced by the Prime Minister is yet another example of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact of recognizing the Quebec nation is not what causes problems. The fact of not respecting it does that. I would have hoped, and I imagine that my ancestors would also have hoped, that within this political space, Canada, which in fact combines the former colonies of British North America, recognition of the Quebec nation would come much sooner. I would also have hoped that we would agree to recognize that there is a Canadian nation, an Acadian nation and the first nations, and above all to recognize that those nations must have governments, authorities or administrative bodies that provide them with their own instruments for advancing their interests. That has always been denied. Today, still, the government is unfortunately denying it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not what I hope for, but it seems to me that this House is once again moving toward disrespect for the reality of Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a country, it could very easily have been imagined—in my opinion it is too late, but perhaps not for everyone in Quebec—that through that mutual respect, a spirit of solidarity could be developed and Canada could exist in a real sense. That is not the case. Unfortunately, history shows us that it is not possible. At least, that is the conclusion we have reached. That is why, in all friendship, we want to make Quebec sovereign and have the most harmonious possible relations with our neighbours in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, that is not the purpose of the debate today. We are asking that this House recognize the existence of the Quebec nation, a civic nation to which the anglophone minority and all the waves of immigrants that have happily washed over Quebec belong; to recognize that this nation has a common language—which does not prevent people from speaking the language of their choice at home, or the anglo-Quebec minority from having its own institutions, but the common language, in the political space, within the Quebec nation, is French; to recognize that we have a common history that is distinct, although it is connected to the history of Canada; to recognize that we have a unique culture, one that is a crossroads and that is our own vision of something that is emerging in many places in the world.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec’s culture is not a culture that is closed to what others can contribute. Obviously the French, British and aboriginal traditions, and the traditions of everyone who has come and helped to enrich this Quebec culture, are part of our unique vision of the world. That is Quebec culture. That is what we are asking this House to recognize. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, unfortunately—and I hope not—the House rejected the Bloc’s motion, we would conclude that Canada, once again, did not really want to recognize the existence of the Quebec nation. </div>

It was the word “neutral”. He referred to the Bloc motion as being a neutral motion. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, my experience in the House has been that the Bloc and its actions within the House typically have a partisan nature to them.</div>

If in fact the member wants clarity and wants to get rid of the ambiguity, why does he not support our motion which simply clarifies that Quebeckers are a nation within a united Canada?</div>

Had “Canada” not been qualified in the motion, we could have supported it, because it is true that Quebec, the people of Quebec, form a nation, and an inclusive one at that, within the Canadian political space. But using the word “unified” runs counter to reality, for it is not true that Canada is a unified country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec, the National Assembly and successive Quebec governments, whether federalist or sovereignist, have refused to sign the Constitution of 1982. How can Canada be united when the Constitution was not signed by a component as important as Quebec? That is contrary to reality. Personally, I am not in the habit of going counter to the facts. If the Prime Minister was sincere in making his remarks, he should amend his motion himself to have the word “united” removed. Then, I will have no problem supporting the motion. As it stands, it is not right, and that is what diverted the debate. It gives the impression that Canada is a united country, which it is not. At the same time, positions taken by the National Assembly and various governments have been trivialized by statements to the effect that Quebec not having signed the Constitution of 1982 is no big deal. They say we are united, but that is not true.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by saying that the debate has been diverted.

It gives me an opportunity to put in my two cents' worth about this motion introduced by the Bloc Québécois.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go back to the original motion, because we have proposed an amendment. The Conservative Party has even made it a separate motion. Everyone is ascribing all sorts of intentions to the Bloc Québécois, when it is actually being true to itself. It wants recognition that Quebeckers form a nation. This is not the first time that the Bloc Québécois has introduced a motion to that effect in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That surprises me and will always surprise me. I have been here since 2000, so obviously I was not around for the saga of the Clarity Act. But today I can see the federalist parties' position on Quebec, and I can imagine what things must have been like when the clarity bill was introduced. The original motion made by the Bloc Québécois was crystal clear. Excuse the redundancy, but it could not have been any clearer:</div>
    </p><a name="Para294042"></a><p>

        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para294043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the Bloc Québécois motion. The Bloc Québécois did not sit down one morning and decide that because these were nice words, it was going to write this motion. On the contrary, every word is important. That is why we chose “that Quebeckers form a nation”; we did not choose “that Quebec forms a nation”. It is simple. Dictionaries define the word “nation”. The word “nation” can be used in reference to a state or territory. For example, the word “nation” in “Quebec is a nation” would be synonymous with “country”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bloc Québécois did not want to trick the House of Commons. It wanted to show its openness and to avoid involving anyone in a partisan fight by asking for recognition that Quebec is a nation. Instead, it proposes to recognize that Quebeckers form a nation. Simply put, according to the definition in the <i>Larousse</i> dictionary, the word “nation”, when applied to people, means:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois made sure that the motion it tabled in the House was crystal clear precisely so there would be no political partisanship. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives did not choose to table an amendment or to ask the mover of the motion for an amendment; they simply took the motion put forward by the Bloc Québécois and made it their own, adding the words “within a united Canada”, which made it a partisan motion. That is what the Conservative Party chose to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I cannot help but smile when federalist parties that supported the clarity bill tell us today that the Bloc Québécois is not clear and reject our motion to table one that is a lot more partisan than ours. I have seen it all. Other colleagues in this House have said that they have seen it all; today, I have seen in all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not take part in the debate on the clarity bill. However, I am taking part today in this debate on the motion put forward by the Bloc Québécois, a party that has never hidden the fact that it wants this House to recognize Quebeckers as a nation. It is not the first but the third time that it has proposed such a motion. Whatever the circumstances, we are always consistent. We tabled a motion that was meant to be as clear as possible, but it was not clear enough for the Conservative Party that had to put a partisan slant to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are trying to clarify our situation and to make the Conservatives, the Liberals and the New Democrats understand that we do not want to force them into an ideological or political war. We are defending a sovereignist option and, one day, Quebeckers will democratically settle the issue. Two referendums have been held so far, and rest assured that there will be a third one. Quebeckers will make that choice. It is not something that we wanted to impose on the Canadian Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will reread the motion, because earlier, I heard the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79007,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79007&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</A> explaining that the aim was to have Quebec recognized as a nation and accordingly a country. No, I am sorry. Let us read the Bloc's motion carefully. I will reread it for my colleagues in this House, in order to demonstrate our good faith:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to clarify our position, we have added “currently within Canada”. Yes, currently, Quebeckers are within Canada. We say this perhaps in all honesty. You think we have some ulterior motive behind what we are after, which is recognition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other parties have problems in this House. Other parties have political problems. All we want is to simply have the House recognize what the National Assembly of Quebec recognized and passed on October 30, 2003, when it stated that the people of Quebec form a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of that assembly did not use the word “Quebec”. The National Assembly used the words “people of Quebec“. We used the words “Quebeckers“. It amounts to the same thing—the people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us return to the dictionary definition. I find the position of the Conservatives and the other members of this House nonsensical. The <i>Larousse</i> dictionary provides that the word “nation”, when applied to people refers to a large community of people, typically living within the same territory and having, to a certain extent, a shared history, language, culture and economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot claim Quebeckers do not form a large community of people. Seven million five hundred thousand people—a large community, in my opinion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not the subject of the debate, I will nevertheless say that, if Quebec became a country, it would rank 95th of 230 countries in the world in terms of its population. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be said that Quebec is not a large community and that Quebeckers, as a nation, do not form a large community with 7.5 million inhabitants. The definition also provides “typically living within the same territory”. Well, indeed Quebeckers do live within the same territory. This is not the subject of today's debate either, and I do not wish to be partisan, but should Quebec become a country, it would be 18th among the 230 countries in the world in terms of its size.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You cannot accuse us of saying that we are not living within the same territory or that it is not a territory with a shared history. Some federalist members have even referred to the history of Quebec. Quebec has its linguistic history. I cite the definition from the Larousse dictionary again; it says “having a shared history, language”. You cannot deny that Quebec is French. It is the largest francophone territory in North America. Nothing more needs to be said about this linguistic fact. In terms of culture, you cannot deny Quebecers have their own cultural structure. Our artists are known throughout the world, whether we think of Cirque du Soleil, Céline Dion or others. The definition talks about having a shared economy, to a certain extent. If Quebec were to be a country, it would rank 20th in terms of gross domestic product, out of 230 countries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose and objective of the Bloc Québécois are not to engage in a partisan debate about Quebec sovereignty. The objective of the Bloc Québécois is for the House of Commons to settle the nation issue once and for all. That is why the question was so lucid and so clear. The first motion that was introduced by the Bloc, and because of which the Conservatives introduced a motion in an attempt to have a completely new debate, was worded as follows: </div>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para294065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was that simple. We extended our hand to the federalists who found it so difficult to recognize Quebeckers as a nation. I can understand them. Recognizing Quebec as a nation, according to the dictionary definitions, is like recognizing Quebec as a country. I say: the Bloc Québécois motion has been studied and analyzed. We have used the correct terms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the Conservative Party that decided—once again, the ones who voted for the referendum clarity act—to take that clear motion, to eliminate it completely and to introduce its own motion. The Conservatives wanted to say: “Look, they are wrong”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope they will understand that it is up to Quebec to choose a question for its referendum, it is not up to the Conservatives to decide that. Once again, in this House, they are incapable of accepting the clear position in a very clear and very lucid motion by the Bloc Québécois, a motion talking about the Quebec nation, that Quebeckers form a nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that my Conservative colleagues will make a little progress and understand that there was no malicious intent in the position taken by the Bloc Québécois, other than to get federalists in the rest of Canada to understand that Quebeckers form a nation.</div>

If the hon. member is trying to say that he would have supported that motion had it been tabled by any other party in this House, it is even worse. It is even more humiliating for federalists in the rest of Canada. As Quebeckers, we are just as representatives of the population, and this is a choice that we made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We selected the proper words, precisely to avoid being accused of partisanship. Had we said “Quebec forms a nation”, that would have meant that we wanted to declare Quebec is a country. Instead, we decided to say “Quebeckers form a nation”, so as to accurately reflect the motion passed by the Quebec National Assembly, to the effect that the Quebec people forms a nation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we did not want a partisan debate. The partisan debate will take place in Quebec, and it is not up to the hon. member to settle this issue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise today to take part in the debate on the motion moved by the leader of the Bloc which asks that the House recognize that Quebeckers form a nation. I understand that this is a very emotional issue for some; however, we must debate serious issues and even difficult issues in an atmosphere of respect and tolerance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My position vis-à-vis the Bloc motion is very clear and unequivocal. I will vote against it. As the leader of the official opposition said yesterday in the House, how could we ever support a motion on Quebec by a party that has zero commitment to Canada and which is blind to the greatness available for Quebeckers within Canada?</div>
    </p><a name="Para294087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people in Quebec who strongly believe in Canada and want to be full participants, as well as enjoy all the benefits that come from being part of one of the greatest countries in the world. Canada is richer and a more vibrant nation for having Quebec and that is why I take great pride in rising to say why I object to the motion, even though I happen to be from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78469,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78469&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Kitchener Centre</A> which is a southern Ontario riding. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that the duality of Canada goes back to the two founding nations, the cultures and the two religions that has led us to be an incredibly rich and tolerant country that I believe impacts the lives of all Canadians. It makes Canada a beacon of hope to the world of how we can live together in peace, and not just tolerate diversity but celebrate it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many federalists and even nationalists in Quebec who believe in Canada and who are committed to a strong Quebec within a strong and united Canada.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, by the admission of the leader of the Bloc, his party is dedicated to destroying Canada. His party believes that the only way Quebec can reach its full potential is by withdrawing from Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that I, as well as all members in the House, respect the opinions that are expressed in the chamber. However, on the issue that is before us today, I fundamentally disagree with my colleague from the Bloc. I share the view, along with the majority of Quebeckers, that Quebec can reach its full potential within a united Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will always fight for a united Canada that is based on tolerance, respect and inclusion. Twice through referendums, Quebeckers have rejected leaving Canada. Even with flawed questions, Quebeckers have opted to remain as full partners in a united Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the Bloc choose to ignore these Quebeckers, the ones who have twice rejected proposals to leave this country of Canada? If the Bloc says it speaks on behalf of Quebeckers, why does it ignore the majority who have twice rejected leaving Canada?</div>
    </p><a name="Para294096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the point of view of the majority of those Quebeckers that I am speaking to and defending today. Liberals have always believed that when confronted with a clear question, whether or not to be part of Canada, Quebeckers will always choose Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My party, the Liberal Party of Canada, and I will always fight for a strong and united Canada. I believe a strong Quebec can prosper within a strong Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1995 the House voted on a resolution recognizing that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada. This resolution was proposed by the Liberal Party. I am proud that my party stood in the House and recognized that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc MPs in the House that day voted against the Liberal resolution recognizing Quebec as a distinct society within Canada. It is true, when the Bloc members had the chance to vote in the House in favour of Quebec being recognized as a distinct society, they voted against that recognition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must ask, what are the motives for the motion that we have before us today? There is broad agreement that all parties of the House--and I think that was demonstrated yesterday and I would have to say that yesterday was probably one of the most historic days that I have spent in Parliament--recognize Quebeckers as a nation. The motivation then becomes suspect when we see the amendment that was put forward by the Bloc today. It is quite clear that the Bloc's motives are to tear apart Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon all of Canada will be celebrating the 400th anniversary of the founding of the city of Quebec by Champlain. Quebec's history is a rich history. It is part of Canada's history. I know that I will be proud to celebrate that 400th anniversary, as will all Canadians across this land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take one moment to further reflect on something that was raised by my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78616,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78616&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Westmount—Ville-Marie</A> earlier today when she was speaking to the motion. She talked about the Bloc's motive. What could it be? What was its purpose? She said that in her view the Bloc is trying to divide federalists. The Bloc members want not only to divide federalists and those who believe in a strong and united Canada, but they are continuing to keep Quebeckers divided by refusing to acknowledge that the majority of Quebeckers believe Quebec can reach its full potential within Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my leader said yesterday, the Bloc's raison d'être is the breakup of Canada. The motion before us, once again, is an attempt to divide rather than to unite. It is pure politics. These tactics and attempts by the Bloc must be rejected. This is simply another demonstration of the Bloc playing games, games of which I refuse to be a part.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, it is important to rise above partisanship and political games, and defend the interests of all Canadians, including those Quebeckers who have twice rejected leaving Canada. It is equally important to adopt a solution that allows all of us to reach our full potential, a solution that respects Quebec and Quebeckers, and gives them a prosperous future within the most magnificent country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not be fooled by the politics of the members of the Bloc Québécois. They have no desire to define what Quebeckers are. Their objective is to take Quebec out of Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para294115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs was a message of inclusion and cohesion, of strength, of hope, of growth. They spoke of how les Québécois can and should be so proud and confident about their Quebec identity, and equally proud and confident about their Canadian identity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the separatist argument from the Bloc today implies that those two identities must, by definition, be mutually exclusive, that les Québécois must ultimately choose one identity or the other, but they cannot have both, and that is a great shame.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the Bloc motion is fundamentally divisive. The motion is also deliberately incomplete. It is potentially confusing, capable, indeed prone, to misinterpretation. The leader of the Bloc essentially confirmed that mischievous intent on his part in the remarks that he made in this House earlier today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As is its stated goal, the Bloc will seek at all times to engender an environment within which their separatist objectives could be realized, and this motion is part and parcel of that strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294119"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recall the words of former Premier Parizeau, who said his plan for separatism was to make other Canadians feel their relationship with Quebec was something like a perpetual visit to the dentist. We must not succumb to that game plan, neither the divisiveness nor the contrived painfulness.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to focus instead on how to keep building success for les Québécois and for all Canadians, including les Québécois. We need to demonstrate our unique historic Canadian talent and capacity for respect, inclusion and accommodation within this vast country. That may well be our greatest possible gift to the world, the gift from all Canadians, including les Québécois. Indeed, it is probably in no small measure because of les Québécois that our country has developed this talent and this capacity to live, grow and thrive successfully in a diverse context together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a troubled world, a divided world, a world where human disputes, strife and anguish are just too prevalent, surely it is a hugely important achievement, a hugely important model, to have the inclusive Canadian success story. Les Québécois have always been integral to that success. It would not have been achieved, indeed it would not have been achievable, without the role and the experience of les Québécois. Together we must not give up on ourselves.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This country covers a vast land mass, spanning the northern part of a vast continent, the second biggest country in the world, with five huge regions and six time zones. We have fantastic geography and topography to admire, to wonder at and to challenge us from coast to coast to coast.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all the features on the North American continent tending to run north and south, while we strive to build a country together east and west. We have a difficult and sometimes downright perverse climate, ranging all the way from the North Pole to the same latitude as the state of California, and all of that belongs to all of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a small but very complicated population, beginning with the aboriginal peoples, then the French explorers and settlers, then the English explorers and settlers and then wave after wave of the most enriching immigration. It is to the point now where we in Canada include every colour, every creed, every ethnic origin, every religion, every political background, crucially and importantly two official languages, many cultures, quite literally the diversity of the whole world all here and mixed together unevenly, not in a melting pot, but as a mosaic and strung out rather sparsely along about 4,000 miles of American boundary.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can hardly imagine a more difficult or challenging set of circumstances from which to try to forge a country, but we have forged one. It is the envy of the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have we accomplished that? Yes, with a lot of hard work and also with some generous good luck. Also, we have done it, I believe, primarily through the faithful application of some typically Canadian values and characteristics, like a sense of fairness and justice, a spirit of generosity, compassion, tolerance, sharing, open hearts and open minds, pride in our vast diversity. We have practised the creative art of accommodation so the overall result for all of us can be more, not less.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always had that patient willingness to listen to each other, to reach out, to bridge our differences, to try very hard to understand one another. Once we have listened and understood, then we as Canadians have always been prepared to take action with and for each other together, not because any such action is in the narrow self-interest of some comfortable majority, not because we have to, but because we want to, because that action is right for the fair, decent and wonderful country that we aspire to be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the stuff of nation building, and nation building the Canadian way is a never ending process. Canada is today and it always will be a precious work in progress. We must be absolutely resolved to keep on building this great country and to do it always and forever together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our opportunities for steadily increasing success for Canadians and for les Québécois and our prospects and opportunities for good fortune would not be possible in our country without the absolutely indispensable skills and values of les Québécois. Those skills and values reach back through out national fabric continuously for more than 400 years. They enrich us today and they will for generations to come.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the concept of a nation is very important. This is not an abstract word that people do not really care about, as the Minister of International Cooperation and Minister for la Francophonie said last June 23. Recognizing the existence of the Quebec nation is more than a symbolic gesture; it is not just a label.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that nations have rights, especially the right to self-determination, that is, the right to direct their own development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two former premiers of Quebec, a federalist and a sovereignist, Robert Bourassa and René Lévesque, agreed on this issue. René Lévesque once said:</div>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para294135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Bourassa, a federalist, had this to say about self-determination:</div>
    </p><a name="Para294136"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</div>
    </p><a name="Para294137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to self-determination is also codified by the UN. Resolution 26.25 adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1970 describes it best.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bélanger-Campeau Commission, which was set up in Quebec after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and chaired by a federalist and a sovereignist, agreed with this. Some of its findings, unfortunately, are still current because we have not really ended the impasse between federalists and sovereignists. The Bélanger-Campeau Commission said:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para294142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Quebeckers are recognized as a nation only two options are open to us. In presenting this motion, the Bloc Québécois is not saying it wants to achieve sovereignty. What we are saying is that there needs to be a major renewal of federalism on a new foundation or there needs to be sovereignty. Those two options are available. But can federalism truly be reformed? Some 40 years of fighting make me doubt it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently all these avenues seemed to be blocked. The only door that is still open, at least for Quebeckers and for the Bloc Québécois, is sovereignty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Quebeckers are a nation they have to be able to have a say on the world stage in their areas of jurisdiction. For more than 40 years now, all the Governments of Quebec have asked to be able to engage in international relations directly themselves on their own behalf where Quebec's jurisdictions under the Constitution are concerned. For more than 40 years now we have made little progress in all these debates. Quebec participates in only one international organization, namely the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. This is not thanks to the federal government, but on the insistence of France, General de Gaulle in particular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election campaign, the Prime Minister promised that Quebec would have its own seat at UNESCO, along the lines of the francophone summit. What we are seeing is Quebec left with only a folding chair, rather than a seat, and since the signing over six months ago, which was all for show, no concrete action has been taken.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also promised that, on the international level, Quebec, as well as the other provinces, though they see less need for it, would have a say in matters affecting their own jurisdictions. We saw in Nairobi, Kenya, during the United Nations climate change conference just what his promise was worth. Quebec was given no voice at that conference. More progressive nations heard about Quebec's plan only because a European minister talked about it.</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para294151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times, since the election of this new government, has Quebec been allowed to freely exercise its own jurisdictions on the international scene?</div>
    </p><a name="Para294152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois would like to assert three principles. The government cannot pretend that it has respected its promises in these three areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Quebec is not like the other provinces. Rather, it is home to the Quebec nation. For this reason, it requires greater autonomy than the other provinces, including on the international scene.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, within its constitutional jurisdictions, Quebec is fully sovereign. It must be permitted to exercise its authority from A to Z, including in international relations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, when negotiating on the international scene in matters affecting jurisdictions under Quebec's own legislative authority, the federal government cannot claim to represent Quebec, unless Quebec authorizes it to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subordination has plenty of disadvantages. It prevents the Quebec nation from fully developing and realizing its full potential. It is neither normal nor desirable for Quebec to be a province of another nation. Legally, Quebec must be on an equal footing with other countries. That is the Bloc Québécois' opinion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the motion put forward by the Bloc Québécois is not asking that the House decide whether or not Quebec should choose sovereignty. What we are asking is that it recognizes that Quebeckers form a nation. As for Quebec's political future, the decision will be made in Quebec, in a referendum that will be held in the purest democratic traditions, as Quebec has always done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of the many sovereignists in my riding, I would like to talk about the advantages of sovereignty. Why would we choose the sovereignist option for Quebec and why would we work so hard to achieve sovereignty? We all want to be free and responsible, both personally and collectively, as Quebeckers do form a nation. We want to face our own internal and external problems, solve them ourselves and gain from it experience, dynamism and the richness of being, all this in a spirit of healthy cooperation with our neighbours, whom we respect, but without the sterile blockage that has existed for too long between Quebec's normal dynamism and the check Ottawa is putting on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pay my taxes to the Quebec government that sits at the National Assembly. I want the National Assembly to make the laws that govern the country of Quebec. I want representatives from Quebec at the table in international meetings to debate and sign agreements and treaties that will have an impact on the lives of Quebeckers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebeckers have the means as well as the obligations of a sovereign people. Two neighbours who each have their own house get along better than those who have to share accommodations where the boundaries are blurred. A sovereign Quebec next to a sovereign Canada will better contribute to the well-being of both neighbours. </div>

As people know, we Quebeckers want something else. When we say that we want Quebec to be recognized as a nation, we are asking that this feature of Quebec be recognized. This does not question the features of the other nation, and it does not put an end to anything. It is simply a matter of recognition.

The redundancy only accentuates the fact that there may be something fishy here. The fact that motives are being impugned to us is also part of the game.

    </p><a name="Para294212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By keeping their eye on the ball, the Huskies have made their way to the top of Canadian university football, one victory at a time. Through teamwork and a tight defensive game, the Huskies have advanced to the finals once again. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate PotashCorp and its president and CEO, Bill Doyle, as well as the University of Saskatchewan and its president, Peter MacKinnon, for their commitment and leadership in bringing the cup to Saskatoon. They had a vision, just as a quarterback sees the winning play before he throws the ball.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitement is building. It is the first time the Vanier Cup has been played outside of the province of Ontario. It is a fitting tribute to Saskatoon's centennial year and will kick off next year's University of Saskatchewan's centennial.</div>

    </p><a name="Para294218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent decision, Canada Post announced it would soon be eliminating its $15 million funding contribution for the publications assistance program. This program in part helps publications defray the cost of delivery to rural residents. This includes community newspapers, such as <i>The Inverness Oran</i>, the Port Hawkesbury <i>Reporter</i>, the Antigonish <i>Casket</i> and <i>The Guysborough Journal</i>, papers that are enjoyed by many constituents in my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though a 2002 Canadian Heritage commissioned report called this funding “critical to the economic survival” of community newspapers, the minister has so far refused to commit to funding this shortfall. The minister should end this uncertainty, do the right thing and commit to full funding for the delivery of rural community newspapers.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low income residents are being evicted at an alarming rate in the downtown east side, with over 800 single rooms lost in three years. Abysmal poverty welfare rates mean people are destined to stay homeless, destitute or without support. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is astounding that VANOC offered $500,000 to clear the streets for two weeks during the Olympics. I guess it does not care about the before and after.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the Conservative government ignored the critical need to fund a national, sustainable social housing program?

The motion recognizes that Quebeckers form a nation within a united Canada.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para294459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go any further, I would like to clarify one thing. I must refer to a French dictionary because sometimes between French and English there are some things that are difficult to distinguish. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two French definitions of nation. What we are talking about today regarding this motion is that a nation is a large human community, mostly living in the same place, sharing more or less strongly historic, linguistic, cultural and economic links. This is what we are talking about today.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para294461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, with respect to Quebec society.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para294462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other nation is the one we recognize as a sovereign nation, which is Canada. Canada is a true nation in terms of a sovereign country. It is important to clarify that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share something else with my fellow colleague. As a Québécois, when I feel respected as a Quebecker I feel even more Canadian. This is at the core, I would say, of the last 30 years of the sovereignist movement.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para294464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of today's motion is deeply rooted Indeed, over the past 30 years, the sovereignist movement has grown out of disrespect for the very spirit of the Canadian federation and disrespect for Quebec's specificity. It is important to understand this. As long as we, as Quebeckers, feel respected within the Canadian federation, we will no longer necessarily feel the desire to leave.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that the Conservative Party is here today to properly represent and recognize Quebec's specificity. Why not? Because the Conservative Party fundamentally respects the federation, the spirit of Confederation. In other words, it recognizes that certain powers belong to the federal government and others belong to the provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, if we really get to the bottom of things and ask sovereignists what they really want, they say they want to respect the spirit of the Canadian federation so as to ensure that the rights and privileges that belong to the provinces are respected. This includes education and various jurisdictions that are particularly vital to the protection of language.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to state that this exercise will help us to define ourselves as a Canadian nation as well. One of the fundamental characteristics of Canadian society is the distinct nature of Quebec. It is what differentiates us from Americans and other countries, for example. And it makes it possible to have a country where we can express ourselves in two languages. As a Quebecker who is also a Canadian, I am blessed by the fact that this distinct nature is recognized in the other provinces. Bilingualism is a good example of that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the motion tabled is based on a fact that I would like to highlight: Quebec's distinct nature is at the heart of the Canadian federation, and that is nothing new. It is nonetheless an important motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to the editorial in today's edition of <i>La Presse</i>, where Mr. Pratte writes that “the motion tabled yesterday by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>...represents historic progress”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is reaching out to all parties, including the Bloc Québécois, to obtain their support for this motion. If it is adopted, the Canadian Parliament will be giving unprecedented acknowledgement of the distinct nature of Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a Conservative government has further shaped the Canadian identity by recognizing the distinct nature of Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Pratte continues:</div>

On the contrary, it is another step in an evolution that is very favourable to Quebeckers, despite a significant number of backwards steps and a great deal of frustration.</small></td>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para294474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the relationship of the founding peoples is evolving and Quebeckers are finding enough space to develop and to achieve their prosperity.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have a federation here, in Canada? It is precisely to take into consideration Quebec's specificity. When we opted for that political system, back in 1867, we did not choose a unitary system. We opted for a confederal system, in which the provinces are responsible for certain jurisdictions. So, this respect for Quebec's specificity is at the core of the Canadian system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, as we know, in Quebec we have notaries, and we use the civil law, which is based on the famous Napoleonic code. We also have school boards, and Quebec justices who sit on the Supreme Court. So, there are many examples which illustrate that Quebec is recognized and that it has its own place within the Canadian federation. This vision is fundamentally different from that of opposition colleagues, particularly Bloc Québécois members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are proposing that the Quebec nation, that Quebeckers fully recognize themselves within the Canadian federation. We do not want the narrow vision of a self-centred nationalism but, rather, a federalism that is open, for example, to other francophone minorities across Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking this opportunity to salute the Quebec government for its initiative, for reaching out to the other francophone minorities and trying to provide support as well as a framework to these primary safeguards of the French language.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real question today is: Does the presence of a sovereign party in this House help Quebec, does it ensure that Quebec becomes a more prosperous society? That is the real question behind today's motion. And we should ask ourselves that question.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am basically saying is that the motion before us today is in fact intended to recognize that Quebeckers form a nation within Canada. That is basically what I am saying.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also saying that, as a result of my presence within this government to defend this proposal, solutions can be put forward for the advancement of this recognition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider, for example, the fact that we are committed to restoring the fiscal balance, or that we are committed to introducing effective means of combating climate change. I hope that we will have the support of my colleagues in the Bloc so that Quebec and Quebeckers can have a healthier environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to state—and it is important for me to do so—that every time Quebec has had sovereignist parties, it has experienced setbacks. The Quebec nation, if we can call it that, has undergone setbacks when it has had sovereignist parties. We just gave the example of the environment. What has happened over the last 13 years with sovereignist representatives of Quebec here in this chamber? There have been major setbacks. An explosion of greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am proud to be a Quebecker and a Canadian. It is important to say in this House that one can be a Quebecker and a Canadian at the same time, and be both in the fullest sense. I think that this is a matter of mutual respect for our differences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec has a leading role to play within the Canadian federation. It is present and active. And like all Canadians, I think that we want to work to strengthen our federation while respecting the distinctiveness of each of the regions of the country, collaborating with our partners, and restoring the fiscal balance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than ever, I want to continue to help ensure that the collectivity of Quebec thrives within the government, and I will be happy to respond to questions from my colleagues in the House.</div>

I am an Acadian. My Acadian friends live in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, the Magdalen Islands, Louisiana, Maine, Montreal and across Canada. They are members of this people. We really do not define ourselves geographically, even though people think most Acadians live in the Maritimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have friends who are Quebeckers, and Quebeckers form a people. They share a common language, culture and history. A number of them live where I do, in Baie Sainte-Marie. They are just as much Quebeckers as the people who live in the Lac-St-Jean region or other regions. They are members of the same people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this people is to be defined by the word “nation”, it seems to me that it would be ridiculous to limit that to a particular geographic location, when there are Quebeckers pretty well everywhere in Canada. It could be said that the people of Quebec form a nation within Canada. That way all Quebeckers would be included. Would it not be silly to consider a Quebecker less of a Quebecker than others and less of a member of the nation if he moves around within the country?</div>

The Acadians have provided great lessons of solidarity and have behaved like a great people in the past, in order to preserve their rights and their language. In Quebec, unfortunately, we sometimes tend to be a bit inward-looking. We have forgotten that some francophone groups needed our support to continue setting themselves free. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also something that is involved in this motion. When we talk about open federalism, we are thinking of minorities, regardless of whether they are anglophone or francophone, as long as they can support one another. We have to broaden our horizons. This is also what we are talking about when we discuss nationalism or open federalism. This is fundamental to today’s debate, and this is the reason why I invite my colleague to support this motion. Who knows whether later on there may be other motions that we can consider for other communities since these definitions will certainly apply to others. </div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para294507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have any difficulty in recognizing that Quebeckers constitute a nation within a united Canada. Where my speech will no doubt depart from those of the Bloc Québécois members is that I am certain that this same nation can develop and flourish within a united country called Canada. The proof is in our history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible not to be struck by the major transformations experienced by Quebec in recent years, since that critical period that the historians quickly named the Quiet Revolution. It was with the team of Premier Jean Lesage that the Quebec of the early 1960s opened up to the realities of the contemporary world, making up in the space of a few years for a delay it had suffered in a large number of areas of activity, compared to other states and governments, which had already met the challenge of modernity. Quebec managed to achieve, in the space of a few decades—notably as far as the creation of development tools is concerned—what some countries and nations spent generations doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Quebec is a modern state that, in the words of former premier Bernard Landry, would be the envy of the world. Indeed, Mr. Landry wrote in the newspaper <i>La Presse</i>, on October 27: </div>

Our state already possesses important legal and financial means to support crucial actions for our society in the fields of culture, education, social solidarity, the economy, the environment, justice, international relations and many others. </small></td>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para294511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the feeling that this quotation will no doubt be used during this debate, and for an excellent reason. In seeking to demonstrate the merits of the sovereignist theory, Mr. Landry has proved that Quebec possesses the tools necessary for its development and its growth while operating within the Canadian federation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, Quebec, a modern society open to other peoples and proud to welcome them into its territory, profits from the benefits that result from its integration into the Canadian federation. At the individual level, Quebeckers, while forming a nation, enjoy the benefits that flow from possession of a double identity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This state of affairs results from the flexibility of our federation, which recognizes the distinct character of Quebec. For example, education which is of critical importance for Quebec is an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The Quebec civil code, which is different from the common law that prevails in the other provinces, is protected by sections 94 and 98 of the Constitution. The use of French, as well as English, is guaranteed in our Parliament as well as in the courts of Canada. While the Parliament of Canada can establish retirement pensions and supplementary benefits, this power is subject to provincial primacy, as a result of which the provinces are predominant, and which represents the constitutional basis for the Quebec Pension Plan and protects it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, other subjects related to the distinct character of Quebec fall exclusively within provincial jurisdiction, in particular, civil rights and property; the administration of justice and municipal institutions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The constitutional protection that Quebec enjoys in terms of its identity extends to many other sectors, especially those relating to language, which are enshrined in the Constitution Act, 1982. Let us remember, however, that this uniqueness of Quebec is reinforced by the practice of a federalism that takes into account respect for other levels of jurisdiction and places an emphasis on intergovernmental cooperation. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para294516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are objectives that our government intends to continue pursuing in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no denying the prominent role that Quebec has played in building Canada and no one would even try in all good faith; it is equally true, though, that Quebeckers like all Canadians, have benefited from the advantages of being Canadian: a quality of life among the highest in the world and constitutional guarantees of respect for human rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebeckers have demonstrated after 139 years within the Canadian federation that the legislative and institutional tools at their disposal have enabled their language and culture to flourish and will continue to do so. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms secures the cultural future of Quebeckers by guaranteeing the linguistic rights of francophones at the federal level. The charter also guarantees that French and English are the two official languages of Canada and that they can be used in Parliament, before the courts, and in federal organizations. Furthermore, the right of francophones to an education in their own language is guaranteed everywhere in Canada, as is the right of anglophones in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebeckers form a nation, but it must be specified that this nation is within a united country called Canada.

The motion we are proposing does not say anything else but that we are Quebeckers and that Quebec is a nation, without any condition. The rest is all hypothetical. Right now, what the members opposite are trying to make us say is not at all what is in the motion. I want to know if the member fully understands that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the vast majority of my life I have lived in Nova Scotia. I grew up with a great appreciation of the Acadian presence in Nova Scotia and in Atlantic Canada. I considered Quebec to be a very dynamic, creative and exciting province outside of Atlantic Canada about which I did not know a great deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then had the privilege of being elected leader of the New Democratic Party and coming to Ottawa in 1995. Over the last 10 years, I have developed an enormous appreciation of how very special and, in some ways, unique, the province of Quebec is within the Canadian family.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to fully appreciate that I think one must live, however briefly, in the province of Quebec and not just in the wonderful cities of Quebec and Montreal, but in the northern part of the province. I had the opportunity to live in the Lac-Saint-Jean area and Jonquière over a period of years taking brief French immersion courses.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandfather, also Pierre Lemieux, was born in Quebec City. My father was born in Quebec City. My father's family lives in the province of Quebec. We are not only proud of our culture and of our heritage, but we are proud Canadians as well.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebeckers realize this. Quebeckers have fully participated in the founding of Canada.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like speaking from the heart about all that I have heard since this morning. I listened closely to the speeches by federalists as well as to those by my colleagues and, frankly and honestly, I have to say that I am stunned by the questions and discussions I have been hearing in this House on this matter.

As a federalist government still suffering from the Canadian mental block, the Conservative government felt compelled to diminish the import of this rather simple recognition, to the point of rendering it meaningless. The motion by the Conservative Party was different from the one put forward today by the Bloc Québécois. This is proof.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> not support the Bloc Québécois motion?

    </p><a name="Para294542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the Conservative minority government continuing to oppose the amended motion? I would say that the Conservative Party's motion is a trick. That motion is conditional, with no effect or consequence. It is significant that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> did not provide us with any information yesterday about how his government plans to interpret this concept of “a nation within a united Canada”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he promising with this motion? What does it mean? What will it mean in fact?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also said that yesterday.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion proposed by the Bloc Québécois today is straightforward, clear and simple. The Conservative Party's objectives are much less so. The government is trying to pre-empt the Bloc Québécois. Why? Because it is no different from all the other federalist governments that came before it. Conservative or Liberal, it makes no difference. They have a barely controlled terror of unconditionally recognizing Quebec as a nation. To their way of thinking, that would give ammunition to the sovereignists and would further their plan for sovereignty. The question is simple. Do Quebeckers form a nation?</div>
    </p><a name="Para294547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government opposes the Bloc Québécois motion because it asks for real, unequivocal, unconditional recognition of the existence of the nation of Quebec. Everyone, starting with the Conservatives themselves, has begun to dilute this motion. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about a party that held its caucus meeting in Quebec City on the eve of Quebeckers' national holiday, but could not even say the word “nation” in a sentence. The national holiday was not that long ago. It was in June, and now it is November.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Liberals are in turmoil in the midst of a leadership race where only one candidate has come out in favour of recognizing Quebeckers as a nation. If the Conservative government is as sincere as it would have us believe, it should accept the amended motion introduced by the Bloc Québécois, because this debate raises another interesting question: would the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>really talk about a nation if he had to entrench it in the Constitution? We wonder.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next week, the Conservative Party will very likely vote against the Bloc motion on the grounds that it has already recognized Quebec as a nation.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Claude DeBellefeuille:</b> Mr. Speaker, I will speak to you, as my colleague points out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By having constantly cheated Quebec on a constitutional level, the federalists are running out of arguments against Quebec's demands and the consensus in Quebec. They have to come up with all sorts of excuses to argue against us. They created a motion similar to the Bloc's, but nuanced, weaker, watered down and they are opposing our motion by saying already that they will vote for the other motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the problem as I see it. The successive federalist governments do not understand, and it is precisely with this closed attitude, with these types of restrictions and tricks that they alienate thousands of Quebeckers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Durham said in 1838, “I expected to find a conflict between a government and a people, but instead found two nations at war within the same state.”</div>
    </p><a name="Para294556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that day when the Quebec nation was already recognized, the federal political plan, which is going on right now, was put in place to slow down, prevent, hold back the emergence and recognition of a people or a nation. The successive federalist governments boast about being open, flexible and an example of a federalism that works. The truth is that every gain within Canadian federalism, every bit of progress made by Quebec throughout its history has been hard won through recurring battles and always met with fierce resistance by the various federalist governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative or Liberal, it is always the same thing: they all unite against Quebec. And every one of Quebec's victories, constitutionally speaking, has been nothing more than pure and simple catch up since the patriation of the Constitution in 1982.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If today's debate is no exception, what the Bloc Québécois motion is asking is simply that Quebec be recognized as a nation. We are in full debate because the government had to add a nuance, amend the motion and impose its conditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I have any time left, Mr. Speaker, since I am sharing my time with the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert</A>? You are indicating that I have a minute left.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by saying that any hope that the federalists will propose something substantial in Quebec is non-existent. The disagreement on Quebec's place that has gone on since 1867 still exists. That said, the Quebec nation continues to exist even without Canada's recognition. It continues to pay its taxes and to have its own interests that sometimes differ from Canada's interests.</div>

She mentioned that certain people had deceived Quebec. Could she tell us who she is talking about? Is she talking about those who have been in Quebec City for 13 years and have not been able to restore fiscal balance? Or is she talking about those who set Quebec back on several occasions, like in 1982 with the patriation of the Constitution, at a time when the province was governed by sovereignists? Therefore, are sovereignists not setting Quebec back within the Canadian federation?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the significant presence of Bloc Québécois members in Ottawa is a testament to the fact that it does a good job representing the interests of Quebeckers. They feel that they are well represented since they elected 51 members of our party in the last election. It certainly means something to feel that a large number of Quebeckers want to be represented by members of the Bloc Québécois who defend the interests of Quebec in Ottawa.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at certain issues like the manpower issue and all the efforts we put into it. And there are bills that we introduced, such as the anti-scab bill and the amendment to the Employment Insurance Act. All these measures are dear to Quebeckers and reflect their values. That is my answer.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film is a joke. It is a very funny social satire. It is also a harsh criticism of Canadian federalism. It uses many types of humour: irony, puns, black humour and parody. It also uses jokes. This scene, in the context of this satire, is a joke. It made us Quebeckers laugh a lot.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's Conservative government motion is a lot like that joke. “Quebec nation in a united Canada” is also a lot like that Yvon Deschamps joke that gets told and retold: “An independent Quebec in a strong and united Canada”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This film pointed out that Quebeckers' conception of their nation has changed over the years. After the conquest, Quebeckers called themselves Canadians, in opposition to the people whom they called the English. Then they called themselves French Canadians in order to differentiate themselves from the English who had decided in the meantime to call themselves Canadians. All that time, as a minority within Canada, they continued to define themselves in relation to their origin. French Canadians were the descendants of the original French colonists. A person was born French Canadian but could hardly become one. It was at the time of the Quiet Revolution that all this changed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking their destiny into their own hands and with the help of the Quebec state, Quebeckers gradually stopped defining themselves by their origin and started defining themselves by their sense of belonging to Quebec society. Quebeckers see themselves less and less as a minority within Canada and increasingly as a separate nation with its own territory called Quebec and a national government called the Government of Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the francophone population is increasingly mixed as a result of the integration of immigrant children into its schools, the term “French Canadian” does not mean very much to young people any more. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone who joins us on this beautiful adventure to build a French-speaking society in North America, making a strength of its differences, is as much a Quebecker as the descendants of the 17th-century French colonists.

It is the project that was the vision of the bringing together of English and French, the vision of Sir John A. Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier and those who worked with them as Fathers of Confederation, who saw the possibilities and the potential of a united Canada that included those founding cultures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some at the time who opposed it, including some from Quebec. In fact, a fellow named Sir Wilfrid Laurier was one of the fiercest opponents of Confederation, yet he too, over time, came to see the benefits and the opportunities that this country presented to his culture, to his home and to the Québécois. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what has happened since within a united Canada. We have had un épanouissement of the culture of Quebec, something that could never have happened had Quebec been alone in North America, when the Québécois culture might have been reduced to something little more than the Cajun culture in terms of the French Canadian tradition. It is the fact of the Canada of Quebec, a Quebec in Canada, and the Québécois being in Canada that has allowed the protection of that culture, the blossoming of it, as I have said, and the opportunities to build the greatest country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member opposite really believe that the cultural opportunities and the strengthening of Québécois culture that have occurred would have been possible had that people been subject to the ebbs and flows of North American culture and the strength of American culture? Or would they have been reduced to little more than what we see among the Cajuns today?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he has asked me a question about climate change, which fits very well with the motion we are debating today, I will answer him by talking about the point of discord that has existed between Quebec and Canada since 1867. </div>

The Bloc Québécois thought by tabling this motion to divide the members of this House, the federalist parties, and, finally, to be able to say to Quebeckers once again how humiliated they were because the House of Commons refused to recognize the Quebecois nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, their firecracker has exploded in their faces; right in their faces. Thanks to their motion, they have united all the federalist forces in this House for the first time in a very long while. In that sense, that tactic of division—I would go so far as to say that treacherous tactic—enabled us yesterday to witness a great moment in this House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never thought that I would stand up to applaud the Prime Minister during this session! I never thought that I would delight in the presence of the leader of the New Democratic Party! The one person to whom I was ready to give a standing ovation was the leader of the Liberal Party. However, yesterday, because of the Bloc’s strategy of division; because the Bloc wanted to weaken Quebec and then have it humiliated, it went completely off track. As a result, we see now that they are skating on the edges of their skates, over on their ankles. They are proposing an amendment about a united Canada. They no longer know where they are going because their strategy failed miserably. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, this provocation gave each of us the opportunity to reflect, in our own hearts and consciences. In that sense, what happened yesterday, because of the motion by the Prime Minister, will enable us all to speak out, as Quebeckers and Canadians, with one common voice. It is the worst possible message that the Bloc members could hear. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were convinced that the Prime Minister would say no to the Quebec nation. They were convinced that this party would be divided and that their motion would be rejected. Then, they would have travelled to Montreal, Quebec City and the regions to say how terrible this was. It is absolutely unbelievable to see that the Bloc, which claims it does not need to search for its identity, tabled a tactical motion to try to get recognized and to seek its Quebec identity here, while being convinced all along that it would not happen. However, it is precisely this provocation that led, yesterday, to a great moment of national unity, and I must pay tribute to that party for achieving that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois' action resulted in some of my colleagues, who had reservations about this whole thing, to agree on a recognition. A vote will take place within the next few days to recognize that Quebeckers form a nation within a united Canada. It is a very positive thing to see this change in views and mentalities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Quebeckers are pleased to see that this House recognizes their difference. This quest for recognition goes back many years. I remember that, during my career, at the 1980 referendum, Quebeckers were told that if they voted no, they would get a form of recognition and federalism would be renewed. I was also there when the Constitution was patriated, in 1982. That patriation was an unfinished business. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the quest for the recognition of the Quebec difference was central to all these representations. This has been the case for a very long time. In that sense, the motion tabled by the Prime Minister is in itself a historic measure that will allow us to hold out the olive branch to Quebeckers, particularly federalist Quebeckers, and tell them that we recognize their existence and their difference within the great Canadian family. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610">(1610)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para294639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this means we recognize that we have more than one identity. We can be both proud Quebeckers and proud Canadians. We can be shaped by both of these identities. Together, all of our identities create the Canadian mosaic. By recognizing the Quebec nation, we are telling Quebeckers that they are more than just a part of our multicultural society and we are recognizing a historical reality. In that sense, I think this would make many of our fellow citizens feel better about being part of this country and feel accepted just as they are. Period, as the leader of the Bloc Québécois would say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are what we are. I think the Bloc Québécois' tactics have enabled us to see that, among ourselves, Quebeckers can define themselves. They have also enabled us to see that our colleagues from elsewhere in Canada accept and value our differences. Our differences are valuable. They do not hurt us; rather, they make us better and enable us to express ourselves in many different ways. Obviously, our ability to express ourselves in French strengthens Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, when we look at the message we are sending Quebeckers, it is clear that our colleagues in the National Assembly think this is one of the best messages we have sent in a long time. Those who boast about representing all Quebeckers should have listened to Premier Jean Charest last night. As the premier of all Quebeckers, he urged the Bloc members to vote for the Prime Minister's motion. He recommended that they do so graciously and recognize the existing reality. Oddly enough, today the Bloc members are turning a deaf ear to the Premier of Quebec. Very interesting. The people who were supposed to be speaking on behalf of Quebec are turning a deaf ear to the premier. Perhaps, if they do not want to listen to Jean Charest, they could listen to Mario Dumont, who says this is very good and a step in the right direction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, this broadened the consensus among the members of this House. I am very happy to see that we were not alone to send this message. We have reached out with this motion, and our colleagues at the National Assembly have responded. Personally, as a Quebecker, I am feeling much more in tune today with the majority at the National Assembly than the people in that corner. Together, we are shaping something that will let the Government of Quebec know that there are men and women in Ottawa who recognize their difference as well as the needs of a Quebec society that is a nation in our midst. That is obvious.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore pleased that the proponents of slash and burn tactics got burned, and it was their own doing. We responded to provocation by not letting ourselves be divided. We will not allow anyone to push us around just because they are using some tactic. They were so sure of themselves, with their prepared speeches saying that the Prime Minister said no and that we Liberals were all over the map. Viewing the country as much more important that our respective parties on this momentous occasion, we all came together and supported the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Quebec will not be fooled. They know full well that, on the eve of the Liberal convention, the Bloc Québécois was intent on driving a wedge between us. It did not do so in an effort to foster unity among Quebeckers or to give greater leverage to Quebec, but rather to weaken Quebec and then be able to cry humiliation. That is why I am criticizing Bloc members for not playing the role they purport to be playing.</div>

That is why I think that our fellow Quebeckers will sense a generosity of spirit, a harmony of spirit with other Canadians, and I really want to pay tribute to my own colleagues as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an easy debate. For some, the concept of nation has a meaning that goes beyond words. In that sense, our colleagues on this side of the House have also made progress. I think it is important that their thinking has evolved. This is a step forward, and it will enable federalists in Quebec to say that it is not true that Quebec is isolated; it is not true that we have to accept the Bloc's version of history. It is not true because the rest of the country is reaching out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still much to be done. Clearly, this has to be seen as an olive branch. Certainly, we are going to keep calling on this government every day to keep its promises to Quebec and the other provinces. For example, the government is saying that it is going to do more in terms of transfers to the provinces, but ultimately, it is doing less. We have noted that weakness. We will judge the government not only on its resolutions, but on its actions, and we will wage a partisan battle in due course.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could have voted in favour of the motion, despite the Bloc's bad faith. I had nothing against the original wording of this motion, but I feel that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s version is far better. Moreover, we would have amended his version if we could. But since it was not possible for us to make an amendment, I think that the Prime Minister's version is far closer to reality. The National Assembly is very comfortable with it. The Premier of Quebec, their premier, is urging them to vote for the Prime Minister's resolution. They should listen to their premier.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of listening to their premier, they want to play a little game with Mr. Boisclair, who has just reacted, 24 hours later, to what is happening here. There seems to be a disconnect between them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know this motion must be understood in its broadest sense. I have no intention of sparking a constitutional debate here today, but personally, as a Quebecker and a Canadian, I hope that one day, when the time is right, we can begin another constitutional round during which we can settled this unresolved issue that is the patriation of the Constitution and the Charter of Rights, the amending formula, and so on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we will one day go beyond a mere resolution. But the day will certainly come when Canadians everywhere will be interested in exploring certain constitutional changes. Today, I do not see a consensus, nor is the official government in Quebec calling for changes. Jean Charest is not calling for constitutional changes, and this will not hinder his chances of winning the next election. At present, we must ask ourselves if we are ready to take small steps.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc's insipid provocation has forced us to take a step that allows us to reach out to Quebeckers. I do not believe that we have solved all the world's problems, but I feel good as a Quebecker and a Canadian. I feel somewhat more comfortable knowing that my own colleagues recognize Quebeckers as a nation and that our colleagues across the floor also recognize what makes Quebec different.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By allowing this recognition, we are probably contributing more to Canada as a whole, because we feel accepted and recognized for what we are. This is true for every aspect of the Canadian population. In order to participate fully in a society, we want to be recognized by our fellow citizens for what we are and what we bring with us.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc tried to fool us. You could say they were hoist with their own petard. In the end, the Bloc allowed us to collectively send a clear, unequivocal, non-partisan message to Quebeckers. For this, I am extremely grateful to the Bloc. </div>

    </p><a name="Para294659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a real democrat also recognizes that, twice already, in 1980 and 1995, Quebeckers have chosen Canada. In that sense, I think that, from the moment that Quebeckers choose Canada and choose to contribute fully to Canada, that is the message that has to be acknowledged. Should Quebeckers make a different choice in a democratic process, all the international rules you are aware of would then apply.</div>

There are members in this House who want to change Canada's reality. We know that. The problem is that a majority of Quebeckers do not agree with them. They are always in the minority. In the polls, however twisted the question may be, they remain the minority. They have not moved forward at all in recent years. I realize that this is frustrating to them and that this is why they hope to use humiliation as an excuse, among others, but their tactic is not working.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ancestors left Quebec and came to Ontario many hundreds of years ago. Part of the reason they left Quebec was to grow this country, to build this country. As my colleague said earlier, the anglophones and francophones and many people from various countries all over the world built this wonderful country into what it is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleague that yesterday was a special moment in history. There is no question about that. I think that 20, 50, 100 years from now people will realize how important a moment it was. It showed that when somebody wants to hurt this country, hurt the francophones, hurt the anglophones, hurt whomever, we as Canadians will not let that happen. We will rally together as a House, not as a House divided, but as a House unified, with one exception. I was wondering last evening as I reflected on what happened yesterday, does this not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the party opposite does not represent Quebeckers. That party wants to tear this country apart, the country which my ancestors and the member's ancestors built.</div>

    </p><a name="Para294666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually the real test is not whether or not there are 51 MPs from the Bloc Québécois; it is knowing whether we are able, as federalists, to make contact with the Quebec population—the francophones in particular—and get it involved in this passionate project called Canada. There have been shortcomings in the past. In my opinion, the existence of the Bloc Québécois—I could not speak otherwise—reflects a vacuum at one point in history. There is nothing accidental here. Thus, as much as I think they have to be combated, I also think they have tried out some little tactics in order to divide us and they have not succeeded. It has created this advantage. In the end, each member is here in this House legitimately. Everyone is democratically elected and deserves our respect.</div>

The reality is that this debate is taking place because the Bloc Québécois tried to get involved in the Liberal leadership race and tried to embarrass the Conservative government.

It was to try and trip us up. The truth is that it has had the opposite effect and I am very pleased with the results. In this sense, the Bloc members have served a purpose. For once, we have had a unanimous motion by all federalist parties and, as a result, they have united us in a cause greater than each of our own parties. That is quite an achievement.</div>

    </p><a name="Para294680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be sharing my time, Mr. Speaker, with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78413,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78413&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mégantic—L'Érable</A>, my colleague in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of points with which I want to start.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me very clear, today's debate, which the Bloc Québécois has brought to the House, has long been fueled by political actors for debatable and questionable purposes. In bringing this debate to the House, the members of the Bloc want, above all else, to refuse to acknowledge the truth. That truth is Canada is a federation that works. It works because of our heritage, the heritage of a decentralized country, the heritage of a federation that recognizes the realities and specificities of our provincial and federal partners.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All regions and provinces have benefited from the decentralized qualities of the Canadian federation. Those qualities have more generally contributed to the vitality and development of all Canadians, especially Quebecers. I am proud to take part in today's debate and to take the opportunity to remind the Bloc, once again, that it is wrong to depict the Canadian federation as a straitjacket that is thwarting Quebec's development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I do not understand why the Bloc is so stubbornly belabouring themes that do not even need to be questioned. It is obvious to everyone that Quebeckers live and flourish in a province that has its own specificity, allowing the francophone majority to affirm itself and have its exceptional identity respected. It is also obvious that this society, which is so rich and so special, allows for the presence and development of multi-ethnicity and plural identities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a great success story, but to what can such an accomplishment be attributed? If we buy into the Bloc's logic, we arrive at conclusions that disturb me. If we buy into the Bloc's credo, we reject all the achievements that make Canada a decentralized federation based on respect for differences as it was founded in 1867. If we share the Bloc's ideas, we are admitting that since then the exceptional quality of the language, culture and institutions of Quebeckers have never found their place within our federal system. In short, this means admitting that respect for differences and respect for the spirit of federalism are illusions that have nothing to do with Canada's evolution and Quebec's development. I soundly reject those theories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we ignore the facts? Should we ignore history? We have such a striking reality before our eyes, but we still need to debate it. I ask again, for what reason? </div>
    </p><a name="Para294687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clearly so difficult to sum up in a single word the diversity of Quebec society and Canadian society. Quebeckers have been marked throughout our history by a will constantly reaffirmed by generations of men and women to promote and defend their rights and preserve their cultural and linguistic heritage, and they have succeeded brilliantly within the federation of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we contradict that? Quebeckers also belong to a community that has strong tools for development, progress and prosperity. Should we contradict that? Yet let us recall the words of Mr. Landry, who admitted himself that Quebeckers had obtained a remarkable degree of development and vitality because they had the legal a financial tools similar to those of a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe instead, and I am convinced of this and I emphasize it, that it is precisely the Canadian federal system that has allowed the vitality and development of Quebeckers and their cultural, linguistic and institutional richness. Our federation enjoys extensive flexibility so let us not deny the achievements of our history and our tradition. Let us not refute the intentions of the founders of the Canadian federation. They were aware of the need to recognize the diversity, differences and specificities of all partners of the federation. We owe much of that to the very presence of Quebeckers themselves. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para294690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebeckers fully participated in the founding of Canada, supported it, knowing full well that their specificity and their differences would be respected within it. That flexibility, which is particular to a federation, has served not only Quebeckers but it has also served all of Canada. Every province, every territory, and every region has been able to benefit from it and contribute to it through their own vitality and development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a federal framework Quebeckers have been able to safeguard their economic development and affirm the specificity and vitality that has not been limited within their own borders, but has spread throughout the globe through the spirit of a unique culture and won the recognition and respect of the entire world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit, and this is reflected in the government's decisions and actions, that our federation is also obviously a work in progress, as indeed any political system is, be it federal or unitary. It would be ridiculous to assert that a federal system is established so that it can no longer evolve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, how can it not evolve in response to circumstances and the many changes that come our way? How can we not recognize the significance of new issues that emerge that may affect the quality and the life of Canadians and Quebeckers, issues that we must address in an increasingly competitive world? It is that inevitable evolution that the Canadian government wanted to respond to through the concept of federalism of openness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already seen that new approach in action, based on respect for differences and the spirit of federalism as Canada's founders wanted. Just look, for example, at Quebec's participation at UNESCO, at the objective we have set to restore fiscal balance, and at our commitment to respect areas of provincial jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this concept of federalism of openness we wanted to ensure that our heritage would be forever preserved. By adopting the federalism of openness, we have sought, and still seek, to ensure that the spirit of federalism remains, that it continues to serve the needs of a decentralized federation and that, accordingly, the full vitality and development of Quebeckers and Canadians is assured.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through a federalism of openness, I wanted to respond to the will of Quebeckers and Canadians, to their will to strengthen our federation by working more closely with our partners, fully respecting the powers and jurisdictions of each. Such cooperation also means a profound respect for our partners and a will to draw on the experience and expertise of all for the common good.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of Quebeckers are rightly proud of their Quebec identity and their Canadian identity. What they want above all, like the majority of all Canadians, is for their governments to work in the common interest of all of our fellow citizens and agree to forge a genuine partnership throughout the country based on solidarity and respect for diversity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada can work harmoniously if it is based on consultation and cooperation by all orders of government. We can see that this whole debate that was fuelled by the Bloc has nothing to do with the words and intentions of the government and the citizens of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should instead look more closely at the achievements of the Canadian federation and the spirit of federalism as an inclusive and evolving principle for the well-being and development of not only Quebeckers but of all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is keenly aware of the role that Quebeckers have played in the building of our country. They obviously continue to play a key role within the Canadian federation by drawing on their strengths and their many assets, by giving free rein to their creativity recognized worldwide, and by contributing to a Canadian political unity through their specificity and their enriching culture, and their contribution of all of these attributes to the development of Canada as a whole.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians and Quebeckers are connected through our past, through our present and for the future. If we work together for the common good of all, that future will be bright, for together we can do great things.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the turn of the century in Nova Scotia, 80% of the population spoke Gaelic. School was taught in Gaelic. We had the first Gaelic newspaper outside of Ireland and Scotland, and for many years the only one.</div>

It does it solely and for the single and alleged purpose of demonstrating that Quebec comprises a collective entity that is suffocating in a political framework within which it cannot flourish—a system that is keeping it down. Such are the Bloc’s real intentions. Nothing else. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To call, as the Bloc is doing, for recognition of Quebeckers as a nation without reference to a united Canada is to say, in other words, that Quebec cannot be in charge of its development in all realms of activity within the Canadian federation, and to refuse to recognize that Quebeckers are part of Canada. No one can seriously argue that position. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec consists of over seven million inhabitants who make up a majority francophone society, and two thirds of the anglophones who live within its territory speak French. Quebec is North American by its geography and French by its origins, and its goal is to be a pluralistic society, open to the world. In addition to French and English, a number of other languages are spoken there. Quebec’s heritage, which bears the stamp of the aboriginal and American cultures, therefore occupies a unique position on our continent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec has always been able to make the influence of this cultural heritage felt, this heritage which is uniquely its own, both within its own territory and in every corner of the international community. It goes without saying that French occupies a central position within that culture, because it is spoken by a very large majority of its inhabitants, but it is a dynamic culture that is also expressed in the arts of all kinds. Whether they be writers, composers, woodcarvers, painters, sculptors, poets, choreographers, filmmakers, actors on stage or screen, singers, dancers, musicians, directors—these artists play an active role in promoting that culture and enabling it to flourish. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very richness of their culture is one of the characteristics that make Quebeckers a nation within a united Canada, and our government agrees with that statement. There is one point, however, that we must stress in the context of this debate: why does the Bloc Québécois demand it of this House—because, let us be frank, it matters little in the Bloc’s eyes whether we support this motion or not. As long as Quebec continues to operate within Canada, no form of recognition of the uniqueness of Quebec could satisfy the Bloc members. The political agenda of the Bloc Québécois lies elsewhere, and what it is trying to do is to prepare the ground for Quebec’s accession to independence, even though its option has already been rejected more than once by the people of Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a time when nations are seeking to delegate part of their sovereignty to supranational organizations so as to strengthen their bonds, Quebec and Canada have the huge advantage of having reached a degree of integration that can only serve them both. The separatist approach, that is, the Bloc approach, proposes exactly the opposite of what has been observed elsewhere in the western world. Taking this utopian path is the equivalent of playing with the future of Quebec and going against the current trends in economic development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion before us is indicative of the Bloc’s presence in this House. The question we must ask is: does this motion contribute anything constructive to the current political debate and in what way would Quebec be better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century?</div>
    </p><a name="Para294723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not the sort of question the Bloc Québécois is used to asking itself, since this is not the perspective from which it justifies its presence in the House of Commons. To listen to the Bloc members, its party is here to defend the interests of Quebec, while promoting the separation of Quebec from the rest of Canada, right here, in this Parliament. In fact what it is really defending is its secessionist ideology, not the ideology of Quebeckers. The Bloc Québécois is proposing to Quebeckers a permanent opposition. The Bloc Québécois is harming Quebec’s right to affirm itself. Quebeckers have shaped Canada, in addition to being a founding people. Why deny this? </div>
    </p><a name="Para294724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the Bloc can give the impression of collaborating with us in good faith by regularly supporting any legislation which it could not oppose in any case. Some things are so obvious that that they cannot be missed by anyone, not even a member of the Bloc. But the basic dilemma of this party does not lie only in the gap in logic between its presence in Ottawa and its true raison d'être. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There also exists another fundamental contradiction in the raison d'être of this party, namely, that it promotes virtue, defends the great principles, appeals to the most noble attitudes, fosters solidarity—at the same time as separation—but with this important distinction, which it soft-pedals: the Bloc Québécois will never be in power. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not want to be in power, because it does not believe in this country. It is playing a waiting game and has been doing so for a long time now. In 1995, with the second referendum approaching, did the Bloc not say that sovereignty was magic and that one wave of the magic wand would change everything? That is the sort of argument the Bloc used to try to convince Quebeckers to separate Quebec from the rest of Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para294735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a question that had been dealt with, throughout history, as has the fact that the Quebecois nation has always been a nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far back as April 1946, Maurice Duplessis spoke of the Canadian confederation as a contract of union between two nations. In November 1963, Jean Lesage referred to the Quebecois as a people, as a nation. In February 1968, Daniel Johnson Sr. said that “The Constitution should not have as its sole purpose to federate territories, but also to associate in equality two linguistic and cultural communities, two founding peoples, two societies, two nations”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It goes back to before the arrival of English-speaking people in America. In 1667, Jean Talon already recognized that the French who were here constituted a different people. That is not far from a nation. In 1756, de Bougainville, on his return from Quebec, said: “It seems that we are a different nation”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is more, and it is also significant. In October 2003, when the Liberals had just taken power in Quebec, the National Assembly adopted a unanimous resolution reaffirming that the people of Quebec form a nation . </div>
    </p><a name="Para294739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you so bent on adding “within a united Canada”, unless it is because you want to reopen the debate on sovereignty? Without doubt, we could have that debate, but that was certainly not our original intention. It is not the Bloc Québécois that put the nationhood issue in the news. It was the candidates for the leadership of the Liberal party. I do not understand why you insist on having this debate. I wish you would explain it to me. Why are you so determined to add something? When, without that addition, you say, “We would be saying exactly the same thing as the unanimous National Assembly with a federalist majority”. </div>

    </p><a name="Para294741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, you have to understand that, for my part, I am in agreement with what I have heard here today. I believe that the Bloc Québécois put forward this motion with the aim of laying a trap for both the official opposition and the Conservatives. That is self-evident.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being said, one thing is certain. From the beginning, we have seen the members of the Bloc shouting themselves hoarse and generally getting worked up in the so-called defence of Quebec's best interests. Is that really what people want?</div>
    </p><a name="Para294743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are advocating recognition of Quebeckers as a nation within a united Canada. Why? Because that is the fact today. I agree: all the quotes from the parties and leaders that my colleague has read are true. However, no one in those movements was a separatist. As this motion is coming from a separatist party, this absolutely has to be clarified. I want to say this. The Bloc is always talking about defending the interests of Quebec. It is on the defensive, whereas we, forming a government that believes in a united Canada, we are talking about promoting the interests of Quebec.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Christian Paradis:</b> We believe that we can promote them within one structure, within a united Canada, and that is what is important. This may shock my friends opposite, but it is the reality. Let us proceed. Let us leave the defence and go on the offence. We must promote the interests of Quebec. I am proud to be a Quebecker, just as my colleagues across the way are, and I do not believe in the association they have been trying to bring about here for the last 13 years.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion, tabled this morning and debated by the Bloc Québécois, bears rereading. First, it states that Quebeckers form a nation, not that Quebec is a nation. This is an important nuance, because the fact that we attribute the term “nation” to people or groups of people, such as Quebeckers, is a simple acknowledgement of fact. And the perception of the word “nation”—which apparently makes some people break out in hives—as a “country” is not the intended meaning of the motion that was tabled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, it was the motion tabled by the government and that refers to this nation in the context of a united Canada that is partisan, because it inevitably triggers a debate over two political options, that is, federalism versus sovereignty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems important to me to set a number of things straight today. Could this be a trap or a blueprint for sovereignty? I encourage the members to read the motion over, together with the one adopted by Quebec's National Assembly on October 30, 2003, by which it reaffirmed that the people of Quebec form a nation. The latter is practically identical to the one put forward by the Bloc Québécois. To the extent that this motion put before the National Assembly was unanimously adopted not only by the Parti Québécois, but also by the Quebec Liberal Party and the Action démocratique, both of which are federalist parties, does this mean that the National Assembly adopting this motion represents a blueprint for sovereignty? To state the question is to answer it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the motion put forward by the Bloc Québécois today seeks nothing more, nothing less than recognition of the fact that Quebeckers form a nation, something we wish the federal government and this House would have recognized.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we form a nation? First, because we share a common land to which we belong and which is known as Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we share a common culture characterized by great diversity, a unique Quebec film industry, creative artists who put their art to the service of the Quebec nation to express our common values. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we want to share a common history, which just keeps evolving, building on our past, and which includes Quebeckers of old stock, of course, but also Quebeckers by adoption, who help build Quebec society as we know it and will know it in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fact that, in Quebec, we share a common language, namely French. We are part of the 2% of the North American population trying to survive in this linguistic sea where we are the minority.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705">(1705)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para294763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had to put in place mechanisms enabling us to continue to work, live and evolve in French because we have institutions, because we have a National Assembly that makes legislative changes and that is essentially an institution and a place where the Quebec consensus can be expressed on national as well as international issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, we have the charter of human rights and freedoms and the charter of the French language that provides the greatest number possible of guarantees enabling us to continue living in French. In the 1960s, we decided to use the state as our primary engine of economic development in Quebec by creating the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, equipping ourselves with solid mechanisms, such as the Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec, and with many strong tools appropriate for a nation that wishes to takes its place on the international scene and to take control of its destiny without being contemptuous of English Canada. That is not the kind of debate we are having. We merely wish to reaffirm that Quebec has the right to live and to express itself in French, to share a common culture and history. This affirmation of the Quebec nation, as I mentioned earlier, was reiterated on October 30, 2003, by the members of the Quebec National Assembly, by both federalists and sovereignists, who unanimously adopted a motion stating that the Quebec National Assembly reaffirmed that the Quebec people form a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of respecting this consensus in Quebec that had been confirmed by the National Assembly, instead of allowing this House and this government to accept the basic premise of the National Assembly's proposal, the government decided, no more and no less, to change the elements of this motion. It decided to include in this motion, which will be voted on, the concept of recognizing the people of Quebec in the context of a united Canada. What does that mean? It means that recognizing the Quebec nation is conditional upon staying in Canada, in a united Canada, as it is.</div>

    </p><a name="Para294797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Bloc Québécois is very much in favour of multilateralism as a method of settling international conflicts. The UN peacekeepers embody this approach. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the peacekeepers who have died on UN missions deserve to be commemorated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, this will give our Prime Minister an opportunity to discover peaceful uses for our army. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only shortcoming that we should examine is the date of the commemoration on August 9. I will explain why we do not like this. We prefer a date that is already universally recognized: May 29. We think that the peacekeepers should be honoured in a more international context. There is already an International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, and it is May 29. We think that this date is more appropriate than August 9 in order to demonstrate our solidarity with the entire international community and the choice it has already made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite appropriate to pay tribute to the peacekeepers. They are a central element in multilateralism, a principle of conflict resolution that is dear to Quebeckers. The essentially international characteristic of the peacekeeping missions authorized by the United Nations Security Council grants unparalleled legitimacy to any intervention and attests to the determination of the entire international community to take tangible steps to deal with the crises that occur from time to time. However, peacekeeping operations alone are not the appropriate instrument for every situation. They must be accompanied by a peace process, not simply replace this peace, which is so dear to us and which must be real to everyone around the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United Nations peacekeeping operations are an impartial and very widely accepted way of sharing the burden and of acting effectively among the ordinary people. Peacekeepers are present throughout the world, as we well know.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 18 operations directed by the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, are being carried out on four continents in 10 time zones, employ more than 90,000 people and have a direct influence on the lives of hundreds of millions of others. Close to 64,200 people are currently serving as soldiers and military observers, and roughly 7,500 are in police forces.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Peacekeeping Operations also employs nearly 5,250 international civilian personnel, over 11,300 local civilian personnel and approximately 1,720 United Nations volunteers. One hundred and eight countries contribute military and police personnel to UN peacekeeping operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UN is the largest multilateral contributor to post-conflict stabilization worldwide. Only the United States deploys more military personnel in the field than the United Nations. There is therefore still a long way to go before multilateralism is the most commonly used form of conflict resolution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005 alone, UN peacekeeping operations rotated 161,386 military and police personnel, made 864 flights into or out of the field, and carried 271,651 cubic meters of cargo. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actions of peacekeepers are usually effective. Since 1945, UN peacekeepers have undertaken 60 field missions and negotiated 172 peaceful settlements that have not only ended regional conflicts but also enabled people in more than 45 countries to take part in free and fair elections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UN electoral assistance has become a regular and increasingly important feature in UN peacekeeping operations, bringing democracy to people everywhere on Earth.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UN peacekeeping is cost-effective. A survey by Oxford University economists found that international military intervention under Chapter VII of the UN Charter—action taken when peace is under threat—is the most cost-effective means of reducing the risk of conflict in post-conflict societies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approved DPO budget for the period from July 1, 2006, to June 30, 2007, was approximately $5 billion. This represents less than 0.5% of global military spending.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UN peacekeeping operations are less expensive than other forms of international intervention. UN costs per peacekeeper, as compared to the cost of troops deployed by the U.S., the developed countries, NATO or regional organizations such as the African Union, show that the UN is the least expensive option by far.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated that it would cost the U.S. about twice as much as the UN to conduct a peacekeeping operation similar to the UN stabilization mission in Haiti: $876 million, compared to the UN budgeted $428 million for the first 14 months of the mission. Other comparative advantages of UN peacekeeping cited by this study included its multinational nature, which provides impartiality and legitimacy, burden sharing, involvement of member states with experience in post-conflict peace-building operations and a structure for coordinating international assistance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 29 is a more appropriate date for commemorating peacekeepers. That is the date chosen by the United Nations as the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers. Indeed, May 29 commemorates Security Council Resolution 50, which was passed on May 29, 1948, and which provided for the establishment of the first United Nations peacekeeping operation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that May 29 should have been preferred over August 9, because it is more universal, in keeping with a principle at the very heart of the institution that the peacekeepers represent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for August 9, it reflects a form of self-centredness or isolationism that is not consistent with the principle we want to convey to future generations on that occasion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by saying that August 9 refers to the day in 1974 when Canada suffered the heaviest losses in a single day during a UN mission in the Middle East. May 29 is an appropriate date. I urge the House to vote in favour of this bill with the date of May 29.</div>

Specifically, the act would make August 9 national peacekeepers' day and calls for the lowering of the Canadian flag on the Peace Tower to half mast on that day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preamble of the bill, it talks about a great Canadian, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, who proposed the first United Nations peacekeeping mission. Mr. Pearson won a Nobel Prize for his actions. Those actions moved Canada to the forefront in the world and our country became the leader in keeping the peace with more than 100,000 members of the Canadian Forces participating in peacekeeping and peace support missions, along with many members of Canadian police services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preamble also talks about the reasons for choosing August 9. August 9 was the day in 1974 that nine Canadian Forces' peacekeepers were killed when their plane was shot down en route to Damascus from Beirut. When this bill passes, as I am sure it will since I know everyone in this House respects our peacekeepers, on the ninth day of the ninth month of every year, the flag on the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill will be lowered to half mast to honour not only those nine who lost their lives, but every peacekeeper before or since, either living or dead, who has served or is serving this country so bravely for such a noble cause.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about those women and men who serve our country in many capacities within the military. I have a military base in my riding and I have spoken of it on numerous occasions, CFB Comox. I have had the pleasure on several occasions to enjoy the hospitality of the 19 Wing Commander, as well as other officers, their staff and employees at the base.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first things we learn when we visit the base is the military ethos: “Duty with Honour”. We learn about the pride that they take in their roles serving our country. 19 Wing Comox has a rich history dating back to 1942 when the base was constructed. It was constructed to protect the strategic Pacific coastline in the second world war. Today, its two operational squadrons fly the Aurora maritime patrol aircraft, the Buffalo search and rescue aircraft and the Cormorant helicopters. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the five Aurora airplanes, the pilot and crews of the 407 Maritime Patrol Squadron spend long hours on surveillance missions over the ocean looking for illegal fishing, migration, drugs and pollution, in addition to foreign submarines. They can also perform search and rescue missions using air droppable survival kits. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With six Buffalo aircraft and five Cormorant helicopters, 442 Transport and Rescue Squadron carries out search and rescue operations in the busiest region in Canada. It is a very vast region. As we can see on a map, the area stretches from the B.C.-Washington border to the Arctic and from the Rocky Mountains to 1,200 kilometres out into the Pacific Ocean.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its operational squadrons, the Wing is home to 19 air maintenance squadrons and a national training school, the Canadian Forces School of Search and Rescue. 19 Wing also supports cadet training at the Regional Cadet Gliding School at HMCS Quadra sea cadet camp. I might add that my young nephew, Gibson, is a proud sea cadet at HMCS Quadra and we are all very proud of him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men and women who join our military do so because they want to serve our country. They are proud to do the job we ask them to do. They are honoured to serve their country and I am honoured to have met many of them and to see first-hand their commitment to making the world a better place to live. Many of those women and men join for the exciting career opportunities, many of which I have just mentioned in my overview of 19 Wing Comox. Many of those professions are provided in our military services.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730">(1730)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para294826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the men and women who join the forces do so because Canada is a world leader in keeping the peace. But our boots on the ground are losing ground. Canada was once a top 10 contributor of military personnel to United Nations missions. Now we rank 50th out of 95 countries. Less than one-tenth of 1% of the military personnel participating in UN missions are Canadian. Since 2001 our spending commitment to UN operations has only been $214.2 million of the over $6 billion on all international missions. That is a mere 3% for peacekeeping.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, Canada is not alone in having virtually abandoned UN peacekeeping. Most of the western aligned middle power states now contribute very little to UN missions. While Canada ranks eighth in military contributions among the 26 NATO member countries, there are eight non-NATO countries that each contribute more military personnel to UN operations than do all the NATO members combined.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sends a very strong signal to the rest of the world that Canada no longer takes the same amount of pride in peacekeeping that it once did. It sends the message that war-torn countries looking for help from the UN should not count on Canada for much support. It also sends the message to those women and men who are so bravely serving as peacekeepers that the work they are doing in other countries so far away is not as important as other military commitments where we are spending much more money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the role of peacekeepers has changed considerably since its inception. I also do not have my head buried in the sand about the dangers of the missions we send our peacekeepers into. I know that they sometimes have to use force, sometimes even kill, or sadly are killed, defending the peace and security of the area they are tasked to defend. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean the idea of peacekeeping is a thing of the past. We cannot, we must not, lose sight of what everyone in this world ultimately wants: to live in peace and security, to live without war and strife. It is an age-old dream and one which we must never stop working toward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it is so important to make sure we are giving our military and peacekeepers the tools they need to do the job that we ask them to do. Some of those tools are tangible, such as tanks, airplanes, ships, guns, clothing, food and other necessities, but also support when they are at home, decent wages and benefits, adequate housing, social supports in the communities and supports for families when the parents are deployed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things that money just cannot buy, and that is knowing that at the end of the day the duty of peacekeepers is honoured by all Canadians. They serve us so proudly, so bravely. They pay the ultimate sacrifice. It is the least we can do by honouring them.</div>

It is certainly appropriate. Parliament has passed bills in the past and previous ministers have also recognized special days. I think of Vimy Ridge Day, April 9, to honour our soldiers who fought at Vimy Ridge in 1917. National Aboriginal Day is in June.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the bill is to recognize the tremendous role and the history of peacekeepers in this country since the days of Lester B. Pearson. In 1956 he first proposed at the United Nations a peacekeeping mission with regard to the Suez Canal crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically in the world, armies have been involved in combat and often in peacemaking rather than peacekeeping. After the Suez Canal crisis, in November 1956, for the first time countries in the region, including Egypt and Israel, agreed to the proposal to have peacekeepers there. Canada's foreign affairs minister at the time, Lester Pearson, proposed the United Nations expeditionary force to go there and basically separate Egyptian and Israeli troops. For this he received the Nobel Peace Price in 1957. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have been very proud and have been recognized around the world for their peacekeeping efforts. We have trained. Whether it is on the Golan Heights with Japanese troops, whether it is in Cambodia, or elsewhere, our troops have been recognized for their peacekeeping efforts. People recognize the expertise of Canadians in the peacekeeping field. That is very important. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national peacekeepers' day would be a day to take time to pause, to think about all of those missions in which Canadians have participated around the world, for example, Cyprus. It would be day to recognize what Canadians have contributed to assist in maintaining not only peace, but also in the promotion of that peace. It is very important to recognize the contribution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations under the Security Council gives the power and responsibility to take collective action when it comes to peace and security around the world. For this reason, the international community looks at these types of operations where Canadians and others have played such an important role in the past.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know all members of the House are very supportive and very proud of the role of our peacekeepers. Over 100,000 Canadian Forces participate in peacekeeping and peace support missions around the world. Regrettably, over 100 have been killed in action over the years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress the importance of a national peacekeeping day. It would be a day to remember, a day to reflect and a day to pause. The Department of Canadian Heritage does a tremendous job in educating Canadians with information packets, brochures, et cetera. I would envision in declaring August 9 national peacekeepers' day, and I will explain why August 9 in a moment, that it would be in part to educate Canadians, particularly young people. It is very important that they understand the role. Why August 9? Because regrettably, 32 years ago on August 9, nine Canadian peacekeepers en route from Beirut to Damascus were killed by a surface missile.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79017,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79017&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</A> in proposing this bill and suggesting August 9 as the day, not only to remember those nine brave Canadians who lost their lives in the quest for peace, but also to recognize in a broader sense all of those who have continued to serve and will serve this country in the future, and to pay homage.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the son of a World War II veteran who fought on the shores of Normandy through the Battle of the Falaise Gap, through Caen, through Belgium and Holland. Unfortunately he had shrapnel in his legs until the day he died and suffered from the loss of hearing in one ear from being buried alive when his tank was hit by a shell. I was always instilled with the importance of the role of Canadian soldiers.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a fact that freedom does not come cheaply. We are engaged in what I would consider to be a peacemaking mission in Afghanistan. Whether it is a peacekeeping role in Cyprus, the fact is that Canadians have always stepped up and contributed effectively over the years. In situations of civil wars, ethnic cleansing, genocides, Canadian peacekeepers have worked to save the lives of many people around the world. They are heroes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally when we think of peacekeepers, we do not think of them as being involved in conflict situations. Regrettably from time to time they could be fired upon by other parties as they were in Bosnia, or when they could hit a mine when travelling along a road. Our peacekeepers put their lives on the line every day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all members of this House would join me in supporting the recognition of a national peacekeepers' day on August 9.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned that over the last 53 years we have seen Canadians participate in many theatres and also assist other countries in the art and the role of peacekeeping. When Canadians wear their blue berets or blue helmets, people know that peacekeepers are there to improve the quality of life for individuals in very difficult situations. They are there to assist in the peace process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that sometimes Canadians are not aware of the difference between peacekeeping and peacemaking. Some would argue that in 1993 Somalia was not a peacekeeping mission; it was a peacemaking mission. Afghanistan is a peacemaking mission, although we are there obviously to try to improve the lives of people who are in a very difficult situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition is important. We do not do this lightly. We do not declare national holidays. National peacekeepers' day would not be a bank holiday, or something in that regard. In a sense it would be a day to reflect. I think it is important as a recognition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too far from Parliament Hill there is a monument to Canadian peacekeepers around the world, to their dedication and hard work. It is incumbent upon parliamentarians and Canadians in general not only to recognize the contribution of peacekeepers, but also to help educate people on the role of peacekeeping.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former educator, I can say that nothing is more effective than making sure that materials are available in schools. I commend the Department of Canadian Heritage for the tremendous work it does in ensuring that information material is available.</div>

This private member's bill is very sincere and well intentioned but I would, however, like to add some perspective that I feel qualified to offer.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty years ago, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company and that event gave rise to armed conflict with Egypt on one side and Israel, Britain and France on the other. Eighteen hundred and fifty-three lives were lost. British prime minister, Anthony Eden, was forced to resign and the British, French and Israeli forces withdrew in March 1957.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before the withdrawal, Lester Pearson, Canada's acting cabinet minister for external affairs, went to the United Nations and suggested creating a United Nations emergency force in the Suez. The United Nations accepted his suggestion and, after several days of tense diplomacy, a neutral force was sent, with the consent of Egyptian President Nasser, stabilizing conditions in the area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lester Pearson was awarded the Nobel Peace Price in 1957 for his efforts. The United Nations peacekeeping force was Lester Pearson's creation and he is considered the father of the modern concept of peacekeeping. Since that time, Canada has lost close 115 personnel on what have been called peacekeeping missions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a speech in Edmonton recently, Lieutenant-General Andrew Leslie, Chief of the Land Staff, recalled wryly that it was hard to classify the operations in Croatia and Bosnia as peacekeeping when artillery rounds were routinely whistling overhead. The name that we give to operations in no way changes the sacrifice that Canadian Forces personnel and their families have made in their conduct of those operations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 50 years, many Canadians have become accustomed to the idea that we are a nation of peacekeepers despite the fact that our soldiers have been assigned mainly to missions other than those carried out by the UN blue berets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is one of the major military forces in the world for some good and some not so good reasons. The Canadian Forces act as instruments of peace every day. Whether in the First World War, the Second World War, Korea, Suez, Cypress, the Balkans, the first Gulf war, Afghanistan, various missions in the Middle East, roles within NORAD and NATO for about 50 years, and many other missions too numerous to mention, the Canadian Forces have contributed to peace and security.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I do not wear any of the traditional peacekeeping medals, I flew thousands of hours of peacekeeping missions in the CF-104 Starfighter and the CF-18 Hornet in North America and Europe. I spent thousands of hours as a flying instructor teaching others to carry out those missions. My flying helmet was not blue but that did not detract from the ultimate objective of every mission that I flew.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several times during the first hour and a half or so of debate on this bill, the tragic and criminal incident of the shooting down of a Canadian Forces Buffalo aircraft by a Syrian surface to air missile on August 9, 1974, was cited. Nine Canadians were killed during this routine supply mission to Egypt. The Syrians maintained that the attack was an accident but no one bought that story. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall very clearly when I heard the news that day. I was driving southbound on the autobahn in Germany between our bases of Baden Soellingen and Lahr. One of the names that was released was Captain Keith Mirau. Keith and I had been flying instructors together at Gimli, Manitoba on our previous tours. The loss of Captain Mirau and his eight crew members was mourned appropriately. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During and since my career in the air force, I have attended many dozens of funerals mourning the loss of friends and acquaintances who have died in the line of duty in the uniform of the Canadian Forces.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para294870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one of those losses was tragic, and the families did not distinguish between deaths caused by a CF-18 crashing in Cold Lake, a diving accident near Esquimalt, a submarine fire in the middle of the ocean, a sniper in Cyprus or Bosnia, a vehicle rollover in Wainwright, a gunshot in the Middle East or fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every member of the Canadian Forces who died in the line of duty represents a sacrifice in the name of peace, and they are all worthy of the title “peacekeepers”.</div>

He contended that Canada has not adjusted well to the realities of what has been called peace enforcement. He said, “We not only don't contribute enough to peacekeeping, we are not training to do the right kind of peacekeeping, which is combat-capable peace enforcement in zones of conflict, like Afghanistan and the Balkans”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired Major General Lewis Mackenzie has argued that the inability of the UN to prevent human slaughter in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda would have been solved by firmer military force.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many other countries, Canada sets aside one day to remember Canadians in uniform who gave their lives in the name of freedom, regardless of how they made that sacrifice. That day is Remembrance Day, and we celebrate it every November 11.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para294876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all spent time in our ridings recently commemorating the courage and sacrifice of Canadian men and women in the cause of peace. Remembrance Day has had more meaning for Canadians in recent years but, as always, the sacrifice to which we pay homage was not in the cause of war but in the cause of peace. Canada has lost over 116,000 courageous men and women in uniform in the cause of peace since 1914. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 9 is already designated and celebrated as Peacekeeping Day.

I equate this to the Battle of the Atlantic Day and the Battle of Britain Day ceremonies—celebrated to show respect, concern, admiration and remembrance but being neither a national holiday nor an event requiring the lowering of the Peace Tower flag.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until last November, there were six books in honour of Canadian men and women who died in the first world war, the second world war, the Korean war, the South African war and the Nile expedition as well as the fallen from Newfoundland before it joined Confederation and those who gave their lives serving where my dad served in the merchant marines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 11, 2005, the Year of the Veteran, the Governor General came to Parliament Hill to dedicate the Seventh Book of Remembrance, which is entitled “In Service of Canada”. On its pages are the names of those who died while serving Canada since 1947, with the exception of those who died in the Korean war. It includes the names of those Canadians who died on many peacekeeping missions. It is a permanent testament to the enormous risks taken by those who wear a uniform, both at home and abroad. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not remind my colleagues that the Seventh Book is unique, because it will never close. It will also commemorate those in future generations when they give their lives in the service of this great nation, Canada.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800">(1800)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para294907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been reminded all too well in recent weeks of the tremendous sacrifice made by our soldiers. I have visited them, both those who have returned without wounds and those who have returned seriously wounded. I have attended funerals as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been inspired by their stories and the courage of their families and friends as they cope with the tragic loss of their loved ones. They are in our thoughts and they are most certainly in our prayers. May they take some measure of comfort knowing that our nation will not forget their service and sacrifice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the issue of remembrance. In the past few years, especially during the Year of the Veteran, this year called Share the Story, I have been impressed by the increasing number of Canadians who gather at memorials and cenotaphs in their communities in honour of their local heroes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the essence of November 11 and it is also the inspiration of August 9, to express our gratitude to those who served our nation and to commemorate the sacrifice of those who lost their lives. In fact, if I have any concern at all regarding this bill, if any concerns have been expressed by the veterans community, and if it is in any danger whatsoever, it is because there may be a danger in obscuring the memorial we have on the 11th day of the 11th month at the 11th hour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also encouraged by the work that our schools are doing to stimulate interest in Canada's military history and heritage. In many schools it was commemorated during Remembrance Week. I would like to applaud the efforts of all those teachers who take the time to organize special learning experiences for their young students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadian citizens we should not take for granted the sacrifice made by those who lay down their lives so that others may enjoy peace and freedom. It is our collective duty to remember them. They deserve no less.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think too that we also pay tribute to our veterans through the services and programs we provide to them and the way in which we do so. As my colleagues would know, veterans returning from the second world war had access to a veterans charter, a series of programs and services intended to aid their rehabilitation to civilian life. Over the years, those programs were adjusted in line with the changing needs of our aging veterans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these programs are not well suited to the needs of younger Canadian Forces veterans and earlier this year in April a new veterans charter was put in place. As the Minister of Veterans Affairs said at the time, “The new charter represents a new chapter in Canada's longstanding commitment to take care of those who take care of us at home and abroad”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also committed to keeping alive the memory of those whose noble and selfless sacrifice represent the very highest ideals of public service. On August 9 and on November 11 at the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them. We will remember them.</div>

    </p><a name="Para294923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked if the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s promise to support a cost-shared agreement to complete the Trans-Labrador Highway meant the entire road, including the south coast and phase III. I asked if the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> committed to fifty-fifty cost-shared funding, as Premier Williams said. The province has already budgeted this non-existent federal money, which is very unusual.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no meaningful response to either question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of background, in the 1970s and 1980s, under current Senator Rompkey, federal Liberal governments provided the first major highway funding for Labrador, funding for the Straits highway, and for the Wabush to Churchill Falls road, but in the 1988 roads for rails deal, concocted by the federal and provincial Conservatives, just $8 million out of over $800 million went to Labrador. The Tories sold us out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a Liberal government in 1997 to help right this injustice. The $340 million Labrador transportation initiative funded the reconstruction of the Wabush to Happy Valley-Goose Bay road, the construction of the south coast highway, and several branch roads. It has also funded a portion of phase III, which will link the other two sections, despite the provincial promise to pay for it with its own funds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservatives have never shown an interest in the Trans-Labrador Highway other than during byelection campaigns. In the 1996 byelection, the Reform and the PCs suddenly discovered Labrador. They ridiculed the fifty-fifty funding formula that the premier now calls for. They made lavish highway promises, then disappeared.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, with another byelection looming, the Conservatives rediscovered Labrador. By then, federal Liberal funding had seen the construction of more highways in Labrador than under the Mulroney and Peckford Conservatives put together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During that campaign, the current defence minister said that “a Conservative government would commit funds to complete Phase III of the Trans-Labrador Highway” and that it “would share the cost on a 60/40” [federal-provincial] basis”, but in the 2006 election the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> would only vaguely offer “a cost-shared agreement”. The sixty-forty figure was gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294930"></a><p>

In a letter to me, the transport minister admits that federal highway plans “have yet to be determined”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towns like Labrador City and Happy Valley-Goose Bay are impatient with Conservative inaction. On the coast, residents worry that the Conservatives will ignore their needs altogether. The provincial transportation minister talks of highways and money but makes no mention of a plan for a coastal highway and connecting the unconnected communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provincial transportation minister said in August that he expected a roads deal by next June. More recently he changed the deadline to this Christmas, yet nobody has seen the province's official proposal to the federal government. According to a New Brunswick media report, there is no federal highways program anyway. The transport minister has generously given himself 10 years to come up with one. So much for a deal by Christmas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot wait for 10 years, so I will ask my question again. Is the Conservative minority government committed to cost-sharing the Trans-Labrador Highway on a fifty-fifty basis? Will this include the whole Labrador Highway from Labrador City to the Straits? Has the province made an official proposal? Is federal funding even available? Will Labrador have a highway deal by Christmas?</div>

    </p><a name="Para294935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada highways fall under provincial and territorial jurisdiction which the member knows. I am wondering why the member is part of a party that for 13 years had the opportunity to do whatever it pretty much wanted in Labrador as far as highways were concerned and did absolutely nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that, we are responsible for national parks highways and a portion of the Alaska Highway which are under federal jurisdiction. Provincial and territorial governments are therefore responsible for deciding on the planning, the construction, the operation and the financing of highways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, unlike some governments in the past, do not interfere in provincial jurisdiction. We are there to help Canadians and help provinces fulfill their mandate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless in today's increasingly global environment the Conservative government is going to take action. It recognizes that investments in transportation infrastructure are absolutely crucial to maintaining Canada's competitiveness and most importantly the quality of life of Canadians. That is the most important challenge the Conservative government has and the government is going to fulfill that mandate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show what we are doing as a government, in budget 2006 we announced $16.5 billion over the next four years to improve provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure. The reason why is because nothing was done by the Liberal government before. It took a Conservative government to make this promise because of 13 years of inaction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unprecedented amount. It has never happened before and after 13 years of neglect, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador are looking forward to the results that we are going to get for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the budget a key objective of the funding will be to cost share with the provinces and territories improvements to the core national highway system. Also, the government is considering how the new funding should be used to address the multi-modal priorities identified in the Council of the Federation's report, “Looking to the Future: A plan for investing in Canada's transportation system”. What can be more important than transportation for our quality of life and for our economy?</div>
    </p><a name="Para294942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is also committed to restoring fiscal balance, something that the Liberal Party has never even identified as being an issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the summer the transport infrastructure and communities portfolio held consultations with provinces, territories and other stakeholders under this Conservative minister's direction on the federal role of infrastructure. We want to have predictable, long term, long track funding, so people can count on it, but also we need to ensure that this funding is done, so that people cannot steal that money, that we are accountable to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These consultations provided valuable input and we are going to listen to Canadians, and do what they say in relation to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national highway system of which we speak here had a review and recently it was undertaken to see whether that system was serving Canadians properly. As a result we discovered it was not under the Liberal government and we expanded it. It was expanded in 2005 and includes three distinct categories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trans-Labrador Highway has been included in the northern and remote category of the national highway system, so it is included in that system, like Highway 63 north to Fort McMurray. Indeed, that highway must meet applicable program parameters and funding criteria. </div>
    </p><a name="Para294947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiscal balance consultations have identified many competing priorities and pressures across all jurisdictions. We, after 13 years of neglect, are going to do something. That is why I am pleased that the Conservative government intends to honour its commitment to contribute $50 million for the surfacing of the Trans-Labrador Highway.</div>
    </p><a name="Para294948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are awaiting at this stage a business case from the province in order to ensure that the project will provide results for Canadians and accountability for Canadians.</div>
