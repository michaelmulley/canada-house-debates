</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have the honour to inform the House 
that when this House did attend Her Excellency this day in the 
Senate chamber, Her Excellency was pleased to make a speech to 
both houses of Parliament.  To prevent mistakes I have obtained a 
copy which is as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Honourable Members of the Senate,<BR> 
Members of the House of Commons,<BR> 
Ladies and Gentlemen:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my great pleasure to greet you on this first day of the 37th 
Parliament since Confederation. The vital 
relationship that exists between the Canadian people and Parliament is 
what we celebrate today through 
history, custom and symbolism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have the pleasure of welcoming new members to the House of Commons, 
and I want all 
parliamentarians to know how deeply I appreciate the ideals that motivate 
you to serve your country. I 
also appreciate the sacrifices brought on by your task and made in the 
name of the common good and of 
leadership. And in a healthy democracy, leadership can come from everyone, 
because it is a sense of 
really knowing what you want and what you can contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little more than a year ago, I became Canada's 26th Governor General. I 
set out as the main objective 
of my first year in office to visit every province and territory and to 
meet as many Canadians as possible, 
wherever they live and make their lives—to engage in a true dialogue 
with them. I have seen many 
places that Canadians have decided to call home, from big cities to small 
hamlets, from the Island of 
Montreal to Ellesmere Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what we call home is more than a place name on a map. It is our 
belonging to a community of ideas 
and ideals; it is the knowledge that we can say something and be listened 
to, and the conviction that we 
can respect, rely upon and help each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meeting Canadians across the country has given me the opportunity to hear 
about the different 
challenges we face. Looking at these issues, we of course remember that we 
have demonstrated, time 
and time again, that we have the self-confidence to act, and to act 
successfully. Change does not frighten 
us—we have always harnessed it to our advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that our country's strength lies in its diversity. Why is 
this so? Because diversity imposes 
serious responsibilities. Indeed, if we accept our place in a rich and 
successful society, we must also 
acknowledge and engage with the parts of our society that are less advantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government has been given a third mandate by Canadians. In leading 
Canada into the new 
millennium, its overarching goal will continue to be to build a stronger, 
ever more inclusive Canada and 
secure a higher quality of life for all Canadians. In pursuing this aim, 
the Government will carry out the 
commitments set out in its election platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is proud, optimistic and strong. The Government has achieved the 
critical objective of restoring 
the nation's finances. The economy continues its longest period of 
economic expansion since the 1960s. 
Inflation and interest rates are low and stable. More than two million new 
jobs have been created since 
1993. Significant new investments are being made in children and youth, in 
innovation and skills, in health 
care, and in the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter this new century, Canada and Canadians face the challenges of 
competing in a faster-paced, 
technology-driven world economy. Of responding to economic uncertainty 
among our trading partners. Of 
continuing to strengthen the fabric of our society in an era of increasing 
globalization. And of advancing 
our Canadian interests and values in the international arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that every region, every province and territory, every 
community, and every citizen has a 
strong voice and can contribute to building our nation. To bring the 
benefits of our prosperity to all 
communities, whether urban, rural, Northern or remote. To promote 
innovation, growth and development 
in all parts of our economy, including our agricultural and resource 
sectors and our manufacturing and 
service industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must rise to these challenges. Success in our more 
interdependent and complex world will 
require the contribution of all Canadians. The Government of Canada, for 
its part, will focus on: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>building a world-leading economy driven by innovation, ideas and talent; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>creating a more inclusive society where children get the right start in 
life, where quality health 
services are available to all, and where Canadians enjoy strong and safe 
communities; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>ensuring a clean, healthy environment for Canadians and the preservation 
of our natural spaces; 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>enhancing our Canadian voice in the world and our shared sense of 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Government of Canada will be 
guided by the values of Canadians. It will 
work with other levels of government, the private and voluntary sectors, 
and individual citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will continue to set bold goals and work toward them in a pragmatic, 
step-by-step way. It will continue to 
be a prudent steward of the nation's finances as it focusses on the 
priorities of Canadians. Its efforts will 
be affordable and sustainable. The Government reaffirms its commitment to 
balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assist the Government in fulfilling its responsibilities, Canada must 
have a public service distinguished 
by excellence and equipped with the skills for a knowledge economy and 
society. The Government will 
seek bright, motivated young women and men to accept the challenge of 
serving their country in the 
federal public service. The Government is committed to the reforms needed 
for the Public Service of 
Canada to continue evolving and adapting. These reforms will ensure that 
the Public Service is 
innovative, dynamic and reflective of the diversity of the country—able 
to attract and develop the talent 
needed to serve Canadians in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will help to create opportunity for Canadians and ensure 
that opportunity is shared by 
all. This is the Canadian Way for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating Opportunity
</I></B></P><P align=left>An innovative economy is essential to creating opportunity for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An innovative economy is driven by research and development. It requires a 
highly skilled work force and 
investments in new technology. A business environment and tax policies 
that encourage smart risk taking 
and entrepreneurship and that reward success. An attractive environment 
for investment. And a strong 
global brand for Canadian excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An innovative economy is one where the benefits of new ideas are shared by 
every sector and every 
region—from East to West to North, from office workers to farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has laid a solid foundation for success in the new economy. Our 
economic fundamentals are 
among the best in the world. Spiralling debt and deficits have been 
replaced by social and economic 
investments, tax cuts and debt repayments. On January 1st of this year, 
most elements of the 
Government's comprehensive and broad-based package of $100 billion in tax 
relief took effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are better positioned than at any time in the last three decades to 
seize the opportunities of the global 
economy and to weather a short-term slowing of growth experienced by 
Canada's major trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Innovation 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To secure our continued success in the 21st century, Canadians must be 
among the first to generate new 
knowledge and put it to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective should be no less than to be recognized as one of the most 
innovative countries in the 
world. Achieving this will require a comprehensive approach and the 
support and participation of all 
governments, businesses, educational institutions, and individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must strive for Canada to become one of the top five countries for 
research and development 
performance by 2010. This is a challenge for all Canadians, but in 
particular for the private sector as the 
largest research investor in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As its contribution, the Government will at least double the current 
federal investment in research and 
development by 2010. In making new investments, the Government will: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>continue to pursue excellence in Canadian research by strengthening the 
research capacity of 
Canadian universities and government laboratories and institutions; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>accelerate Canada's ability to commercialize research discoveries, 
turning them into new 
products and services; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>pursue a global strategy for Canadian science and technology, supporting 
more collaborative 
international research at the frontiers of knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New federal investments will include strategically targetted research that 
is co-ordinated with partners. 
These investments will directly benefit Canadians in areas such as health, 
water quality, the environment, 
natural resources management, and oceans research. Among its investments, 
the Government will 
increase support for the development of new technologies to assist 
Canadians with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research in life sciences will benefit all of Canada, particularly our 
agricultural and rural economies. The 
Government will help Canada's agricultural sector move beyond crisis 
management—leading to more 
genuine diversification and value-added growth, new investments and 
employment, better land use, and 
high standards of environmental stewardship and food safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Skills and Learning
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will only realize its full potential by investing aggressively in 
the skills and talents of its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To succeed in the knowledge economy, Canada will need people with advanced 
skills and 
entrepreneurial spirit. Canada's youth are optimistic, technologically 
savvy, globally connected and the 
most highly educated generation in our history. The Government will 
continue to help young Canadians 
contribute to their country, gain employment, and apply their business and 
creative skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a skilled work force must be a national effort. The Government of 
Canada will work with 
provinces and territories and with non-governmental organizations to 
ensure that all Canadians, young 
and old, can achieve their learning goals. Canada must see at least one 
million more adults pursue 
learning opportunities during the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will also help adults who want to improve their skills, but 
who may face difficulty in 
finding the time or resources to do this while providing for themselves 
and their families. It will create 
Registered Individual Learning Accounts to make it easier for Canadians to 
finance their learning. And it 
will improve the loans that are available to part-time students, so more 
workers can learn while they earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Canadians face particular challenges in upgrading their skills and 
enhancing their education. The 
Government will take steps to make it easier for them to access skills and 
learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth at risk are among the most likely to drop out of school or to have 
difficulty in making the 
transition from school to work. The Government will work with its partners 
to ensure support for 
youth who particularly need help staying in school or getting their first job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, many Canadian adults lack the higher literacy skills needed in 
the new economy. The 
Government of Canada will invite the provinces and territories along with 
the private sector and 
voluntary organizations to launch a national initiative with the goal of 
significantly increasing the 
proportion of adults with these higher-level skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons with disabilities face barriers to full participation in the 
economy and society. The 
Government of Canada will work with the provinces and territories and 
other partners toward a 
comprehensive labour-market strategy for persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing numbers of Aboriginal people are developing their business 
skills and competing in the 
new economy. The Government will work with Aboriginal people to help 
strengthen their 
entrepreneurial and business expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigrants have enriched Canada with their ideas and talents. The 
Government will take steps to help 
Canada attract the skilled workers it needs. It will also work in 
co-operation with the provinces and 
territories to secure better recognition of the foreign credentials of new 
Canadians and their more rapid 
integration into society. The Government will re-introduce changes to 
immigration legislation to streamline 
and improve the immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Connecting Canadians
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government has helped to make Canada one of the most connected 
countries in the world, yet the 
speed of change continues to accelerate. Canada must continue to develop 
and strengthen its 
information infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector today is expanding high-speed access to the Internet in 
many regions. The National 
Broadband Task Force will advise the Government on how Canadians together 
can achieve the critical 
goal of making broadband access widely available to citizens, businesses, 
public institutions and to all 
communities in Canada by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will continue to support the Community Access Program and 
SchoolNet, ensuring that 
Canadians, their communities and their schools can have an on-ramp to the 
information highway. These 
programs are critical to Canada's effort to close the digital divide, 
particularly in rural, remote, Northern 
and Aboriginal communities. The Government will also enhance SchoolNet, 
focussing on creating more 
and better learning content on-line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will continue to work toward putting its services on-line 
by 2004, to better connect with 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also modernize federal privacy law to safeguard the personal 
information of Canadians and provide 
better copyright protection for new ideas and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade and Investment
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government's investments in innovation, skills and connectivity, as 
well as its reduction of corporate 
taxes and improved treatment of capital gains, are making Canada one of 
the most attractive places to 
invest and to do business. In addition, the Government will: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>ensure that Canadian laws and regulations remain among the most modern 
and progressive in 
the world, including those for intellectual property and competitiveness; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>re-introduce legislation to promote a strong and efficient financial 
services sector that will benefit 
the Canadian economy and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will work closely with the United States, Canada's most 
important trading partner, to 
maintain secure and efficient access to each other's markets. It will 
continue the joint work begun to 
modernize the shared border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City this April, the 
Government will advance work toward 
creating the Free Trade Area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will also launch a branding strategy to raise awareness of 
the advantages of investing in 
Canada. As part of this effort, the Government will continue its 
successful Team Canada trade missions 
and launch Investment Team Canada missions to the United States and Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sharing Opportunity
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Way recognizes that economic and social success must be 
pursued together. We cannot 
build a prosperous society in the absence of economic growth. We cannot 
lead in innovation and new 
ideas without healthy and secure citizens. We must not pursue our 
interests in the world without 
strengthening our distinct culture and values here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is the creation and sharing of opportunity more important than for 
Aboriginal people. Too many 
continue to live in poverty, without the tools they need to build a better 
future for themselves or their 
communities. As a country, we must be direct about the magnitude of the 
challenge and ambitious in our 
commitment to tackle the most pressing problems facing Aboriginal people. 
Reaching our objectives will 
take time, but we must not be deterred by the length of the journey or the 
obstacles that we may 
encounter along the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government is committed to strengthening its relationship with 
Aboriginal people. It will support First 
Nations communities in strengthening governance, including implementing 
more effective and transparent 
administrative practices. And it will work to ensure that basic needs are 
met for jobs, health, education, 
housing and infrastructure. This commitment will be reflected in all the 
Government's priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children and Families
</I></B></P><P align=left>Securing a good start in life for children is the only way to ensure that 
they are ready to learn, to seize 
opportunity as adults, and to contribute to the building of their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time in Canada when retirement often meant facing a new life 
of hardship. A generation ago, 
Canadians set a national goal to eliminate poverty among seniors, and we 
have made significant 
progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time in this country when falling sick meant risking one's 
life savings. Working together, 
Canadians built a national, publicly funded health care system to ensure 
access to quality care for every 
citizen regardless of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when losing a job also meant immediate loss of income for 
workers and their families. 
And so Canadians created Employment Insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Canadians must undertake another national project—to ensure that no 
Canadian child suffers the 
debilitating effects of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and their governments have already taken significant steps in 
this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strong economy and job creation have been essential to reducing poverty 
and ensuring that families 
have the resources to care for their children. But economic growth alone 
is not enough. Governments 
also have a key role to play in helping families left behind and in 
providing support to families and 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments have put in place a range of measures to help families and 
children. The National Child 
Benefit is the cornerstone of our collective efforts to provide children 
with a better start. It is the single 
most important social program to be introduced in this country since 
medicare in the 1960s. The 
Government of Canada's contribution to the National Child Benefit will 
continue to rise over the next four 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently, the Government of Canada and provinces and territories 
launched the Early Childhood 
Development initiative to expand and improve access to services for all 
families and children. The 
Government of Canada is investing more than $2 billion in this initiative 
over five years. As part of this 
agreement, governments will begin reporting to Canadians on the outcomes 
of their programs and 
services for children. These reports will give the Government of Canada 
and its partners the information 
they need to take whatever additional steps are necessary to provide 
Canadian children with a better start 
in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will also take immediate action with its partners 
where the challenges are 
greatest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Single parents and their children often face special challenges 
overcoming poverty. The 
governments of Canada, New Brunswick and British Columbia have been testing new 
approaches to help single parents become more self-sufficient. The 
Government of Canada is 
prepared to test innovations with other provinces and territories, with 
the longer-term aim of 
developing new measures that help these parents overcome poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will work with its partners on modernizing the laws for 
child support, custody, 
and access—to ensure that these work in the best interests of children 
in cases of family 
breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will improve the support available to parents and caregivers in times 
of family crisis. No 
Canadian should have to choose between keeping their job and providing 
palliative care to a 
child. The Government will take steps to enable parents to provide care to 
a gravely ill child 
without fear of sudden income or job loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In securing a better future for Aboriginal children, the Government will 
work with First Nations to 
improve and expand the early childhood development programs and services 
available in their 
communities. It will also expand significantly the Aboriginal Head Start 
program, to better prepare 
more Aboriginal children for school and help those with special needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will also co-operate with Aboriginal 
communities and provinces and 
territories on the measures required to reduce the number of Aboriginal 
newborns affected by 
fetal alcohol syndrome. No child should experience this syndrome, but 
Canada's immediate aim 
must be to significantly reduce its incidence in the Aboriginal population 
by the end of this 
decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good Health and Quality Care
</I></B></P><P align=left>A healthy Canadian society is built on the health and well-being of 
individual Canadians and the health of 
our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians place a high priority on good health and on their health care 
system. We know that our system 
of medicare, which ensures access to needed services regardless of income 
or place of residence, is vital 
to our quality of life. It is a Canadian advantage and deeply valued by 
all citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will uphold the Canada Health Act. It will work 
with the provinces and 
territories to ensure that all governments continue to fulfil their 
commitment to the principles of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments in Canada have come together to strengthen and renew Canada's 
health care system. Last 
September, First Ministers affirmed the commitment of their governments to 
the principles of the Canada 
Health Act and endorsed a health action plan that will enable them to move 
forward in building a modern, 
integrated and sustainable health system for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years, governments will take concrete action to reform 
and support innovation in 
primary care, to adopt modern health information technologies, and to 
purchase needed diagnostic and 
medical equipment. For its part, the Government of Canada is committing 
more than $21 billion in new 
funding to the provinces and territories over five years through the 
Canada Health and Social Transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will also champion community-based health promotion and 
disease prevention 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will strengthen its efforts to encourage physical fitness and 
participation in sport, and take 
further steps to combat substance abuse, reduce tobacco consumption, 
prevent injuries and 
promote mental health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will advance progress on disease prevention, focussing in particular 
on reducing the incidence 
of preventable diabetes and tuberculosis—especially among Aboriginal 
people, who suffer 
disproportionately from these diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will also provide a further major increase in funding to 
the Canadian Institutes of 
Health Research. The new funding will enable the Institutes to enhance 
their research into 
disease prevention and treatment, the determinants of health, and health 
system effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on the health action plan's commitment to public reporting, the 
Government of Canada will work 
with the provinces and territories to create a citizens' council on health 
care quality. This council will 
ensure that the public's perspective is considered in developing 
meaningful indicators of health system 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As public reporting begins on how the health system is meeting the needs 
of Canadians, governments 
will use this information to continue to move forward with the renewal of 
medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Clean Environment
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is blessed by the beauty of its vast landscape and the wealth of 
its natural resources. But with 
this blessing comes the responsibility to ensure its preservation. A 
healthy environment is an essential 
part of a sustainable economy and our quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government's focus will be on the three priorities of clean air, clean 
water, and the conservation of 
Canada's natural spaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December, the Government of Canada signed an agreement with the 
United States to significantly 
reduce the emissions that cause smog. This agreement will lead to a 90 
percent reduction in smog- 
causing vehicle emissions by 2010, bringing cleaner air to millions of 
citizens in both countries. The 
Government will move quickly to implement this agreement and other 
measures, working with the 
provinces and territories to achieve cleaner air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Canada's responsibility, as steward of one of the world's largest 
supplies of fresh water, to protect 
this critical resource. Safeguarding our water is a shared task among 
governments, industry and 
individual Canadians. The Government of Canada will fulfil its direct 
responsibilities for water, including 
the safety of water supplies on reserves and federal lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will also lead in developing stronger national guidelines 
for water quality by 
enhancing scientific research and continuing its collaboration with 
partners. Drawing on expertise 
within the Government and from across Canada, it will significantly 
strengthen the role of the 
National Water Research Institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will fund improvements to municipal water and waste water systems 
through the federal- 
provincial-municipal Infrastructure Canada program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also invest in research and development and advanced information 
systems to enable 
better land use and protect surface and ground water supplies from the 
impact of industrial and 
agricultural operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are the guardians of a significant percentage of the world's 
wilderness and wildlife. The 
Government will invest in the creation of new national parks and implement 
a plan to restore existing 
parks to ecological health. It will work with its partners toward more 
integrated, sustainable management 
of Canada's oceans. And it will re-introduce legislation for marine 
conservation areas and to protect 
species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its efforts to promote global sustainable development, the 
Government will ensure that Canada 
does its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will work with its 
provincial and territorial partners to 
implement the recently announced first national business plan on climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To safeguard Canadians from toxic substances and environmental 
contaminants, the Government will 
also strengthen laws, research efforts and other measures for health 
protection. This will include the 
development of appropriate standards that reflect the special 
vulnerabilities of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong and Safe Communities
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong and safe communities are an essential part of the fabric of our 
society. They are critical to 
providing Canadians with the security to build a better future for 
themselves and their families. They are 
also important to attracting talented people from around the world to come 
and make their home here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian communities of all sizes—whether urban or rural, Aboriginal or 
multicultural—face diverse 
challenges and have unique needs. The Government of Canada will strive to 
ensure that, wherever 
possible, its actions and programs are co-ordinated to help build local 
solutions to local challenges. It will 
work with partners across Canada to launch a dialogue on the opportunities 
and challenges facing urban 
centres. It will co-operate with provincial and municipal partners to help 
improve public transit 
infrastructure. And it will help to stimulate the creation of more 
affordable rental housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring that Canada's communities are safe is an important element of 
fostering and attracting the 
talented people needed for success in the new economy. Crime rates in 
Canada have fallen steadily for 
almost a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will continue to work with provinces and 
territories, communities, and all its 
partners to implement a balanced approach to addressing crime—focussing 
on prevention as much as 
punishment, strengthening penalties for serious crime, and considering the 
needs of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will focus on safeguarding Canadians from new and emerging 
forms of crime. It will take 
aggressive steps to combat organized crime, including the creation of 
stronger anti-gang laws and 
measures to protect members of the justice system from intimidation. It 
will provide enhanced law 
enforcement tools to deal with emerging threats to security, such as 
cybercrime and terrorism. It will act to 
safeguard children from crime, including criminals on the Internet. The 
Government will take steps to 
ensure that our laws protect children from those who would prey on their 
vulnerability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will re-introduce legislation to change how the justice 
system deals with young 
offenders. It will encourage alternatives to custody for non-violent 
offenders, emphasizing rehabilitation 
and re-integration into society, while toughening consequences for more 
violent youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working with the provinces, territories and communities, the Government of 
Canada will strengthen the 
capacity of local communities to deal with conflict, prevent crime, and 
address drug abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tragic reality that too many Aboriginal people are finding 
themselves in conflict with the law. Canada 
must take the measures needed to significantly reduce the percentage of 
Aboriginal people entering the 
criminal justice system, so that within a generation it is no higher than 
the Canadian average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vibrant Canadian Culture
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is defined by far more than its political boundaries or economic 
relationships. In these times of 
rapid change and globalization, it is more important than ever that we 
know who we are as Canadians 
and what brings us together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of our cultural policies for the future must be on excellence in 
the creative process, diverse 
Canadian content, and access to the arts and heritage for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the English and French networks of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation have long been 
cornerstones of Canadian cultural policy. The CBC helps connect Canadians 
to each other, their history 
and their country. It reaches all parts of Canada, from big cities to 
small towns to Northern and Aboriginal 
communities. It provides a distinctive Canadian voice in both official 
languages and important 
opportunities for our creative people. The Government will increase its 
support to help the CBC fulfil its 
distinct role as a public broadcaster serving all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will assist the book-publishing and sound-recording sectors 
to make the transition to the 
new economy. It will continue to support the development of digital 
content for the Internet and other new 
media in French and English. And it will work to expand international 
markets for Canadian cultural 
products and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities across Canada are increasingly recognizing the importance of 
arts and heritage for their 
quality of life and ability to attract talent, investment and tourism. The 
Government of Canada will 
continue to work with the private and not-for-profit sectors and other 
governments to strengthen Canada's 
cultural infrastructure. It will help communities to develop arts and 
heritage programs that are sustainable 
and relevant to their diverse circumstances and aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating and Sharing Opportunities Globally
</I></B></P><P align=left>The well-being of Canada and Canadians depends on global human security, 
prosperity and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to working with its international 
partners to promote 
international peace and security by enhancing the mechanisms for conflict 
prevention and resolution. It 
will work to strengthen global governance as well as existing and new 
multilateral institutions. These 
include the G-20—a new forum of which Canada is the first chair— 
which is striving to enhance the 
stability of the world economy and ensure that globalization benefits all 
its participants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will increase Canada's official development assistance and 
use these new investments 
to advance efforts to reduce international poverty and to strengthen 
democracy, justice and social stability 
worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have become leaders in harnessing the power of technology to 
build a more inclusive society. 
This experience serves as a powerful model for the world. Through its 
participation on the Digital 
Opportunities Task Force established by the G-8 nations and through its 
own investments in developing 
countries, Canada will contribute to closing the global digital divide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will continue Canada's proud record of peacekeeping. In 
Budget 2000, the Government 
provided funding increases for the Canadian Forces to help ensure that 
they are equipped and prepared 
to respond quickly to calls for help at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Summit of the Americas this year presents an exceptional opportunity 
to promote a balanced and 
coherent vision for deepening co-operation among the nations of the 
Western hemisphere. The summit 
declaration and action plan will support Canada's interest in 
strengthening democracy and human rights, 
expanding commerce through the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative, 
increasing people's access 
to the benefits of growth, and providing opportunities for all nations in 
the Americas to improve the quality 
of life of their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Summit of the Americas and as chair of the G-8 in 2002, Canada will 
work to expand opportunities 
for more countries to participate in the benefits of globalization, while 
pressing for peace and security in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Celebrating Our Canadian Citizenship
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was born of a noble vision and an act of will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Canadian citizenship has been built over time through the experiences 
we have shared: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When together we celebrate the successes of our scientists, 
scholars, athletes and artists, our leaders 
on the world stage, and our peacekeepers. And when we remember and honour 
our war veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we visit other parts of our country or when we travel abroad 
and see ourselves through the eyes 
of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When every year thousands of new Canadians stand proudly with their 
families to take on the 
responsibilities of Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come together to help each other in tough times. And when 
millions of Canadians volunteer 
their time and energy to make their communities a better place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will help Canadians to strengthen their bonds of mutual 
understanding and respect, to 
celebrate their achievements and history, and to exercise their shared 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will continue to expand exchange programs for young Canadians to 
reach its goal of 100,000 
exchanges each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's linguistic duality is fundamental to our Canadian identity and 
is a key element of our 
vibrant society. The protection and promotion of our two official 
languages is a priority of the 
Government—from coast to coast. The Government reaffirms its commitment 
to support 
sustainable official language minority communities and a strong French 
culture and language. 
And it will mobilize its efforts to ensure that all Canadians can interact 
with the Government of 
Canada in either official language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutions of Government will continue to be strengthened. Since 
1993, the Government has taken a 
range of measures to enable members of Parliament to more effectively 
represent the views of their 
constituents. MPs have participated in pre-budget consultations, at the 
end of which recommendations 
were made to the Government. Moreover, private members' bills from the 
House and Senate have been

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of the speech delivered 
by Her Excellency the Governor General at the opening of the 
session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Harold Macklin (Northumberland, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with a great sense of pride and humility that I 
move the motion on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay my humble respects to Her Excellency the 
Governor General and thank Her Excellency for delivering the 
speech today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I would like to thank the Right Hon. Prime Minister for 
bestowing this honour upon me and the riding of Northumberland to 
bring forward the motion on the Address in Reply to the Speech 
from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the people of Northumberland who have 
placed their trust and confidence in me to represent their 
interests in the House.  As their member, I vow to work in 
conjunction with my colleagues to address the concerns and 
challenges that we face today and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my predecessor, the hon. Christine Stewart, I extend my 
personal regards for her 12 years of dedicated service to her 
riding, to her colleagues and to her nation.  She has been an 
inspiration to all of us.  On behalf of my colleagues I thank her 
for giving so much to so many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my family who are with me today for their 
endless motivation, inspiration and support.  I am reminded of 
the importance of family and it is a value I cherish.  Today's 
speech has demonstrated the commitment of the government to 
support families and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To you, Mr. Speaker, I extend my sincere congratulations on your 
election as Speaker of the House.  You have earned the confidence 
and support of your colleagues to guide us through the many 
complex issues that face us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as I reflect on the history that surrounds this Chamber 
and the Fathers of Confederation, I am reminded of a lawyer who 
practised law for 15 years in the riding of Northumberland, who 
bore the name James Cockburn.  On November 6, 1867, he was 
unanimously chosen as the first Speaker of the House.  Indeed 
Northumberland has strong roots within Confederation and to the 
Speaker's chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a privilege to say that I hail from one of the best 
ridings in the country.  Northumberland is a picturesque riding, 
with vast rolling land and freshwater lakes to the north and 
south borders.  Along the east and west borders of Northumberland 
we have the Trent Severn waterway and the Ganaraska River, both 
opening into Lake Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These bodies of water remind all of my constituents that fresh, 
clean water is something to be cherished and enjoyed.  This is 
part of the positive quality of life experienced in 
Northumberland and it needs to be preserved so it may be shared 
with others.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, as a country with one of the largest masses of fresh 
water in the world, needs to continue to demonstrate its 
commitment to the environment and to protect this great natural 
resource.  Fresh water is our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we rely heavily upon natural resources to ensure 
the success of one of our largest industries, and that is 
agriculture.  I know firsthand the farming way of life because I 
come from five generations of farmers.  I am proud to say that my 
great great-grandfather introduced the first Holstein cattle into 
Northumberland in 1884.  Since then we have come a long way, yet 
there is much work to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our rural voices must continue to be strong in supporting our 
food supply system, for agriculture is not only a way of life in 
my riding, it is a way of life for so many across this great 
nation of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot stand by and allow the family farm to die.  We must as 
a government provide support for the farming community in their 
time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see today that our government has pledged 
to work with the agricultural community to move beyond crisis 
management, to support them in their time of need and to ensure 
that family farms that helped build our nation prosper once 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of this House and a representative of the people of 
Northumberland, I have pledged to bring forward the concerns of 
my constituents on the issue of agriculture.  It is important 
that we continue to support the family farm, which has been a 
cornerstone of our Canadian heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very optimistic when envisioning our future.  In today's 
knowledge based economy, innovation and creative thinking are the 
currency of success.  Our government is investing in today's 
pioneers because they are the architects of our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By such investment in knowledge and innovation, we are laying 
down a strong foundation for a stronger nation.  The building 
blocks of our foundation are found in our youth and to make them 
strong requires education and opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the introduction of programs, such as the Canadian 
opportunities strategy, the Canadian government is opening more 
doors to post-secondary education than ever before.  The Canadian 
millennium scholarships are the centre of this strategy and will 
provide more than 100,000 scholarships to low and middle income 
students for the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, we are strengthening the institutions where 
learning and research take place.  Canadian universities and 
laboratories will benefit from programs, such as the Canada 
foundation for innovation and the networks of centres of 
excellence, as a means of expanding future opportunities through 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Locally in my riding, I have taken the initiative to integrate 
technology, research and innovation through the municipal, 
provincial and federal governments.  I have launched a research, 
innovation and technology advisory committee to establish 
seamless connections between all levels of government and all 
aspects of our community.  By bringing together these key groups 
my constituents have the opportunity to work together to shape 
the vision of our future as a riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's throne speech exemplifies the commitment by the 
government to Canadians young and old.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have once again demonstrated our ability as a government to 
respond to the needs of Canadians while maintaining fiscal 
responsibility.  The speech not only affirms Canada's 
position at the forefront of a knowledge based economy, but it 
stresses that concerns about health care and early childhood 
development shall be answered by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have demonstrated time and time again that we are a 
government that supports all those in our society while looking 
after the fiscal needs of our country.  As a government we 
continue to reflect the Liberal values on which we were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a growing country, a country of which to be proud.  We 
are a nation that has again been named the best country in the 
world in which to live.  We are a country where people are 
recognized for their cultural diversity, varying interests and 
are motivated toward keeping Canada the best country in the world 
in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to remind all hon. members of the 
House, regardless of our party loyalties, that Canadians from 
coast to coast have spoken.  We have been chosen to hear their 
voices, address their concerns and instil confidence in them that 
we are fighting the same battle, the battle to make Canada the 
very best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I extend to you, Mr. Speaker, and all members of the House 
my best wishes.  I am certain that this parliament will stand as 
the best in history.  Let us leave our legacy now to drive the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hereby move, seconded by the hon. member for Laval East, that

General of Canada:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard (Laval East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the members on both sides of the House for the warm 
welcome they have given me this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her Excellency the Governor General has read the Speech from the

with which she read it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, if I may, to congratulate as well the member for 
Northumberland on the excellent speech he has just delivered. 
His interest in Canada and his hopes for the future do him 
honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank our Prime Minister for honouring Laval 
East by asking me to second the motion for an Address in Reply 
to the Speech from the Throne.  It is a real joy for me, 
especially since, for a number of years, in the mid 1980s, I sat 
way up in the press gallery following the proceedings of the 
House.  I loved every minute of it.  I can understand why the 
journalists who were there at the time are still there today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore a real delight to find myself here on the floor 
of the House of Commons and, although I have come down from the 
stands to be here, I consider it a promotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that, during the latest election, our friends 
opposite, the hon. members of the Bloc, tried unsuccessfully to 
present themselves as the sole defenders of Quebec.  The people 
of Laval East gave me a majority, and this government has 
received its third mandate in a row— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please.  The hon. member from Laval East has 
the floor.  This is her first speech in the House and perhaps 
all of us could listen to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs Carole-Marie Allard:</B> On behalf of all my colleagues, I want 
to thank the people of Quebec and assure them of our intention 
to fully defend their interests during this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Laval East offers many challenges. Canada is a 
vast country, and I have noticed that several of us do not know 
my riding well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laval, in the province of Quebec, is the name of a renowned 
university, but it is first and foremost a great city, located 
on an island near Montreal. The city of Laval is buzzing with 
economic activity. I must say that the infrastructure program 
put in place by the government is a valuable tool for growth and 
development at the disposal of our local decision makers in 
Laval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laval's economic development cannot be dissociated from that of 
the greater Montreal area. 
It has been stimulated by the Canadian action strategy for the 
greater Montreal area and very sizeable federal investments 
exceeding $1.5 billion. These measures have helped consolidate 
the economic base of the Montreal region, and Laval has 
benefited from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laval East is one of three ridings located on the island of 
Laval. It is an urban area bordered by two rivers, but it also 
includes a large agricultural area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When travelling on certain secondary roads around Laval in 
September, one feels that one is in the country, seeing the vast 
fields and mounds of cabbages on farmers' trailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that Laval East and the entire city of Laval are 
more than just a suburb.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the priorities announced in today's Speech from the 
Throne coincide perfectly with those of the people living 
in Laval East, who want to work on their island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding welcomes the government's initiatives to promote a new 
economy based on research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high tech sector has been taking on increasing importance in 
Laval in recent years.  The government's continued  emphasis on 
developing new technologies augurs well for the biotechnology, 
pharmaceutical and computer industries. One has only to think of 
the Institut Armand Frappier, which offers leading-edge training 
at the master's and doctoral levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partnership with industry approach has been a winning one 
for this new economy, with its emphasis on innovation and new 
global markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my humble opinion, the Speech from the Throne reflects a 
vision of modern society focused on the family, youth and the 
less fortunate, a lasting Liberal vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne outlines an action plan for the 
future, based on a Canadian way of doing things. 
The tax breaks promised last fall took effect one month ago.  It 
has been reassuring to see that they have been driven by a sense 
of fairness and responsibility, and that low income Canadians, 
particularly families with children, have been the principal 
beneficiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also shown that it was able to react quickly 
and introduce short term measures, such as last fall's rebate to 
low income Canadians for heating costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you that this measure was extremely well received in 
Laval East, where seniors are having a very hard time coping 
with the increase in heating costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a lawyer who had to deal with heart-wrenching matrimonial 
disputes, I am glad to see that my government is concerned about 
the help being provided to single-parent families and the best 
interests of the children when a family breaks down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing the child benefit and introducing a one-year parental 
leave are just some of the concrete measures that will be taken 
to ensure a brighter future for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, I also came to realize how 
important the health agreement signed last September was to my 
constituents of Laval East, who are however still wondering how 
this agreement will be implemented by the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment of our government to take concrete measures 
during the next three years to promote health and prevent 
illnesses is crucial to our aging population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the way our government keeps insisting on maintaining a 
medicare system where all patients, rich or poor, are equal is 
certainly reassuring for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By acting to fight organized crime and protect the public 
against new forms of intimidation, the government is showing how 
responsible it is. We all remember the panic created by the 
murder attempt against reporter Michel Auger. This truly 
reflects the terror a large segment of our population is living 
under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As another sign of openness, the government insists on helping 
more adults develop advanced skills. Therefore, it will create 
registered individual learning accounts. Throughout his public 
life, our Prime Minister has shown deep concern for labour force 
training.

goals. His determination, some 30 years after entering politics, 
to put in place measures to help workers be better equipped to 
face today's challenges is proof that, in politics, 
determination is what counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the same number of years as our Prime Minister to 
achieve my goals. He entered politics at age 29, which is not my 
case. So, I hope you will forgive me if I am impatient at times 
during this mandate and I apologize in advance for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am confident that we as parliamentarians have 
the ability to go beyond partisanship to make ours a better 
society. 
Today's Speech from the Throne is eloquent when it comes to 
preserving our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is with enthusiasm that I support the motion on 
the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.

Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member spoke of a modern society 
being built which all Canadians will be able to enjoy.  Modern 
society is based on eating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this throne speech there is no mention whatsoever of a farm 
income crisis or of concrete steps being taken to reduce and 
alleviate the ongoing crisis.  What is there by way of concrete 
steps to address the farm income crisis?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member for Laval East who wants to protect 
Quebecers' interests without engaging into partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 18 of the Speech from the Throne it says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government reaffirms its commitment to support sustainable 
official language minority communities and a strong French 
culture and language— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refers to sustainable official language 
communities. Which are Canada's official language communities 
that are not sustainable and that the government wants to 
abandon?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on page 11 of the Speech from the Throne I 
have found the most arrogant statement I have heard in a long 
time. It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when losing a job also meant immediate loss of 
income for workers and their families. And so Canadians created 
Employment Insurance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a government say such a thing? How can the member defend 
such a statement when the employment insurance plan is the plan 
that has created the most poverty in Canada in the last 50 
years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard: </B>Mr. Speaker, if I remember correctly, it 
was the Bloc Quebecois that blocked the bill— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I would like to say that we have done something 
unusual today.  Never before have we had a proposer or a seconder 
questioned in the House of Commons.  It is a precedent.  Also, 
never before on the first day in the House of Commons has a 
member of parliament blocked the Bloc Quebecois like that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
just want to let the member know that she ought to have realized 
that the alleged employment insurance bill could not have been 
blocked by the Bloc Quebecois because it was never tabled in the 
House. There has been no vote on this matter. It would however 
have been interesting to see the government table such a bill to 
find out what people thought— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I remind hon. members that 
this was a maiden speech. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair has recognized the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie for 
questions and comments. The member then said he was rising on a 
point of order. If he has a question or a comment, he has the 
floor. He can speak now if he so wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> It will be all, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien: </B>Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to say that 
never before on the day of the Speech from the Throne in the 
House of Commons have hon. members questioned one another. 
Coming from the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and from the Parti 
Quebecois, this attitude is as irritating as the whole rag 
business. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  If this is parliamentary reform then we have a long, hard 
session ahead of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
find it difficult to understand that the Prime Minister would be 
pleased that we innovate by asking questions and then blame hon. 
members who do so. As for the “rag”, he should not be sorry 
that, for once, a sovereignist is seeing red.

I extend our congratulations to Her Excellency the Governor 
General on her presentation of the Speech from the Throne, and to 
you also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see we are moving along lines of precedent here, with the 
government once again at fractious odds with the Bloc and the 
official opposition continuing to be seen as the group that 
brings peace, order and good government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the Chairman, the Deputy 
Chairman, the Acting Chairman and the Assistant Deputy Chairman 
of the Committees of the Whole House on their appointments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also extend congratulations to the members for Laval East and 
for Northumberland on their enlightened speeches and the presence 
of their families here today.  That support is so treasured by 
all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also acknowledge, as I move to adjourn, that Canadians see 
stormy economic waters ahead.  Tomorrow I would like to talk 
about charting a safe course through those waters.  I now move to 
adjourn the debate.
