	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Standing 
Committee on Finance has the honour, this morning, to present 
its first report.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In accordance with its order of reference of Friday, February 
4, 1994 your committee has considered Bill C-2, an act to 
amend the Department of National Revenue Act and to amend 
certain other acts in consequence thereof, and has agreed to 
report it without amendment.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-217, an act to amend the Young Offenders 
Act, the Contraventions Act and the Criminal Code in 
consequence thereof.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Leeds-Grenville for seconding the motion to 
introduce this bill.
<P>
	During the election campaign Canadians made it clear that 
they would like to see some fundamental changes to our 
criminal justice system. It would appear that the Young 
Offenders Act has acted as a lightning rod for a lot of the 
concerns in the community. This bill in my view would address 
some of the very serious flaws in the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The bill has three purposes. First, it would lower the age 
limits that define a young offender. A young offender would be 
defined as a young person between the ages of 10 and 15. As a 
result, 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds would be held 
responsible for their criminal acts and prosecuted in adult court.
<P>
	Presently, 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds are subject to the 
Young Offenders Act and not the Criminal Code of Canada in 
adult court. In my view, 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds are old 
enough to understand the nature and consequences of their acts 
and should be held responsible as adults.
<P>
	The second purpose of the bill would be to increase the 
maximum, I stress maximum, penalty for first and second 
degree murder from five years to ten years. I believe Canadians 
want to see some changes to the maximum penalty provisions 
for murder under the Young Offenders Act. Any persons 
between the ages of 10 and 15 who commit first or second degree 
murder would face a maximum penalty of 10 years.
<P>
	Finally, the bill would allow for the publication of the name of 
the young offender after the young offender's second conviction 
for an indictable offence.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe if this bill is carried by this House it 
will go a long way to satisfying some of the very serious and 
reasonable concerns of Canadians with regard to problems in 
our criminal justice system.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert) </B>moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-218, an act to amend the Unemployment 
Insurance Act (excepted employment).
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for Laurentides for supporting this bill and would 
also like to give a short explanation about this legislation.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to exclude from the excepted 
employment category those jobs that are characterized by a 
dependant relationship between the employer and the employee.
<P>
	At this time, the employment of women collaborators is not 
insurable unless, as it says in clause 3(2)(c) of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, these women can prove they 
would have gotten into a similar work contract had they not been 
their employers' spouses.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1462"> 1462 </A></B>
<P>
	This clause of the Unemployment Insurance Act is 
discriminatory, because it creates a different burden of the 
proof, especially for women collaborators.
<P>
	That is why I hope that my bill will be debated as soon as 
possible.

<P>

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have this 
opportunity to address the House formally and launch the 
defence policy review.
<P>
	For the next few minutes I will outline the terms of the process 
that will be involved in the final product which will be the new 
defence policy for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The need for a thorough review of Canada's defence policy is 
generally recognized. In fact, during the election campaign, all 
parties called for a review of the present policy to ensure that it 
really meets the needs of today. The attention given to defence 
issues should surprise no one. Defence is a fundamental duty of 
the government and has major impacts in Canada and abroad.
<P>
	Furthermore, the maintenance and operation of our armed 
forces account for a considerable share of public spending. 
Therefore we must have a clear and realistic defence policy 
which defines what we expect of the Canadian forces and how 
we intend to equip and train them to carry out their tasks.
<P>
	During the election campaign, my party maintained that it 
was urgent to review Canada's defence policy in order to take 
account of the country's new needs and the financial reality we 
are facing as well as international instability.
<P>
	I would now like to describe how the government intends to 
conduct this most important review.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have had some discussions in the last few months on the 
issues that have arisen, and the public consultation process is a 
central priority for this government. In the election campaign 
this was outlined by all parties that felt that Parliament should 
take a greater role in the formulation of policy development. 
Parliament has always historically had that essential role, but in 
recent years governments have moved away from listening to 
members of Parliament in a full and timely way in the 
formulation of policy.
<P>
	Since we reconvened in this Parliament in January, we have 
had debates on two very important issues, our maintenance of 
peacekeeping in the former republics of Yugoslavia, and cruise 
missile testing.
<P>
	In this same spirit of consultation, we are proposing today the 
establishment of a special joint committee of Parliament to 
consider the future of Canadian defence policy.
<P>
	In something that will be unique and to avoid unnecessary 
taxing of individual members who will be very busy with a 
number of committees, we are going to have the House of 
Commons membership in this special joint committee mirror 
the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs to join with nominees from the Senate. That means the 
same members involved in daily defence related matters, those 
studying the estimates, will be dealing with the defence review. 
The most knowledgeable people on defence matters will be 
carrying through both exercises.
<P>
	Through this committee we hope to receive the broadest input 
possible; in other words, not just from experts and interest 
groups, but from a wide variety of Canadians concerned with 
this vital national issue.
<P>
	Ever mindful of the somewhat travelling road show that 
became a circus on the Constitution which the previous 
Conservative government put into place a year or so ago dealing 
with the Charlottetown accord, we would not wish the 
committee to follow that unsavoury precedent. We would, 
hopefully, wish the committee to hold hearings in different parts 
of Canada so that people who otherwise could not afford to 
travel to Ottawa will be able to get to some regional centres. I 
hope that does not become an undue expense for the House and 
that there will be selected communities, large communities 
across the country, in which representations can be made.
<P>
	We would like this report from the committee to be made no 
later than September 30 of this year. Why September 30? We are 
trying to keep to our red book timetable. I know members of the 
other parties are going to become tired of the red book. However 
we have to emphasize to Canadians that they can expect this 
government to keep its election promises as much as possible. 
This is one we are trying to keep. We want the review to be 
completed by the end of the year so that Canadians will at last 
know where defence policy is going in this very turbulent time.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	We will monitor the progress of the public debate as it 
proceeds in the journals and conferences and in the media. Once 
the committee completes its work we will study it very 
carefully. The public component of the policy debate on defence 
will be conducted as it should be, by the House of Commons and 
the Senate. That is the true vehicle for public input. If members 
of Parliament and Parliament itself cannot be the vehicle for 
expressing the will of Canadians, I do not know what else can.
<P>
	The report will play a major role in shaping the government's 
response. By that I mean there will be a white paper on defence 
probably within a few months of the committee issuing its 
findings. The completion of this should be at the end of the year. 
I do not want to mislead hon. members of the Senate and the 
House. The report they will issue will not constitute the new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1464"> 1464 </A></B>
<P>
defence policy but we will ignore many or most of its 
recommendations at peril.
<P>
	As I said Parliament is the unique place to bring a certain 
dimension to the debate that one cannot otherwise get through 
private consultations. I hope to engage in consultations with 
experts, officials and other people in the defence community as 
well as to have discussions with our allies based on their 
experiences. All of our allies are going through a similar 
turbulent period in developing foreign policy and defence 
policy. I will be having those conversations with them but 
certainly public participation and the role of members will have 
a heavy bearing upon the eventual outcome of this policy.
<P>
	In the interim, government is going to have to make decisions. 
The world does not stop because Canada is having a defence 
review and I hope that members will take that into 
consideration. I can imagine some of the things that will come 
up in the next few weeks and months. I hope members then do 
not ask why we do not leave things until the end of the defence 
review. The fact is we have to make some tough decisions.
<P>
	A very tough decision we made, which was another red book 
promise, was the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopters. We 
have had some difficult discussions with our NATO allies both 
at the summit in Brussels and over the last few weeks by 
telephone. My colleague the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the 
Prime Minister and I have had discussions with our allies on the 
very difficult situation in the former republic of Yugoslavia and 
the potential of air strikes. Some of the ongoing discussions 
have led to lengthy consultations in the House. I mention 
peacekeeping and cruise missile testing.
<P>
	One could envisage for example the government being asked 
to consider how to respond to events in Bosnia, a request to send 
additional peacekeepers to that location. Obviously we have to 
make those decisions very rapidly as events occur. They cannot 
wait.
<P>
	We will keep Parliament, especially the committee, fully 
informed of any significant decisions as long as we do not betray 
any confidences with our allies in the process. We will strive to 
make sure these decisions which have to be taken on a day to day 
basis do not prejudice the outcome of the review. We will do all 
we can to ensure that any decisions we do take on an ad hoc basis 
in response to developments as they occur will have the broad 
support of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During the same period, the Minister of Foreign Affairs will 
review Canada's foreign policy. The minister will provide 
details on this subject to Parliament in a few weeks. Since the 
country's foreign policy and defence policy overlap in several 
areas, my colleague and I have developed a process to allow 
both reviews to proceed in harmony.
<P>
	Under the terms of reference of the parliamentary committee 
reviewing defence policy, this committee will meet with the one 
responsible for reviewing Canada's foreign policy.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	I also accepted the invitation of my colleague, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, to co-chair the national forum on international 
relations, which will certainly consider questions related to 
defence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A national forum on matters, whether they be defence policy, 
foreign policy, overseas development aid, or trade policy will be 
hosted by my colleagues, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Minister for International Trade and I in a few weeks. That again 
is another promise in the red book.
<P>
	The fundamental issues in the defence review to be 
considered are set out in a guidance document the government 
has put together. If I have the agreement of hon. members, I 
propose to table it in both official languages pursuant to 
Standing Order 32(2).
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there agreement to 
table the document?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> It is the guidance document that will be 
provided to all members of the committee to help them in their 
deliberations. It does not set out any prescriptions; it simply 
identifies the issues and helps them frame their deliberations. It 
is intended to stimulate discussion and focus the work of the 
committee on the critical issues to be resolved.
<P>
	To give members a sense on how the government intends to 
approach the substantive aspects of the review I would like to 
spend a few minutes reviewing the broad outline in the 
document I have just tabled.
<P>
	The document begins an examination of the Canadian defence 
issues by setting out the international and domestic context of 
Canadian defence.
<P>
	In it we note that the cold war has yielded some very real 
improvements in international security relations. Since 1989 we 
have seen an astounding chain of events occur, especially in 
eastern Europe with the dismantling of the former Soviet Union 
and the re-emergence of states that have not been independent 
for many years, in some cases for centuries.
<P>
	There has been significant progress in arms control and the 
resolution of some of the long-standing regional conflicts. 
Beyond this we have the rapidity of events unfolding especially 
in Europe to caution us as to how we deal with the formulation of 
defence policy.
<P>
	The guidance document talks about the unpredictability, the 
volatility and the violence in the international environment. We 
see this obviously in the former republic of Yugoslavia and the 
disintegration of that country. However, it is being played out in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1465"> 1465 </A></B>
<P>
the  bordering states, the former republics of the Soviet Union, 
both in Europe and in Central Asia.
<P>
	I have become much more alarmed at the pattern of events 
that are occurring in that part of the world with smaller states 
potentially having the ability to operate nuclear weapon systems 
which have come into their hands directly because some 
republics of the former Soviet Union have them on their soil. 
However, I must admit I am very happy with the agreement 
which seems to have been put in place in the former republic of 
Ukraine, now an independent state, for control in dismantling 
and dismemberment of these weapons.
<P>
	Many people have been involved in the arms business and the 
nuclear development business in that part of the world. We know 
there are regimes that for whatever reason through territorial 
expansion or other designs of hegemony in the region want to 
use nuclear weapons to improve their case. We see a very 
disconcerting scenario unfolding and that should make us 
vigilant in formulating our defence policy.
<P>
	What I am trying to say is that the events, the hope and the 
euphoria in 1990 and 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet 
empire has given way to a bit more realism, a bit more 
pragmatism. Yes the world potentially is a better place. We do 
not have this terrible arms race between the two superpowers, 
but the fallout, especially in the Soviet Union, in Russia and that 
area has created a degree of instability we have to be very 
mindful of. We shall watch the situation in Russia very 
carefully. Of course Canada is fully behind attempts in that 
country to organize itself in the most democratic and 
fair-minded fashion in its new role as an independent country 
free from any ideology.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	From a military point of view Russia does remain a power. It 
has nuclear weapons. It still has a large armed forces, much of 
which has been repatriated from the former eastern European 
states. Events such as the second coup attempt last October and 
the outcome of the recent elections are of concern to us. They 
reflect the precarious state of reform in a climate of serious 
social and economic problems.
<P>
	Making long-term decisions about the Canadian Armed 
Forces is difficult enough at the best of times. It is even more 
difficult when the future of international security is so complex 
and so uncertain.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The guidance document reminds us of the importance of the 
national dimension of Canada's defence. As a bare minimum, 
under the National Defence Act, the forces are required to take 
action in situations that threaten public order in Canada. The 
forces still have a role to play in defending Canada and 
protecting Canadian sovereignty, and this role includes assisting 
other departments and other levels of government.
<P>
	Over the years, the government has asked the forces to assist 
certain government agencies in search and rescue activities and 
with relief in cases of national disaster and the protection of our 
marine resources.
<P>
	In its deliberations, the committee will have to determine 
what the appropriate national roles for the Canadian Forces are 
and what level of capability our military people need to fill these 
roles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the most significant domestic issues affecting the 
Department of National Defence and Canadian forces is fiscal 
restraint. This is addressed in the foreword of the guidance 
document. I have stressed that we have to develop a policy that 
is realistic and affordable. I want to re-emphasize that point 
today. Because of the urgency of fiscal restraint, we must set 
priorities and focus on plans, procurement and operations that 
are most essential to our needs.
<P>
	The guidance document sets out three areas where the 
committee and Canadians need to think carefully about defence 
priorities in an attempt to design an appropriate defence posture 
for the 1990s. However in doing so we cannot forget the cost 
implications.
<P>
	In that context I would like to address a comment which has 
been raised by the other parties and by some of my own 
colleagues. That is the logic of having a defence review when we 
are about to cut a massive amount from the defence budget. This 
is something which again was outlined in the red book.
<P>
	With respect to defence we agreed to eliminate the EH-101 
helicopter program. It was a sound decision. It was a good 
decision. That particular piece of equipment was too expensive 
for our needs. We felt that the former government erred. We said 
so in the campaign and we have discharged our obligations.
<P>
	At some point in time our need for replacing the Sea Kings to 
carry on search and rescue and other naval operations for which 
some of the EH-101s were intended will have to be addressed. 
Committee members can help us along when they discuss the 
role for the forces and their policy suggestions as to the kind of 
capability we need in search and rescue, in maritime 
surveillance and the naval force generally where the EH-101 
was to be deployed.
<P>
	Our other promise was to cut $1.6 billion from the defence 
budget. It is there in the red book. It is not a budget secret. This 
is public. Of course the Minister of Finance when he brings 
forward his financial projections will obviously take that into 
account.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1466"> 1466 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	That is a promise we will discharge. I am on the record saying 
that in speeches and I have mentioned it in the House.
<P>
	In dealing with this urgent fiscal situation, because the 
savings have to start clicking in April 1, at the beginning of this 
fiscal year 1994-95, we had two options. We could have decided 
to curtail operations. We could have decided to, as I have said 
not facetiously but honestly, do something that would have seen 
our F-18 fighter planes fly every seventh day.
<P>
	We could have our great new frigates which are admired by 
naval experts around the world just give tours of the Grand 
Banks instead of going any further and, again being somewhat 
tongue in cheek, having guns without bullets or armoured 
personnel carriers that do not function.
<P>
	We cannot afford that because defence of our country and our 
vital interest is crucial. We must do this in the best way possible. 
What we decided to do is to try to take the tough decisions that 
governments have ignored in the past. They have ignored them 
in a most irresponsible manner.
<P>
	As the armed forces budget as a proportion of government 
spending has decreased from about 24 per cent in 1963-64 to 
about 8 per cent today and going lower, the number of actual 
uniformed personnel has decreased from 130,000 to about 
77,000 or 78,000. It is going lower because of the cuts that were 
announced by the previous government. Those are working their 
way through the system.
<P>
	We have to decide. The government would be interested 
obviously in hearing from the committee as to how low we can 
go to have a real credible defence. If one goes too low, what can 
one do and what can one not do?
<P>
	Along those 30 years as we were shedding uniformed 
personnel we were not in a commensurate way dealing with 
infrastructure and capacity. We have an administrative and 
physical infrastructure and capacity which is too much for the 
more modest armed forces we have today.
<P>
	As anyone in business knows, if one's market share declines 
radically one has to cut one's overhead if one wants to stay in 
business. Unlike some in the House who tried to equate 
exclusively business with government, we do not do that 
because government is not a business like any other business. It 
is a unique institution that has to balance many competing 
interests.
<P>
	However, we do owe it to Canadians to try to operate 
ourselves in a most efficient manner. When we announce our 
defence cuts, we will do so in such a way as to address this 
infrastructure imbalance, this inflated administrative overhead 
that does not really conform with the actual role being 
discharged by the armed forces today.
<P>
	It will be very controversial. It will impact on every region of 
the country. I cannot over-emphasize enough the severity of 
what we have to do. If we do not do this and do this fast, that is in 
the next few weeks, then we will have to take the cuts in the 
operational end which in effect will grind us to a halt. It could 
even mean that we would have to, notwithstanding the decision 
of the House about deployment in the former Yugoslavia, the 
government's decision and the views of the House, concede 
external operations.
<P>
	I do not think Canadians want to do that. We have to discharge 
our obligations whether it is there or elsewhere. We have to 
continue to operate the business, the plant or service for 
Canadians that the Canadian Armed Forces brings forward.
<P>
	It would be very difficult. It would be very controversial and I 
would ask the members not just in the opposition parties but also 
my own party to understand the difficulty that we have to face.
<P>
	In doing it we will deal with individuals affected in a way 
which is extremely sensitive, which will go beyond what is 
required in terms of collective agreements and with our 
personnel. I believe that we will be able to put as good a face on 
what we are going to do from a human impact position as 
possible, as realistically as we can. With respect to communities 
that will be affected, this will be very difficult. Some can absorb 
job losses, some can absorb the decline in economic activity, but 
others will not be able to do so readily. We do not want to preside 
over the dissolution of entire communities in the country.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Even though the government's financial means are severely 
restricted, we will work with provinces and communities, 
members of Parliament affected and businesses to try to ensure 
that the very good plant and capacity that we have in many of our 
facilities-office buildings, bases, other structures-are used 
for other purposes. Whether it is business, community projects 
or provincial government works, we will try as best as is 
possible to ensure that the economic activity in those 
communities is not gutted but is maintained to some degree.
<P>
	Having said that, there will be no more Summersides. We 
cannot afford it. The former government-no disrespect to my 
colleagues from Prince Edward Island, there may be one or two 
in the House today-closed that base and there was an outcry. I 
understand the outcry. The compensation that the people in 
Prince Edward Island received was generous by comparison 
with what we can do today. We just do not have the hundreds of 
millions of dollars to replace the economic activity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1467"> 1467 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to take the opportunity in this debate to tell my 
colleagues why we are proceeding in this way. We have to do it 
now to preserve the fighting edge of the forces, but not to 
prejudice the outcome of the defence review.
<P>
	If we mothball equipment and curtail operations, it is still 
going to mean jobs. If when the defence review is complete, the 
members have worked hard in their committee and they 
advocate a certain direction, we may have to say: ``Well, we 
cannot do that any more because we got rid of that piece of 
equipment, we cut out that unit from the armed forces and to 
restore it is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars''.
<P>
	By acting now I believe we are going to preserve the ability of 
the joint committee and others participating in the review 
process to effect policy in a meaningful way and at least be able 
to have a fighting capability at the end of this year that can 
discharge any obligations the committee thrusts upon it.
<P>
	I would ask for the co-operation of members when we 
announce our budget cuts. My colleagues and I will be available 
on a regional basis to explain what we are doing and to try to 
mitigate somehow the impact. We will do everything we can to 
help various communities. But the time has come to address 
some of these very difficult questions and it must be done now. It 
cannot wait.
<P>
	I am going on a little bit longer and I must apologize to my 
critics on the other side. I have probably told the House more 
than I have told the cabinet. It is meeting upstairs and I have to 
go and face the music, which is somewhat unusual in the sense 
of the House hearing a longer speech on defence than cabinet has 
already heard. It is meeting now and I apologize to my critics 
because I will not be here to listen to them. My parliamentary 
secretary is here. As members know, he is a former 
distinguished member of the Canadian navy. He will be making 
notes, plus our officials will be watching the debate on 
television. Everything that is said here today certainly will be 
brought to my attention.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government wants to hear about every 
aspect of defence policy-our multilateral relations, NATO and 
NORAD. I think NORAD is up for renegotiation in 1996. We 
want the committee to be completely unfettered in what it looks 
into. We want it to be reasonable, obviously, and I think the 
members will be reasonable. We will be meeting jointly with the 
foreign affairs committee. I see my colleague from Toronto, the 
parliamentary secretary of foreign affairs, listening to the 
debate. There is obviously overlap in some areas but we could 
hold joint hearings to make sure there is no duplication of work.
<P>
	I have confidence in the quality of the members that I know 
are on the House of Commons committee from the three parties. 
They are knowledgeable, they have spoken in the debates on 
cruise missile testing and on Bosnia and our role in 
peacekeeping. They are knowledgeable people and they are 
sincere. They want Canada's defence policy not to be one of 
partisan bickering but something  upon which we can all agree 
and something about which we can all feel the kind of pride that 
we should feel.
<P>
	The Canadian Armed Forces has a terrific reputation. It goes 
back decades. It goes back to our participation in world wars, the 
Korean war and all our peacekeeping ventures. We have just sent 
over a fact finding tour led by people from foreign affairs. We 
have one of our senior military people assessing the situation in 
Bosnia because we have to make a decision very quickly about 
our engagement. The comments about the conduct of Canadian 
troops are absolutely outstanding.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I hate to quote one of the belligerents, but one general on the 
Serbian side when talking about our troops in Srebrenica said: 
``We want the Canadians to stay. We trust them. We like them''. 
That is probably the only thing the three factions agree on in 
Bosnia, that the Canadian troops are probably the best that are 
deployed there under the UN command.
<P>
	We have a proud institution, terrific people. In many respects 
it is a shame that we have allowed our armed forces to work hard 
without having paid much attention to them over the years. The 
last government dealt with the armed forces in a most 
reprehensible manner in terms of policy. It issued a white paper 
without public consultation. It slashed here there and 
everywhere with no military, operational or logical reason to do 
so. It certainly shocked the morale of the armed forces.
<P>
	However, we have professionals. They know what is coming 
in terms of defence reductions but they have a real faith in this 
Parliament and the changing attitudes of the Canadian public 
and the government to try and be fair and honest with them so 
that they can discharge their obligation in the best interests of 
everyone in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start by congratulating the Minister of National 
Defence on his presentation. In the course of my speech, 
however, I will show there are a number of points on which we 
differ with the minister.
<P>
	I am not sure whether we should be grateful to the government 
for initiating a review of our national defence policy, as part of a 
motion to appoint a special joint committee to consider the 
document from the Department of National Defence entitled 
Review of Canadian Defence Policy.
<P>
	I do not intend to dwell on the pros and cons of appointing a 
special joint committee. The role of the Standing Committee on 
National Defence happens to be to deal with the items that 
together form the mission of this new committee. Without 
wishing to seem repetitive, is this not just another form of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1468"> 1468 </A></B>
<P>
duplication and overlap, a waste of time better spent making the 
decisions that are so important to Quebecers and Canadians?
<P>
	The new committee will have the same consultative powers: 
the power to summon witnesses, to hire consultants and to print 
documents. It will also, as the minister said, adjourn from place 
to place inside Canada in order to get the advice it needs to make 
informed decisions.
<P>
	Everything in the committee's structure and operations is a 
duplication of the Standing Committee on National Defence, 
thus generating additional costs that, although not necessarily 
excessive, will not be well received by the Quebec and Canadian 
public.
<P>
	It has been said repeatedly that we must reduce public 
spending, make government more effective and, what all 
taxpayers would like to see, simplify the parliamentary process 
to make it productive and cost effective. And lo and behold, here 
we have one more addition to the government apparatus, and I 
find that very difficult to accept. All members in this House 
should try, to the best of their ability, to reduce all unnecessary 
spending, even the smallest amounts, to prove to our 
constituents that we realize the financial situation is very 
serious and that our actions must reflect the commitments made 
by all parties to their constituents.
<P>
	I am afraid that, all things considered, I cannot accept the 
duplication of time, energy and money this special joint 
committee will represent. The Minister of National Defence 
said earlier that hon. members were very busy, and now he wants 
to make them even busier by striking another committee that 
would have the same mandate as an existing committee.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	I repeat that it is the responsibility of the Standing Committee 
on National Defence to review the document tabled by the hon. 
minister and to make the best possible recommendations. The 
standing committee can invite any expert on military or foreign 
policy issues, and ask pertinent questions so as to develop a 
defence policy and submit it to the government. Again, 
members of the standing committee who will sit on the joint 
committee will have access to the same experts, will ask the 
same questions and, no doubt, will get the same answers. If this 
is efficient decision making, then I understand why Canada's 
debt is so large.
<P>
	However, the tabling of this motion has one definite 
advantage: it will force members of this House to discuss the 
motion itself, but also Canada's defence policy, which is often 
criticized by the public, the media, some elected 
representatives, as well as the Auditor General.
<P>
	I think we all want an exchange of ideas, but also an in-depth 
review of the role of our national defence establishment. We 
must look at every aspect of defence policy. Commitments to 
NATO, the United Nations and the United States are all 
important elements in this review. Some major changes have 
occurred on the international scene in recent years; all NATO 
allies have modified their defence policy and the United States, 
Great Britain and France have adopted new approaches.  Canada 
has, to some extent, followed the same process by coming up 
with a new defence policy statement in 1992.
<P>
	This trend has triggered three patterns in the readjustment of 
defence policies. First, all countries reduced their defence 
budgets, which translated into reduced demand and production 
for the defence industry. This situation severely affected arms 
producing countries, including Canada, where thousands of jobs 
disappeared. Quebec also paid a heavy price, since a good part 
of the Canadian defence industry was centralized in the 
Montreal region.
<P>
	The second pattern is more of a strategic nature, since it has to 
do with evaluating possible external threats, following the 
reduced risk of east-west conflicts. This risk being now almost 
non-existent, the threat of regional and even local conflicts has 
taken a new importance which defence policies must now take 
into account. Canada shares this view with its allies.
<P>
	The third pattern is the progressive transformation of 
international institutions such as the UN and NATO, whose 
political and strategic missions are being fully reviewed.
<P>
	In the context of our relations with other countries, we must 
remember that the role of Canadian peacekeepers was examined 
during those long debates on the situation in Bosnia and on 
Canadian peacekeeping missions. The Minister of National 
Defence also referred to that role in his speech this morning. 
Consequently, I will not discuss this issue at length.
<P>
	Other aspects concerning the review of our national defence 
policy are just as important, but they affect us and our 
constituents much more directly. I am referring to the national 
and financial aspects.
<P>
	The national aspect has to do with internal activity. What role 
do we want our military personnel to take on inside the Canadian 
territory? Will our armed forces play a more significant role to 
ensure our internal security? Will they be called upon to patrol 
the Canadian coastline to protect us against possible intruders? 
Will they be called upon to play a more active role in the fight 
against drugs? Will they be called upon to help monitor fishing 
activities in our territorial waters? Will they be called upon to be 
more involved in sea and mountain rescue operations? Will they 
be called upon to help the public in case of a natural disaster?
<P>
	Only when the role and the mandate of the Department of 
National Defence are clarified will we be able to determine the 
human resources and the material required to fulfil that 
mandate.
<P>
	It would be premature to evaluate and analyze possible 
changes in our defence policy until the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, in co-operation with the Minister of National Defence, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1469"> 1469 </A></B>
<P>
takes a close look at our commitments to NORAD and NATO, 
and also at our involvement in UN peacekeeping missions. In 
fact, the minister said earlier that officials from those two 
departments would meet to discuss those issues. So, until the 
House is  informed of the outcome of these meetings, it is 
difficult to predict what Canada's new defence policy will be.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Only then we will be able to determine the personnel required. 
Moreover, future needs should be determined in co-operation 
with military authorities. Given the circumstances, we should 
not focus on major policy directions, but rather on 
administrative aspects, in order to find out what the real 
implications are.
<P>
	For starters, the Bloc Quebecois suggests that reduction 
programs already initiated be evaluated. This includes an 
evaluation of the decision to cut back on staff, reduce the 
number of officers and close certain bases. We should know why 
military equipment is being procured or maintained and 
determine, with the help of the military, whether such 
equipment is relevant. We have to make the necessary choices 
and avoid spending billions of dollars to procure equipment 
solely for regional development purposes. Often, the costs are 
higher than if we had relied solely on ability and expertise. 
Finally, as the Auditor General has repeatedly pointed out, the 
minister should be made to completely rethink his military 
procurement policy.
<P>
	At this juncture, I cannot help but give several examples of 
this procurement policy which has cost the taxpayers dearly. If 
this policy is not amended, it will prove to be even more costly.
<P>
	Take, for instance, Litton Systems of Toronto which was 
awarded the contract to modernize destroyers, even though it 
had no expertise in shipbuilding. The $2 billion contract 
awarded to Litton Systems represented a waste of money since 
this company was unable to fulfil its commitments owing to its 
lack of expertise in this field.
<P>
	Logically, why was the contract to modernize these destroyers 
not awarded to MIL Davie of Lauzon, the company that built 
these ships, was totally familiar with their components and had 
the necessary expertise to fulfil the terms of the contract?
<P>
	Another example is the $250 million contract awarded to a 
British Columbia firm for the construction of tracked vehicles. 
The company based its design on a Swedish model, whereas 
Bombardier has been building this type of tracked vehicle for 
decades now. Had these contracts been awarded to companies 
with expertise in these fields, the government would have saved 
money. This is what it should be aiming for.
<P>
	In his 1992 report, the Auditor General refers to major 
operational problems, in particular with regard to the weapons 
management policy or military equipment procurement 
programs. Because of the numerous problems and difficulties 
that arise, the processing of proposals is delayed and a large 
number of staff are tied up. Several recommendations make 
mention of staff problems and specifically, of DND's defence 
program management system.
<P>
	In section 17.25 of his report, the Auditor General is openly 
critical of the program management system, noting that in 
addition to being ineffective, it generates an enormous amount 
of work for staff. The Auditor General proceeded to say, and I 
quote: ``The first problem relates to the enormous staff 
workload needed to implement this cumbersome process. Our 
analysis of all projects over $10 million identified in the defence 
services program as of February 1991 revealed that it takes an 
average of 1,109 days from the time a project is first identified 
in the DND database until the statement of capability deficiency 
document is approved. It takes an average of 1,107 days for the 
program planning proposal to be approved, 1,608 days for the 
program development proposal, 1,332 for the program change 
proposal, and 394 days for effective project approval by the 
Treasury Board. These average times between individual stages 
of the defence program management system and the number of 
times these documents are amended and recirculated provide a 
good indication of the amount of staff effort involved''.
<P>
	Considering the many pitfalls and obstacles, the Auditor 
General estimates that only a very small percentage of projects 
proceed through the entire, amazingly ineffective process.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	He pointed out, among other things, that all the change 
proposals to the defence procurement program -and there are 
many; just think of the frigate contract and the disputes between 
National Defence, St. John's Shipbuilding in New Brunswick 
and MIL Davie of Lauzon, in Quebec- are making even more 
cumbersome a process which already takes too much time and 
costs taxpayers too much.
<P>
	The costs associated with such a management process cannot 
be considered in isolation. Large amounts are involved and, 
instead of making things easier for the government, it is making 
things harder, so much so that the government is now avoiding 
this complicated process and granting gainful contracts directly 
to companies, like Bell Helicopter of Mirabel for the tactical 
transport helicopters and Western Star for the light off-road 
transport vehicle.
<P>
	I think that if the Auditor General points out serious 
deficiencies, it is worth looking into the matter. Why is the 
Liberal Party not acting? No business could survive such 
methods, it would go bankrupt.
<P>
	The abnormally high number of higher ranking officers in the 
Canadian Armed Forces is another example of an overly liberal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1470"> 1470 </A></B>
<P>
and incredibly costly process. How can we justify having 32,999 
corporals and 7,631 captains when there are only 9,370 soldiers 
in our armed forces? There are just about as many captains as 
soldiers. With only 9,370 soldiers on a total strength of 77,975, 
the Canadian forces are the most top heavy in the world, 
relatively speaking, and also the most expensive to maintain.
<P>
	Would we not be justified in questioning the suitability, the 
desirability of such an expensive top level? Would it not be 
better to have fewer officers and to apply the savings to 
equipping our soldiers? Unquestionably, such a situation calls 
for corrective budgetary action.
<P>
	I would now like to move from the personnel problem to the 
infrastructure problem, specifically to the closure of military 
bases. This is not the first time in our history that the 
government has had to close down military bases. Several were 
closed after the second world war, and again in the sixties, in the 
seventies and, more recently, in 1988-89 when the Conservative 
government closed over 13 bases and stations across the 
country.
<P>
	In spite of it all, the defence infrastructure remains far too big 
for the size of the forces. With a strength of merely 78,000 
members, the Canadian Armed Forces are maintaining from 
coast to coast facilities that could accommodate 140,000. 
Obviously, more cuts are needed, especially since several of our 
bases are obsolete and increasingly expensive to maintain. Also, 
their strategic value is not the same as it was at the time they 
were built. So, for all these reasons, the government will have to 
make a choice and impose a new round of closures.
<P>
	During the last days of its mandate as the Official Opposition 
and again during the election campaign, the Liberal Party took a 
stand for base closures in return for real, concrete guarantees to 
the communities affected by these measures. As a matter of fact, 
the Minister of Defence said a few words earlier about the 
applicable procedure.
<P>
	Promises were made in the red book to convert surplus 
military bases in Canada to peacekeeping training and staging 
centres. The Liberal defence conversion plan reflects a strategic 
direction based on Canada's foreign policy, a policy in which 
peacekeeping is viewed as a political basis that the Liberal Party 
will rely heavily on.
<P>
	The plan to convert surplus military bases to peacekeeping 
training and staging centres seems to be an important part of the 
Liberal Party's foreign policy and their March 26, 1993 press 
release was very explicit in that regard. So, this policy direction 
should not be overlooked and action in this area is to be 
expected.
<P>
	It is important at this point to denounce holding a special 
debate on Canada's defence policy when the government has not 
yet tabled its new white paper on defence.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	This position applies not only to the issue of cutting military 
bases but also to that of training centres for peacekeepers.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, cannot approve the peacekeeper 
training centres initiative for several reasons.
<P>
	First, it would be unrealistic to believe that countries from 
around the world or NATO members will send their troops to 
such centres for training. Who will pay the travelling expenses 
of international troops coming here to train and the costs of 
transporting their equipment? The UN does not have the 
resources to pay such costs. Furthermore, these international 
missions always have extremely tight deadlines. How can one 
reconcile these deadlines with a stay in Canadian training 
centres that will cause even further delay?
<P>
	Second, as the minister was saying earlier, it has been 
demonstrated that Canadian peacekeepers are among the best 
trained in the world. So why create a training centre when our 
troops already enjoy exceptional training conditions on their 
existing bases? Why should we spend new money to move our 
troops, who are already training in the field, at less cost, for 
international missions?
<P>
	Third, it is dishonest and hypocritical to argue that the 
creation of a training centre does not entail extra costs for the 
Canadian government. How can we say that, on one hand, we are 
cutting spending by the Department of National Defence and 
that, on the other hand, we are keeping military bases which 
should no longer be in use open for peacekeeper training. This 
contradictory message deserves to be challenged by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	Fourth, Quebec's military bases, Valcartier in particular, play 
a very important role in preparing Canadian troops for 
international peacekeeping missions. Encouraging the creation 
of training centres for peacekeepers-in Cornwallis, for 
example-effectively means the end of this type of activity on 
Quebec territory and the loss of significant economic resources. 
We have no choice but to oppose such measures, for the very 
foundation of defence department activity on Quebec territory 
may be affected.
<P>
	The real solution to compensate communities that will be 
affected by defence spending cuts remains the establishment of 
defence conversion committees. The success of these 
conversion projects is totally dependent on local people taking 
in hand the economic resources offered by the government to 
compensate for losses caused by the termination of defence 
activity and to stimulate the economic diversification of the 
region affected by these changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1471"> 1471 </A></B>
<P>
	We are proposing that priority be given to local and regional 
stakeholders in the military base conversion process. These 
local stakeholders are in the best position to know how to 
optimize resources and how to decide on economic 
diversification projects. We are also proposing that a plan be 
developed for the economic reallocation of buildings and 
facilities that will be closed by the Department of National 
Defence, and then that existing infrastructure be integrated into 
economic renewal projects put in place by local stakeholders.
<P>
	Program management, preparation and planning must be 
transferred to local stakeholders to prevent the federal 
government from over-centralizing once again. In any case, it is 
likely that projects favoured by local people would be more 
valid than those coming from the federal government. In fact, a 
centralized approach may lead to excessive costs and again to 
the bureaucratization of government action. The federal 
government's action plan should not hinder local and 
community initiatives.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is reiterating its 
commitment to the cuts that must be made in the defence 
department's budget. In my speech, I pointed out several 
questionable expenses in a costly and demanding management 
system, and it would not be unreasonable to believe, like the 
Auditor General, that drastic changes must be made in this area.
<P>
	Finally, the list of criteria for military base closures was 
compiled many years ago. Such closures must be done in a 
rational and irreproachable fashion. When we look at 
infrastructure, it is important to remember that Quebec only has 
13 per cent of the defence department's capital assets. It would 
then be ill-advised to believe that Quebec bases can be reduced 
even further, as this would only aggravate Quebec's current 
disadvantage in this area. In addition, the bases in Bagotville, 
Valcartier, Saint-Jean and Montreal are operational and 
essential to military operations as they represent the minimum 
needed in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I want to state once again my disagreement with 
the motion to create a joint committee. I would urge instead the 
government and the department of defence to simplify, instead 
of complicating, the defence policy review process.
<P>
	I hope that the minister will have the political courage needed 
to rationalize the management of his department with 
intellectual honesty and the enlightened co-operation of all 
stakeholders.
<P>
	I would like to commend, in closing, the commitment made 
by the hon. minister in his speech to carry out the rationalization 
everyone is hoping for.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the Minister of National Defence on his 
presentation this morning and my colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois on his presentation, although I must say  there are 
some portions of his presentation with which I disagree.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate the Reform Party's support for the 
conduct of a defence review. We think it is long overdue and 
vitally necessary that our country revisit the requirements of 
Canadian defence.
<P>
	We also support the establishment of a joint committee of the 
House of Commons and the Senate. It is my understanding that 
there would be two committees dealing with this matter if it 
were not for the consolidation into one.
<P>
	Senate expertise as evidenced in the 1993 Senate Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs report on Canadian involvement 
in peacekeeping is but one example of the expertise the Senate 
brings to bear and can offer. Within reason more heads, 
particularly knowledgeable heads, are invaluable. It provides 
for broader input.
<P>
	The committee at the moment is skewed somewhat eastward, 
in that there is a lack of western representation on it. I am hoping 
that perhaps in the representation from the Senate we will see 
some more western representation to provide a more national 
mandate.
<P>
	We are very much in favour of the document's support for 
consolidation with other parliamentary committees. We think it 
is important that defence be taken in conjunction with foreign 
affairs. Obviously it is an adjunct to it. We also think a 
consolidation with the industry committee to involve defence 
conversion will best benefit Canada in the conversion from our 
current defence posture to a different one.
<P>
	With the end of the cold war, as the minister said, there was 
great relief throughout our country and throughout the world 
because it appeared the great menace that had faced us for many 
years was gone. That to a large measure is true. The Warsaw pact 
collapsed and there was no hovering menace that appeared to be 
ready to consolidate or to take over the west.
<P>
	However more recent happenings have indicated that is not 
quite the case. We now have a much more volatile world. 
Nationalism has risen in many areas, including the previous 
Soviet Union, and there is danger that local conflicts or 
extended conflicts could erupt in that area.
<P>
	We have seen the dire consequences of ethnic and religious 
clashes. They are going on at this moment in the former 
Yugoslavia. It would be a misnomer to say the world is a safer 
place now. In fact it is probably more dangerous without the iron 
fist control we used to see in the Warsaw pact.
<P>
	A rising threat which we must be concerned with and take 
account of is the terrorist threat. With the sophistication of 
modern weapons and the ability to distribute those weapons 
throughout the world by countries which are a little lacking in 
foreign exchange and therefore vulnerable to offers of 
remuneration for the weapons, they are virtually everywhere or 
can be  virtually everywhere in the world. We as an independent 
country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1472"> 1472 </A></B>
<P>
have to be very conscious of this point and prepared to deal with 
a terrorist threat.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I guess we should be asking ourselves the following question 
right now: Are we entering an era of continued instability, or are 
we simply transiting a time of turbulence and discord? The 
answer to that question is not readily available. I think we have 
to await the outcome to see just what is going on. I fear that it 
may be a more extended period than we would wish.
<P>
	Traditionally Canada's defence priorities have been, first 
sovereignty, then mutual defence alliances, aid to the civil 
power, peacekeeping, and search and rescue. In this defence 
review nothing should be sacred. Everything should be 
examined to decide whether or not we want to continue with it, 
whether we want to reallocate priorities, and whether we can 
afford to do what we say we are going to do.
<P>
	For instance, search and rescue is almost a given. People 
consider that if we have defence forces they will be there to help 
people at sea, to help people who are lost, to help survivors of air 
crashes, and so on. However, is this better done by the military, 
or could it possibly be done by contract with a civilian agency in 
a cheaper fashion? I think that question must be considered.
<P>
	We must consider Canadian national needs: the ability to 
control our air space, to detect and monitor people who enter it, 
to control our seashores and the approaches to them, and to 
control our borders. We must be able to provide protection from 
smuggling, from deliberate pollution, from illegal immigration, 
from drug trafficking and from overfishing. The question we 
must deal with is: How much of these tasks must be accepted by 
the armed forces and how much can be assigned or co-operated 
with other agencies?
<P>
	We must look to Canada's international needs and desires. 
Our mutual alliances come to mind. We have been involved in 
NATO since 1949. It has been a very successful involvement 
because in my mind this is what brought the Warsaw pact to its 
knees. It is what stopped the encroachment into western 
territory from the east. Although NATO could be recognized as a 
large relatively inefficient and very expensive enterprise, it has 
accomplished its purpose. It should be recognized as that.
<P>
	NORAD is almost considered by some to be an agency we no 
longer need. We must be very careful in our assessment of 
NORAD because it also has a space adjunct to it that I think we 
would ignore at our peril.
<P>
	Going to the proliferation of various weapons of 
sophistication in the world right now, there is a very great 
likelihood we will see strategic missiles in hands we would 
prefer not to see them in. While NORAD is not in the business of 
providing a defence against it, it could certainly plot the launch 
of these missiles and the projected strike zone, where it is going 
to hit. This was used to some effect in the Persian gulf war when 
the  Scud missiles were tracked from their launch. Their impact 
was passed as information to our naval vessels in the Persian 
gulf.
<P>
	We have to look beyond those two mutual defence alliances to 
our burgeoning involvement in the Pacific Rim. Is it going to 
involve a requirement for Canada to join in with some defence 
alliance with the people in the Pacific Rim area?
<P>
	Since the beginning we have been involved in UN 
peacekeeping activities. Probably Canadians in the majority 
would vote for continuation in these activities. But we have to 
question very seriously in which ones do we wish to be involved. 
How much are we willing to commit in funds to providing those? 
Those funds not only involve the actual deployment of the 
people who are there. They involve the cost of training those 
people, of transporting them and of looking after them after they 
come back.
<P>
	Again referring to the gulf war and other commitments we 
have had, we have had naval vessels in the Persian gulf, in the 
Red Sea, in the Gulf of Aden, in the Indian Ocean, and currently 
we have vessels deployed in the Adriatic.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important to realize that at this moment there are over 700 
submarines employed by over 44 different countries in the world 
today. There are another 150 being constructed at this moment.
<P>
	The submarine has become the weapon of choice for many 
nations because it is relatively inexpensive to operate and 
relatively devastating in its ability to control what goes on. For 
instance, in the Falklands war, one British submarine tied up the 
entire Argentinian fleet and kept it out of the action.
<P>
	Therefore we have to very seriously consider when we deploy 
our naval forces into other spheres whether we go there as an 
independent nation capable of providing our own protection or 
with a force that can add this protection to us. That is a decision 
we have to take.
<P>
	We are involved at the moment in a humanitarian assistance 
mission in the former Yugoslavia. There are many misgivings 
among many Canadians about the mandate, the effectiveness 
and the actual involvement of Canadians in this type of theatre.
<P>
	Finally, of course, we must consider the requirement for 
Canadians to intervene on ideological grounds where we see a 
human rights violation situation going on in a country and our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1473"> 1473 </A></B>
<P>
people think there is a requirement for Canadians to be involved. 
The mission in Haiti at the moment comes to mind.
<P>
	Finally, we have to consider the terrorist threat that I referred 
to earlier. It is very likely that at some time there will be a 
serious terrorist threat posed not necessarily against Canada but 
perhaps against one of our neighbours or our allies. It could also 
be posed against us and we must be prepared to deal with that.
<P>
	To paraphrase from the guidance document, the question that 
we need to examine in this defence review and answer is should 
Canada establish and maintain at the lowest possible cost a 
combat capable total force of naval, land and air forces which is 
adequately equipped, appropriately supported and properly 
trained to protect Canadians, their values and their interests at 
home and abroad.
<P>
	I suspect the answer to that is going to be yes, although we 
may be seeing a change in the priorities that we have allocated in 
the past to those that we will allocate at the finale of this defence 
review. Our aim should be to give Canadians the defence forces 
they want and are willing to pay for.
<P>
	My perception of our task in this defence review differs 
somewhat from our colleagues in the BQ on one item and maybe 
with others. I do not know. The bottom line as far as I am 
concerned should be that within those forces and within the 
budget that Canadians approve, Canadian defence dollars 
should be spent on defence and not on ancillary items.
<P>
	The social benefits traditionally associated with defence 
establishments which come from employment and military 
payrolls must take second place to defence requirements.
<P>
	Finally, the outcome of the defence review should be to 
answer the needs of Canada as a whole, not those of any one area 
or region within the country. To my mind we are trying to 
establish the requirements for Canadian defence forces from 
Vancouver Island to Newfoundland and from the American 
border to the North Pole.
<P>
	We should concentrate on achieving what we think is needed 
and what we can afford to do. That should be our final game. It is 
my hope that when the white paper is produced some months 
after the conclusion and the submission of our final defence 
review, it will reflect very closely the findings that we come up 
with in this review.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to participate in this debate and to say to 
members opposite that I appreciate their input.
<P>
	The last intervention by the member from the Reform Party 
was quite good. It was balanced. It said that there were 
imperatives that we have as a nation whether it is an 
insurrection, smuggling or looking after our territories or 
whether or not search and rescue is something that the military 
should have or whether it should be privatized. Canada has a 
unique tradition with respect to its role as played in World War I, 
World War II and in conflicts. I think our size, our economic 
base and our geography along with those traditions have placed 
Canada in a particular position that cannot be ignored, and that 
is  that we are well-known for our peacekeeping roles. Some 
people would ask if it is peacekeeping or peacemaking. Whether 
or not we want to get into that argument is really not a problem 
since our major role is probably to help stop conflicts.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The member opposite made a very good point when he spoke 
about submarines. Submarine warfare as well as cruise missiles 
and F-18s have changed the way that wars are traditionally 
fought. The Suez Canal was something very strategic until there 
were submarines. Submarines could be in any place in this 
world. There is something called MIRV which comes out of the 
water with a propeller and rocket fire. It can break into seven 
warheads and each one can be independently guided. That 
changed the whole perception as to whether or not a base was 
needed in any particular locale.
<P>
	I for one would like an answer to the question of the hon. 
member, what exactly is our role, and then try to deploy our 
people based on that role. Of course that role would involve not 
only the defence standing committee but also military experts.
<P>
	The minister of defence said that we do not operate our system 
like a business. He was right. I listened to the member opposite 
who said that we should not be engaged in deadly war 
equipment. It is a fact of life that for our own protection we may 
have to do it and since we have a surplus, we sell to people 
globally. Then there is a fight within the country about whether 
it goes to Montreal, Quebec City, British Columbia or Ontario. 
That is probably something that should not be in this debate 
since we are talking about what our position is, what kind of 
equipment we require and how are we going to carry it out in the 
realities of the amount of money we have.
<P>
	I would like to make one point and I hope that it is considered. 
The member for York South-Weston and others have looked at 
defence spending and have said that it is top heavy with generals 
and people in the upper echelons.
<P>
	We hear the argument that these people are required since our 
standing army is not very large and if we have to get up and go, 
these people can train troops, that they are in positions 
strategically in order to make that happen.
<P>
	One suggestion that is probably appropriate involves the great 
tradition of taking people from the private sector who were in 
the military, taking their years of experience, counting them in 
the pension funds and so on. That is one area where the private 
sector could probably help. Strategically we need those people. 
However, in reality I do not think we can pay for generals and so 
on. To keep these people motivated, they take exams and keep 
moving up, so there is a top heavy army. One innovative 
technique might be to let them be in the private sector and do 
their managerial work which involves some of the skills we 
need, whether it is logistics or whatever special expertise they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1474"> 1474 </A></B>
<P>
have, and allow them  to interact with the military from time to 
time to keep them combat ready.
<P>
	I applaud members opposite for their interventions. I know 
there is another subcommittee. I am not sure why that is 
happening. As far as I am concerned I do not care which 
committee studies it. I just hope the focus is on the reality.
<P>
	Bismarck said once that countries should only make alliances 
with countries of their own size. Once you start with one bigger, 
you are going to get into trouble. You cannot go around saying 
that you are neutral. You can be neutralized but you are never 
neutral. It is the brutal reality about power and power relations 
in this world. Canada is unique. We do not want to fight with 
anybody. We happen to be next to the United States which is a 
global force and deploys itself. Because we are in the global 
spaceship called earth, everything is interconnected with 
everything else. There might be a hot spot and it may be that the 
conflict could spread, which we have seen happen time and time 
again, and then it affects us.
<P>
	We have to look at it strategically and come to grips with that 
within our own reality. I think that is the way we should go.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think there was a question 
there. It was mainly a comment. I would agree with much of 
what the member said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would 
like to comment on the points raised by my colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois who argued against creating another committee 
because it was duplication. Last week they were taking the exact 
opposite point of view when they said: ``Let us form another 
committee to examine the waste and duplication in 
government''. Now they are opposed to the creation of a 
committee that is going to do some additional work.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of National Defence-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would just like to 
remind members that in the question and comment period, 
comments or questions can only be directed to the last 
spokesperson. In this case the member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands was the last member to speak to this motion. So I would 
ask the member for St. Albert if he would direct his comment or 
question to his colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> My question therefore is for the last speaker. 
The riding of St. Albert where I live is on the edge of a major 
military installation, CFB Edmonton, which employs 
approximately 3,300 people. That is a major installation.
<P>
	I would like to give a bit of a background on how much is 
actually involved in that installation. The base provides 
administrative and technical support not only for the elements 
of air command but for those units located in Edmonton from the 
National Defence Headquarters, Land Forces Command 
Headquarters, Maritime Command, Training Systems 
Headquarters and Communications Command. It is a tactical 
aircraft centre for the Canadian Air Forces as well as a parachute 
training centre.
<P>
	In addition, it is the home of such units as the Canadian 
Airborne Centre, Parachute Maintenance Depot, Survival 
Training School plus four flying squadrons. Not only that, but 
the search and rescue for western Canada for the the north is 
located in Edmonton.
<P>
	A couple of years or so ago we had a horrible crash in Resolute 
Bay where we were unable to get our search and rescue people in 
to perform a rescue without the loss of life. I think it is 
absolutely important that we have a military installation in 
Edmonton that can serve the north.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has said that there will be 
major cutbacks announced within the next few weeks prior to 
the defence review taking place. I would like to suggest and ask 
my colleague from the Reform Party who was speaking whether 
he agrees with me that no cuts should be made, especially on a 
major military installation of 3,300 people, until such time as a 
defence review has taken place and we can find out whether or 
not this is really needed. How can it be decided that a hub of 
military installations that serve all of western Canada, 
employing 3,300 people, is no longer relevant?
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for Saanich-Gulf Islands if 
he agrees with that point of whether we should wait until the 
review is finished before we make any major decisions of that 
kind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question.
<P>
	I am already on record with the minister as reflecting the view 
that I believe that closure of bases and so on should better await 
the outcome of the defence review. I think it most important that 
we know what we are doing and why we are doing it before we do 
it. It is far more expensive and time consuming to try to recover 
a capability that we have given up than it is to maintain it for just 
another few months and then say: ``All right, now we do not 
need it''. I do agree that we would be wiser to wait until the 
defence review is completed before we announce base closures 
and so on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1475"> 1475 </A></B>
<P>
	On the other hand I am assuming because of the multitude 
of activities that take place at Edmonton perhaps it might not 
be one that is considered for closure. However, if in the course 
of the defence review it is revealed that the capability that is 
vested in Edmonton can be diversified to other bases and the 
capability that is required is still available then I would say that 
I would have to opt on the side of Canada and its defence force 
as a whole rather than leaning toward supporting any particular 
area in the country.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. William Rompkey (Labrador):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in this debate today and I want to talk a little 
at the beginning about the timeliness of the debate and I do so as 
the recently elected chair of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs.
<P>
	In that capacity I am looking forward to the review and to 
hearing from people all across the country. I want to thank the 
government for bringing forward the review in the way that it 
has. When we were in opposition we called time after time for 
the government to do exactly what is being done today.
<P>
	As the official critic for the opposition at that time, I recall 
asking the Minister of National Defence if he would refer this 
matter to the House of Commons standing committee. Now we 
have a reference and I am very pleased with that.
<P>
	It seems to me that we need to go about it in this way. We have 
seen defence cuts over the last several years and we all know that 
the cold war is over, that there is a peace dividend and that 
restructuring has to take place.
<P>
	We also are very much aware of the fiscal and monetary 
situations. We are aware of the deficit and the need to restrict 
and cut that deficit and keep it in line. Obviously, defence has 
played and will continue to play its part in the reduction of the 
deficit.
<P>
	We felt quite correctly as an opposition that to drive defence 
policy from the Department of Finance was not the way to have 
an armed forces for Canada for the future.
<P>
	We felt that we really should proceed by examining the aims 
and objectives of the armed forces. What do we want Canadian 
armed forces to do for the foreseeable future and for the next 
century?
<P>
	That is the way we are proceeding now and it is the right way 
to proceed. Defence cuts can and should be and have been made 
but there is a critical mass to be maintained within the armed 
forces. If we fall below that critical mass we remove our ability 
to respond to the challenges of the future and to equip the armed 
forces however that may turn out to be for the task ahead.
<P>
	To drive defence policy from the Department of Finance we 
felt and feel now was not the way to proceed. I am very pleased 
that we are going about this examination, this review, with an 
open mind and  questioning all the underpinning assumptions of 
national defence for the future.
<P>
	I am also pleased that the House of Commons, the 
representatives of the people, is being used as a vehicle to 
include as many Canadians as possible in this debate. We will 
want as parliamentarians to hear from Canadians all across the 
country who have an interest in defence matters and in the 
security of Canada. I hope they will come forward and I invite 
them to come forward. Perhaps we can even use the vehicle we 
are using today of television to include as many Canadians as 
possible in this review.
<P>
	We want their ideas. We want them to feel that this is their 
debate, this is their review, these are their armed forces, the 
armed forces of their country. I hope that many Canadians will 
participate.
<P>
	We will be doing it as well in conjunction with our colleagues 
on the committee on foreign affairs because obviously there is a 
very integral relationship between the armed forces and the 
foreign affairs of Canada. That is a component of the armed 
forces and we will be looking at that. We will be exploring our 
membership now in NATO, the development of the CSCE, our 
partnership in NORAD and the alliances we have formed and 
may continue to form and explore on both coasts and in other 
continents.
<P>
	I am looking forward to this and I want to talk a little about my 
own experience with the armed forces. It may underscore an 
aspect of the armed forces that we have not heard about and 
perhaps do not always consider.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I remember joining the naval reserve when I was at Memorial 
University in St. John's. I was 19 years old. As a matter of fact, I 
had been a Canadian for seven years at that time. I was not born a 
Canadian. I have a great deal of fun sometimes by telling other 
people that I am a new Canadian. I came to this country when I 
was 13 years old.
<P>
	We in Newfoundland, it is important to underscore, were not 
part of this country until 1949. When I joined the navy reserve I 
was a new Canadian of seven years. I had rarely been off the 
island. My friend from Summerside knows that those of us who 
are born and live on islands live a pristine and surreal existence 
that is the envy of many other people all over the world. One 
thing that it does for us is create a bond between us, but it does 
not introduce us always to other people in other areas.
<P>
	When I joined the Canadian navy I met for the first time other 
Canadians. I discovered what they were like. I got to know them. 
I trained in Halifax, I trained in Esquimalt, British Columbia. I 
saw both ends of this country and all places in between. That 
introduced me to Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1476"> 1476 </A></B>
<P>
	I make that point because I do not think we should 
underestimate the role of the armed forces in Canadian 
citizenship in the broad sense.
<P>
	As we question what is happening in the world and as we 
question what is happening in this country and as we look for the 
kind of Canada we have had, the kind of Canada that we want 
now and for the future, let us not underestimate the role of 
national institutions.
<P>
	As we see many national institutions fading, disappearing and 
changing it seems to me that the Canadian armed forces are one 
of those national institutions that is still with us and that still 
provides a very important role in this country for national 
citizenship in the broad sense of the word.
<P>
	It helped me to educate myself. It taught me a few things. I 
suppose if war were to be declared and were called up, I would 
be called upon to remember some of those things that I learned 
over 30 years ago. God help the country if that were the case.
<P>
	However, it taught me more than just navigation, seamanship, 
semaphore and that sort of thing. It taught me about people, how 
one responds to people, how one works with people, how one 
lives with people and about this country as well.
<P>
	I do not think we should underestimate the value of the armed 
forces for education and citizenship in the broadest sense of the 
words. I am not saying that may be the primary role of the armed 
forces but I think it is an important role.
<P>
	We should ask in this review how the armed forces reflect 
Canada in other ways. How many aboriginals are there in the 
armed forces, for example? Is it commensurate with the 
percentage of aboriginals in this country? How do the armed 
forces reflect the bilingual and bicultural nature of Canada? We 
do have bilingualism within the armed forces. As a matter fact, 
we have components of the armed forces that operate in either 
official language.
<P>
	I had the privilege last spring, as a matter of fact, of spending 
some time at Valcartier with the Vandoos before they went to 
Bosnia. I was impressed once again with the competence, the 
professionalism and the dedication of that particular fighting 
unit which is so renowned not only in this country but around the 
world. I was impressed as well with its ability to respond to new 
circumstances.
<P>
	It does not simply have a tradition. When I saw the simulation 
of events it was to meet in Bosnia going on at Valcartier I 
realized that particular unit not only had traditions but had 
competence in anticipating new situations that it would find 
itself in and was developing an ability to respond.
<P>
	We should ask ourselves in this review how the armed forces 
reflect various aspects of Canada in the inclusion of aboriginals, 
in the inclusion of people of both official languages.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	There are other components as well that we should be looking 
at to see whether our own armed forces effectively reflect the 
kind of Canada that we have and that we want.
<P>
	Then we should ask what do we want the armed forces to 
defend against? Should we be talking about defence or should 
we be talking about security, the security of Canada, and how we 
want Canada to be secured? Are our borders secure against the 
incursions of illegal drug pedlars, for example? Are we secure 
against foreign overfishing? I have to say that recently, as a 
matter of fact within the past few days, the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans has been in Brussels trying to convince the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization that we do have a 
serious crisis in this country.
<P>
	I have to say as well that the reports this morning were not all 
that encouraging. The CBC reported that European countries 
still do not accept, as I heard the news, that there is a crisis and 
that there has been a dramatic decline in fish stocks, even over 
the past year.
<P>
	If we have not been able to adequately defend ourselves and 
our resources through discussion and through international 
forums, and I consider myself a moderate, I have to say very 
clearly that these resources are important enough to us that we 
should consider taking extreme measures if we have to defend 
those resources.
<P>
	We have to see the future of the Canadian navy in that context, 
not just in the context of search and rescue. That has been 
alluded to already by my colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands, 
and quite rightly. I have known SAR Techs over the years and 
they are among the most competent and effective that we have 
anywhere in the Canadian forces. We have to make sure that we 
give them the appropriate tools to do their job.
<P>
	Particularly for those of us who live on both coasts, search and 
rescue is an essential and fundamental component that must be 
protected.
<P>
	How do we secure our towns and our cities in emergencies 
across the country? As my colleague has quite rightly said, that 
has been a historical role of the Canadian Armed Forces and will 
continue to be for the future. How do we secure this continent of 
North America in co-operation with our very powerful 
neighbour to the south? How do we secure air space? How do we 
secure the seas around North America? How do we secure our 
towns and cities within North America?
<P>
	There is a role there for the armed forces, it seems to me. We 
should be asking questions and comparing some of the things 
that are going on in the United States. For example, in the United 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1477"> 1477 </A></B>
<P>
States there is a national guard. Is  there a need or a role for such 
an organization in Canada? I do not know. These are interesting 
questions that we can explore as we explore the security of our 
towns and cities and our coasts and the role of the armed forces 
in doing that.
<P>
	Finally, apart from securing the continent and looking at the 
defence organizations that we have had such as NORAD, do we 
need a NORAD of the Pacific as well as a NORAD of the 
Atlantic?
<P>
	What about the Arctic sea? As the Prime Minister and others 
keep reminding us, this is a country that runs from sea to sea to 
sea. I just saw my colleague from Iqaluit here in the Chamber 
and he and I both understand that quite often traditionally 
Canadians see the coast as being east and west, but there is a 
northern coast as well. In my riding I come very close to the 
Arctic sea, to Baffin Island. I am just south of Baffin Island and I 
know that northwest passage is important to us as well.
<P>
	Canada runs from sea to sea to sea and we have to make sure 
that all of those coasts, all three of those coasts, are secure in the 
future. That is our mandate.
<P>
	How do we want to do that? We have to realize also that the 
world has to be made secure. Canada has a role in that as well.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The world has shrunk and is smaller than it ever was. Even if 
we wanted to and even if it was not in our best interest, I think we 
would be called upon to play a role within the UN. There is a 
growing need now, it seems to me, to look at the international 
structures we have created for ourselves to see if they are 
effective in decision making for keeping peace in the world. 
Once we ask about structures like the UN, NATO, the CSCE and 
so on we then have to ask: What armed forces do those structures 
need and how can Canada contribute?
<P>
	We have been called on over the years to be peacekeepers for 
the world. We have an international reputation, and quite rightly 
so. We will have to ask ourselves in this review: What is the 
level we can sustain in terms of peacekeeping? There has 
already been another call for more Canadian troops to go to 
Bosnia as the ceasefire seems to be taking hold and to be 
effective.
<P>
	How much can Canada sustain? We have troops in something 
like 17 different peacekeeping operations all over the world, 
something like 2,700 Canadians at last count, almost 2,000 of 
whom are in Bosnia, in the former Yugoslavia alone. Can we 
maintain 2,700 people in 17 different peacekeeping operations 
all over the world? It is not just our armed forces but our RCMP 
is taking part in those operations. Sometimes our customs 
officers are taking part in those operations. What level can 
Canada sustain? What role should Canada play?
<P>
	We will have to examine that. For all those roles how may 
people do we need in the armed forces? How many soldiers? 
How many airmen? How many naval personnel? How many 
naval ratings do we need? Those are the questions we have to 
ask.
<P>
	How will they be trained? Do they have to be combat ready? 
There is a theory proposed by the people to whom I talked at 
Valcartier last spring, the generals who were training the 
peacekeepers going to Bosnia, that the most effective 
peacekeeper is a fully trained combat soldier ready to meet any 
emergency. Only if we are ready to meet any emergency can we 
meet the lesser emergencies.
<P>
	We will have to ask: How do we train and what do we train 
for? Finally how will we equip the armed forces? What level of 
armaments will we need? How will we get those armaments? 
How much will we produce in this country? How much should 
we buy off the shelf? These are questions we will have to ask.
<P>
	What will be the impact of that on Canadians now? Obviously 
we will not take as thorough an assessment of the arms 
production industry in Canada, but it is relevant to the armed 
forces and it is relevant to the economy of Canada at this time. 
Those are questions the committee will have to ask as well.
<P>
	How much will we build in Canada? We are building now. We 
are building in Halifax. We are building in Saint John. We have 
some of the best in Quebec. We have some of the best and most 
competent shipbuilding operations anywhere in the world. We 
are building in London, Ontario. General Motors has an 
important plant for the construction of armoured vehicles.
<P>
	How much of this are we going to need? How much of this are 
we going to continue to build as Canadians? How much can we 
purchase elsewhere? Finally what level of funding will there be 
for the armed forces?
<P>
	In his statement the minister has quite rightly pointed out that 
this is an important part of our study too. In the document he 
tabled today, the guidance document, paragraph 6 says that the 
Department of National Defence has been and will continue to 
be supportive of efforts to improve Canada's overall fiscal 
situation. Planned outlays have been cut back by more than $14 
billion over the period between the fiscal years 1989 and 
1997-98.
<P>
	The cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter program and 
defence budget cuts called for during and since the recent 
federal election campaign will lower defence spending by well 
over 10 per cent in the next four years, from a high of 40 per cent 
some years ago to perhaps less than 7 per cent in present 
circumstances. Defence expenditures today account for less 
than 8 per cent of the federal budget as opposed to about 20 per 
cent in 1964. The defence estimates have taken a hit. There has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1478"> 1478 </A></B>
<P>
been a reduction in defence estimates. There will be more as we 
fight the fiscal situation and as we fight the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	I end where I began: We must not forget there is a critical mass 
to the armed forces and there is a level below which we cannot 
pare. If we go below that level whatever it turns out to be, we 
may not have an effective armed forces in the country to do the 
kinds of things we want them to do. That is the kind of question 
we will be asking in this review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the previous speaker. He gave us a very eloquent 
overview of national defence. However, I do not fully agree with 
him, especially since he did not stick to the motion before us 
today.
<P>
	As for the motion tabled this morning by the Minister of 
National Defence, I do not see the need to hold a special debate 
on our national defence policy, since the government has yet to 
table its white paper. With this debate, is the government 
playing for time and trying to bring the public on side? What I 
just said also goes for the cutbacks affecting military bases and 
for the peacekeeper training centres.
<P>
	I was hoping the debate would focus mostly on ways to lower 
defence spending, even before the budget is tabled, rather than 
on a joint committee made up of a specific number of people, 
with specific terms of reference, which will undoubtedly cost 
Canadians an unknown amount of money. Earlier, the hon. 
member raised many questions, and I think that we have 
received enough information from our military strategists and 
our military staff and we have had enough discussions with these 
people to know where we should be going with our national 
defence policy.
<P>
	I wonder of course how much this review will cost. I also 
wonder about the committee membership. I do not see why we 
need five senators on this committee, since they would only 
increase costs. But anyway, I am against such a committee.
<P>
	In this debate on national defence, I have much more 
confidence in our military strategists. We have to trust someone, 
otherwise we should stop sitting in this House and start spending 
all our time consulting department after department. For 
example, CFB Bagotville is designed to be involved in Canada's 
territorial air defence, airspace control, drug enforcement, 
international forces as well as support for our land and naval 
forces.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	CFB Bagotville can provide air defence since it already has all 
these elements. It can respond to all our anticipated needs in 
relation to NORAD. Bagotville is located 245 miles from 
Gagetown, 240 miles from Tracadie, 370 miles from Clearwater, 
85 miles from Valcartier and 290 miles from Petawawa. Its 
central location makes it ideally suited to provide, with 
optimum efficiency, the services to which Canadians are 
entitled.  The only thing that this base, which is 99.9 per cent 
francophone, needs to be really efficient is an air to ground 
weapons range.
<P>
	I hope that the government will take these remarks into 
consideration and will take action instead of constantly telling 
us to wait, to wait for the creation of jobs, to wait for the budget. 
Communities that are concerned about base closures want to 
know. This is the question that I want to ask my colleague: How 
long they will have to wait before the government makes a 
decision. Will they have to wait one more year or even two more 
years? Will the government let this uncertainty drag on? If they 
knew that they were going to lose their base, they could start 
working right away with labour unions, with the industries that 
will be affected and with the people themselves in order to come 
up with a new project to replace that base. That is my question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rompkey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I tell the hon. member that 
Bagotville is very important to me because CF-18s from 
Bagotville are staged into Goose Bay from time to time. In my 
riding we have a very direct connection in Goose Bay to 
Bagotville. I do not know what the future is for that base or other 
bases. I know the government will very soon make clear its 
intention in that regard, in keeping with the promises made in 
the red book during the campaign. Very soon Canadians will be 
apprised of the intentions of the government in that regard.
<P>
	I just want to make two other comments. As I understood the 
hon. member he seemed to want to have the government's 
intentions first. As a member who has been around here for some 
time, I have to say I have been very impressed by the way in 
which this particular Parliament has proceeded, that is by 
actually asking members of Parliament what they thought 
before the government made some decisions.
<P>
	Those of us who were around here before know that was not 
always the case. Decisions were made. They were a fait 
accompli. They were handed to people whether or not they liked 
them. This way is a much better way to proceed. Not only are 
parliamentarians being asked their opinion before long-term 
government decisions are made, but the people of Canada are 
having a chance to participate. When we were in opposition we 
called for this and I am very happy to see it is taking place.
<P>
	With regard to an increase in spending, whether or not the 
member agrees with a joint committee I do not see a great 
increase in spending. It seems to me the committee will have to 
travel whether or not it is both Houses. The salaries of senators 
as well as members of Parliament will be paid on whatever 
committee they happen to sit on any particular day. I do not see a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1479"> 1479 </A></B>
<P>
great increase in spending as a result of having a joint committee 
rather than a House of Commons committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
try to be a little more brief in my question. I suspect many of us 
in the House have been touched at one time or another in some 
way by the military as I have been. I have friends still in the 
military all over the country whom I knew 20 years past.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	I agree with many of the comments made by the hon. member 
for Labrador concerning national pride. People today are 
somewhat confused about the role of the military. People within 
the ranks of the military are also somewhat confused about it 
which does not do much for their morale.
<P>
	I do believe we should study first and take action second, as 
my friend from Saanich-Gulf Islands has said. I also believe 
we should end the political football that has been evident within 
the military for 20 years at least. It seems to become an issue 
every year at budget time.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on three areas. 
When the minister made his opening statement he said that 
public consultation is a priority with the government but the 
report that will ensue from the consultation will not constitute 
the new defence policy. I wonder if that is some form of 
disclaimer to the findings of the report itself or if it is just 
another way of saying the committee does not have as much 
teeth as we think it may have.
<P>
	Another comment is on the selected communities where 
representations can be made. It is important to realize that some 
of these communities should be places like Summerside which 
has already gone through this type of situation. That community 
may offer some very good comments on this particular situation 
now that the deed has been done down there. The locations of 
these representations should be very carefully assessed and 
selected.
<P>
	One other comment I would like to have made by the hon. 
member is the role of the reserves. I well remember growing up 
in the maritimes in the mid-1960s. I joined the military in 
Halifax, virtually having left school at a predetermined age. I 
had very few opportunities but I received a very good 
opportunity with the military and made a home there which led 
to a career.
<P>
	What role does the government see for the reserves? There is a 
great opportunity for expansion. Perhaps the hon. member could 
comment on the future of young people in the reserves.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I recognize the 
hon. member for Labrador, the member for Fraser Valley West 
reminds me that like all new members in this 35th Parliament he 
has learned his lessons well in a very short period of time and 
that within one question there are many questions to the hon. 
member for Labrador.
<P>
	Trying to respect the standing orders with regard to time 
limits of speeches in questions and comments, particularly in a 
debate such as this one which is of great importance to all 
Canadians, and wanting to give as many members as possible 
the opportunity to participate, I would ask the co-operation of 
everyone so that we might be able to get on the record the 
participation of as many members as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rompkey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I take your point and will be 
brief.
<P>
	On the last point, let me just say that I would foresee an 
increasing role for the reserves in the Canadian Armed Forces. 
We are committed to the total force concept, as was the previous 
government. We will be studying the comments the Auditor 
General has made on the inadequate integration of the reserves. 
However, suffice it to say that I see a continuing and increasing 
role for the reserves in the Canadian Armed Forces. Indeed, 
approximately 30 per cent of our people in Bosnia are reserves.
<P>
	I take the point concerning locations of representations. I 
assure the hon. member that the committee will want to travel all 
across the country. The committee wants to hear from as many 
Canadians as possible, including those who traditionally have 
been part of the armed forces establishment and those who are 
simply interested.
<P>
	With regard to the minister's comments this morning about 
the white paper following on from the committee report, if the 
member reads the blues, he will see the minister said that the 
government would not necessarily be totally governed by the 
report of the committee. He did go on to say, I think if the blues 
are checked, that the government would ignore the committee 
report at its peril.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I simply took that as the minister giving himself enough 
latitude to be the government, as is his role, but saying very 
clearly that this is a serious process and that we do want to hear 
recommendations and to hear policy formulated from the 
parliamentarians of Canada after listening to the people of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government is inviting us today to a third debate on Canadian 
defence policy. Going against all logic, the government started 
this series of debates by asking the House to reflect on two 
special aspects of such a policy, namely the role of Canadian 
peacekeepers in Bosnia-Hercegovina and in Croatia, and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1480"> 1480 </A></B>
<P>
testing of cruise missiles over Canadian territory, before letting 
us know the general direction of its intended defence policy.
<P>
	Today, without any warning, the government is asking the 
House to debate the main thrusts of our new defence policy 
using as a base a vague and general document which has been 
handed out to members at the very last minute. Moreover, the 
government assumes that a defence policy can be considered 
independently from foreign policy, which is not the case. There 
again, the government carefully avoided to unveil its intentions 
regarding the direction it will give to this new foreign policy.
<P>
	However, since we must accept the general format decided 
upon by the government for this debate, I will say that we first 
need to put this question in the general geopolitical context of 
the day, because it is this context which determines the choices 
Canada will have to make when defining its defence policy.
<P>
	It might be useful to recall that at the end of the second world 
war, the world split in two distinct blocs, the western bloc and 
the eastern bloc, which set up two competing military alliances, 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, that Canada 
joined in 1949, and the Warsaw pact.
<P>
	At the end of the cold war, toward the end of the eighties, this 
polarized political situation changed drastically. The Warsaw 
pact dissolved, leaving NATO without any apparent rival. 
Therefore, western countries do not seem to be facing any 
readily identifiable threat. World stability is no longer the result 
of a balance of power between two groups. New nuclear powers 
are gradually emerging, and they often are politically unstable. 
Under such circumstances, it became difficult for Canada and its 
allies to question the collective security system which had 
determined their defence policy during the cold war.
<P>
	On another level, the decreased influence of the east bloc 
countries and Russia on international issues had a direct impact 
on the political and military stability in several regions of the 
planet. Yugoslavia and the ex-Soviet republics are the most 
striking examples of that.
<P>
	Some regions have also tried to take advantage of the new 
division of strategic powers to assert their political and military 
presence in their part of the world. The Persian Gulf war remains 
the most striking case, in line with the new configuration of 
global politics.
<P>
	In response to the emerging political balance, NATO 
countries reviewed and then modified their defence policies. 
The same process went on in Canada and, in 1992, the 
government presented a new political statement to replace 
Perrin Beatty's white paper dating back to 1987.
<P>
	The defence policy of western countries was readjusted in 
several ways. First, the most important measure in my view was 
to reduce the defence budgets; since exterior threats were no 
longer comparable to those that prevailed during the cold war, 
defence did not require as many resources as it did in the past. 
The armaments industry was affected directly by that 
readjustment because its  markets shrunk considerably. In arms 
producing countries, hundreds of thousands of people were laid 
off and Canada was no exception.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Second, on a more strategic level, was the review of potential 
sources of outside threats. Under the new international order, 
the danger of an east-west conflict has greatly diminished. The 
new dangers, as identified by NATO members, stem from the 
regional conflicts which have been emerging in various parts of 
the world over the last few years. Canada shares this point of 
view, as attested by its 1992 policy statement.
<P>
	Third, the political and strategic mandates of the major 
international organizations are being totally redefined. The UN 
and NATO are two cases in point.
<P>
	The United Nations organization, through the Security 
Council, is increasingly being asked to take action in conflicts 
arising in various parts of the world. The latest ones, the gulf 
war and the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, herald new 
trends which have a significant impact on the national defence 
policy of western nations.
<P>
	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for its part, seems to 
be willing to take on a much bigger role since the disintegration 
of the Warsaw pact. Originally designed to ensure the mutual 
defence of its member countries, NATO is now seeking to 
modify its defence mandate in the north Atlantic to become 
more closely associated with the United Nations organization, 
as its military arm whose role would be to enforce the mandates 
given the UN by the Security Council.
<P>
	This trend is reflected in negotiations on the use of air strikes 
against Serbian troops in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
<P>
	As a member of two major international organizations, NATO 
and the UN, Canada cannot and must not withdraw from 
discussions on these issues. The international situation is very 
unstable, and it would be extremely dangerous to renege on our 
international commitments.
<P>
	As you know, Canada does not have the necessary resources to 
provide for the security and full defence of its vast territory.
<P>
	This given has had a decisive factor in Canada's defence 
policy for several decades, as can be seen by this country's 
participation in joint security systems established through 
NATO and NORAD. It would also be unrealistic to think Canada 
is not affected by changes in the global political situation. We 
must realize that Canada can play a strategic role at the 
international level and, in return, rely on its international 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1481"> 1481 </A></B>
<P>
alliances to guarantee the security of its territory. That was the 
gist of the 1992 policy statement.
<P>
	The statement replaced the 1987 white paper which, as I said 
earlier, was drafted in a cold war context. The new defence 
policy was intended as an adjustment to the new international 
situation. It pointed out the risks that continued to exist from a 
strategic point of view, despite the collapse of the Warsaw pact, 
and perhaps I may quote the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The nuclear arsenals of the former Soviet Union remain sufficient to devastate 
this continent. At a time of ongoing instability in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, prudence requires that we take these capabilities into 
account in the formulation our defence policy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The size of our country, its strategic location, and the limited resources that we 
can devote to defence mean that, for the foreseeable future, Canada will maintain 
its long-standing relationship with the United States.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Until further notice, this policy statement is still the Canadian 
government's official policy on national defence. A few 
adjustments have been made, however, including the renewal of 
the Canadian-American agreement on cruise missile testing. 
Furthermore, with its contingent of peacekeepers, Canada has 
also helped redefine its role within our international 
institutions.
<P>
	As far as strategy is concerned, we have seen that the 
geopolitical context is changing very fast. As I said earlier, this 
development should not necessarily be interpreted as a portent 
of a new era of peace. The carnage taking place in various parts 
of the world should give us some indication that is not the case.
<P>
	It would be illogical to think that just because the world is no 
longer divided into east and west as it was after World War II, we 
should abandon our role within the joint security systems.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The concept of threat should not be perceived only as being 
inherently linked to the concept of territory. Should the conflict 
in the former Yugoslavia spread beyond its borders, for 
example, Europe and NATO would be directly involved. The 
catastrophic consequences of such a scenario are serious enough 
to make us realize how important it is to have a defence policy 
which is not only intended to protect the territory of Canada or 
Quebec, but also takes into consideration the security of our 
strategic and traditional allies.
<P>
	During the last election, and many times since October 25, the 
Bloc Quebecois has reaffirmed its support for cuts in the budget 
of the Department of National Defence. Despite the 
international context I have just described, we believe that we 
could cut that budget by some 25 per cent without dramatically 
impairing the operations of that important department.
<P>
	Reducing the budget of the Department of National Defence 
by 25 per cent does not mean that we should withdraw from our 
obligations. On the contrary. The Bloc Quebecois is not 
advocating the total elimination of all major equipment 
procurement programs, though we believe some should perhaps 
be abandoned.
<P>
	These programs remain important if Canada is to live up to its 
international commitments, but the rapid changes on the 
political scene worldwide make it necessary for western 
countries to redefine their defence policies on an ongoing basis. 
Canada is no different.
<P>
	A new government has been elected and it is now its 
responsibility to propose new directions, in terms of defence, 
that can adequately address these rapid and fundamental 
changes that are occurring throughout the world. In this regard, 
you will note that the Liberal Party of Canada had already stated 
some of its positions while sitting on this side of the House, in 
the opposition, and during the last election campaign.
<P>
	But it is worth pointing out, Mr. Speaker, that this is not the 
first time that the Liberal Party sends conflicting and unclear 
messages about its defence policy. Let me just remind you that, 
in the early seventies, under Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian 
government tried at first to distinguish itself from its American 
neighbour, but later, in the early eighties, its positions got 
considerably closer to the Americans'. As evidence of this, it is 
interesting to note that it is the Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
administration that first authorized cruise missile testing on 
Canadian soil in 1983.
<P>
	Let me also remind you that Prime Minister Trudeau had 
taken on an international peace mission while at the time 
increasing considerably national defence budgets and 
authorizing the purchase of sophisticated equipment in order to 
support Canadian defence policy. I am thinking, for instance, 
about the acquisition of CF-18s and the first order for new 
frigates intended for the Canadian navy.
<P>
	While sitting in the opposition, the Liberal Party often blamed 
the Conservative government for being too conciliatory with the 
United States. It did not keep the Liberal Party from reaffirming 
its support for the cruise missile tests last January, even though 
many of the top members of the party had objected to such tests. 
It is not easy therefore to anticipate what the main orientations 
of the government will be on the issue of national defence.
<P>
	Yet, on a political level, it is important that we make sure the 
government determines in the very near future the thrust of new 
defence and foreign affairs policies that will be credible, clear 
and feasible.
<P>
	It is too late to go on listing platitudes like they have been 
doing in the red book until now. The Liberal Party is in office; it 
must act responsibly and stop pretending it is consulting people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1482"> 1482 </A></B>
<P>
in order to gain time. Consultation is definitely a good thing, but 
it does not relieve the government from its obligation to reveal 
its intentions and the general principles of the policies it wants 
to  implement. Discussion is valuable only if it is based on solid 
grounds.
<P>
	The House of Commons is now in its third emergency debate 
on issues that are not supported by an honest and concrete 
national defence policy. What is even worse is that those debates 
do not seem to lead to any well defined policy.
<P>
	Such an attitude is totally inappropriate. At this stage of the 
discussion, we denounce resorting to emergency debates on a 
national defence policy when the government has not even 
presented its new white paper on the subject.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I also seriously question the creation of a joint committee of 
the House and of the Senate to study and define the direction 
Canada's new defence policy should take. I doubt it is pertinent 
and financially sound as an operating procedure.
<P>
	Since there is already a House standing committee which has 
been given the mandate to study defence issues, we believe a 
joint committee would only duplicate its efforts, with all the 
expected drawbacks as far as efficiency and cost effectiveness 
are concerned. We think the government must avoid such 
expensive practices which only go to demonstrate that the 
Senate of Canada is useful and its existence fully justified. This 
inference alone should lead us to question the relevance of 
keeping this antiquated and archaic institution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make a few comments on what the hon. 
member for Verchères had to say and pose a question to him.
<P>
	He made reference to the fact that this is the third debate we 
have had in the House on the armed forces in a hundred days. He 
spoke of this in a negative sense. I suspect there are those in the 
country and many members in the House who would look on that 
fact as being very positive. Certainly members of the armed 
forces welcome a discussion on their business. Three 
discussions in a hundred days is more than we have had on 
national defence in the House in the last 10 years. I see that as 
positive.
<P>
	The member says these discussions are about defence policy, 
that we are going to have a defence policy today. I remind him 
that in the case of Bosnia the fact that we have a peacekeeping 
capability and would peacekeep is defence policy. Whether we 
would continue to leave peacekeepers in a particular location is 
a national operational decision. It is not a policy decision.
<P>
	On the business of cruise missiles the minister made it quite 
clear on February 3 when he answered a question that we had 
agreed to participate in the cruise missile testing, but on the 
understanding with the American government that future testing 
would be determined by our defence policy. It is unfair for him 
to do that.
<P>
	I have a question for him. He says that we are buying time. 
The red book said that we would have a defence white paper by 
the end of this year. That is what we are doing. It was clear. It 
was telegraphed months ago, almost six months ago. By the 
same token he says this is all wrong because we cannot make 
policy in these decisions; we have to study it properly. Then he 
says we are just biding time and goes on to say that what we 
really need to do is to cut defence by 25 per cent.
<P>
	Does the hon. member want a policy to decide what we want 
to do, or does he want to cut it by 25 per cent? He cannot have 
both.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to my hon. colleague, I 
hear a lot of things I never said. First of all, I would like to say 
that I went out of my way to point out that such a debate was 
highly desirable, and highly praiseworthy, but that we cannot 
have a discussion just for the sake of it. To have any productive 
discussion, we need a policy paper to give a direction to the 
debate.
<P>
	When we had the debate on whether Canadian peacekeepers 
should stay in Bosnia-Hercegovina and in Croatia, and the 
debate on allowing further cruise missile testing in Canada, we, 
on this side of the House, criticized not the relevance of the 
debate nor its very nature, but the fact that the debate was going 
on before the government had presented its overall policy or the 
general direction of its defence policy.
<P>
	My hon. colleague is quite right when he says that cruise 
missile testing and peacekeeping are part of Canada's overall 
defence policy. Consequently, as far as we are concerned, it is 
totally illogical to proceed backwards and, as I said before, put 
the cart before the horse by debating certain specific aspects of 
the defence policy before we even had a chance to discuss that 
policy as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	In view of such criticism, we thought that the government had 
gotten the message. Obviously, it has not. It is back today with 
this debate on Canada's defence policy, without any policy 
paper or guidelines, except for this short paper we were given 
only this morning.
<P>
	I think that we should have received this document much 
earlier so that we could have been apprised of the government's 
concerns and questions regarding defence policy. They only 
gave it to us this morning. How are we expected to have a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1483"> 1483 </A></B>
<P>
worthwhile debate under such conditions? What I was 
criticizing in this debate was not its relevance but the way it is 
taking place.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in my introductory comments on welcoming this 
opportunity to speak I said how great it was that we had three 
parliamentary debates on national defence in a hundred days 
which was more than we had in 10 years. Certainly I welcome 
that. I know members of the armed forces and members of the 
House welcome it. I see it as very positive.
<P>
	The premise under which we are discussing today is that for 
the first time, certainly in my memory, parliamentarians are 
having a look at and listening to what the country has to say to 
determine what will be the defence policy. In my memory a 
white paper has not been written as a result of a parliamentary 
committee. I welcome that. It is the way it should be done. 
Instead of people behind closed doors putting together 
documents on premises that may or may not be right, I believe 
this is the right and proper way to produce a white paper.
<P>
	By way of introduction I want to give some indication of how 
I plan to organize my thoughts today. I want to have a look at the 
traditional way we have gone about producing defence policies 
in Canada. Then I want to expand and have a look at some of the 
factors that have changed which may cause us to rethink our 
traditional way of producing our defence policies. Then I want 
to give some examples of those general discussions in the time I 
have.
<P>
	To begin with, Canada's traditional approach to defence 
planning has been affected by many factors. Many of them 
cannot be changed. We have the country's political evolution 
and, to a certain extent, our post-colonial sense of dependence. 
This was thrown off at Vimy Ridge but it still remained for a few 
years after. We have our vast expanse and remoteness. We are 
the second largest country in the world. We have three oceans. 
We have the world's largest coastline. We have our physical 
contiguity with the world's most powerful state and, above all, 
our own peculiar political culture and the effect on how we 
govern ourselves.
<P>
	The formulation of a clear policy in Canada is never a simple 
or easy matter. In my opinion Canadian defence policy has 
seldom represented a deliberately chosen course of strategic 
direction or a fully integrated element of national purpose and 
object.
<P>
	For more than four decades the basic premise on which 
Canada's defence policy was based was the cold war. That was 
the background against which we defined our security interests. 
That was the reference point for the setting of priorities and the 
making of decisions.
<P>
	The 1964 white paper was based on the view that if there were 
a war it would be nuclear and over quickly, thus precluding the 
practical use of conventional or reserve forces.
<P>
	The 1971 white paper cut back military numbers but expanded 
their roles: protecting our sovereignty, defending North 
America, upholding NATO, domestic emergencies and UN 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	The 1987 white paper considered nuclear powered 
submarines, new tanks, bases in the north and forward operating 
bases for F-18s as essential to our defence, at a time when the 
cold war premise was about to come to an end.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	It also, incidentally, seriously considered the total force 
concept, calling up a force in reserve to complement forces in 
being.
<P>
	The latest policy statement issued by the minister of defence 
in September 1991 represented a useful, but I believe long 
overdue clarification of a change in orientation. If one really 
views it in its pure terms, the document was more of a 
rationalization of incremental decisions that had already been 
taken more than a suitably thoughtful re-examination of the 
basis for future policy development and planning.
<P>
	The premises have changed. It is now time to measure policy 
against those changes and on that basis work our way to 
decisions that will serve our national interest.
<P>
	To begin with we are now living in a period of technological 
change that can justifiably be called a second industrial 
revolution. Advances in microelectronics, genetic engineering, 
materials, space and telecommunications have turned industrial 
planning upside down.
<P>
	When we factor in the deeply embedded and substantive 
trends in the physical environment, human rights, 
demographics, trade and economic patterns, it suggests a 
climate in which the traditional business as usual view of 
defence planning is unlikely to work.
<P>
	I believe also the concept of national security is changing. 
Today it must be recognized that military might does not wield 
the same amount of national power it did yesterday. Indeed, the 
relative power of countries is now determined by an increasing 
interplay of economic and military factors which together with 
the fragile disposition of modern political systems is a major 
consideration.
<P>
	The emerging democracies in eastern Europe for example, in 
Latin America and elsewhere will only add stability to their 
respective regions if they are seen as capable of tackling their 
domestic problems.
<P>
	National security in the future may be just as concerned with 
environmental issues and the ability of a nation to feed itself as 
it is with the size, nature and structure of the armed forces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1484"> 1484 </A></B>
<P>
shaped from the time  honoured need of maintaining territorial 
sovereignty and security.
<P>
	The <I>Exxon Valdez</I> oil spill off the coast of Alaska comes to 
mind. So does the collision early in this decade between a U.S. 
and a Russian nuclear submarine near Russia's Arctic naval base 
in which some experts suggest that had the submarines collided 
at a different angle, both may have sunk instantly before their 
nuclear reactors could have been shut down.
<P>
	Economic and social developments, while traditionally 
considered important in determining national interest, have 
today taken on a new significance for military planning as states 
struggle for independence and to protect markets and access to 
resources vital to their domestic economies.
<P>
	Interruption in the flow of oil out of the Middle East for 
example was a major consideration in Canada's going to war for 
the first time in 40 years in the Persian gulf in 1992.
<P>
	Similarly, the concern of Atlantic Canadians, my own 
province and the Atlantic provinces, over the survival of their 
northern cod stocks may very well involve maritime forces 
responding to foreign overfishing on the nose and tail of the 
Grand Banks in a big way.
<P>
	The hon. member for Labrador this morning spoke of this and 
other national and sovereign imperatives that we will have to 
consider. Therefore I will not cover that.
<P>
	I now want to cast my eye internationally. At the end of World 
War II we ended up with 60 countries in the world-recognized 
entities as countries. As a result of revolutions and 
decolonialization, countries breaking up, today we have three 
times that many countries in less than 50 years.
<P>
	In these 180 countries of the world, there are 4,000 languages 
and as many religions. What is interesting about the 
composition of the countries is it is responsible for the trend that 
we see today. That is that 60 of these countries have populations 
of one million or less and 40 of them have less than 200,000, less 
than most of the smaller provinces in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	More important, and I think it is germane to the argument I am 
making, less than 10 per cent of these countries have a 
homogeneous ethnic population and less than 5 per cent have an 
ethnic group that accounts for more than 75 per cent of the 
population.
<P>
	I believe what we are seeing is an explosion of nations 
downward and inward to the point where they are really 
comprising the smallest ethnic and religious groups.
<P>
	In the last four and half years we have been involved in the 
world and in Canada in more peacekeeping operations than we 
have in the last 40 years. If we take the trend that I spoke of 
earlier and look at the increasing intolerance of religious, social 
and ethnic groups one for the other, it is my thesis that the 
demand  for peace operations is going to increase in scope, in 
number and in complexity.
<P>
	Let us look at some very simple examples. Political 
instability has us involved in Cambodia. The inability of 
Somalis to provide food for themselves had us involved there. 
Ethnic wars in the former Yugoslavia has us involved there. 
Canadians are asking why, why? These are some of the things 
that our defence policy will address.
<P>
	The simple answer is that Canada is a major trading nation 
with a multicultural make-up and it is in our national interest to 
invest our national resources to maintain a more stable world.
<P>
	The traditional concept of national security is also affected by 
the uncertainty as to what might be a new pattern of world order 
to emerge following 45 years of a relatively stable cold war 
environment. I would suggest that history tends to work that 
way. History tends to work in pattern, certainly in my lifetime.
<P>
	The most recent example I suppose I can quote is that after the 
end of World War II it took a few years for a pattern of the cold 
war to emerge and for east and west military and political 
alliances to polarize on either side of the iron curtain. We had 
the Warsaw pact versus the NATO alliance. The cold war is now 
over and the security systems that we have known all our lives 
are in question. We are waiting to see what will eventually 
replace them.
<P>
	On top of that the traditional alliances, the Middle East order, 
has changed. Trade patterns have changed and we are not sure 
what is going to replace them. We are still getting used to the 
idea of a single superpower and what that means to the outcome 
of regional disputes, although the recent Persian gulf campaign 
does provide some tangible evidence of how future blow-ups 
may be managed.
<P>
	What happens in the Middle East will in many ways impact on 
Europe and what prospects there may be for global order in 
coming decades. The same argument applies for Asia where the 
changing power balances are affecting the positions of China 
and Japan as well as the smaller economic tigers such as Korea 
and Taiwan.
<P>
	Superimposed on all of that of course is the compelling need 
to refurbish the operating mechanisms of the United Nations. 
That I do not believe needs any elaboration in this House to the 
members present.
<P>
	Until a clear pattern emerges which if we are to believe 
history it will in a few years, hasty decisions on defence services 
programs for a 15-year period based on an outdated defence 
policy of the past five years may prove very, very risky.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1485"> 1485 </A></B>
<P>
	Another consideration comes to mind. It relates to the need in 
responding to these factors of change within the parameters of 
national pressures for immediately shrinking defence budgets. 
As identifiable enemies disappear we do not have an identifiable 
Warsaw pact, we do not have an identifiable Soviet Union; as a 
perceived identifiable enemy disappears, the constituency for 
defence cut funding in this country and in other countries will by 
natural order and natural trends diminish and the call for peace 
dividends and conversion will increase.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Peace Alliance, for example, is already calling 
for the budget to be cut in half. I am still seeing editorials in 
national newspapers citing the importance of identifying the 
industrial parameters and the national imperatives related to the 
conversion of defence industries. Conversion of defence 
industries is a big thing in the United States and in the U.K.
<P>
	They may not agree with them, and there are members in the 
House whom I see nodding and shaking their heads, but I believe 
they have to be addressed by proper defence policy review.
<P>
	In summing up what I have said, let me repeat that this is a 
time when it is particularly important to base defence policy on 
a truly vigorous appreciation of the complex global situation, on 
the broader meaning of national security and on a focused effort 
to be prepared to dispense with the traditional methods in the 
interest of effectiveness. As I said earlier, the fact that the 
genesis for this white paper is coming from political 
committees, parliamentarians studying the issues, I believe is an 
indication that we have agreed and are prepared to digress from 
the age-old traditional methods.
<P>
	Canada is committed to peace. That after all and above all is 
our national interest. Our national goal is to promote a more 
stable international environment as I spoke of earlier. The role 
of our armed forces is to defend this country and to contribute to 
the preservation of peace and stability throughout the world. 
Our defence policy must support these objectives.
<P>
	To do this effectively it must be based on a clear-eyed 
perception, one that recognizes the achievements of the past but 
also the continuing dangers of the present.
<P>
	Sir John Hackett, a very well-known and highly respected 
military person and author, once said: ``When a society looks at 
its armed forces, it is looking in a mirror and if the reflection of 
that mirror is a true one, the face they see will be their own''.
<P>
	Our armed forces have always acquitted themselves 
admirably. Their reputation as true professionals is unsurpassed 
be it in NATO, peacekeeping, national efforts, search and rescue 
or any conceivable operation that is within the purview of the 
military inventory.
<P>
	Our policy review must be correct in order that when our 
young men and women in uniform are committed to an operation 
and sent in harms way, as many of them are today, their 
government and their country will know that they need to be 
there and they have the proper equipment and logistics support 
to make sure that they will do their job as well as they can under 
the circumstances.
<P>
	In conclusion the decisions we make about Canadian policy 
must be guided by commitment, by focus, and by prudence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member. It 
seems he has disregarded an aspect of the national defence 
policy review and consequently of the Canadian Armed Forces, 
and that is the work language in the armed forces.
<P>
	I know that the former Conservative minister, Mr. Masse, had 
deplored the fact that French language was rarely used in the 
armed forces and that few francophones got promotions.
<P>
	I know that in my own riding some members of the reserve 
cannot take courses in French and, therefore, find themselves 
barred from getting promotions.
<P>
	Therefore, I wonder if the government will consider this 
matter in its review of the general role of the armed forces, and 
consequently of the operations of the Canadian Armed Forces. I 
would like to know the government's position on the matter 
because the present situation appears quite deplorable.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
question. Whether it has applicability and relevance to the 
particular discussion I just had I suppose is immaterial. I will 
grant him that it is an aspect of our policy we should be looking 
at. I did not mention it of course. He appreciates that in a 
20-minute presentation we are all constrained to present factors 
determined by a number of things.
<P>
	It is a fair question. What I will say to the hon. member is 
something the Prime Minister has not said. I am sure he would 
agree with what I am about to say but I have not checked it out 
with him.
<P>
	There are no sacred cows. We have assumed nothing in that 
sense. Clearly there have to be parameters in what it is we do. I 
speak generally and from personal experience. Considerable 
progress has been made in that area. More progress has yet to be 
made.
<P>
	One example for the hon. member of an ongoing project in his 
province is a centre of excellence for the naval reserve force. He 
is aware of course that the headquarters for naval reserves is in 
Quebec City. This centre of excellence will be used for training 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1486"> 1486 </A></B>
<P>
reserves. It is meant to address the ability for naval personnel 
who  tend to be posted to the east and west coasts to be given the 
opportunity to participate in their second language.
<P>
	I use that as one example of the ongoing efforts by National 
Defence. However, the general answer to the member's question 
is that I am sure it will be addressed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
National Defence for his eloquent defence of the defence 
department.
<P>
	At the edge of my riding are CFB Namao and CFB Edmonton. 
We heard the defence minister speak this morning about how 
there will be cuts. I understand that cuts have to be made. 
However, today we are debating the need for a defence review. I 
am quite concerned that the minister intends to make some 
serious cuts to the defence establishments.
<P>
	Prior to the commencement of the review or right at the very 
beginning rather than at the end, CFB Edmonton now employs 
about 2,800 military personnel and quite a number of civilians 
in addition to that. It is the base for search and rescue for 
Canada's north. As I mentioned, there was the plane crash in 
Resolute Bay where there was loss of life because we were 
unable to get people in there quickly enough to save those lives.
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary give any assurance 
whatsoever to me and my constituents, if the rumours are true 
that CFB Edmonton is perhaps on the chopping block, that their 
jobs are secure? This is a major defence installation. We cannot 
just say that all the things they were doing yesterday are now 
totally superfluous and just close the whole place down. This is 
the hub of the western forces in Canada and many headquarter 
facilities are there.
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary give his assurance that CFB 
Edmonton will be maintained so that these people can be assured 
they are performing a vital role as they have been in the past 
toward the defence of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that the hon. member 
feels constrained by this in response to his constituents. I would 
do the same thing and I appreciate his concern.
<P>
	I would just like to repeat what the minister said this morning. 
I have heard him say it many times. That is that we have to be 
very clear that the infrastructure rationalization is separate from 
the defence policy.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands will remember as 
I do that whenever cuts and reductions in the military force came 
up those of us in uniform would reach for a thing called the 
infrastructure study. We would give it to the politicians because 
we knew they would never cut back on infrastructure. It was 
politically dangerous to engage in infrastructure rationalization.
<P>
	We-not just any side of the House, but all politicians and I 
am one of them-cannot engage in that any longer. We now have 
an infrastructure for 75,000 people that we had for 130,000. We 
may get away with plus or minus 10 or 20 per cent but we cannot 
get away with 100 per cent deficit. We have one building for 
every two people in the Canadian forces. We cannot rationalize 
that. We cannot agree with that and cut the operational edge of 
the armed forces. It would not be fair to our men and women in 
uniform.
<P>
	We have an operational capability right now. That is 
essentially to send a task group to sea, to send two squadrons of 
fighter aircraft abroad and to send a battle group. We want to 
honour the commitments we have made in the red book but at the 
same time maintain our operational commitment until we decide 
in a defence policy review what we want that commitment to be.
<P>
	The hon. member knows I am unable to comment on the 
question he has asked me. I hope the overall perspective I have 
given him will put it in the context of what we are discussing 
today and why the policy review will be in the future and 
infrastructure decisions will have to be made before that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been listening for some time now to what the member opposite 
has to say about defence. I must say I have serious reservations 
about the need for such a new committee.
<P>
	Earlier, some members told us how pleased they were because 
this is the third time the issue has been raised in the last 100 
days. That, in my opinion, does not mean we will get better 
results. If we had been better prepared, we might have needed to 
address the issue only once.
<P>
	Also, we have heard a lot about the way this government is 
doing things, about the way it consults before taking action. I 
agree that members should be consulted. However, when we are 
asked to set up a committee without knowing how much it is 
going to cost, we need to consider the proposal very carefully. 
Earlier, a member talked about the Charlottetown circus which 
cost, as we know, millions and millions of dollars.
<P>
	What bothers me beside the costs of the project is the way they 
keep quoting the red book. It seems that the red book contains all 
the solutions needed to improve government management. If 
that is true, why not simply implement the red book; let the 
government implement it and we will be able to decide for 
ourselves. We might not need this committee after all, which 
plans to travel throughout Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1487"> 1487 </A></B>
<P>
	We also heard about cuts and streamlining measures. But what 
will we do? We will travel throughout Canada to gather 
suggestions without knowing whether we will get the money and 
the budget to implement them.
<P>
	To sum up, I would like to ask my colleague how much he 
thinks this committee will cost us? What will we get from it? 
You have to remember that less than a week or 15 days ago, we, 
in the Bloc Quebecois, were suggesting that a committee be set 
up to review government expenditures, and that our proposal 
was turned down. Such a committee was not deemed necessary, 
because the government thought it had all the tools it needed to 
do that review.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I think that today the government is not looking just to set up 
another committee, but it also wants to travel throughout 
Canada to sound out public opinion. We just came out of an 
election. First, we should let the government implement the red 
book, and then, we can see what more can be done.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to run out of time. May I 
have the unanimous agreement of the House to answer the 
question? It will not take too long.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is some time 
remaining for the parliamentary secretary to respond. If he 
should go beyond the allowable limits we are prepared to take 
into consideration his request at that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member had a number of 
questions but I think the focus was why we need to have this 
committee. I have to presume he means the combined 
committee because I do not believe the hon. member would 
object to the defence standing committee studying the defence 
issue. I am going to assume he meant the combined committee.
<P>
	I am not sure where the Bloc is coming from because I sat in 
this House a week or 10 days ago while the Bloc argued for a 
committee to look at issues the Auditor General had raised. On 
the one hand it wants some committees. On the other hand it now 
objects to the fact that a committee is struck for a substantive 
purpose, that is to look at what it is we are doing in defence.
<P>
	The hon. member asks why we do not just apply the red book. 
That is precisely what we are doing. We are applying the red 
book. The red book says we are going to have a defence policy 
review by the end of the year. That is what we are doing. It 
should be no surprise.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about preparation time. My gosh, 
people with the backgrounds they have should not need much 
time to prepare on such an issue as defence policy. God knows 
members spoke about it enough during the election so they 
should have enough preparation time to talk on the general 
subject. This is not a specific issue. Any member can get up and 
talk about anything on defence related to a defence review. I am 
not sympathetic to that problem quite frankly.
<P>
	I will address the substantive issue. The substantive issue the 
hon. member has put to me is how the parliamentary secretary 
and the minister can support a combined committee. I will give 
him the answer; it is not that complex.
<P>
	In the bad old days the traditional method I talked about in 
defence planning was relatively simple in the sense of how it 
was done. We asked: Who is our enemy? We looked across the 
ocean or up in the sky and we identified a potential enemy. Once 
we identified the enemy, we asked: Okay, what are his 
capabilities? There are satellites now that can hover 200 miles 
above and can read not only the licence plate number on a car but 
also can give the pigment in the paint. We knew more or less 
what the enemy had. We had the enemy identified and the 
enemy's capability.
<P>
	The third aspect was: What is the intention of that enemy? 
Does he intend to surprise us by lobbing ballistic missiles? Does 
he intend to have a landing force in the Arctic? What are his 
intentions?
<P>
	Determining intentions was more difficult than determining 
the capability or identifying the enemy. If a country had more 
armed forces than it justifiably and reasonably needed to defend 
itself, then it could be concluded it had an intention other than 
its defence. It had an offensive intention. Depending on how 
much excess defence capability it had could determine more or 
less how aggressive those intentions could be.
<P>
	We cannot identify the enemy now. Therefore we do not know 
what his intentions are and we do not know his capabilities. 
When faced with that kind of situation as we are now that the 
cold war is over, we tend to fumble and do not know how to go 
about it.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	However, what we are faced with, as many members in this 
House know, is the sitting down of reasonable men and women 
to take a look at a situation that is peppered with uncertainty. In a 
case like this the more people within the confines of an 
institution, in this case the parliamentary institution, we bring to 
bear, the better our judgment is likely to be.
<P>
	In bringing two sides of the House together we not only get the 
perspective of members of the House of Commons, a certain age 
group, a certain philosophy and a certain commitment because 
of their requirement to campaign and be re-elected, we bring 
into call the upper chamber, the other place, which brings 
another dimension to those factors I mentioned.
<P>
	The salaries are there anyway. On the cost of travelling, the 
numbers of dollars are so marginal as to be almost 
inconsequential.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to start by apologizing to one of my 
constituents. I came to this House today certain that we would 
get unanimous approval from all corners and every party in the 
House on this defence review. Therefore, I have to apologize to 
that constituent in Penticton who said: ``I watch the CPAC 
channel but it is always so negative''. I thought today we would 
have something positive. I hope to address this issue with some 
very positive comments because I am in support of it.
<P>
	A review of Canada's defence policy is long overdue. 
Although emphasis and approach have varied from time to time, 
Canada's defence policy remains much as it did 30 years ago. 
Therefore, I support this motion.
<P>
	I look forward to reviewing the guidance documents referred 
to in the motion that the minister tabled this morning to 
determine exactly the scope of what our review will be.
<P>
	I would also like to commend the government for using the 
committee system to undertake such an important policy review. 
The effective use of committees is an important means by which 
an individual MP can represent the views of his or her 
constituents in developing national defence policy.
<P>
	As a member of the standing committee on defence, I look 
forward to the task ahead of us with the wealth and experience 
including military, academic and business backgrounds of those 
who sit on the committee. I endorse the concept of combining it 
with the Senate as well. The reason for this is that while we have 
a large number of people on the committee from eastern Canada, 
we only have a few who will bring a western perspective to the 
committee. Hopefully, with the five Senate members there will 
be some representation from the western provinces.
<P>
	The work of this joint committee will be extremely important. 
Three questions have come to my mind and I am sure many 
Canadians have asked themselves the same questions. First, are 
our current Canadian forces suited for the post-cold war era? 
Second, do our international commitments meet our military 
capabilities? Third, how effective is our current defence 
spending? These are questions to which all Canadians would 
like answers.
<P>
	I am reminded of during the campaign when I was in the town 
of Keremeos in my riding. A gentleman stood up at the back of 
the hall and said: ``I do not believe in having a military in 
Canada and I do not think I should have to pay taxes for such a 
thing as encouraging people to go off to war and fight''. My 
question to him at that time was: ``If you do not believe in a 
military, do you really know what it does? Do you know the role 
it plays? For instance, would you object if the military were a 
part of an exercise to capture people who were bringing in a 
shipment of cocaine off the coast into Canada to sell to our 
youth? Would you be against a military if you were capsized on 
the ocean and the search and rescue technicians from Vancouver 
Island came to your rescue?  Would you be against the policy at 
that point? Or would you be against a military that made certain 
that our sovereignty and our natural resources were not taken 
away by other countries like we do with our fisheries patrols?''
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	These are the things I do not think Canadians really sit down 
and think through about what the Canadian military role is and 
the actual importance of the things it does. It is one of the 
downfalls that the Canadian forces really can accept some 
responsibility for because they have not communicated all of 
their roles to all of the people of the country. That is one of the 
things we have to look at. These are extremely important 
questions and the committee must deal with them.
<P>
	I have a little background in the military. I spent some time in 
the Royal Canadian Navy in the early 1970s and I remember at 
that time the military experienced a time when we were not 
upgrading our equipment. We were dealing with the equipment 
that we had and did the best we could but the government was 
not spending money on upgrading equipment.
<P>
	I remember one story when we were called out. I was 
stationed on a ship on the west coast in Esquimalt and we were 
called out because there was a Russian destroyer just off the 
coast of British Columbia and our task was to go out and follow 
it and make sure it did not get into any mischief.
<P>
	During this excursion we went out and found that this 
destroyer was a vessel that was much more capable than we 
were. It was a very technologically advanced vessel. We could 
not even keep up with this particular vessel because of the ships 
we had at that time.
<P>
	The captain of the ship turned to one of boatswain mates and 
told him to go down to the leading seamen's mess and get the 
bingo crank for playing bingo on board. Everyone wondered 
what he was talking about but he did it. He got this bingo cage 
that holds the balls with a handle on it. The order was given to 
hoist it up the mast. Of course, everyone was wondering what 
the captain of the ship was up to. He looked at it and was very 
happy with his accomplishment and he said that the destroyer 
would be taking pictures of it for the next two hours and for three 
weeks it would be busy trying to figure out what it was.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that although our equipment 
was not always the best, we certainly adapted to the situation we 
were in.
<P>
	One of the areas I would like to talk about today, and nobody 
else has talked about it too much, is personnel and how we are 
going to cope with the changing armed forces. In particular, I 
would like to talk about the total force plan, the concept 
introduced in 1987 which I understand the hon. member for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1489"> 1489 </A></B>
<P>
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception participated in which has 
made our reserves a key component of Canada's defence policy.
<P>
	The total force policy concept aims to integrate regular and 
reserve forces to give reserves a greater role in military 
capability. The total force concept was also designed to allow 
Canada to maintain the same level of military capability while 
cutting costs. Reservists are paid only when they are on active 
service or in training and are therefore less of a drain on the 
public purse.
<P>
	As a result of this policy's greater reliance on reservists the 
levels of regular troops have declined while the numbers of 
reservists have increased.
<P>
	In 1990-91 Canada had 88,000 regular force personnel. These 
numbers are projected to decrease to 75,000 in 1995-96. On the 
other hand, today there are about 38,000 reservists and by the 
year 2000 this is projected to grow to 47,000.
<P>
	Presently reservists play an increasingly important role in 
Canada's peacekeeping operations. Reservists make up a much 
greater part of the replacements going on overseas missions.
<P>
	As we heard today, I think the latest rotation to go overseas 
was composed of about 50 per cent reservists.
<P>
	Some serious concerns have been raised about the increased 
reliance on the reserves and I hope this joint special committee 
will look in more detail at these issues.
<P>
	In the past few years some concerns have been expressed that 
we are placing too many demands on reservists, especially those 
who have not been trained to the same extent as our regular 
forces.
<P>
	In his review of reserve forces in 1992, the Auditor General 
pointed out that as reservists move up in rank, and this is through 
no fault of their own, they lack the training and skills as 
compared with those in the regular forces at an equivalent rank.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	He found that reservists lacked practical experience. As an 
example, when a combat arms officer reaches the rank of major, 
it amounts to approximately 750 training days difference that 
the two people have attained.
<P>
	We must ask, therefore, whether we are placing reserve forces 
in situations for which they are not adequately trained. In 
response to these concerns the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs recommended in 1993 that in 
Canadian contingents deployed in dangerous UN operations 
such as Bosnia, the number of reservists be limited to no more 
than 10 per cent of the total force. So far, there has been no 
problem on the ground due to lack of training, and our troops 
have properly carried out the tasks which have been assigned to 
them.
<P>
	I would like to say that everyone in Canada should admire the 
work and courage and dedication that these reserve forces have 
displayed in these dangerous operations.
<P>
	However, we must ensure that we are not placing unfair 
demands on our reserve forces. Serious concerns have been 
raised about the readiness of the reserves. Also, in the 1992 
report the Auditor General found that only one-third of 
reservists would turn out during an emergency and many of 
those who would turn out would not be properly trained to the 
necessary standards. This joint committee must ensure that 
Canada does not sacrifice its readiness.
<P>
	One major reason why reservists do not receive enough 
training and experience is their lack of security in their civilian 
employment. It is extremely difficult and a risk for many 
reservists to participate in training exercises because they may 
lose seniority at their jobs, they may be subject to losing 
promotions or their vacation time and in some cases they may 
even lose their jobs to serve the country in the reserve force.
<P>
	This is an issue that I am deeply concerned about. I have a 
tremendous admiration and respect for reservists who have put 
their jobs on the line to serve Canada.
<P>
	This is also a very important hurdle for the effectiveness of a 
total force concept. The Conference of Defence Associations 
has recently pointed out that if the issue of job protection is not 
addressed it is doubtful the total force will reach its top level of 
effectiveness.
<P>
	The Canadian Forces Liaison Council is concerned. It is 
currently trying to solve this problem by emphasizing to 
employers that the training and discipline the reservists gain 
will actually benefit the employer and will far outweigh the loss 
in employees' time.
<P>
	We must consider the point and the viewpoint of business 
owners very seriously. After all they face additional costs and 
inconveniences when their reservist employees are called for 
training or active duty.
<P>
	This may prove to be particularly trying to small and medium 
sized businesses. Everyone in this House has recognized that 
small and medium sized businesses are going to be the areas in 
which we create the employment in this country. Therefore, if 
we are looking at a defence review we also have to realize that a 
number of these jobs that are created through small and medium 
sized businesses will also have this additional strain that some 
of those people will probably be reservists.
<P>
	The real test of this policy, however, is yet to come. Presently 
many reservists serving overseas are students who are willing 
and able to take the time off from their education. Replacements 
for many of these student reservists may have to come from 
employed reservists for whom it will be much more difficult.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1490"> 1490 </A></B>
<P>
	This special joint committee will, I trust, consider ways to 
encourage employers to permit reservists to serve in Canada. In 
many other countries there are laws requiring reservists to be 
allowed time off to train and to serve, while preserving their jobs 
and their seniority. The problem is that this could discourage 
employers from hiring reservists. We ought to be very cautious 
about any legislation that may do that.
<P>
	In this defence policy review we should also consider ways to 
protect the employment of reservists, whether called up for 
training or active service. At minimum, I would hope that we set 
an example for the private sector and take measures to protect 
federal employees who actively serve in the reserves. By 
addressing this issue we can show our support to the increasing 
role we are asking reserves to fulfil in our defence policy.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Canada's armed forces have a commendable history of 
providing a well run, effective military which has performed the 
many tasks required of it with distinction and with honour. 
Whether on cold patrols, fisheries patrols off our coasts or 
peacekeeping duties in the war torn corners of our world, the 
men and women who serve Canada so well deserve our 
admiration and support. The realities of the present day debt and 
deficits however mean we have to be concerned that we are 
getting the best value for taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	In his 1992 review the Auditor General stated that the 
problems related to the ability of reservists to respond when 
called up have reduced the savings possible under the total force 
concept. I hope the special joint committee will make this one of 
its primary focuses.
<P>
	Finally I would like to take a moment to talk briefly about a 
program that is close to my heart and falls under the defence 
budget: our national cadet program. This program with which I 
have been involved for several years is a useful and productive 
program that instils a sense of civic responsibility and national 
pride in young Canadians. It does not matter if they are from 
Valcartier, Quebec, from Labrador, Prince Edward Island, 
Saskatchewan or Alberta, they all undergo the same training 
program. It helps to strengthen the unity of our country.
<P>
	While the program grows in popularity its budget has been 
decreasing. I believe it comes back to the issue of effective 
government spending. How many inefficient projects are we 
saving at the expense of this program which trains 65,000 young 
Canadians in leadership, citizenship and physical fitness?
<P>
	This is the type of program we should encourage. It is 
uniquely cost effective for the government because it is a 
partnership between the Department of National Defence and 
civilian organizations like the Navy League of Canada, the 
Army League of Canada and the Air Force League of Canada. In 
communities where they are located there are local 
organizations that also support them through funding. In my 
own community of  Summerland, British Columbia, the Kiwanis 
Club is a supporter of the cadet program.
<P>
	The government has expressed a concern for youth. In the 
national cadet program Canada already boasts the finest youth 
program in the world. Over the next year I will certainly make 
the joint committee aware of the important role the cadet 
program plays in the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	These are some of the issues I look forward to addressing in 
the upcoming defence policy review. I support the motion and I 
commend the government for allowing the special joint 
committee to consult broadly in making recommendations. I am 
eager to hear the input of Canadians on the issue. I hope we will 
respect the views of all Canadians. Through public consultation 
we can have an effective review of our defence policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would 
like to thank my colleague from the Reform Party for his 
excellent and very instructive speech on the work of the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Since he did not say why he had decided to support the 
government's proposal to create an ad hoc committee for this 
review and since there is already a parliamentary committee on 
National Defence, could he tell me why he thinks this committee 
is necessary? And how can he justify these additional 
expenditures? There is no doubt that with the creation of this ad 
hoc committee the regular committee will be free to study other 
issues, but why this ad hoc committee? Why would we allocate 
special sums of money for travelling across the country? It 
seems to me that the Reform Party has repeatedly asked that we 
cut spending. Why does the hon. member think that we should 
put extra funds at the disposal of this group of parliamentarians 
and senators to consider a new approach, a new Armed Forces 
policy? How can he reconcile this with his party's position?
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I addressed that in my speech. I feel it 
is important because of the make-up of the House standing 
committee. We have two members on that committee who 
represent the views of westerners. My hope is that with the 
additional five members from the Senate we will see 
representation from all parts of the country. That is why I 
support it.
<P>
	I do not look at it as a duplication. They have their committees 
and are doing some work. By putting the committees together 
there is an actual saving. We are talking about the things the 
member was talking about in making sure the right hand knows 
what the left hand is doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1491"> 1491 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not want to cover any ground that I have already covered. 
However on the question regarding expenditures as far as travel 
in the country for consultation is concerned, the other member 
of the Reform Party on the committee and I will certainly make 
our views known that these trips in Canada must be justified. 
The work when we go on these trips will be work. There must be 
a reason for undertaking them. Otherwise we would be opposed 
to doing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt on his positive attitude in 
seeking a resolution to the very serious problem presented to 
Parliament, the very serious debt crisis we face. The turn of 
events in the world requires us to assess our alliances and 
commitments to alliances and to look at how we have allowed 
our armed forces to be stretched from sea to sea in bases that no 
longer have relevance to their initial establishment. We will 
have to do some evaluation on a merit basis of whether they need 
to be done because this is a political decision.
<P>
	The people in the armed forces can tell us about their needs, 
their training, their numbers, et cetera. Every time when it 
comes to making decisions the presentation from the Canadian 
Armed Forces has been that this is where we can cut without 
affecting our effectiveness.
<P>
	These are some of the decisions we will have to make on 
behalf of the people of Canada so that we can keep our armed 
forces in a strong position to undertake the tasks the government 
always places upon them. They are spread thin because this is 
dictated to by the nature of the base policy the political 
decisions have made on.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt 
I hope we will look at these situations. Some of the bases will 
stay and probably be enlarged. We do not know that. Certainly if 
we are to make decisions we need all the relevant information. 
As the hon. member said, in some cases we may have to go and 
look at them and when we speak we can speak with some sense 
of reality on behalf of the armed forces.
<P>
	Again I would like to thank the member. We must keep in 
mind that if the armed forces were in need of overhauling, the 
decisions were delayed, delayed and delayed in this place. It was 
not the fault of Department of National Defence, because that 
was offered as a cut year after year after year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments and I concur.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to know if we are still in the questions or comments 
period or if I am beginning a 20-minute speech.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> No. We are still in the 
period for comments and questions, with a few minutes left.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the previous speaker on his quality of presentation 
and his obvious knowledge of the subject. I would suggest that 
much work has gone into the preparation of his talk today.
<P>
	Does the member opposite feel that militarily there was any 
advantage in looking at a possibility of having a consistent 
movement of personnel from cadet to reservist to regular force 
in terms of the armed force component of training?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, under the current guidelines the cadet 
program follows they do not promote advancement to the 
regular force or reserve force. One main reason for that is that it 
encourages not only young people who are interested in a 
military career. It encourages young people who have an interest 
in aviation, leadership training, their communities and getting 
involved in civic responsibility. It is not just a military focus. I 
am not sure it would benefit the program if we added that 
element to it.
<P>
	Right now many who have joined the cadet movement go on to 
many other careers. It has been a positive experience. The 
experience the cadets gain through participation is very 
important. It makes them better citizens no matter where they 
go.
<P>
	I am not sure making advancement to the regular force or to 
the reserve force part of the program is the answer for the cadet 
program. It certainly is a positive experience wherever they go. 
Some do go on to the military.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, by way of comment on that subject, the hon. member is 
right. The purpose of the cadet organization is not to induce 
young Canadians to join the Canadian forces.
<P>
	Having said that, there is a natural affiliation. I regret I do not 
have the numbers, but several times in the last 10 years I have 
looked at military colleges, military units and officer corps. 
Without question if we go to one of these units, particularly the 
military colleges, and ask ``how many of you have had cadet 
experience'', we would be absolutely astounded by the number 
of hands that would go up.
<P>
	I seldom get personal in the House, but my introduction to the 
navy really came directly as a result of being involved in my 
local sea cadet corps, RCSCC Matthew, where I was the chief 
petty officer. As a result of one of the annual inspections the 
inspecting officer had literature and discussed what we planned 
to do for the future. It was a direct result of my association with 
the cadet organization; it certainly helped me make a  decision 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1492"> 1492 </A></B>
<P>
to have a career in the military. It is important to make that 
correlation.
<P>
	As a final comment, even if a cadet never goes anywhere near 
the recruiting office, the cadet organization in the country is one 
of the finest, if not the finest, youth organizations and one of the 
most unsung and unpublicized. Whether or not it is intentional 
most Canadians do not know about this tremendous program 
that is so responsible for making our young Canadian men and 
women much better citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, at the start of my speech I said I was 
hoping for a positive experience. I certainly am getting it in the 
House today.
<P>
	As a former commanding officer of an air cadet squadron I 
have seen two of my cadets go on to Royal Roads Military 
College. I would agree there is that element to it.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	There is no question that with a program that encourages unity 
in all regions from every spot in this country, every area has the 
benefit of a cadet program. Those cadet programs are of vital 
interest to the Canadian people.
<P>
	People will I hope start to take notice and participate in the 
cadet program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
waited a long time, probably close to five years, for a debate like 
this to take place in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I was first elected in 1988. It should be fairly clear to anybody 
who has been to or lived in Nova Scotia and knows anything 
about national defence that the contributions made by the 
Canadian Armed Forces in Nova Scotia and indeed all of 
Atlantic Canada are extreme not just in dollars spent but also in 
contributions to communities.
<P>
	When I was growing up, when we would see somebody in 
uniform on the main street of my home town, including my 
father who had served in the armed forces during the second 
world war, we would look to these people with a great deal of 
respect. It was bred into us. Of all the places in this great 
country, I believe there is no place where a service man or 
woman would feel more welcome than in a place like Nova 
Scotia because today we still harbour the same degree of respect 
for the men and women in uniform that we did during the Second 
World War and in times since then.
<P>
	Places like Nova Scotia have benefited greatly financially 
because of the contributions and placement of bases of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. It is important when talking about the 
motion in front of us that we look at this from a bit of a historical 
perspective.
<P>
	CFB Shearwater and probably half the Canadian navy on the 
east coast are in my riding. When I was elected in 1988, one of 
the big concerns that I heard over and over again was that these 
people in uniform who chose to serve their country so proudly 
and so well felt that once their representatives were elected, they 
forgot that they too were constituents who needed to be heard.
<P>
	They were fed up in 1988 with what they saw as a series of 
government initiatives that clearly did not care what the job was 
that they were asked to do, that clearly were not policy driven. 
They seemed to be driven by an imperative first to get elected. 
Therefore they promised anything. However, once they were 
elected, they said they had a debt, a deficit and other things to 
consider. These were tough decisions. Guess who got the biggest 
cuts every time something came around? It was the men and 
women in the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Somebody may ask why that is. Perhaps one of the reasons is 
that when one becomes a member of the Canadian forces and is a 
good soldier, seaman, air force pilot or working on the Sea King 
helicopters, one gives up many of the fundamental rights that 
every other Canadian has come to expect. One gives up one's 
right to publicly criticize government policy.
<P>
	Many men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces 
immediately become an easy target for indiscriminate 
non-policy based cutting in the area that they have chosen to 
make a living, national defence.
<P>
	In 1988, it was tough for me to canvass. When knocking on 
doors in Dartmouth, career naval officers said to me that my 
party was against the nuclear submarine program. How can you 
say your government will look after the interest of the Canadian 
military establishment, the defence industry establishment and 
indeed the interest of Canada as a sovereign state if you do not 
support this initiative?
<P>
	I said to them that I believed the Canadian Armed Forces had 
to be given the tools to do the job that they were mandated to do. 
First and foremost, before we went into these major 
expenditures we had to have a defence review. We needed to 
have a white paper that had some teeth, that took into account 
the fact that the world had changed dramatically since any 
government had made a fundamental policy review in national 
defence.
<P>
	People said to me at the time that Mr. Beatty, then Minister of 
National Defence, had a paper that went to the floor of the House 
of Commons. I told them that he had not acted on it, that we were 
still talking about it. They said that nevertheless it was a paper. I 
had a heck of a hard time convincing those individuals that the 
Liberal Party was committed to having a fundamental review of 
defence policy and that we would modernize our national 
defences for a changing world. I suppose a lot of them did not 
vote for me.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
	About six months after that when the Conservatives were 
re-elected in 1988, all their plans, policies and great promises of 
what they were going to do for the Canadian military 
establishment got shuffled away because of the debt and deficit. 
All of a sudden Mr. Beatty's white paper on defence was 
shredded. Once again we had a haphazard approach on how to 
deal with Canada's national defence forces.
<P>
	In 1989 when the budget was brought in, after many men and 
women in the Canadian Armed Forces voted for the 
Conservative Party, voted for that government because they 
believed what had been said in the pre-shredded document of 
1987 white paper, the Tories came in in 1989 and cut nearly $3 
billion, $2.75 billion, from national defence over four years. 
They did this without any review of the impact that would have 
on the role that we asked the men and women in the Canadian 
Armed Forces to perform for us as Canadians both domestically 
and internationally.
<P>
	We also saw base closures, again without a fundamental 
review. What is it that you want the men and women in the forces 
to do? Tell the generals and they will do their best. Do not come 
in and say: ``We want you to do exactly the same today as you 
did yesterday, and by the way we are going to send you to three 
or four more peacekeeping hot spots in the world, but you are 
going to have to do it with $2 billion, or $3 billion, or $5 billion, 
or $7 billion less''.
<P>
	It was ridiculous. It was impossible to do both things at the 
same time. However the military did their best. Then we had 
what I consider to be an attack on regional realities in Canada.
<P>
	Because the Tory government did not have a lot of seats in 
Atlantic Canada, it decided in the 1989 defence cuts that we 
would share a greater burden of defence cuts than any other part 
of the country. With 22 per cent of the personnel of the Canadian 
Armed Forces in Atlantic Canada, we received 55 per cent of the 
cuts in that 1989 budget. Forget what the mandate was. Forget 
what those bases were doing. Forget how that would impact on 
the ability of the Canadian Armed Forces to do their job. It was 
cut. A political decision was made to cut in Atlantic Canada 
because the Tories had very few seats there.
<P>
	The Tories were not going to look anywhere else and we lost 
bases. We lost CFS Sydney, CFS Barrington, CFB Summerside. 
I still cannot believe that one. We had reductions in Gander, in 
Chatham, New Brunswick and on top of all that CFB Moncton, 
our supply base. I have talked to the generals who say it makes 
sense to have CFB Moncton, it makes sense to have CFB 
Chatham.
<P>
	Political decisions were made at that point in time. The best 
advice of the generals was thrown aside. That government which 
had a lot of seats in one province, the province of Quebec, made 
some decisions about where supply bases should go. That is 
what it did.
<P>
	It is little wonder that the men and women in the Canadian 
Armed Forces started to view all of us that practise politics in 
this place with a little bit of suspicion. They had been fooled 
once more.
<P>
	The other thing that we saw in subsequent budgets was about 
$11 billion cut over the long term from national defence 
expenditures in Canada, all without a policy in place. Each and 
every time the government mismanaged its financial dossier, it 
hit national defence for the reason I said earlier. The men and 
women in national defence really do not have a voice. They are 
not allowed to speak up. They give up that fundamental right 
that every Canadian comes to expect because they have chosen 
to serve their country.
<P>
	We are once again faced with the big bogeymen of the national 
deficit and debt. Where is government most likely to look first 
for cuts? National Defence. I have done my homework. I have 
done my research. I have come to a conclusion. We have a major 
debt problem in this country. We have got a deficit problem.
<P>
	The one area of expenditure that has not contributed in any 
great way to the debt and deficit of this country is national 
defence. Since the mid-fifties we have seen the expenditures on 
national defence, not rise like in almost every other area of 
expenditure but go down steadily from about 25 per cent to 
about 7 per cent. We have seen the standing forces of the 
Canadian Armed Forces almost halved in the last 10 years.
<P>
	National defence, I understand, is a big budgetary expenditure 
item. I am not saying that it is not. I think that in the absence of a 
fundamental wholesale full policy review that any further cuts 
to the Canadian military at this point in time would not only be 
stupid, would not only be dangerous but would be disastrous for 
the capability that we may be asking for in 12 months or 14 
months' time, that the men and women and their generals and 
planners undertake for the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to debunk another myth because some of it is coming 
from this side of the House and that is kind of hard for me to 
take. There is a myth that somehow when governments need to 
cut that we do not look at the strategic reasons why bases are in 
certain places but we say: ``Well, we have to somehow equal 
pain''. As an Atlantic Canadian who has been here for five years, 
when I hear equal pain it usually means more pain down in my 
neck of the woods than anywhere else. I hear this coming from 
some people in the department and some people in the 
government and it scares me.
<P>
	Somebody said to me the other day: ``Well, you know, Ron, 
you have $1,240 per capita being spent in Nova Scotia on 
national defence and the average is about $388 or $389 
nationally. So I guess  you can take a bigger hit than anybody 
else''. The last time I checked, Canada had one of the longest 
coastlines of any state in the world. Of all the provinces in 
Canada, I would  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1494"> 1494 </A></B>
<P>
put forward that when we take all of those coves on that craggy 
shore of Nova Scotia together, we probably have the longest 
coastline of any province in Canada.
<P>
	The last time I checked, a sovereign state that had a navy had 
to put it on the coasts. It does not put it on the prairies. It does not 
put it in central Canada. I suppose it could try to put it on the 
Great Lakes but it might have trouble getting out sometimes. 
The last time I checked, if you are a maritime state, you have to 
put your navies on your coastline. We have the largest coastline 
of any state in the world. Nova Scotia has the largest coastline of 
any province.
<P>
	British Columbia is on our Pacific side. Where do we put our 
navies? We put them on our coasts. That is why Victoria, 
Esquimalt and Halifax harbour are the homes to Canada's navy.
<P>
	Yes, it costs to have a navy. It costs about a billion dollars per 
coast to have that small, paltry navy that probably needs a lot 
more equipment than what it has, but it does a damn good job 
with the equipment that we have given them and the resources.
<P>
	I am not going to apologize and say because Halifax is the best 
ice-free Canadian port on the east coast of Canada that 
somehow we should shut everything else down in Atlantic 
Canada that has to do with the military because we have the 
navy. I am not going to do that because it does not make any 
strategic sense. The argument is full of vile subtleties that I am 
not going to debate in this place.
<P>
	If we take out the Canadian navy and its contribution in 
Atlantic Canada, suddenly Atlantic Canada and all of the other 
defence establishment expenditures are below the national 
average. Is that not shocking? The member for Chatham knows 
that. I look at the member from Summerside and he knows that. 
However, past governments have said: ``Well you have more 
than the rest, therefore you have to suffer a little more''. Well, 
we have suffered quite enough from poor planning on defence 
strategy and poor economic planning of the last government. I 
am hoping that my government today is not going to do the same 
thing.
<P>
	One thing I do know is that we do have a surplus of 
infrastructure in the Canadian Armed Forces. I know that. That 
is fundamental. It is reality. What I do know is that when 
planners over at finance start to determine what they think is 
sound infrastructure for defence then our defence policy hits the 
shoals. I know that defence planners are no more capable of 
dealing with science and technology planning perhaps or the 
post-secondary educational area in Canada than finance 
planners would be in defence.
<P>
	That is why we need first-and I underline first-and 
foremost a fundamental review of what it is that we want our 
Canadian Armed Forces to do. Do up the list, priorize it, put our 
expenditure lines down, tell us how much it will cost and then sit 
down as a government and determine which of those priority 
options we are going to undertake.
<P>
	I think to go the opposite direction would allow us to fall into 
the same trap as the previous Conservative government. It 
would allow the state of our Canadian Armed Forces to further 
erode to a point perhaps from which they will not easily be able 
to return.
<P>
	It was not easy in this election to be canvassing with our red 
book. I supported the red book but it was not easy. The red book 
said that if we became government we would cancel the EH-101 
helicopter contract.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	CFB Shearwater is in my riding. It employs a lot of people and 
does a tremendous job for Canadians. There is the navy at 
Halifax harbour. Therefore, it was not easy for me to tell people 
at national defence that I supported new helicopters but I did not 
support that acquisition. I did it because I believed in the larger 
policy that we put forward as a government.
<P>
	I said it before and will say it again to put it in <I>Hansard</I> that as 
long as we have the Canadian navy on both coasts, it is going to 
need shipborne air support. As long as we have ships and a navy 
and we need air support we are going to have to have good 
equipment to send our pilots up in.
<P>
	The Sea King helicopters currently at CFB Shearwater are 
old. They are aging. We have great maintenance crews to keep 
them flying but they are still old and aging. This or some other 
government is going to have to make a decision on replacement 
because those helicopters must be replaced.
<P>
	The argument then is as to whether or not the choice of the 
previous government was indeed a sane one. I do not think it 
was. It was a helicopter based on the premise of an old white 
paper in the absence of any modern defence policy saying that 
what we needed was a cold war helicopter. I know it does other 
things but essentially it was a cold war helicopter.
<P>
	What I said to the people in my riding was that if they elected 
me as part of a Liberal government I would ensure there was a 
voice for the Canadian Armed Forces in my caucus and on the 
floor of the House of Commons. I would ensure there was a 
fundamental review of defence policy. I would ensure when that 
defence policy review was completed that somebody would be 
there to fight for the resources for the men and women of the 
Canadian Armed Forces to do the job we ask of them, which they 
do so willingly and so proudly on behalf of each and every one of 
us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1495"> 1495 </A></B>
<P>
	We are at that point now. I have read the red book. I had a 
little bit of say in how it was put together as some of us on this 
side did. We knew there would be cuts to national defence, but 
we said two things. We said we would fund the infrastructure 
program in the red book through cuts to the existing programs 
and we identified national defence as one of those departments.
<P>
	We said we would take $360 million from national defence. 
We also said we would not take it in the same manner the 
previous Tory administration had, but that we would take it after 
consultation. I underline after. We indicated that any further 
cuts in national defence would flow from this fundamental 
policy review for defence.
<P>
	I hope that on Tuesday we find that those commitments we 
made and that I and every one of us canvassed on are upheld in 
the budget.
<P>
	Nobody in the Canadian Armed Forces I have met thinks 
times are easy. They know times are tough because they are 
taxpayers too. They know that the debt and deficit are spiralling 
out of control. However they also know that government has a 
responsibility to maintain a defence force.
<P>
	What are the things I would like to see in the review? First and 
foremost we have to look at what our domestic requirement is. 
There is the navy on the east coast of Canada. We send those 
frigates and supply vessels out. We send them on exercises in the 
north and south Atlantic. It costs a lot of money to do that, but as 
long as we are involved in things like NATO then that is part of 
our commitment.
<P>
	I hope that the defence review looks at what is the best and 
most efficient use of the limited naval resource we have on both 
coasts first and foremost looking at what it is we need as a 
sovereign state.
<P>
	I have mentioned four or five times that we have the largest 
coastline in the world. I do not have to remind any Canadian that 
we have a major crisis in the Atlantic fishery. We cannot even 
police our own 200-mile limit. We have had a problem with too 
many Canadian fishermen taking too many fish because we 
could not watch them. We have had a problem with too many 
foreigners coming in and taking too many fish. Because we 
could not even police our own sovereign fish resource on the 
east coast the result is that we have about 40,000 people out of 
work down there.
<P>
	We have seen an ecological catastrophe of biblical 
proportions with the virtual elimination of the northern cod 
stock. Surely to goodness we have learned our lesson and the 
defence review will look very closely at what it is we can do with 
our naval resources to ensure that our renewable fishery 
resource and which has employed so many hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians over the centuries is protected once 
those cod stocks return. That is a role we can look at.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	There is another thing we have to look at. There is another war 
going on in our waters. That is the illegal drugs which are going 
into far too many coves, nooks and crannies, all along the east 
and west coasts of Canada. It is destroying our young people. 
Surely to goodness one of the things we must do is look at our 
defence resources and apply them in such a way that we combat 
this crime wave.
<P>
	I hope we also look at the defence forces for other things. 
Domestic security also includes environmental security in this 
day and age. I do not know why we could not use the expertise of 
the men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces to have a first 
and ready strike force. Any time there is an environmental or 
ecological disaster in Canada these highly trained individuals 
could go in and secure the area and mitigate against 
environmental catastrophes as much as possible for Canadians.
<P>
	On the international scene we are going to have to fish or cut 
bait. We cannot have it both ways. We are a small nation of 
around 28 million souls. We do our very best. Canada has 
participated in every peacekeeping venture since the second 
world war. Think about it. We are spending over $1 billion in our 
efforts in Bosnia at a time when the government has a $45 billion 
deficit and we are talking about cutbacks to programs and 
transfers to individuals.
<P>
	These are not easy times for us. However surely the defence 
review will look at these things and will look at what it is we 
want our armed forces to do in domestic security. It will also 
look at what we should be contributing as part of our 
international collective responsibility. Maybe it is 
peacekeeping. Maybe we will decide there are other things we 
should do.
<P>
	What I do know is that the framework established in the red 
book must be completed. This defence review we are debating 
today is absolutely essential and has been far too long in the 
offing. I am very pleased one of the first things our government 
has done is to choose to set this committee up as quickly as 
possible so it can go out and consult and come back with the 
framework for a modern policy for the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	I am no seer; I do not have a crystal ball. However I hope that 
on Tuesday the actions the Minister of Finance must take in 
order to try to control our spiralling debt and deficit will not 
adversely affect or prejudice this review. I hope the Minister of 
Finance and the Minister of National Defence will be able to 
effect as much of the savings as they must for this current year 
internally, without laying waste too much of the infrastructure 
of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	In conclusion, this has been a great debate and I look forward 
to participating further as the day rolls on. The men and women 
of the Canadian Armed Forces have waited a long time for a 
government that lives up to its commitments on defence. They 
will be proud and pleased  this defence review is now finally 
under way. At its conclusion they will find that yes, democracy 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1496"> 1496 </A></B>

does work and that yes, sometimes political parties and prime 
ministers do keep their word to the men and women of the

want to remind the hon. member for Chicoutimi that we do have 
three or four minutes left, but that the hon. member for 
Dartmouth would like to be able to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the feeling that the member 
had a little more time than planned. I do not know if I am 
mistaken.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must say that I have 
followed all the speeches closely this morning and that I have 
complied with the Standing Orders to the best of my abilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the speech which was 
just made and I must say that for the first time this morning we 
seem to be hearing a different tune from the other side of this 
House.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke of a white paper, a question that was 
raised this morning. I would like to remind him of a statement 
the present Prime Minister made when he was Leader of the 
Opposition in March 1993: ``Canadians deserve a government 
which can lead the way, a government which brings new ideas 
and new strategies, a government which helps them adapt to 
change''.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	This debate and the approach which this government has 
taken in the past 100 days are at variance with what the Prime 
Minister said. So that my colleague can answer about what he 
said on the white paper, I ask him whether he is prepared to ask 
his caucus to have the Liberal government table its white paper 
on national defence as soon as possible and let the existing 
parliamentary committee on defence do its job and not create a 
new committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Dartmouth has about 30 
seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> I will be very quick, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I can understand, the hon. member opposite is probably used 
to watching Conservatives on this side of the House who make 
their decision first and then consult later. We are a government 
of a different stripe. We believe fundamentally that the people of 
Canada have a right to be heard before decisions are made.
<P>
	The white paper will flow from the discussions that will take 
place in our caucus, in national defence, in the Parliament of 
Canada and in the standing committee that has been struck 
today.
<P>
	If the hon. member will just give us a little time and give 
Canadians a chance to be heard, that paper will be tabled at the 
appropriate time in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by 
members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to bring the House's attention to an article in yesterday's 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>.
<P>
	The front page article describes the problems that plagued the 
Winnipeg blood fractionation plant when political manoeuvring 
became more important than proper technology and business 
practice. The Canadian Blood Committee, forerunner of the 
Canadian Blood Agency, currently trying to derail the Halifax 
fractionation plant and take over the Canadian blood supply, 
squandered millions of taxpayers' dollars before virtually 
giving the obsolete plant away.
<P>
	In contrast, the proposed plant in Halifax will be built, 
financed and run by the private sector. Miles Pharmaceutical, 
which runs fractionation plants around the globe, has 
guaranteed the full output of the plant.
<P>
	I call on the provincial ministers of health to learn from 
history, put petty politics aside and support the Halifax 
fractionation plant for what it is: good sound economic 
development in an area that is desperate for good economic 
news.

well below legal limits.
<P>
	I want to assure the residents of Essex-Windsor that the 
Minister of the Environment instructed her Ontario regional 
officials to conduct on-site field testing at Fermi II before the 
water was released to ensure that the levels of radiation are 
within legal standards and no other contaminants are present. 
Those tests are currently under way.
<P>
	I am very concerned and so are the citizens of 
Essex-Windsor. Lake Erie is a shared body of water and the 
Canadian public has a right to be informed of potential threats to 
our drinking water. The levels of radiation may very well be 
within legal and even within Canadian standards, but Canada 
should be given ample public warning of such releases.

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to bring to the attention of the Minister of Finance the 
many requests of my constituents to protect the present level of 
RRSP contributions. In the past, much of the workforce was 
employed by businesses with the means to provide pensions for 
their workers. Today, more and more people are employed by 
small companies or are self-employed and have no retirement 
pensions.
<P>
	We must preserve RRSPs as an essential means of allowing 
individuals to provide for their retirements rather than 
becoming dependent on government safety nets. The limited 
benefit to be realized by reducing RRSP levels compared with 
the high cost of reducing personal retirement savings plans is 
not in the best interests of Canadians.
<P>
	I urge the Minister of Finance not to include changes to the 
registered retirement savings plan in his forthcoming budget.

Literacy Program to its original level. Further, I ask the

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ORGANIZEDCRIME">ORGANIZED CRIME</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	RCMP accounts and sources reported daily in the media are 
gradually revealing the extent of criminal activities connected 
with the smuggling operations of the warriors. The problem has 
become a very serious one, as we read this morning in the 
Montreal daily <I>La Presse</I>, which reported that smugglers 
operating on the reserves were also involved in money 
laundering, along with, and I quote: ``-Italian organized crime, 
motorcycle gangs and even a number of Colombian families''. 
According to the officer responsible for RCMP operations in 
Quebec, the RCMP cannot stop criminal activities on the 
reserves without the co-operation of the Mohawk authorities.
<P>
	Considering that the situation has gone beyond the limits of 
what is admissible under the rule of law, will the Prime Minister 
acknowledge he has a duty to meet the Mohawk chiefs in order 
to obtain their co-operation in stopping the activities of the 
warriors, as requested by the RCMP?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have given the RCMP a clear mandate to do its job and wipe 
out all smuggling in Canada, including on Indian reserves.
<P>
	As I explained to the House, the whole issue of policing on 
Indian reserves is very complicated. We have the local Mohawk 
police which is authorised by law and has a mandate delegated 
either by the Government of Ontario or the Government of 
Quebec. We have the provincial police which is involved in 
general law enforcement, in other words, the Quebec Provincial 
Police and the Ontario Provincial Police.
<P>
	As for the federal police, its role on Indian reserves is to deal 
with smuggling. That is what it is doing now, and I have nothing 
more to say. The RCMP has a clear mandate to do its job as 
prescribed by law.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is common knowledge that any police, effective and 
prestigious though it may be, and we acknowledge that is the 
case with the RCMP, needs the support of the government. In 
this case, the RCMP does not have that support. That is pretty 
obvious.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he will admit that my 
question, which he failed to answer, is very relevant, in other 
words, we should ensure that the RCMP can count on the 
co-operation of the chiefs on these reserves and consequently, 
the Prime Minister should see them himself and not let people 
see ministers  when they come out of these meetings and the 
parties are contradicting each other.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the Leader of the Opposition really wants to solve the problem, 
he will ask his members not to play the game of dragging the 
problem of the Mohawks into their questions all the time.
<P>
	We are fighting those who are criminals. Some are outside the 
reserve; there might be some on the reserve. But the impression 
of the Mohawks at this time is that it is a campaign by the Bloc 
Quebecois to tarnish their reputation, and this is not useful.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is quite a difference between tarnishing a 
reputation and sticking to the facts. The Bloc never asked any 
questions that were not close to the facts, and the Bloc relayed 
allegations which were made and published in very respected 
newspapers in Quebec: <I>Le Soleil, La Presse, Le Droit,</I> et cetera.
<P>
	The answer of the Prime Minister is equivalent to abdicating 
the authority of the law. If the Prime Minister would like to 
discharge his duties he would meet the chief of those villages 
and localities to make sure they provide their full co-operation 
to the government.
<P>
	Since there are links with international activities on this 
question, would the Prime Minister get in touch with the 
American government to get the full co-operation of that 
government so as to implement an international police action 
plan which would be efficient and professional?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the RCMP has been in touch with the American authorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the press is 
also reporting this morning that the RCMP is in a position to 
prove that in 1993 alone, at least $700 million in cash passed 
through the Akwesasne reserve, that many other items in 
addition to cigarettes are smuggled and that many other groups 
associated with organized crime are involved.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister undertake to put an end to the 
activities of organized crime groups who are taking advantage 
of a protected area just a few kilometres away from Montreal to 
launder money and conduct their illegal activities without fear 
of being stopped?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the matter of money laundering the hon. member refers to is 
already under active investigation by the RCMP. It has the full 
support of the government in doing whatever it considers  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1501"> 1501 </A></B>

necessary to put an end to the smuggling rings wherever they are

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B>Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is for the Solicitor General, since he is answering 
for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Can the Solicitor General, who is privy to all kinds of 
information, explain to us why he is always the only one in the 
dark, when in fact these allegations come directly from RCMP 
investigators? Is the Solicitor General living on another planet, 
or does he simply prefer to turn a blind eye to what is going on?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am dealing with reality, not like the Bloc that says that it asks 
questions that are only ``close to the facts''.
<P>
	If the Bloc were serious it would ask questions based on facts 
because that is the kind of answer the government is giving. Our 
answers are based on facts, based on full support for the RCMP 
and its work everywhere in the country.

said that we could not run a country through referenda. That is 
what I said.
<P>
	If some members of Parliament do not think they can pass 
judgment when a law is in the House, they do not belong in the

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said yesterday-it is very simple-that this notion we should be 
replaced by polling is revolting to me. I repeat it today. We have 
been elected to use our judgment. Members of this party use 
their judgment knowing they belong to a party which was 
elected with a program which was distributed across the 
country. This is what a political party is.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>

	The hon. member should be more worried about the way her 
party votes than the way the Liberal Party does.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the only way to restore public trust in the judgment of 
Parliament is for Parliament to show greater trust in the 
judgment of the people.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister agree that one of the most effective 
ways of doing this is to give the people a direct role in major 
decisions from time to time through binding national referenda?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there was a referendum in Canada about a year and a half ago. It 
can be used once in a while but it cannot be used as a formula to 
run Parliament. That is not the way to do it. We were elected 
under a program.
<P>
	There have been free votes in the House in the past. I must tell 
the hon. member I voted against capital punishment and 
abortion twice. This was not what my electors preferred but they 
continued to vote for me because I used my experience and 
judgment in those cases. It was a matter of conscience for me. I 
took my responsibilities and I went back to them. The hon.

high cost of replacing the GST by some other tax of a yet 
unknown nature. He pointedly noted that the implementation of 
the GST had cost government and businesses a total of more 
than $800 million.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance share the view of the Auditor 
General that replacing the GST would needlessly cost millions 
of dollars to government and businesses, when those businesses 
are not yet totally familiar with the tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of 
Regional-Development Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is really up 
to the committee to determine what is going to  replace the GST. 
I believe that it is a very important exercise in democratic 
judgment. If the previous government had done so, perhaps we 
would not be in the mess we are in now.
<P>
	This being said, the hon. member must know that I share most 
of the views of the Auditor General, and in particular the one 
which deals with the elimination of overlap and duplications 
between departments and agencies. The role of the Auditor 
General is to audit the books, while the role of the committee 
and the Department of Finance is to set the fiscal policy of the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the Minister 
of Finance not agree that, instead of replacing the GST, it would 
be wiser to simplify it, to iron out all its administrative problems 
and to take the necessary steps to collect all accounts in arrears 
which total more than $1.5 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of 
Regional-Development Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, simplifying 
the sales tax, reducing the cost, lowering the administrative 
burden, all that is part of our goal when we consider replacing 
the GST. And up until now I thought that was an opinion we 
shared, at least I thought that was the opinion of your critic for 
finance. If you have changed your mind, you should tell the 
committee.

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
IJC today released a report that claims governments have not 
done enough to clean up pollution in the Great Lakes. It is clear 
that toxic chemicals continue to enter the Great Lakes system. 
There is evidence to indicate that this is damaging not only to 
the environment but to human health as well.
<P>

new responsibilities as the vice-chairman of the environment 
committee because she has a good record of concern about these

<P>
	The fact is that the IJC report is bad news for the 45 million

indirectly.

my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The CBC reports liquor smugglers to be making profits of 
$105,000 per truckload and bribing Canada Customs officials to 
facilitate their trade. The finance minister talks of closing minor 
tax loopholes while smugglers are finding huge loopholes big 
enough to drive trucks through.
<P>
	Does the government intend to expand the principles of its 
action plan on cigarette smuggling to include a broad attack on 
all sectors of the growing underground economy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member had listened to the announcement I made in the 
House of Commons last week, he would know we referred to the 
fact that the task of the RCMP was not to act only against 
cigarette smuggling but also against the smuggling of alcohol, 
drugs and armaments. That is the mandate of the RCMP and the 
Department of National Revenue.
<P>
	In order to succeed we have to spend more money. We gave 
more money to the RCMP and the Department of National 
Revenue to be well equipped to do the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	The government knows there is a direct link between high tax 
levels and the growth of smuggling in the underground 
economy. The government has set targets for deficit reduction 
and job creation.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister: Has the government set a long-term 
target for tax reduction and can he tell the House what it is?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we said we wanted to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of the GNP. 
I do not think I can add to what the Minister of Finance will have 
the pleasure of giving as his plan for this fiscal year, Tuesday 
next. The hon. member has only to be a bit more patient and he 
will have his answer.

Sarajevo.
<P>
	During a scrum yesterday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs

<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should know that Canada is third in 
terms of the contribution made to the UN force in the former 
Yugoslavia. We think that we have already done more than our 
share in this regard.
<P>
	Obviously, the United Nations are trying to get additional 
troops to ensure an effective ceasefire and to maintain peace in 
that region.
<P>

	I believe that other countries can make a greater effort and we 
hope that they will follow our example and reply positively to 
the UN Secretary General's request.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, unless 
I am mistaken, the minister just said that Canada is doing more 
than its share regarding this mission. Consequently, if it cannot 
get additional troops, the UN could soon be unable to maintain 
the permanent ceasefire which we were all hoping for.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not sure I understood the question, but I presume 
the hon. member wants to know if I agree with the UN request to

descriptions will not change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue was discussed at some length in the House 
when we had second reading of Bill C-2. It was discussed again 
at the committee stage in the finance committee a short time 
ago.
<P>
	The fact is that we intend to continue to have what I regard as 
one of the best customs services in the world for the non revenue 
aspect at the border. On the revenue aspect, that is collecting 
money, they do very well too but other things such as attempting 
to find children who have been kidnapped, attempting to pick up 
smuggled goods-drugs, arms, liquor or whatever-they do 
very well.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that there is absolutely no 
intention on the part of this government of changing the 
fundamental role of the customs service at the border.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minister for his answer.
<P>
	Just for clarification, because of the integration process and 
because of the PS-2000 initiative the job description will have 
to be rewritten. I need assurance from the minister that the new 
wording on the job description for the customs officers will 
retain its present emphasis on law enforcement and border 
protection rather than merely tax collection.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought I had answered the question.
<P>
	I can assure the member that when it comes to rewriting job 
descriptions, we will have first and foremost in our mind the 
excellent job currently done by customs and the perhaps 
increasingly very important role that we see for them to perform 
at the border.
<P>
	I obviously cannot at this time, given the negotiations that 
will take place with the union and given the negotiations that 
will take place within the department, commit that the exact 
wording will remain there in the future as it has in the past.

question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	Mr. San Martin Pedro Hugo, an admitted Peruvian terrorist 
and conspirator to the murder of government officials, was 
denied refugee status in Canada and deported. Now that same 
individual has been granted a minister's permit and flown back 
to Canada. It will cost taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars to 
send him through the entire refugee process a second time.
<P>
	When will the minister halt this hearing and have this terrorist 
deported?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. I have discussed this case with him.
<P>
	Concerning this case of the refugee claimant who was denied 
refugee status, it was the feeling of my officials that the 
individual posed a threat to the Canadian community. Therefore 
the immigration officials had this individual flown back and 
deported to Peru right away.
<P>
	Subsequent to that, the individual's lawyer appealed the case 
to the Federal Court of Canada. It was the Federal Court that 
ordered a new appeal hearing in front of the Immigration 
Refugee Board. There is something called due process, and 
therefore immigration was simply obeying the Federal Court, 
which is the law of the land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Is it in the best 
interests of Canadians is my question. Since the election of this 
government, the minister has been made aware of numerous 
flagrant abuses of the refugee process. Canadians are concerned 
that the system is out of control.
<P>
	How many more examples of abuse will the minister allow 
before he responds to the legitimate concerns of Canadians who 
want the refugee determination process overhauled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government has moved very 
swiftly to try to deal with the concerns of Canadians in terms of 
ameliorating the Immigration Refugee Board. In fact, we moved 
on appointments that spoke to quality of experience and 
expertise. That was in fact concurred in by the press secretary to 
his leader who stated that finally these appointments are in the 
right direction.
<P>

<P>
	Second, we also have reviews under way that are going to 
balance the whole question of tolerance with the question of 
criminality. The member should be cautioned not to inflate and 
inflame the situation, that it is out of control and that somehow 
criminals are certainly in the majority. That simply and 
factually is incorrect.
<P>
	Third, immigration officials did airlift this individual. It is the 
Federal Court that through this individual's appeal granted a 
rehearing. That is simply the law of the land.
<P>
	I would ask this member to work within the law. If he is 
advocating a change in the law, that is another question.

	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for South West Nova for his many 
questions.
<P>
	First, training for our peacekeepers in Bosnia is being done at 
the moment in California. This group is the Strathconas from 
Calgary. It is being done there because we have to guarantee 
adequate climatic conditions for that training. We cannot 
guarantee that at any base in Canada including Cornwallis, 
Gagetown or Valcartier because of the weather.
<P>
	Second, with respect to Cornwallis, the outdoor training 
facilities would not be appropriate. They are just not sufficient 
for the kind of training that is required.
<P>
	I should also say that the hon. member has been very diligent 
in pursuing me around the confines and the corridors of

say to him and to his constituents that we are very mindful of the 
promises we made in the red book. We are mindful of our 
promises for the establishment of Canadian peacekeeping 
training centre.

calling once the House returns from its weeks break.
<P>
	I want to make one further comment. While today I said that 
Monday shall be an allotted day-and I assume this will be 
understood by the Table to mean I am designating the day-I 
also want to say that if by chance I say that Monday or any other 
day of the week will be an allotted or is an allotted day then it 
means I am allotting it formally. I hope that will be understood 
by those concerned.
<P>
	By the way I am not referring to my colleagues, the opposition 
party House leaders, but others who are charged with recording 
the business of the House.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
we broke for Question Period the hon. member had asked me a 
question concerning the defence white paper. I would just like to 
elaborate.
<P>
	The question basically was: Would I support the government 
tabling a white paper on defence policy? He seemed to think that 
should be done prior to consultation. I had indicated to him very 
clearly that this is a different government on this side of the 
House. We consult first and then act. We do not act and then 
consult.
<P>
	We committed in our red book to a period of consultation. We 
have said to the Canadian public and we have said to the men and 
women in the Canadian Armed Forces that no more would there 
be a slash and burn approach to defence policy. We recognize 
there is a fundamental responsibility as a government to 
modernize our defence establishment. We recognize we have 
certain fiscal restraints which we have inherited from the 
previous government. Over all, we recognize our fundamental 
responsibility to Canadians that when we get into areas such as 
national defence policy, social policy, fisheries policy, whatever 
it is, we have a responsibility to consult. What we have started 
here today with this debate on the floor of the House of 
Commons is to get that process going, to put it over to a standing 
committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1509"> 1509 </A></B>
<P>
of this House and to ask that  committee to review what we 
should be doing in a modern, geopolitical world context.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, we will come back at some point. I will support 
our government, this party, putting forward and tabling in the 
House of Commons a white paper on national defence. It will not 
be done, and I underline this, until the work of the committee has 
been done and all of the interest groups and all Canadians 
wishing to be heard on this issue are heard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to my colleague from 
Dartmouth and I know he has a keen interest in national defence 
affairs. He has spoken quite profoundly today and a number of 
times in the House and in caucus. He is certainly a defender of 
national defence. I would ask him today if he could comment 
further concerning his opinion regarding base closures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Madam Speaker, I would make a few more 
comments on base closures.
<P>
	If we talk to members of the Canadian military who know 
what they are talking about, who should be the people who drive 
the defence policy, and ask them what they need to do the job we 
have asked them to do, they will say that since the Conservative 
government slashed the standing forces, there has not been a 
corresponding cut in redundant defence infrastructure. We all 
know that is the case.
<P>
	My premise in the arguments I put forward today is simple. If 
we are asking a House of Commons committee to go forward 
and consult across this country about what our defence policy 
should be, we should not if at all possible, and I underline this, 
prejudice the outcome of that report.
<P>
	What we should do in keeping with the commitments we have 
made in the red book is try to realize as much of the $360 million 
in expenditure cuts to national defence without adversely 
affecting the infrastructure that is left in the country.
<P>
	We just heard my colleague from the Cornwallis area, from 
South West Nova, ask a question of the minister in the House 
about CFB Cornwallis. We have heard that CFB Cornwallis, 
which is in Nova Scotia, is the English speaking recruit training 
centre for the Canadian Armed Forces. Even though our forces 
had been reduced, I would anticipate that the result of a review 
would show that we are still going to have some new English 
speaking recruits coming into the system.
<P>
	My colleague from South West Nova asked specifically about 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	My point is if we can leave as much of the infrastructure intact 
at this point, pending the outcome of the defence review, we will 
be leaving every available option open to that defence review 
committee as far as what role it believes our armed forces should 
be mandated with.
<P>
	It is never easy to close a base. I want to say that. It is never 
easy to close a base. It can be unconscionable, however, for a 
government to close a base without first and foremost looking at 
the defence priorities and the requirements and how that base 
closure would affect those requirements.
<P>
	I would hope that the Minister of National Defence and the 
Minister of Finance in their wisdom will look internally at 
operations, will look at things such as lowering the hours of 
flying time for the Sea Kings at Shearwater. For every hour that 
the Sea Kings are in the air out of CFB Shearwater they take 
about 21 hours of maintenance. If they could cut the number of 
air hours by 30 or 40 or 50 per cent for a year without affecting 
the mandate and the requirement to be flying for certain 
manoeuvres it would be a substantial saving.
<P>
	Perhaps there are things like that which can be done by 
reducing flying time for the Challengers currently out over the 
Atlantic doing fisheries patrol. My understanding is that fully 
40 per cent of those flights are really not fisheries patrols. In the 
short term, perhaps a year, until this defence review is 
completed those reductions in expenditures could be made 
without adversely affecting the realm of possibilities of defence 
policy.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	That is my position on defence reviews. I am hoping that on 
Tuesday when the budget comes down the ministers who are 
charged with this responsibility will be able to find savings 
internally without taking too sharp a knife to bases and 
infrastructure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
relatively pleased to speak in the House today on this matter.
<P>
	This special debate initiated by the government on Canada's 
defence policy bears a strange resemblance to the other special 
debates that have taken place in this House since January 17 last. 
We have had debates on social programs, on Canada's role in 
Bosnia, on cruise missiles, on parliamentary reform, on 
pre-budget consultations, and so on and so forth. All of these 
debates, which appear to have no common thread, illustrate the 
extent to which the newly elected government lacks the political 
will to see things through.
<P>
	Strangely, the government's actions seems to contradict the 
claims in the Liberal Party's red book. Page after page, the 
Liberals led Canadians and Quebecers to believe that they were 
capable of grasping and resolving the enormous economic and 
social problems gripping the country today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1510"> 1510 </A></B>
<P>
	This debate does not seem to fit in with any particular plan. 
Yet, it should be part of an overall review of Canada's foreign 
policy, of its role with respect to the Third World and 
disarmament, of its relations with the United States, of the 
relationship between foreign policy and defence policy, and so 
forth.
<P>
	We are being subjected to a special debate on Canada's 
defence policy, and one of the primary objectives of this debate 
is to propose the appointment of a joint committee on which the 
other house would be represented, no doubt to ultimately make 
it appear more useful and justify a little more its existence in the 
eyes of the Canadian public.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> This committee, which obviously will cover 
the same ground as the Standing Committee on National 
Defence, will be a superb example of wasted time, energy and 
public funds, and of overlap.
<P>
	This debate is even more useless in that it does not even 
reflect-and that was the least we could have expected-what is 
stated in the red book with respect to industrial conversion, an 
area that especially interests me as industry critic.
<P>
	The red book was clear and explicit, and I quote from page 55: 
``The defence industries today employ directly and indirectly 
over 100,000 Canadians. The end of the Cold War puts at risk 
tens of thousands of high-tech jobs. A Liberal government will 
introduce a defence conversion program to help industries in 
transition from high-tech military production to high-tech 
civilian production''.
<P>
	But today, not a word. Not a word either in the throne speech, 
in the address in reply to the speech from the throne or in the 
defence minister's opening remarks in this special debate on 
Canada's defence policy. The issue of industrial conversion was 
entirely left out of the discourse and concerns of this 
government.
<P>
	Most armament production industries are high-value-added 
manufacturing industries. This makes jobs in defence 
production valuable. It is therefore important to preserve theses 
jobs because a decline in the manufacturing industry of Canada 
and Quebec could be extremely detrimental to the economy.
<P>
	An estimated 46,000 workers depend on armament 
production in Quebec. Over 32,000 of these jobs are listed in 
industrial fields. This is to say that industrial conversion is of 
particular relevance to Quebec. From 1987 to 1992, sales of 
weapons produced in Quebec have dropped by over 48 per cent, 
from $1.6 billion in 1987 to $810 million in 1992. During the 
same period, 11,000 jobs were lost in that industry.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The geopolitical situation, combined with a decrease in 
defence procurement contracts have resulted in a substantial 
drop in defence production, particularly in the Montreal area. 
Businesses associated with this kind of  production are going 
through an extremely difficult period, and the transition does 
not guarantee the preservation of many jobs.
<P>
	For example, the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter 
contract translates into a significant shortfall for the Quebec 
economy. Defence companies work in very high technology 
sectors where costs are high. In other words, if conversion is to 
be achieved, it must favour civilian production with a very high 
added value and a very high technological content, and certainly 
not the manufacturing of stove pipes or common consumer 
goods.
<P>
	If there was a real political will in this government, it could 
act almost immediately in two areas where industrial 
restructuration could be achieved in a tangible way. I mentioned 
earlier the helicopter deal and the government's decision to 
cancel production, with the support of the Bloc Quebecois. We 
must remember, however, the compensation suggested at that 
time by the Official Opposition to soften or completely avoid 
the negative impact of this decision. It was to transfer the 
scientific and technological budgets and expertise associated 
with the helicopter production project to the high-speed train 
project between Quebec City and Windsor, which has very 
important economic and technological benefits and the 
tremendous advantage of meeting a need of the civilian 
population, and whose technology could then be exported.
<P>
	So far, the Liberal government has turned a deaf ear to this 
suggestion despite the statements in the red book. It took the 
same attitude toward the MIL Davie shipyard. This shipyard, 
which used to specialize in military shipbuilding, is now 
threatened with closure. In fact, it had to lay off 600 workers 
since the beginning of 1993. If nothing is done, it could be 
forced to close after delivering the last ship to the Canadian 
Navy. This shipyard has embarked on a process to convert from 
military to civilian production. It has started this process. In this 
context, in order to survive, MIL Davie must be awarded the 
contract to build the Magdalen Islands ferry and receive 
assistance in developing a new kind of multifunctional ship 
called smart ship.
<P>
	In fact, the MIL Davie case was the subject of a unanimous 
consensus during Rendez-vous 93, an event held in Montreal by 
the private sector on September 15 and 16, 1993. Eighteen 
associations were gathered at this meeting on the economy, 
which took place at the suggestion of the Conseil du Patronat du 
Québec, including the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan 
Montreal, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the 
Front de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec, as well as the four 
main labour bodies in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1511"> 1511 </A></B>
<P>
	During this Rendez-vous, a resolution proposed by the École 
polytechnique de Montréal, regarding the opening of a 
high-speed train line between Quebec City and Windsor, was 
also unanimously passed by the participants. In the same vein, 
I would like to mention that, last week, residents from my 
riding and from the Trois-Rivières region sent me a petition 
signed by close to 6,700 people asking for a substantial 
reduction of military expenditures and the reinvestment of a 
good part of the resulting savings in the creation of good jobs. 
Those 6,700 petitioners are to be added to the 5,000 who have 
already expressed their disagreement regarding the helicopter 
contract. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to 
the tenacity of all those who participated in this initiative, and 
I will be proud to table their petition in this House in the weeks 
to come.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	If industrial conversion is necessary, it will be done on a case 
by case basis. There are already a few success stories, one of 
which I find particularly interesting, that is the Expro plant in 
the Montreal region. I want to tell you briefly about the 
instrument which brought about this success, namely the setting 
up of a manpower adjustment committee.
<P>
	I am all the more pleased and comfortable to discuss this issue 
because I worked with these committees for 11 years in my 
region, when I was with the Quebec Department of Manpower. I 
can therefore attest to the strength and the power of these 
committees in a business, when their presence and their role are 
well understood. That strength is gained through the 
information, often confidential, which circulates within the 
committee, and is also linked to the common cause at stake and 
to the interest for the parties of finding common solutions to 
common problems.
<P>
	It is very rare that a situation does not improve when 
employers and employees work together, are supported by 
governments, and are assisted by a neutral and independent third 
party who diagnoses the strengths and weaknesses of both sides 
of the company and who, after the two sides have approved that 
diagnosis, proposes a binding work plan.
<P>
	As in the case of Expro, this should be the government's 
preferred structure if, some day, it should decide to make good 
on its election promises regarding industrial conversion.
<P>
	In conclusion, we have to realize that a whole sector of the 
high-tech manufacturing industry is in jeopardy. The economic 
future of Canada and Quebec is largely dependent on our ability 
to react positively to this structural change. The government 
must get its act together and clearly show its political will to 
take energetic and consistent measures to ensure the industrial 
conversion of our military businesses.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member just gave a speech, indicating some of the ideas 
that he has as to where the government could effect some 
savings in national defence expenditure.
<P>
	Somewhere out there is a misnomer that perhaps some 
provinces do not get a great economic impact from national 
defence expenditures. One place that is fairly great is in the 
province of Quebec. Indeed colleagues on my side of the House 
and employees of members that I know from the province of 
Quebec have little understanding about the great and very 
positive economic impact of national defence expenditures in 
that province.
<P>
	I remind the member that for 1992-93 according to the data I 
have received from national defence, in excess of $2 
billion-that is a lot-is spent directly in the province of 
Quebec by the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	I would ask him to go a little bit further. One of the things that 
sometimes is not put into the right envelope as far as benefits are 
capital projects from Atlantic Canada. We have the frigate 
replacement program which is out of Saint John, New 
Brunswick. Many of those vessels are being built in the province 
of Quebec. Indeed the Department of Industry has indicated 
clearly that for every dollar that is spent in Atlantic Canada on 
capital projects, about 44 cents of it goes to Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore the major impact of defence may be at least 50 per 
cent more and perhaps even double. There is about $3 billion to 
$4 billion in that economic impact in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The member from Trois-Rivières indicated that he had a 
petition from some people in his riding. They basically said that 
they thought there should be even further cuts.
<P>
	The hon. member knows that there are both civilian and 
military personnel employed in his riding and that his riding 
benefits to the tune of at least $4 million to $6 million. Would he 
be willing to forgo that $4 million to $6 million infusion from 
national defence, both civilian and military employees, grants 
and other purchases, to put into other ventures in his riding? 
Would he agree with the petitioners that he mentioned that we 
should slash $4 million or $5 million from Trois-Rivières?
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I think that we must see the question in a broader 
perspective. Major geopolitical changes are taking place on this 
planet, and within Canada, budget cuts have already been under 
way for several years. I illustrated it in my statement. Spending 
decreased by about 48 per cent, with the effect of cutting about 
11,000 jobs in Quebec, including high-tech jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1512"> 1512 </A></B>
<P>
	Governments and politicians must develop a broader vision. I 
do not think that we can limit ourselves to the short term; we 
must consider the medium and long term. Of course, some 
sacrifices may have to be made, but one thing I want to 
emphasize is that it will be done case by case. I do not think that 
it will be big government programs designed here in Ottawa; it 
will be decided case by case, factory by factory, using an 
instrument with which I am familiar, labour committees. These 
have been successful in all kinds of situations, especially one 
case which I am told is already a model for this planet. All kinds 
of people, including academics, are studying how Expro, which 
was known for labour conflicts of all kinds, strikes, lock-outs, 
all sorts of rather negative things, became a company with 
exemplary labour relations that is once again profitable.
<P>
	I think that we must favour this kind of approach, which is not 
magic, but is necessary: maintain good labour-management 
relations. The secret of this mechanism is information, no 
denying it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am certainly glad to see that my hon. colleague across 
the way has read the red book so faithfully. We are pleased to see 
that.
<P>
	After listening to his comments with regard to economic and 
social programs and all the things we should be doing today, I 
assure the hon. member that they will be done by this 
government.
<P>
	With regard to the defence committee and the subject matter 
of today and his comments, the hon. member made several 
comments with regard to alternatives and suggestions as to how 
government should be working with and for the people and 
providing the opportunity for input.
<P>
	The committee he is talking about actually provides 
opportunity for additional input. I would certainly hope the hon. 
member will provide that committee with the opportunity to tap 
into his expertise to provide that input and those suggestions. 
That is exactly what it is for. It is a forum to provide as many 
people as we possibly can in this area with an opportunity to 
provide their expertise and their input to assist the department in 
making the best possible decisions in the final analysis.
<P>
	I think we should indeed be pleased that this government 
continues to provide the opportunity for that input. That was not 
always the case with previous administrations.
<P>
	Is the hon. member prepared to provide the benefit of his 
expertise and input to this committee to assist in the long term 
and short term as well to make those decisions that are going to 
be made and recommendations that will be made back to the 
department of defence?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his comments. I am flattered that he noticed. Of course, if ever 
people in certain places thought that my contribution could be 
valuable, I would be only to happy to oblige. But the point I was 
making, what I was objecting to in my speech is the fact that the 
special joint committee in question will cover the same ground 
as the Standing Committee of the House on National Defence. 
Personally, I do not see the point. Perhaps it is as good a way as 
any to keep the people in the other place busy. However, given 
the costs involved-and the member on this side of the House 
will agree-I think that the money might be put to better use, as 
the case may be.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I also object to the fact that this debate has no framework. As 
the Official Opposition, we would have expected a plan of 
action, a master plan, an overview of defence and foreign policy, 
a white paper, something. But no, the proposal is to set up a joint 
committee, period. Very disappointing!
<P>
	On the other point, I will be pleased to oblige if ever people in 
certain places should see fit to call on me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be as brief as I possibly can.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for his presentation. He 
included significant detail in his speech of those projects in 
Quebec that are defence oriented and within the manufacturing 
sector. They do indeed provide employment to many. He cited 
the figure of 46,000 jobs.
<P>
	He indicated in his opening remarks his concern for the lack 
of a thread to link together our debates in this House. This is a 
legitimate concern demonstrating a desire to seek coherence, 
which I think is the word the hon. member used, through 
national program development. He then moved to provincial 
domain, highlighting a narrower level of concern.
<P>
	How can he reconcile his role as a national representative 
while at the same time working on a case by case scenario within 
and for Quebec? This does not provide the national coherence 
that he identified in his opening remarks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from Calgary Southeast for her comments.
<P>
	In this case, and this is perhaps where my experience comes in 
handy, I know with regard to government programs that 
problems within a company are best dealt with within the 
company, through an in-house program. The key players, that is 
to say an employer and the workers, unionized or not, must be 
involved. They must learn to speak to each other, whatever the 
situation. Expro is a perfect example. It can be done, in terms of  
defence 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1513"> 1513 </A></B>
<P>
conversion as well as in other areas where the situation has 
improved considerably.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I cannot tell 
you what a delight it is for me to rise today. It is the first 
opportunity that I have had to speak in this House when you are 
in the chair.
<P>
	I want to make special note. My congratulations to you on 
your appointment as the deputy chair of committees of the 
whole. I know that the whole House benefits from your wise 
counsel in chairing us here today and in the future. My deepest 
and warmest congratulations to you.
<P>
	It gives me pleasure as well to rise to speak in this debate and 
to talk for a few minutes about an issue that is of great concern to 
me and to my constituents. For over five years now it has been 
my very great honour to represent the people of the city of 
Halifax.
<P>
	Halifax has many names. It is known as the city of trees. It is 
known as the city with more green spots than any other city in 
North America but primarily and perhaps most widely it is 
known as, thanks to Hugh MacLennan, Halifax the warden of the 
north. It was known throughout World War II in many dispatches 
and many news bulletins as a small east coast Canadian port.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	From its founding in 1749, Halifax has been a city of great 
military significance in the defence of North America, most 
particularly in the defence of the north Atlantic. It is Canada's 
eastern naval base and the largest naval base in the country.
<P>
	There are a variety of reasons why Halifax was chosen. 
Probably first and foremost is that we do have one of the most 
beautiful natural harbours in the world. Up until this winter it 
had been ice free for most of the time, but this winter has 
defeated many of us with its severity. Even Halifax harbour had 
a little bit of ice this winter. Normally we are and claim to be the 
largest natural ice-free harbour in the world.
<P>
	We also have a distinct advantage in that we are the closest 
port in North America to Europe. We are also close to the major 
ports on the eastern sea coast of the United States. Behind the 
harbour itself we have Bedford basin. It has been said many 
times by me as well as by others that every navy in the world 
could ride at anchor with room to spare in Bedford basin.
<P>
	We have been home to the Royal Canadian Navy since our 
founding. It might not have been called the Royal Canadian 
Navy at that time. I am sure the hon. member from Bonavista 
can tell me exactly what it was called in 1749, not that I am 
suggesting he was there, but he would know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Sir Edward Cornwallis.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Yes, indeed, he was the admiral of the day.
<P>
	On a more serious note, Halifax has been a focal point of the 
Canadian navy as long as there has been a Canadian navy. 
Haligonians, though perhaps not always so, are now proud and 
happy to be home to the Royal Canadian Navy.
<P>
	We have had some differences at some times over our history, 
as my colleague from Newfoundland would agree, but those 
differences have been settled for a long time. As I said, the 
location of DND in the city of Halifax and its environs is of 
tremendous importance to the healthy economy of Halifax, to 
the healthy economy of Nova Scotia and to the healthy economy 
of Atlantic Canada. However, it is also tremendously important 
to the historical and cultural life of our city.
<P>
	We are and we define ourselves by that port. We know that the 
military presence there is of tremendous significance. We know 
also that not just the ships and their personnel but the work done 
at the naval dockyard is of tremendous importance to the 
economy of our city.
<P>
	We are, and people are always surprised when I say this, 
essentially a city without an industry. We are the regional centre 
of the federal government and the provincial capital of Nova 
Scotia. We have five universities-six, excuse me. My hon. 
colleague from Halifax West would remind me that within the 
environs of our two ridings we have six universities. We also 
have that most important element to our economic health, the 
Department of National Defence.
<P>
	Consequently, as the review of the armed forces and of 
national defence is taking place it is of supreme importance to 
the people of Halifax that the continued health and survival and 
indeed the continued thriving of DND be reiterated in this 
House. It is a matter of importance for all the people of Canada 
but most particularly for the people of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	There are several things I want to talk about with regard to the 
areas I hope will be covered in a review. For the majority of the 
five years I have had the good fortune to be here in this House I 
had the responsibility to speak on behalf of women. Although I 
have different responsibilities today, one never loses the feeling 
for work one has done for a long time. As a woman and as a 
member of Parliament there are certain messages that every one 
of us knows we must carry as women represent 52 per cent of the 
population in this country.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Last year under a different government in this House a report 
was tabled by the then Minister of National Defence, the then 
member for Vancouver Centre, on elements within the 
Department of National Defence and activities relating to sexual 
harassment and gender bias. At the time I and other members of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1514"> 1514 </A></B>
<P>
my party spoke out very strongly on the need for reforms within 
the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	I want to state at the beginning of my remarks that when I talk 
about problems of gender equality, sexual harassment, and 
discrimination on the basis of gender, by no means do I consider 
the Department of National Defence to be the only offender or 
the worst offender.
<P>
	We live in a society that sadly in 1994 is still basically sexist. 
We live in a society where women are still generally 
discriminated against. They deal with a lack of recognition in 
the value of the work they do. They deal with harassment and 
glass ceilings which prevent their promotion and prevent their 
attaining the goals many of them richly deserve.
<P>
	Consequently it is incumbent upon all of us in this House, men 
and women alike, to remember when we deal with any matters of 
national policy that questions relating to fairness and equality in 
gender must always be on the table.
<P>
	As the member for Halifax, as all members do, I have office 
hours every Friday in my riding and when the House is not 
sitting, throughout the week. Over the past five years I have had 
a number of young women come to see me. Many of them were 
DND personnel, either in the services or civilian workers. Many 
others have come to see me from other federal and provincial 
government offices and whatever.
<P>
	However, because this review is taking place I want to make a 
very special plea. I know that special plea will not go unheard by 
the minister, his parliamentary secretary, the members of 
cabinet or indeed by the Prime Minister because I know this is a 
government of fairness and a government that intends to 
establish fairness. I want and hope that in this review the report 
that was tabled last year on gender inequality and sexual 
harassment within the Department of National Defence will be 
looked at. I hope that the proper and appropriate systems will be 
put in place.
<P>
	Again as the member for Halifax, when these young women 
would come to see me there was a common thread with regard to 
the problems particularly of sexual harassment. A number of 
people who have not dealt with the problem or have not been 
faced with this particular form of discrimination sometimes find 
it hard to believe. It has always been my experience in dealing 
with good men and true-and I find that the vast majority of 
gentlemen in this Chamber can be classed as good men and 
true-that there are two problems. I am trying to explain the 
problems of sexual harassment.
<P>
	One problem is the vast majority of men that women deal with 
would never even consider activity of this nature so they cannot 
believe it actually happens. The other is that for a small number 
they do not want the light of day shone on it and have themselves 
found out. Therefore, again they do not want to hear about it. 
However, I think the former is most generally the case.
<P>
	Let me assure those who think this kind of activity is unusual 
or the exception that it is not. It is very difficult for women who 
are victimized in this way to come forward. All the standard 
reactions of women are not to rock the boat, not to disturb the 
status quo, not to anger their superiors. That is because for many 
of them, the jobs they hold are absolutely crucial to their 
families, to their standard of living and to maintaining their 
place in life. Frequently when these matters take place they 
think: ``I imagined it,'' or worse: ``I did something to engender 
this response''.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	That is usually not the case. As a matter of fact, empirical 
research in this area is that it almost never is the case. Along 
with that equally unacceptable practice, that of racism, it stems 
from the unconscionable behaviour of the perpetrator and not 
from the behaviour of the victim.
<P>
	Consequently I make this plea today. In the review and in the 
decisions as to where the Department of National Defence is 
going, as to where we are going as a country on defence policy, I 
will do something I rarely do in this House and that is to quote an 
American source.
<P>
	My American source is one of the first great feminists of 
North America, Abigail Adams, the wife of the second president 
of the United States, John Adams. She was the mother of, I think 
it was the fourth president of the United States, John Quincy 
Adams. When her husband with his colleagues was crafting the 
declaration of independence and later the constitution of the 
United States, she said: ``Remember the ladies''.
<P>
	Well, I would paraphrase it for the 1990s. I would say to my 
colleagues and to those people who will be doing the review in 
the Department of National Defence, that policies relating to 
gender equality must be part and parcel of the new armed forces, 
of the new Department of National Defence.
<P>
	Women in this country have earned the right and deserve to be 
full partners in all our endeavours. Women can serve in the 
armed forces and serve with distinction as they have done over 
many, many years. However they must be able to enter that 
milieu as they must be able to enter any milieu, particularly one 
that is governed by the public policy of this country, with the 
knowledge that they will not be victimized, that they will not be 
treated as second class citizens, and that if anyone attempts that 
kind of behaviour proper systems will be in place to answer and 
deal with those complaints.
<P>
	The difficulty we have had with both sexism and racism, not 
just in this country but in democratic societies generally, is that 
we have tended to deal with them as individual cases before 
well-meaning and well-acting human rights commissions. An 
individual goes to the system with a complaint based on a breach 
of human rights law. That individual might get redress in one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1515"> 1515 </A></B>
<P>
particular case, but the system that allowed the offence to occur 
in the first place has not changed. It has not  removed the ability 
for such acts to occur. That is what we must do right through our 
government, right through our public policy.
<P>
	The fact is that this review of the Department of National 
Defence is a golden opportunity. It is an opportunity that must 
not be missed, that can go forward again-and this is something 
we are all concerned about in this week before the budget is 
about to come down-without costing a whole lot of money.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	It is my belief that systemic discrimination can be eradicated 
from federal government agencies generally without costing a 
whole lot of money. That is not the case for some of the other 
things that I am very keen on, such as pay equity and a few other 
things. Those are going to cost money and the piper will have to 
be paid and he will have to be paid soon as well.
<P>
	The question of systemic discrimination and the question of 
setting up within our current institutions, defence and otherwise 
in this country, can be done and has been shown that it can be 
done by a variety of reports under human rights commissions, 
under royal commissions. I refer, for example, to the Abella 
report on employment equity which shows certain ways that 
systemic discrimination can be dealt with.
<P>
	I can remember some 12 years ago when you, Madam 
Speaker, and I were both present at a meeting here in this 
building sponsored by what was then known as Employment and 
Immigration Canada during which we discovered that CIDA 
Canada marketed a program to other countries across the world 
that showed them how to eradicate systemic discrimination 
from private sector companies and government offices at very 
low cost.
<P>
	We have the program. It is available. I believe that we can 
implement it within our own public service, within our own 
Department of National Defence.
<P>
	While we permit the evils of racism and sexism, while we 
permit discrimination in any form in this, one of the most 
pluralistic and multicultural societies on earth, we have no right 
to stand proudly as Canadians and claim it as we know it can be 
and should be the greatest nation on earth.
<P>
	We tend to be rather quiet as Canadians, but we are also 
accused from time to time of being rather smug because we are 
so very fortunate. In spite of the ills that beset us in times of 
economic downturn, in spite of the difficulties and in spite of the 
world's worst weather, at least here in Ottawa, we do not deny 
the fact that we are among the luckiest people in the world.
<P>
	Until we solve the problems that beset 52 per cent of the 
population, until we do this, we as Canadians carry a burden that 
we should not pass on to our children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
previous speaker, the hon. member from the beautiful province 
of Nova Scotia, is to be commended for introducing into today's 
debate the subject of discrimination in the Canadian Forces, 
although she made it clear this was not the only department 
where major changes were necessary.
<P>
	The motion before the House today to appoint this special 
joint committee could, of course, include discrimination, but I 
wonder whether this would not be duplicate a previous exercise. 
Perhaps action, not more studies, is what we need. You referred 
to the Abella report and the report released last year which made 
it clear that discrimination existed in several sectors at National 
Defence.
<P>
	The facts are there, recommendations have been made, the 
various parties have responded to the reports that were 
published, and the only one that is not moving at all is the 
government. I think it would make sense for the government that 
has been in power since October 25 and whose members has 
been familiar with the problem for years, and especially 
considering the report released last year, to immediately table 
specific measures to deal with this discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	You mentioned this earlier, quite rightly, and it surprised me 
as well last year, when I heard that the government was giving 
other countries advice on how to eliminate discrimination in 
certain agencies, even private agencies, and that it did not 
consider implementing its own recommendations.
<P>
	Although I applaud your comments on the subject, I think you 
were rather soft on this new government by failing to state quite 
frankly that it was time to do something specific, since the 
report and the recommendations are known. All it takes is for the 
parties involved, meaning the government, to make a decision 
so that, as you pointed out, this kind of discrimination on 
military bases is abolished.
<P>
	I do not think a committee, especially not a committee of both 
Houses, which means a very big committee, which would be 
asked to discuss conversion, to reflect on the potential need for a 
new base for training peacekeepers, to consider the advisability 
of closing certain bases or what Canada's contribution should be 
as an international force, in multilateral forces, I do not think it 
could also talk about discrimination. This committee will 
already have too much on its plate. A debate on this particular 
issue would not be appropriate in a committee that is supposed 
to make recommendations for future policy. It seems to me we 
do not need any further debate on this issue. The public realizes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1516"> 1516 </A></B>
<P>
that changes are necessary. Changes must be  made, and the 
government can make them without a committee, on the basis of 
existing reports.
<P>
	In any case, this committee seems to be one committee too 
many. We already have a National Defence committee, which is 
supposed to consider future policy and the estimates and hear 
testimony from the military and civilians. The hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières said earlier in his speech that he had a petition 
signed by nearly 7,000 people from Trois-Rivières who 
objected to the fact that National Defence and the defence sector 
are so generously funded and said that conversion was 
necessary. We already have a committee that can hear these 
witnesses and make recommendations to the government.
<P>
	I have known the hon. member as an ardent activist for 
women's rights. I applaud that, and I know she will keep up the 
good work, but she will realize it is much harder now. A great 
politician once said that power imposes its own constraints. I 
want to ask whether she is prepared to rise in caucus and here in 
the House, not to ask members to think about discrimination but 
to ask for immediate implementation of the recommendations of 
the Abella and other reports, which tell us exactly where the 
discrimination is and how it should be corrected.
<P>
	If she wants to accomplish anything, it will have to be done 
through government decisions. I also think that the proposed 
committee should not be struck. In other words, the committee 
is unnecessary because we already have a National Defence 
committee that could examine all the items the minister 
mentioned this morning and which the red book, which you 
praised so highly during the election campaign, mentioned as 
well, although far more clearly than the minister did in his 
speech this morning.
<P>
	Would the hon. member agree that it is time to do something 
about discrimination instead of taking this issue back to 
committee?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I must say I am truly delighted 
to see the hon. member's conversion on the road to Damascus 
because as he has kindly recalled my history on the opposition 
benches as an activist for women's rights, I too recall his 
original incarnation in this House as a member of a government, 
indeed as a member of a government that had full access to the 
Abella report which was tabled in this House in 1984 when the 
hon. member was part and parcel of that government.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	I am sure that his desire for quick action has come since his, 
shall we say, change in circumstance. I will, however, say that I 
am a little disappointed at the hon. member's wish to debunk a 
committee that has not yet been struck. Certainly there is a 
committee for national defence, a standing committee of this 
House, and it has a particular mandate.
<P>
	The joint committee that is being talked about in this 
resolution has a specific mandate that was promised, I might 
add, in the red book. We on this side of the House will always 
keep our promises. That is a promise we made. It is a promise we 
are going to keep.
<P>
	What I want to see done and what I know will be done by this 
committee is that the systemic changes necessary to prevent 
further discrimination within the armed forces will be dealt with 
by this joint committee as part and parcel of its long-term 
mandate. To say that this work can be left to the committee on 
national defence is to be unrealistic. I know the hon. member 
would never be so with regard to the duties of the standing 
committee here in this House.
<P>
	For example, the standing committee on defence will have to 
deal with estimates and with various and sundry other matters as 
they come up in the daily business relating to the minister of 
defence and his responsibilities.
<P>
	This joint committee is to do a very special job within a very 
special period of time. As I said before, it is one that is 
absolutely necessary to the health and future of the Department 
of National Defence.
<P>
	With regard to the need for action, I want to make perfectly 
clear that in my remarks I was certainly not calling for any more 
studies, no more studies. We know what the problems are. We 
know where they are. We know how they exist and we also know 
how to fix them.
<P>
	What remains to be done now is for this committee to take as 
its mandate, which I am quite sure it will, this problem and work 
it in with the review and its recommendations for changes within 
the armed forces that the Department of National Defence will 
carry forward into the next century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Madam 
Speaker, today I would like to join some other members of this 
House in supporting the motion before us to strike a special joint 
committee of the House of Commons and the Senate to consider 
Canada's defence policy.
<P>
	It is the conviction of many within our country and among our 
international neighbours that the last decade of this millennium 
presents an urgent and opportune moment to re-examine 
defence policy and national security.
<P>
	The international, regional and internal factors compelling us 
as Canadians to review our policy are well articulated by people 
within and out of the defence industry. I am sure they will be 
thoroughly addressed by the joint committee we are proposing 
to strike today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1517"> 1517 </A></B>
<P>
	For my part, the issues of fiscal constraint, international 
political instability and the safety and adequate resourcing of 
troops we send abroad in service are priorities.
<P>
	I wish to contribute to the current debate by emphasising the 
process of review. I want to encourage the proposed joint 
committee to consult carefully and widely with Canadians 
during this review process for two basic reasons.
<P>
	First, the federal government has a unique and special role in 
educating Canadians about national defence and security. 
Defence is totally within the constitutional jurisdiction of the 
federal government. We must discharge our duties in this regard.
<P>
	This review process is one opportunity to make younger and 
newer Canadians in particular aware of the role that our armed 
forces play and of the service they provide for us. I also hope 
that the joint committee will consider in its deliberations other 
ways and means for Canadians to be made fully aware of the 
importance of defence.
<P>
	Developing educational and training programs will also 
ensure that we have a secure pool of future personnel for our 
armed forces service. While a consultative process will no doubt 
reveal various opinions and philosophies about the role of 
defence, the open and frank discussion should be of great 
educational value and should contribute to a national consensus 
for defence policy, one that would be sufficient to guide us into 
the next century.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	The importance of achieving such a national consensus is the 
second reason for a broad and careful consultation process 
among Canadians. The best policy and legislation that 
governments can bring forward is that which commands lasting 
public support.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians not only need to understand but that 
they want to understand defence policy. I believe that they will 
support policy that they understand and have had a hand in 
crafting.
<P>
	It is with this in mind that I offer some constructive criticism 
of the timing of this review. It seems to me that the Liberal Party 
red book makes a number of policy decisions that may prove to 
be premature. These include increasing the priority of 
peacekeeping, establishing peacekeeping centres at surplus 
bases, forcing defence industry conversions, creating a 
peacekeeping brigade of volunteers and cutting the defence 
budget by $1.6 billion over four years.
<P>
	Others have made this point as well. I as well feel that 
piecemeal change to defence policy before a thorough review is 
completed is a case of putting the cart before the horse. We 
cannot be sure of what our requirements will be, for example, in 
the area of base reorganization before the review process is 
completed. In other words, I would encourage the government to 
be as objective and  open minded as possible when going 
through this review process.
<P>
	The two crucial functions that the joint committee on 
Canada's defence policy can fulfil by developing a good process 
of consultation are education and consensus. The government 
must continue to find ways to accomplish these objectives.
<P>
	I would also like to present an idea to this House which I have 
suggested to the minister of defence privately regarding the 
potential closure of Canadian forces bases. I recommended that 
the minister strike an ad hoc caucus of members who have CFBs 
in their ridings to participate fully in the base closure review 
process.
<P>
	The benefits of such a process would be as follows. First, the 
minister may be provided with information from each base and 
surrounding community that he might not otherwise have had 
the benefit of receiving. This information, along with expert 
opinion, would be shared and debated openly in an ad hoc caucus 
resulting in the best analysis and decisions possible.
<P>
	Second, it would allow the MP to more ably and effectively 
represent the views of his or her constituents. Third, it would 
increase the ownership level of the decision among 
parliamentarians and, therefore, among Canadians.
<P>
	It is important for the government to have the respective MPs 
regardless of the future of any given base as allies rather than 
adversaries of the decision.
<P>
	Having been fully informed of all the factors in the decision 
making process and having had the opportunity to contribute to 
the discussion on behalf of constituents, an MP would be a great 
help in communicating, gaining support for, consolidating and 
monitoring the outcomes of the decision.
<P>
	In conclusion, a consultative, co-operative approach relating 
to the whole defence policy or to a subdepartment of it seems to 
be very much in line with the government's stated agenda for a 
more open and effective Parliament.
<P>
	I am sure that we would all admit to some uncertainty about 
what the next century will bring in terms of internal, regional 
and international stability. I would argue, however, that the best 
way to face such an uncertain future is with careful planning. 
The future will surely come. The question is will we drive into it 
or will we drift into it?
<P>
	Canadians will feel most secure with the future if we as 
leaders involve them, help to educate them, listen to them and 
together come to the best possible decisions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the Prime Minister and the Minister of National 
Defence and the government on this long overdue review of our 
national 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1518"> 1518 </A></B>
<P>
defence policies, the way we provide services as well as the role 
of national  defence. I would also like to congratulate the 
government on involving once and for all national defence staff, 
the armed forces and all those who have anything to do with 
national defence policy.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe it takes a lot of guts to undertake such an overall 
review. I am very happy and delighted to see this review taking 
place. In particular, unlike my colleague on the opposition side, 
I am encouraged by the fact that our role internationally will be 
enhanced through this review and also through the fact that 
some of the bases that we have here in Canada might be used as 
training bases for other forces around the world that might be 
interested in peacekeeping roles.
<P>
	When it comes to the closure of bases, the hon. member is 
saying that MPs should be consulted in order for them to go back 
to their constituents and tell them about the issues so that they 
may bring back the views of their constituents. It goes without 
saying any MP who tells me that his or her constituents support 
the closure of a base is mistaken. No constituent would like to 
see a base in their neighbourhood or their surrounding being 
closed.
<P>
	What we have to do is involve those affected by doing a 
review to ensure that whatever action the government takes 
would have a minimal or no affect on the surrounding 
community. The government is doing just that.
<P>
	I am informed that this member in his home province of 
Saskatchewan undertook an initiative to have a look at one of the 
bases that is under consideration, I presume, and invited 
everybody but the member for the area in which this particular 
base is involved. I want to ask him why he did not practice what 
he preached. When he undertook this initiative why did he not 
involve all of the different partners rather than just picking and 
choosing the people he wanted to invite to that particular 
meeting or event?
<P>
	Would the member not agree that it would really be wrong to 
prejudge the government decision on an initiative which has just 
now been launched? Would he not agree that it would be wiser to 
wait until such a time as the committee is struck and has had a 
chance to undertake a review? Does he not think that would be 
the best time and place in order to make any kind of presentation 
on behalf of his constituents? That would be the proper time for 
the member to tell the government and the minister the kind of 
things he would like to see the government do when it comes to 
national defence issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Madam Speaker, I have two points. First of all, 
the base that is apparently in question in Saskatchewan happens 
to be the base which is in my home riding. Second, in any 
attempts or meetings that we have had as a Saskatchewan caucus 
we have invited everyone to be present and to take part in those.
<P>
	The question that the hon. member raises is a good question 
and one that I talked about in my presentation. There can be no 
way at this point that we can go out and make piecemeal cuts or 
changes to any part of the defence without the full review 
process. We have to give the review process a chance to work.
<P>
	I look at base closures as one perfect example. If we close or 
drastically change base <I>x</I> in province <I>y</I> today and pending the 
outcome of the review this fall we may say that base <I>x</I> in 
province <I>y</I> should have been kept. One cannot make a judgment 
as to what the long-term mission or the long-term goal of our 
defence should be without giving the process a chance to work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
in the lobby but I was listening to the speech by the member. I 
fully understand the angst that he must feel knowing that with 
the base and with cuts pending he may have to deal with that in 
his riding. I certainly wish him well. I certainly hope that he 
does not have to deal with that at this point.
<P>
	I have a fundamental question. During the election campaign 
the Reform Party in my riding-I have one of the largest 
military ridings in the country-would go around and say that it 
was its party's platform to eliminate the deficit in three years. 
However, at every all-candidates meeting on my side of the 
harbour and on the side of the harbour of my colleague from 
Halifax, whenever asked about defence policy we never 
received an answer.
<P>
	The hon. member is now speaking for his constituents and I 
think that is the right thing to do. I want to know what the party's 
position is? The Reform Party platform said that in three years it 
would eliminate the deficit. With 37 cents of every discretionary 
dollar left in the budget going to defence, how would his party 
approach cutting the deficit to zero without going around and 
laying waste to most of the national defence infrastructure?
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	What I am saying is maybe he cannot have it both ways. I have 
never seen it like that. Maybe he can explain how it is done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Madam Speaker, first of all if anyone would 
take the time to look at our famous blue book they would see that 
we have not advocated any major cuts to defence from the $12 
billion budget it is currently working under.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1519"> 1519 </A></B>
<P>
	Having said that, we also believe that sooner or later we have 
to make infrastructure cuts. I am not opposed to cutting back or 
to making changes in defence. What I am saying in the whole 
gist of what I did say was that we have to get the process 
finished. I agree with the member's side of the House to have 
this review process but let us not make any changes until we 
have a look at it.
<P>
	There may be a situation in which something very close to me 
is necessary to be cut. I would not like that. My constituents 
would not like that but that is part of the tough talk and the tough 
things that have to happen over the next few years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to compliment the hon. member on his speech.
<P>
	I listened with a lot of interest because obviously something 
we are going to have to do is revise the role of the military for the 
21st century. Things have changed. The cold war is over.
<P>
	What I am interested in here and now is process of review. I 
would like to know what the hon. member's vision is of how this 
process of review is going to work, how this committee is going 
to be put together. Obviously one of the things we will be 
looking at is the cost part of it and the Reform is definitely 
looking at the cost of operating government.
<P>
	I would like to know how the member is going to put together 
this committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question. It is a good question.
<P>
	The vision I probably have for this review is that there would 
be a committee of members who have CFBs in their ridings. 
That would give all of us, and I have a CFB in my riding, a 
chance to sit down and make the case or tell the minister or tell 
the committee of people that this is what makes Moose Jaw wing 
15 very good, very important.
<P>
	I would talk about things like the low cost of operating this 
service in Saskatchewan, for instance. We would do this in 
conjunction with expert opinion, people who are in our defence 
industry at this time. There has to be some give and take so that 
we can look at what is best for the industry and for the country as 
a whole and not necessarily what is best for my riding or any 
particular riding.
<P>
	Having said all that, I do know, as I mentioned before, that 
there are going to be some tough choices. If an MP were asked to 
be part of that committee he or she could go back to his or her 
riding and indicate the reasons that base <I>x</I> was changed or base <I>y</I> 
was closed.
<P>
	I was part of that and it may make sense. We have to change it 
based on what we talked about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Madam Speaker, as with 
many aspects of Canadian life, the time has come for a long and 
hard look at our military policy, where we want it to go and how 
we want it to be an instrument of our national policy.
<P>
	I would like to begin by saying how much I appreciate the 
opportunity to participate in this important debate and I believe 
it is important because it affects everyone in this country.
<P>
	After all, Canadians, no matter what their age, their 
occupation, or where they live, have a stake in defence. For that 
reason I am especially pleased that the government has formally 
launched a defence review in the House of Commons. In so 
doing, the government is once again showing its commitment to 
consult with Canadians and take account of their opinions in 
determining the future of defence policy.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The opinions of concerned Canadians will be given voice here 
today, as they have been already, and they will no doubt 
influence the structure and the purpose of our military forces in 
the future.
<P>
	As the minister noted in his speech earlier today, the aim of 
the review is to develop a new defence policy for Canada, one 
that reflects not only an uncertain environment abroad, but our 
needs here at home and the values we hold as Canadians.
<P>
	The government hopes that the special joint committee on 
defence policy will hear the widest possible range of views on 
the future of Canadian defence.
<P>
	Once the committee is established I expect that it will make 
plans to solicit the widest range of opinion on these issues. But 
before consultations begin we need an answer to a basic 
question: Is there a need for armed forces in the world today? 
Many people are asking this question.
<P>
	In my view, the answer is yes. A glance at the front page of 
any major daily newspaper on practically any given day will 
enforce this view. Regrettably, the potential for conflict still 
persists, both between states and within states.
<P>
	Armed forces are designed to play many roles in the world 
today. During the next few minutes I would like to discuss those 
roles in general and I will describe how the Canadian forces 
could help Canada meet its domestic and foreign policy 
objectives.
<P>
	In doing so I will identify the specific roles that the Canadian 
forces carry out. They exist as security at home and they exist to 
contribute to international security and defence through 
multilateral operations abroad.
<P>
	Finally, I will describe some of the activities undertaken by 
the Canadian forces. Those activities stand as solid proof of the 
asset our military represents due to its great ability to carry out 
many necessary tasks at home and abroad.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1520"> 1520 </A></B>
<P>
	The most basic reason that any country fields armed forces is 
to protect its people, its territory and its political independence. 
To provide that protection, armed forces must guard against 
threats to sovereignty from without and answer threats to law 
and order from within whenever those threats outstrip the 
availability of civil authorities to respond.
<P>
	Democratic governments prefer to avoid using the military to 
maintain public order but having the ability to do so provides a 
form of insurance against unacceptable risks.
<P>
	The Canadian forces have been called upon to respond to 
threats to public order. We all recall the calm and disciplined 
performance with which the Canadian forces helped to diffuse a 
potentially explosive situation at Oka a few summers ago. 
Providing protection is an important military role, but it is not 
the sole raison d'ètre for the military.
<P>
	Most armed forces are also capable of carrying out a variety 
of civil roles like search and rescue and disaster relief. We do 
not have to look beyond our own borders for examples of this.
<P>
	The national roles played by the Canadian forces can be 
invaluable. One of the most important and most dramatic roles 
is search and rescue. It is a task that demands professionalism 
and determination, often under daunting conditions. The crews 
that fly search and rescue missions enjoy their triumphs such as 
when a Sea King helicopter lifted two stranded hunters from an 
island off Nova Scotia or plucked nine Honduran seamen from a 
sinking ship off the coast of Haiti.
<P>
	Sometimes, of course, the end result can be far from 
rewarding, as we saw in the futile search for the missing crew of 
a cargo carrier lost in the Atlantic last month or the grim 
discovery last summer of a wrecked plane that ended a 12-day 
search of the Quebec wilderness. But the point is that our forces 
are there, they are trained, they are equipped and they are ready 
to meet Canada's search and rescue needs.
<P>
	Our forces are also ready to respond to calls for disaster relief. 
Canadian soldiers, sailors and air crew have fought floods, 
battled forest fires and evacuated isolated communities standing 
in the way. For more than 50 years Canadian forces have also 
played a role in protecting our marine resources. Today Aurora 
and Arcturus surveillance aircraft conduct fisheries patrols over 
huge expanses of ocean, taking over where the Argus, the 
Tracker and the Lancaster left off.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The proficiency of the Canadian forces is the product of their 
training and equipment. The dedication of our service men and 
service women in carrying out those domestic roles attest to 
their status as a national asset. Based on the contribution they 
make to our national, domestic interests alone, there can be no 
doubt that the Canadian forces should continue to play a 
significant role in our collective future.
<P>
	I have described the role of the armed forces within the nation 
state. Of course, armed forces also are maintained to respond to 
serious breaches of international security. Few of us would have 
to search our memories to think of these examples. The two 
world wars come to mind immediately, as does the Korean 
conflict and the most recent war in the Persian gulf.
<P>
	When the cold war ended, we had hoped this type of threat 
would recede, but as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait illustrated so 
forcefully, aggression and conflict are not yet things of the past.
<P>
	In addition to the many civil wars currently under way, 
tensions between nations are high and could easily lead to 
conflict. Think of the uneasy truce that exists between North and 
South Korea or the apprehension among the states bordering the 
civil war in the Balkans. Obviously there is no substitute for 
armed forces to respond to situations where diplomacy and 
negotiations have failed leading nations to resort to force.
<P>
	Indeed even the authors of a document as hopeful as the 
United Nations charter acknowledge that these types of 
situations would continue to exist and in response they called 
upon states to maintain armed forces that can be used to defend 
the principles contained in the charter.
<P>
	Canada's armed forces are no strangers to operations of this 
type. We were a major allied power during the second world war. 
We sent forces to Korea under UN command. In 1990 we were 
among the first countries to commit forces to the multinational 
coalition that operated in support of the United Nations and 
reversed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
<P>
	Collective defence is another form of multilateral military 
co-operation in which security minded nations choose to 
participate. While sovereign states join organizations like the 
United Nations, helping to ensure international security on a 
global basis, collective defence arrangements are more limited 
and more focused. Essentially collective defence arrangements 
result when like-minded nations promise to co-operate to 
guarantee each other's defence.
<P>
	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO is a classic 
example of that co-operation. Since it was founded in 1949 the 
alliance has grown to include 16 nations, all of which have 
pledged to pool resources for the common defence. NATO's 
primary purpose has been to prevent a major war through the 
deterrence of aggression and in this it has been very successful.
<P>
	Considering that the cold war could easily have ended with a 
nuclear confrontation, we are very fortunate that NATO never 
had to use its military capabilities. That does not mean however 
that other than preventing an east-west conflict there were no 
benefits to collective defence through NATO. Far from it. At a 
basic level NATO reduced the expense and increased the 
efficiency of providing for defence within the Atlantic 
community 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1521"> 1521 </A></B>
<P>
and from a political perspective NATO contributed  greatly to 
the reconciliation of countries that only quite recently had been 
at war with each other.
<P>
	NATO has also served as a meeting place where nations could 
discuss security issues and as a catalyst for military 
standardization and interoperability. In fact the familiarity 
NATO bred was put to very good use during the gulf war. Many 
of the allied countries were well acquainted with one another's 
equipment and procedures, factors that enhance the success of 
joint operations.
<P>
	Canadians have been strong supporters of collective defence, 
not only through NATO but through a longstanding bilateral 
defence relationship with the United States. We have placed our 
armed forces at the service of NATO and NORAD and we have 
actively participated in shaping allied positions. I hope that 
Canada will continue to play this constructive role.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	A third international role for the armed forces and for 
Canadian forces in particular is the involvement in 
peacekeeping operations. Most Canadians today are familiar 
with the contribution we are making to a concept first 
introduced in the years following World War II. Back then 
peacekeeping and observer missions were seen as something of 
an exotic innovation, but today they are widely accepted.
<P>
	The review will provide Canadians with an excellent 
opportunity to reflect on the complex and evolving state of 
peacekeeping. The reality is that many current operations bear 
little resemblance to the original concept.
<P>
	Within the last five years alone military forces have stepped 
into the breach to carry out an ever increasing and changing 
variety of tasks. Let us consider some of them for a moment.
<P>
	Peacekeepers have helped to monitor elections in Africa and 
Central America. They have trained local populations to 
recognize and disarm land mines in Afghanistan. In Cambodia 
they helped provide administration on a nation-wide scale. In 
the war torn remnants of the former Yugoslavia they have 
ensured the delivery of humanitarian aid and created safe havens 
for refugees.
<P>
	In only a few years peacekeeping tasks have expanded 
exponentially and the demand for qualified personnel to serve as 
peacekeepers has risen to new heights. No one is more aware of 
these developments than Canadians. In the past few years we 
have listened to reports about the activities of our forces in 
troubled spots around the world. We felt pride when Canadian 
forces air crews flew humanitarian aid to Sarajevo. We watched 
on television one hot summer day as a young Canadian soldier 
risked his life in the same city to save two women wounded by 
sniper fire. We have read about the difference our peacekeepers 
have made in Cambodia, in Central America and the Middle 
East.
<P>
	There are many other worthy stories that have never, ever 
received wide circulation. Take for instance the military 
engineers in Bosnia who lowered the road through a mountain 
tunnel and straightened hairpin curves to improve a critical 
route used to deliver humanitarian aid. The Canadian soldiers in 
Somalia, we hear a lot about them but we did not hear about the 
ones who improved schools, reopened a hospital and got public 
utilities up and running in this area.
<P>
	In essence, the defence review will chart a new direction for 
the Canadian forces as we enter the 21st century. That role has 
changed dramatically, even since the end of the cold war. 
Although sovereignty protection and collective defence remain 
important priorities, peacekeeping has become a focal point for 
the Canadian forces. We need to ask ourselves how best to strike 
a balance between these activities.
<P>
	In conclusion, the end of the cold war has brought about 
dramatic reorderings and turbulence throughout much of the 
world. To meet the challenges of today and those we expect to 
encounter in the future we must field flexible, capable military 
forces.
<P>
	If Canada seeks peace in a time of great transition and 
upheaval then it follows that we must retain armed forces 
capable of meeting the challenges to our defence and security at 
home and abroad.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened very closely to the speech by my hon. 
colleague for Hillsborough and I agree with him that the 
Depatment of National Defence does many things very well and 
that it plays an important role.
<P>
	However, if we examine each of the services in detail, it is 
clear that each one is important and has a role to play. My 
question is the following: Since we already have a national 
defence committee and given that we are asking the middle class 
and the poor to tighten their belts, what more can a special 
sixteen-member joint committee accomplish that existing 
committees cannot?
<P>
	I would also like to ask my hon. colleague why the sixteen 
committee members should be authorized to travel from place to 
place within Canada and abroad to receive evidence?
<P>
	Would it not be more logical to have witnesses come here to 
give evidence?
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments and his questions. I suppose I could use the saying six 
of one, half a dozen of another. I assume one of the reasons for 
the joint committee is to have the two Houses involved and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1522"> 1522 </A></B>
<P>
16 people. It does not matter to me whether it is 11 or 16 or 
whatever the case may be. However it is going to be a joint 
committee of both Houses. There will be expertise on that joint 
committee from both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
	We have talked over the years of the other place being an 
instrument that is not of much use to the country. One of the 
reasons that has come about is that the other place has not been 
used enough when we are starting out on such things as this 
investigation of our armed forces.
<P>
	The people from the other place will contribute to this 
committee as well as we will contribute to it. So far as the 16 
members going across the country is concerned, why not bring 
the people here? The hon. member will find in a lot of instances 
that people will be brought here. The most viable thing to do 
would be to bring people here.
<P>
	We remember what happened when other committees went 
across the country in the last number of years. People were very 
concerned when the committee did not go to their areas. We have 
to be cognizant of that. We should visit as many of these areas as 
we find necessary. With that number of people, we can also split 
into different committees that can visit at different times in 
different areas of the country. That would help to speed up the 
process and not miss anybody in the overall scheme of things.
<P>
	I do agree that in many instances it would be much more 
expedient, much more economical, to bring the people to Ottawa 
to listen to them here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member who has just spoken has broad 
experience in government. He has been in provincial 
government and he has been in Ottawa for a while.
<P>
	Does he not feel it is very important to have a number of 
members like 16 on a committee including senators and to have 
breadth and depth from across the country on matters as 
important as the future defence policy of our large country, a 
country that has a great name around the world in peacekeeping 
and in doing more than our share during wartime in the past?
<P>
	We will have many people with expertise in foreign affairs. 
We will have people with expertise in the military field. We will 
have other people with expertise in the industrial and training 
fields. The Canadian forces is the largest training school in 
Canada.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not feel it is important to have breadth 
and depth from across Canada on the committee, to have the 
committee going to meet Canadians who cannot afford to come 
to Ottawa because this is a huge country, and to let Canadians 
have their say on such matters as defence policy and foreign 
policy? If we do not have that breadth and depth, will we not 
have an inward looking attitude instead of a broad, outward 
looking attitude at the world and nationally in our own country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
intervention and his questions. I think they are very relevant.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I spoke just a moment ago about this very thing. This is 
certainly one of the most important committees I have been on 
in my time here. It is going to take an in depth look at our 
defence policy as to where we are going into the next 
millennium. I believe we have to be committed to it. As I look at 
the make-up of the committee thus far I am very pleased. We 
have many good people on it from every party in the House. I 
think that spells good for the future. I am sure the people who 
will be chosen from the Senate will add their expertise to it at 
their own level.
<P>
	As I said a moment ago, we have to go out to various parts of 
the country, and probably other places around the globe, to get 
the whole input of people who have a great interest in our 
country and in our military as to what we should have in 
upcoming years.
<P>
	This is not something that will be a hodge-podge, band-aid 
situation. I think we have had some of that in the past. I believe 
the time has come. Canadians have told us that we have to 
change. Our economics tell us we have to change. I can see the 
make-up of this 16-member committee. It will split into 
subcommittees to go across the land and across the world to see 
what will be necessary for the next number of years. This is very 
important to the future of the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Unfortunately, there 
are only a couple of minutes left, Madam Speaker, and I think I 
could do a 20-minute speech because I am so frustrated from 
hearing what I just heard. I will try to be calm and precise and to 
ask the hon. member opposite for a precise answer.
<P>
	On the first opposition day, we had a debate on a special 
committee to review every item of government spending and to 
save not millions but billions of dollars. The Liberals were 
against that committee to save money and to avoid duplication 
in the mandates of committees, as they said at the time. They are 
now offering us the same thing in a defence committee, not the 
same thing but a real duplication with enormous costs on reports 
we already have and answers we already know, with senators, 
probably to assess the relevance of their duties and to occupy 
them to a certain extent, since they have nothing to do, with 16 
members, 14 on this committee. I am sorry but I would like some 
clarifications on the relevance of this committee, an 
approximation of costs, and I would like to know why you were 
opposed to a committee to save not millions but billions of 
dollars where now you are proposing to spend money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1523"> 1523 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would suggest that you keep your red book 
introduction for the next campaign, if there is one, to the effect 
that voters no longer trust politicians because, with behaviour 
such as this, they will continue to distrust them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I can give the hon. 
member for Hillsborough about 30 seconds if he thinks he can 
give an answer in that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, this committee was struck by 
the House. The committee is in place, the Standing Committee 
on National Defence and Veterans Affairs to study the policy. It 
is a joint committee of both Houses.
<P>
	The idea that we are going to spend more money on it is 
ridiculous. We are given a budget to go forward as a committee 
and that is what we are going to do. We are going to determine 
the future defence policy of the country for some time to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Madam 
Speaker, today the government, in a somewhat hasty move, has 
introduced a motion calling for the establishment of a joint 
committee which would duplicate the work of the Standing 
Committee on National Defence. I do not want to expand on the 
substance of the motion at this time since several of my 
colleagues have argued against it and stressed that there is no 
justification whatsoever for setting up a joint committee which 
would cover the same ground as the Standing Committee on 
National Defence, increase costs and delay the implementation 
of a defence program. Therefore, not suprisingly, I join with my 
Bloc Quebecois colleagues in denouncing the striking of this 
joint committee, as proposed by the government in its motion.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Instead, I would rather spend my time focusing on the issue of 
industrial conversion. As we know, defence industries employ a 
considerable number of people and since the end of the cold war, 
these factories are getting fewer and fewer orders. They have 
already begun laying off workers. Therefore, steps must be 
taken quickly to convert military factories for civilian purposes.
<P>
	What I do not understand is that the Liberal Party of Canada 
appears to be saying two different things. When it formed the 
Official Opposition, it said one thing, but now that it is in power, 
it seems to be singing an entirely different tune. To confirm my 
suspicions, I would like to read to you a short excerpt from a 
March 26, 1993 press release prepared for immediate 
publication by the office of the then Leader of the Opposition. 
Therefore the current Prime Minister was Leader of the Official 
Opposition at the time. He was in Quebec City where he 
announced to reporters a policy to convert the defence industry 
for civilian purposes. That announcement appeared on the 
following day's papers. Three opposition members were also 
making a similar announcement here  in Ottawa at the same time 
and virtually all of the media in Canada covered the story.
<P>
	Right now, the Liberal government has all the data it had back 
when it was in opposition. Why authorize another joint 
super-committee to conduct further studies and analyses and 
undertake more trips when we already have a committee, the 
Standing Committee on National Defence, to do the job? It 
makes no sense!
<P>
	I would like to read part of the statement issued by the then 
Leader of the Opposition at the press conference held on March 
26, 1993. ``Today, Liberal leader Jean Chrétien, speaking in 
Quebec City, and three Liberal MPs, speaking in Ottawa, 
unveiled the defence conversion policy that would adopted by a 
Liberal government to bring our high-tech military industry 
into the post cold war era, while creating at the same time new 
economic development opportunities''.
<P>
	Here are the highlights of the announcement made in Quebec 
City by Mr. Chrétien and in Ottawa by Mr. Axworthy, the 
External Affairs critic, by Mr. Bill Rompkey, the Defence critic 
and by Mr. Jim Peterson, the Industry critic.
<P>
	They proposed to expand the mandate of Industry, Science 
and Technology Canada's $200 million Defence Industry 
Productivity Program, known as DIPP, from developing defence 
technology to helping the industry convert and diversify into 
areas such as environmental technologies and high-tech 
peacekeeping technologies. They also proposed the 
establishment of an Economic Conversion Commission, with 
the participation of industry and labour, to facilitate and 
coordinate the process of conversion in the 100,000-job defence 
industry. Quite a few people work in the defence sector, 100,000 
to be exact.
<P>
	The Liberals urged the opposition and suggested to the 
Conservatives, then in office, to develop joint conversion 
arrangements with the United States, the market for 80 per cent 
of Canada's defence exports. Under the Clinton administration, 
the United States have embarked on a major defence conversion 
effort, thus reducing demand for Canadian-built defence 
products.
<P>
	``The cold war is over, and Canada must adapt to a changing 
world'', said Mr. Chrétien at that press conference. He went on 
to say that ``the Tory government has no defence conversion 
policy and has been content to let the market dictate 
diversification''.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Chrétien noted at that press conference that he had been 
calling for government action on defence conversion since 
March 1990. The Liberal leader called the international arms 
trade, which has shrunk by 25 per cent in the last few years, an 
industry of the past. He said, ``We need to invest in the economic 
winners-and the job creators-of tomorrow''. He wanted to 
invest and suggested to the then Conservative government to 
invest $5.8 billion in helicopters. He said that it was a cold war 
policy and that it was no way to develop Canada's  high-tech 
potential. The Liberals believed instead in gearing this shrink-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1524"> 1524 </A></B>
<P>
ing industry towards more competitive military and civilian 
goods. Government can and must show leadership in shaping 
change. It was still Mr. Chrétien talking.
<P>
	He then concluded by saying, ``Canadians are entitled to a 
government that is prepared to lead, a government that has new 
ideas and new strategies and which helps them adapt to changing 
times. Our policy on defence conversion is a clear example of 
how a Liberal government will respond to the needs of 
Canadians in the 1990s''.
<P>
	When we look at, listen to and read what the Liberals were 
saying when they were the Official Opposition as opposed to 
what they are not doing now that they are in power, it is clear that 
they have two languages: one for the left side of their mouths 
and another for the right side.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois's policy on conversion takes into account 
the importance of the armament industry and its structural 
impact on the economy. The Bloc Quebecois proposed during 
the last election campaign and fervently hopes that the federal 
government will take steps to facilitate the defence industry 
conversion process. Such a program is necessary and must be 
implemented as soon as possible.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois doubts that the Liberal government will 
pursue a wide-ranging conversion policy. The EH-101 
helicopter episode is revealing in this regard and clearly shows 
that the Liberal government does not intend to pursue a 
comprehensive strategy on this. It was a perfect opportunity for 
this government to show its true intentions in this area, but it 
preferred to single out the helicopter program, without a 
conversion program in return.
<P>
	Then how can we launch such a program? Professors 
Bélanger, Fournier and Desbiens, of the defence industry 
conversion research group at the Université du Québec in 
Montreal, did some research and came to the conclusion that a 
very large number of defence workers live in Montreal, a region 
where they conducted a more in-depth study on the effects of 
non-conversion.
<P>
	The Montreal region is the main defence industry centre in 
Quebec. More than 500 defence companies are located there and 
the total value of goods and equipment delivered amounts to a 
little over $2.1 billion. The region alone generates 63 per cent of 
defence economic activity in Quebec and accounts for 26 per 
cent of the Canadian market. The employment picture shows 
what is happening.
<P>
	My time has expired, even though I would have liked to go on. 
I will continue at the next opportunity. I would just like to say 
that, on this whole issue of industry conversion, many jobs are at 
stake and there is an urgent need to intervene.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order! It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier-Public Works; 
the hon. member for Louis-Hébert-Quebec City Airport; the 
hon. member for MacKenzie-Grain Transportation.
<P>
	Are there questions or comments?
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the hon. member 
for Beauharnois-Salaberry had to say. He actually said a lot 
that I agree with. He gave us some good figures on conversion.
<P>
	This is a legitimate question, it is not posturing but I am not 
precisely sure whether he meant that the defence review should 
look at conversion or whether he felt we had precluded 
conversion from being considered. I can assure him that is not 
the case. Nothing is being left out of the review. Nothing is 
sacred and nothing is to be left untouched with respect to 
considerations.
<P>
	Also, I gather more from the tone than the statement of what 
the hon. member said about the decision on the EH-101 
helicopters, and of course I am making an oblique reference to 
the decision of the government to cancel the project, but my 
understanding was that his party was in favour of cancelling the 
project as well.
<P>
	If the hon. member could clarify these two points I would be 
delighted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to answer the question raised by my colleague. Of 
course, the Bloc Quebecois agreed 100 per cent with the 
cancellation of the helicopter contract, except that it was only 
half done. Not only should they have cancelled the helicopter 
contract but they also should have recovered the money that was 
to be invested in it and put it in an industrial conversion fund. I 
blame the government for not doing that part of the job. It was 
only half done.
<P>
	This second part could have redirected all the money to be 
saved on the manufacture and purchase of the helicopters-over 
$5 billion. If this $5 or $6 billion had been invested in 
converting military companies, we could have stopped the 
hemorrhage that is going on right now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1525"> 1525 </A></B>
<P>
	I take the example of the Expro plant in my riding. It makes 
powder and shells. Not so long ago, the Expro plant had over 
a thousand workers, but with the end of the cold war, Expro's 
orders from the defence department dropped drastically. Now 
this plant has only 400 employees. I give you this example 
because I know that plant particularly well, since it is in my 
riding, but the same danger threatens some 60,000 workers in 
these military plants throughout Quebec, over 60,000 if we 
consider all of Canada.
<P>
	The Liberals only did half the job when they cancelled the 
helicopter contract because they did not take the money that 
should have come back to them and invest it in industrial 
conversion.
<P>
	There was a second part to the question, but I spent so much 
time on the first that I forgot the second. I do not know if my 
colleague-Oh yes! It has come back to me, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	The whole issue of industrial conversion should probably be 
discussed by the defence committee and I hope that we will not 
have to discuss it as well in the joint committee that you want to 
set up, because that would further prolong the debate-there 
would be no end to it. Workers in our factories are now waiting 
for a conversion program before they are unemployed. That is 
the threat hanging over us.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Workers in 
military plants who are in danger of losing their jobs tomorrow 
morning do not want to hear about setting up a joint committee 
that will report in six months or a year or two. The government 
should take a position before then. It is urgent. Enough 
discussion-let us act.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
remarks will deal with disparities between Quebec and other 
parts of Canada.
<P>
	Quebec is one of the most disadvantaged areas in terms of 
economic benefits from National Defence contracts. Quebec's 
per capita share of defence spending is clearly below average. 
The following figures speak for themselves. An internal 
document from the Department of National Defence indicates 
that per capita spending for 1990-91 was $1,217 in Nova Scotia, 
this province ranking first, followed by New Brunswick in 
second place with $1,050, while Quebec ranked sixth, with a per 
capita share of defence spending of only $316.
<P>
	Updated data for fiscal year 1992-93 indicate that the trends 
observed with regard to inequities experienced by Quebec in 
terms of economic distribution have worsened. The latest 
figures from National Defence, provided by the Minister of 
National Defence himself when he met with parliamentarians on 
February 10, confirm that Quebec's share of benefits has shrunk 
considerably. Actually, 16 per cent of the benefits go to Quebec, 
while  Ontario gets 36 per cent, the Atlantic provinces, 16 per 
cent like Quebec, and Western provinces, 20 per cent.
<P>
	Defence spending includes various expenditures. There are 
infrastructure expenditures, personnel expenditures, equipment 
expenditures as well as procurement and services expenditures. 
In terms of personnel expenditures alone, with 25.4 per cent of 
the population of Canada living on its territory, Quebec received 
only $773 million in benefits in 1990-91, as compared to $1,821 
million for Ontario with 36.6 per cent of the population. Even 
Nova Scotia got more than Quebec, namely $793 million.
<P>
	In 1992, the Department of National Defence conducted an 
in-house assessment of the extent to which Quebec was 
receiving its fair share of certain types of defence expenditures. 
This assessment demonstrated how unfairly Quebec was treated 
by the federal government with regard to defence spending as a 
percentage of Canada's GDP. Inequities were found under the 
following budget items: construction, research and 
development, operations and maintenance, Reserves and 
Cadets-to supply and equip the cadets-overall defence 
spending, personnel costs, Regular Force, civilian personnel. In 
all these areas, Quebec was clearly at a disadvantage.
<P>
	As far as defence infrastructure in Canada is concerned, it 
should be pointed out that Quebec's share represents only 13 per 
cent of the value of the federal government's defence 
installations, as compared to 34 per cent for the Western 
provinces, 27 per cent for the Maritime provinces and 26 per 
cent for Ontario. To remedy the situation, the Canadian 
government and the Department of National Defence, under 
Marcel Masse, former Conservative Minister of National 
Defence, had developed a major infrastructure modernization 
program for Quebec, building drill halls here and these at great 
cost. Capital expenditures apparently exceeded $100 million.
<P>
	These projects have raised Quebec's share of funds allocated 
to construction up to 19.2 per cent of the total amount of this 
budget item. However, they are now put in jeopardy in the short 
term by the upcoming budget, which will be tabled on February 
22 as we all know. It is important that Quebec remain a priority 
because it is clearly disadvantaged with regard to government 
expenditures in those areas.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Technically, Quebec has four large military bases, which 
provide jobs for thousands of people: Valcartier, 6,085 
employees; Montreal, 3,922; Saint-Jean, 2,031; and Bagotville, 
1,782.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence remains a major 
employer in Quebec with more than 13,820 employees listed on 
these four bases. Though the numbers are substantial, we must 
not forget that comparatively speaking, Quebec is not getting its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1526"> 1526 </A></B>
<P>
fair share, and we object to any cuts at the expense of Quebec's 
economy.
<P>
	Another aspect of the regional economic impact of defence 
procurement contracts is the issue of interprovincial trade in the 
arms production sector in Canada.
<P>
	John Treddenick, an economist with the Royal Military 
College in Kingston, looked into this subject and according to 
his study, Quebec performed well on direct contracts with the 
Department of National Defence but was getting less than its 
share of economic spin-offs, increasingly.
<P>
	The potential for absorbing defence contracts into the 
economy in Quebec is not the same as in Ontario. The big winner 
in interprovincial sub-contracting is Ontario, because it is able 
to get major sub-contracts from projects managed in other 
provinces. In this respect, it occupies a unique position 
compared with all Canadian provinces, with a defence complex 
that far outweights the size of its direct contracts from the 
Department of National Defence.
<P>
	However, Quebec's defence production is still substantial. 
The Quebec economy, and especially the economy of the 
Montreal area, is very dependent on National Defence contracts, 
as was pointed out repeatedly by Professor Yves Bélanger at the 
University of Quebec in Montreal, who is an expert on these 
issues. Consequently, an industrial conversion strategy must be 
prepared as soon as possible.
<P>
	At this stage, we should not have a special debate on National 
Defence policy until the government has released its white 
paper. This position applies both to the issue of downsizing in 
military bases and training centres for peacekeepers. In fact, 
there are several reasons why the latter initiative should not be 
supported by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	First, it is unrealistic to believe that countries from all over 
the world would come to train in these centres. Who is going to 
pay the cost of bringing international troops and their equipment 
over here? The UN does not have the resources to pay for all 
that.
<P>
	Second, it is a fact that Canadian peacekeepers are among the 
best trained in the world. Why bother setting up a training 
centre, when our troops already receive excellent training at 
existing bases.
<P>
	Third, it would be dishonest and hypocritical to let the public 
think that creating training centres would not generate 
additional costs for the Canadian government. How can we tell 
people we are cutting back on defence spending, and at the same 
time keep military bases open to train peacekeepers? This does 
not make sense, it is misleading and the Bloc Quebec cannot 
support such proposals.
<P>
	What is my party's position? We received a mandate from the 
people of Quebec to fight existing inequities and ensure that 
Quebec gets its fair share.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened attentively to what my colleague had to say. 
Although I was not in the House all the time because I had to 
take a telephone call, I was listening in the lobby. I agree with a 
lot of things he had to say; he made some very good points.
<P>
	Looking at the aspect of the defence policy review to which he 
made reference, I am assuming he would be interested in the 
conversion policy. One thing the defence policy review will 
more than likely look at is the subject of conversion because it is 
an ongoing matter at the end of the cold war. The U.K. is doing 
it. The United States is doing it. No matter what happens we 
have to look at that opinion. The policy review is an excellent 
time to do it with expert witnesses.
<P>
	If the hon. member's party is so big on conversion surely it 
would not want to stand in the way of a policy review taking 
place purely because of the mechanism of the standing 
committee. That is almost a technicality in a way. Surely he 
would look at the bigger subject and have a policy review so that 
policies that would be beneficial to his constituency could be 
looked at in a very positive sense.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank my colleague for his words. I think that we do not need to 
set up a joint committee to decide on conversion policy. I 
remember very well during the election seeing programs of 
different political parties which already dealt with the subject. 
As my fellow member of the Bloc Quebecois just said, I think 
that at some point the government will have to act and shoulder 
its responsibilities.
<P>
	Now they seem to want to have us discuss all sorts of subjects 
in the name of a so-called democratization of the House, but one 
thing is certain: the government was elected to govern and not 
only to consult.
<P>
	I think that at this stage it would be advisable for our duly 
elected government to get to work and make the decisions it 
must make so that Canada can finally have a policy which 
reflects the needs of the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate my hon. colleague who just spoke. I think he 
brought up a very important point, namely the distribution of 
funds and Quebec's share of DND funding. The perception is 
that Quebec is very well served in this regard. Of course, we 
want to hold on to the jobs we have and of course, we willingly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1527"> 1527 </A></B>
<P>
accept the benefits that come with these jobs. This debate gives 
us  an opportunity to demonstrate once again how Quebec is not 
getting its fair share.
<P>
	I believe my hon. colleague said that Quebec has only about 
15 per cent of the jobs in the industry, whereas we account for 23 
or 24 per cent of the country's population. He mentioned that the 
province has only 13 per cent of all military infrastructures and 
is allocated only 15.8 per cent of DND's overall budget. This is a 
very important consideration for us.
<P>
	Disregarding for the moment the historic injustice of which 
we are the victims, I think the hon. member put his finger 
squarely on the problem, namely that the government is trying to 
gain some time by holding debates-and this one is particularly 
untimely and premature since the Department of Foreign Affairs 
has not yet decided what role the Department of National 
Defence will be called on to play in international policy.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would just like to say that I agree completely with 
my hon. colleague about the proposed committee. We already 
have a perfectly adequate national defence committee. To set up 
a joint committee with senators would be a waste of time. The 
time has come to take action. The government must make some 
decisions. That is what it was elected to do. So, it should act and 
stop setting up committees.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The Chair recognizes 
the hon. member for Shefford, but very briefly, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Thank you for your courtesy, Madam 
Speaker. At the risk of repeating myself, I would simply like to 
add that we, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, were elected to 
ensure that Quebec is not merely a province on the receiving end 
of social assistance and unemployment insurance. On every 
issue and in every area of federal jurisdiction, we will ensure 
that Quebec gets everything it has coming to it. Finally, I would 
just like to say that in the past, Quebec did not get its fair share 
and the time has come to put things right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in 
this important debate examining the future of Canada's defence 
policy both in Canada and abroad. The proposed review is most 
timely because Canada, along with other nations, has come to 
recognize that the end of the cold war requires us to rethink the 
nature and purpose of our military forces.
<P>
	I add that the timeliness of the debate is significant for 
another more broadly defined reason. The end of the cold war is 
not only significant for bringing about change in the defence 
agenda but in our political agenda as well. Not only is the 
military's role a broad issue, but as I said it has a role at home. 
We need to protect the perimeters of our country, but we must 
consider the military in terms of helping those in need at home.
<P>
	Having said that, the end of the cold war has not brought a 
sudden end to the need of our military; quite the contrary. 
However our focus and priorities must shift in a number of 
policy areas. In other places, in other committees, we are in the 
process of redefining how government will better assist the 
citizens it has been elected to serve. In terms of our military we 
are redefining how we can better serve the people of our own 
country, as well as the people of other nations who are in need of 
its services.
<P>
	Internationally the focus on peacekeeping training befits 
changes now occurring at the global level. Emphasis has shifted 
from one of conflict to conflict resolution. Such change is both 
welcome and necessary in light of changes happening within 
society at large.
<P>
	Citizens both within and beyond Canada's borders now call 
for greater peace and justice. Greater emphasis is placed on 
democracy and human rights. When the cold war ceased to 
dominate the focus of international relations that change 
brought great hope that our nation would achieve a strengthened 
spirit built on international co-operation and collaboration.
<P>
	While we have seen a relaxing of political tensions in some 
parts of the globe, there are still far too many regions where 
military conflict is intrinsic, a way of life for people in far too 
many regions. We still see countries attempting to meet political 
agendas with military force. This government's plan to 
strengthen our leadership role in peacekeeping and to commit to 
Canadian efforts to improve the UN's policies on peacekeeping 
could not come at a more necessary stage in our history.
<P>
	It is right for Canada to fulfil the roles of peace enforcement, 
peace establishment, peace restoration and peace building. I 
would add to this list the more recent dimension of humanitarian 
aid protection. Such humanitarian intervention enables aid 
convoys to reach those people in dire need of assistance. Few 
can argue about the benefit of such intervention given the 
number of lives saved by this action.
<P>
	It is time to reach consensus on the debate surrounding our 
military and restore our focus to the original UN mandate 
penned in its charter in 1945 to be a major force for international 
order and stability.
<P>
	I would add that it is not only important for us to examine the 
changing role of our military on the national and international 
levels. We must also determine how such change should be 
reflected domestically.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	We must continue to train troops to be prepared for any kind 
of military encounter along with training for peacekeeping 
initiatives. We need to strike a balance between maintaining 
armed forces to protect ourselves and participating in 
international peace operations. I believe the time has come for 
us to put forward an expanded role for our Department of 
National Defence, one that is not restricted to military 
operations alone  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1528"> 1528 </A></B>
<P>
since this focus fails to reflect the new reality of the 
interdependence of foreign and domestic affairs.
<P>
	Canada has one of the best regarded military forces in the 
world in no small part because of the training we provide our 
troops. We need to capitalize on this capability more often and 
deliver this training to the international community. While we 
do much of this now, we have the capacity to do more.
<P>
	CFB Gagetown is the largest military base in Canada by land 
mass and is situated in my riding of 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury. As a combat training centre, 
Gagetown is a land force centre for excellence dedicated to the 
training of world class soldiers and leaders. Training is 
conducted within the framework of combined arms operations 
up to the battle group level. The base provides a most 
sophisticated and realistic simulation training environment and 
employs some of the most expert instructors in this field.
<P>
	The base is responsible for conducting the most advanced 
courses for the infantry, artillery and armour elements of land 
force command and the training of troops that have served in one 
or more peacekeeping missions. The Royal Canadian Regiment 
stationed at CFB Gagetown participated in two missions within 
a two year period: Cyprus from October 1991 until April 1992; 
and the former Yugoslavia from November 1992 to May 1993. 
In addition there are always a number of soldiers from CFB 
Gagetown serving with the UN in a variety of peacekeeping 
missions. The experience and leadership gained while training 
at CFB Gagetown has had a significant impact on the success of 
Canadian troops during peacekeeping missions over past 
decades.
<P>
	Further members of the reserve force totalling some 2,000 for 
the Atlantic region and trained at Gagetown have served in 
peacekeeping missions. As well reserve soldiers provide a 
valuable resource for emergencies because they are able to work 
along with the regular force personnel in various situations. The 
nature of reserve training is an area we may wish to explore in 
order to further evolve the role of our military in training on the 
international stage.
<P>
	We also need to explore options for using our military 
personnel and military facilities for non-military purposes. Too 
often we hear of the need for better equipment and increased 
personnel in search and rescue. Were military resources more 
easily available to assist organizations like the RCMP and EMO 
the trauma and agony suffered by individuals and in many cases 
entire families and communities would be greatly reduced.
<P>
	We also need to explore what roles military personnel and 
their facilities can play in non-military employment and 
training programs. As I mentioned in a statement earlier this 
week during members statements, the Department of National 
Defence has recently engaged in a co-operative initiative with 
New Brunswick's Department of Advanced Education and 
Labour to pilot an occupational and lifeskills training project.
<P>
	Just Monday of this week 30 unemployed New Brunswickers 
between the ages of 17 and 24 began a 20 week program of 
military lifeskills and occupational training and job experience 
at CFB Gagetown. For the participants selected from youth 
strategy, aboriginal peoples and social assistance programs, the 
combination of occupational and lifeskills training will help 
young unemployed New Brunswickers build new futures.
<P>
	There is more at stake in such an initiative than just training 
and employing 30 individuals. Although I do not mean to 
diminish the significance of that, in this period of fiscal restraint 
it is important to consider the financial benefits of providing 
training programs in this manner. Since the Canadian forces 
provide the training facilities and instructors for the project in 
New Brunswick, the people, space, materials and facilities are 
readily available. It strikes me that this amounts to a creative 
arrangement for both federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	We must also consider how our military can contribute to 
environmental protection and clean-up and to border patrol, 
particularly as it relates to the north and the sea. This places new 
and increased demands on our military such that it moves the 
forces' agenda beyond just that of defending the country.
<P>
	As we consider our nation's place in the global community we 
must remind ourselves that Canada has had a positive and well 
established international reputation for decades. We have been 
admired and emulated by countries around the globe. We want to 
continue to set examples for other nations. We can do this by 
redefining our military role to better reflect the social changes 
occurring at the international level. In many respects we are not 
only just capable of setting such examples, we are also obliged 
to do so.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	When I first arrived in Ottawa to represent the people of 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury I was immediately struck by the 
cultural diversity represented in this House. I have always been 
proud of Canada's efforts to give equal recognition to all 
cultures living within our borders. This pride was reinforced 
when I realized the reality of the vision.
<P>
	We are citizens of the world living in one country. Within our 
very own borders we know and represent a multitude of cultures 
found around the world. Unlike the United States we do not 
ascribe to a melting pot approach where people must give up 
their culture; we encourage individuality and uniqueness. Such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1529"> 1529 </A></B>
<P>
a philosophy and approach puts us in the unique position to 
understand the various interests and cultures of the world.
<P>
	In our understanding of just how wonderful such diversity 
truly is, we are in the best of all positions to help others when 
they are faced with some form or level of forceful conflict. The 
diversity within our borders has not only taught us to be a 
compassionate and caring society; it has taught us about the 
many ways of life embraced by many people. We can use our 
own enlightenment not only as an advantage to ourselves, but 
also as an advantage for helping others in need of conflict 
resolution.
<P>
	I am fully aware that our desire to accommodate a variety of 
cultures may be controversial and may need government support 
from time to time. However that should not mean that we do not 
want that diversity.
<P>
	We can use this knowledge and respect. In fact I believe we 
owe it to the international community to assist the United 
Nations in its mission for promoting world peace. Our 
knowledge of ethnic diversity combined with our excellent 
military training and knowledge places us in an enviable and 
more than capable position to help achieve global stability.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to add that the people of 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury are peaceful people who are 
proud New Brunswickers and Canadians. This pride is not just 
defined by the integrity and quality of life at the community 
level, but is further defined by the international reputation we 
know ourselves to possess around the world.
<P>
	People recognize that this positive image carries with it 
certain obligations and responsibilities we must be willing to 
extend to those in need. As a country we cannot make excuses 
for ourselves and stay away from the fray. We are far too socially 
aware to bury our heads in the sand and hope that volatile 
situations will somehow resolve themselves, preferably in a 
quiet fashion.
<P>
	In light of the need for us to examine and redefine Canada's 
military, I support the call for the appointment of a special joint 
committee comprised of members of the Senate and of the 
House of Commons to review Canada's defence policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague and I 
totally agree that changing international circumstances demand 
that we diversify the role of our armed forces and, hence, that we 
expand the types of training of our military personnel.
<P>
	My colleague was right in pointing out the role played by the 
Canadian Forces in humanitarian aid. As a Quebecer, I could 
also point out that they had an opportunity to show a total 
control of the situation during the Oka crisis.
<P>
	I would like to stress the fact that during the two first wars, 
our forces were able to show their real capability and, in the last 
few years, they have won the admiration of the world in peace 
missions.
<P>
	I would like to give my personal testimony to my colleague. I 
was in Belgium during the liberation of some Belgium cities by 
the Canadian army. I was also in Katanga, now Zaire, in 1963, 
when the Canadian Forces took part in a UN mission of 
transition that is quite forgotten now in Katanga. So I had the 
opportunity to admire the Canadian Forces both in their military 
role and their humanitarian role.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	What I would like to stress is that we should not forget in this 
diversification that eternal peace is not guaranteed. Nothing 
proves that our role will ever be limited to separating warring 
parties or bringing humanitarian aid. Nothing proves that we 
will not be dragged into conflicts of direct concern to us.
<P>
	The end of the cold war is certainly a good thing, but, though I 
am neither a soldier nor a strategist, I do not feel that the present 
situation in Russia is more reassuring than the situation that 
existed in the former USSR. There are other potential conflicts 
in which we could be directly involved. The role we should 
assign to the bases, in order not to close them, should continue to 
be partly military in addition to the new responsibility, with 
which I fully agree, of diversified humanitarian help that they 
should be taking over.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member is this: Does he not agree 
with me that we should continue to consider the strictly military 
role of defence of the territory and participation in democratic 
alliances involved in possible conflicts, besides this new and 
purely humanitarian role?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague and appreciate his intervention. 
The many issues brought forward merely point to the need for a 
review.
<P>
	We mentioned our traditional defence role in terms of 
international conflict. We also mentioned humanitarian aid and 
the need to broaden training to include other kinds of activities. I 
concur on all those points and in fact use that as a strong 
argument for having this review and striking this joint 
committee.
<P>
	I also welcome the opportunity to respond by saying we have 
to be more focused. We have to be more strategic in where we 
task troops to participate by virtue of the changing nature of our 
own military force and the department.
<P>
	I would also like to speak for a second on the broadening of 
training. I did not mean to suggest it would just be a broadening 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1530"> 1530 </A></B>
<P>
of military training that would be available, but rather a general 
broadening of training including other kinds of training. We all 
recognize there is a task force on human resources development 
that is  looking for places for training. It strikes me that these 
facilities are one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to commend my colleague for his remarks and his interest in this 
very specific task we are taking on.
<P>
	We have heard many interventions here in the last number of 
weeks regarding our defence policy as it stands, our 
peacekeeping role and the costs that of course are always 
involved in any major undertaking we get into in this country, be 
it military or anything else.
<P>
	I have my views, as does everyone else, on what the role of the 
military is in the future of our country. There are those in society 
as I said in my speech who perhaps do not believe we need any 
participation. Then there are those who believe we should spend 
the whole budget on it.
<P>
	I assume somewhere down the line we are going to have to 
make a decision as to what our future is going to be in this area. 
There are many situations out there. In the peacekeeping roles 
we are involved in today the majority of our troops are land 
forces. We have a navy and an air force. I just want to ask the 
hon. member his view on what he sees coming out of the 
machine at the end of the day when we have completed this study 
and the government makes its decisions. What does he see from 
his constituency and from his national perspective as to where 
we should be going.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I think the important feature in terms of this review 
may very well be the review itself in that in the nature that it is 
proposed, there was I assume broad consultation. I heard some 
debate as to the nature of that broad consultation but I really 
believe, perhaps more than with other programs, that the 
national defence policy of a nation requires significant public 
support, public understanding, sympathy and so on.
<P>
	I believe that support depends on a sense among Canadians 
that they have the opportunity to have a say as to what the 
country is doing in those terms.
<P>
	More than anything else I think what we will have at the end of 
the day is a concise, thoughtful, national policy that Canadians 
can understand with clarity, that Canadians can help in fact 
create through the broad consultation that will take place in the 
joint committee.
<P>
	There has been, particularly in the international tasks that 
have been engaged in, some confusion as to objectives and the 
nature of missions and so on. I really believe if nothing else at 
the end of the day we will have a larger understanding of what it 
is that our troops are sent out to do.
<P>
	I think that is vitally important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be very fast with this. The hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury spoke about the training program 
at Gagetown with the government of New Brunswick.
<P>
	Could he elaborate for a couple of minutes on that because 
that is a very interesting program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this program is a co-operative initiative between 
national defence and the department of advanced education and 
labour in Fredericton, essentially using the facilities, the trained 
personnel, instructors at CFB Gagetown, material, equipment 
and various people. There was a province-wide advertisement 
placed and a number of applications sent in. Because it is a pilot 
project this one is limited to 30 but the intention is to see this 
program grow.
<P>
	There is a potential at the end of a 20-week program to 
become engaged in national defence itself. Also, because of the 
nature of some of the training available through the Department 
of National Defence, these individuals are trained in life skills, 
employment seeking skills, basic self-confidence objectives. 
Either way it is a win-win situation for both national defence 
and the provincial government in Fredericton.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have not had the opportunity to congratulate 
you on your appointment to the chair. We wish you well. I know 
you will do a very fine job.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity in this debate to thank my 
constituents for my re-election and for supporting me over the 
years the way they have. We have the largest county in the 
province of Ontario. In addition to that in my riding we have a 
large part of the district of Nipissing.
<P>
	I live three miles from the base gate in Petawawa township. 
That base has been in the forefront of peacekeeping activities 
since day one. The families of the military and the civilian 
community have been rubbing shoulders. They get along well 
together. They play together. They work together. They study 
together and they plan together.
<P>
	There is a very good civilian-military relationship throughout 
the entire community. That is very important. It is very 
important that our civilian community support our Canadian 
Armed Forces. This defence policy we are talking about today is 
undoubtedly in the long run going to mean they will be facing 
challenges of great cultural differences wherever they go in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1531"> 1531 </A></B>
<P>
world. They will be facing great differences in religious beliefs 
and customs wherever they go.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	It is not easy for personnel in the Canadian forces to be sent to 
any trouble spot on the face of the earth. They are ready to go, 
they are professionals, but there will be accidents along the way. 
When there are accidents we have to support them and when 
they do an excellent job we support them. If we do not do that 
then I would suggest to everybody that we are not really living 
up to that great promise we make on November 11 as we stand 
around the cenotaphs and say: ``We will remember them''.
<P>
	Every soldier who goes abroad to do work on behalf of 
Canada, every soldier who works for this country has the same 
dedication to this nation and to his or her duty as those who have 
gone before them. We wish them well.
<P>
	As we talk about Canada's defence policy in the few months 
ahead it is going to be very important that we consult those 
people as well as the Canadian public at large.
<P>
	You cannot have a debate such as this on Canada's defence 
policy and have an inward look at it. Defence policy and foreign 
affairs policy automatically mean that we are not only looking at 
things in a national perspective here at home but we are looking 
at the world as an international community and we are going to 
work with them.
<P>
	We must be humanitarian in our view of the world. We must 
be realistic. There is no way we can face the situations in this 
world today without being professional. Our Canadian Armed 
Forces are professional. There is a great visiting back and forth 
between Gagetown and Petawawa. I want to thank my hon. 
colleague from the Gagetown area for the speech he delivered 
this afternoon. He obviously has a very good feel for his 
constituents in the military community. It is very important to 
have that feeling on the floor of this House as we talk about 
defence policy and foreign policy for this great nation of ours.
<P>
	There was a great deal of comment this afternoon about the 
defence committee. I cannot believe some of the comments I 
have heard. One would almost think that a standing committee 
around this place was something new. Standing committees 
have been going for decades. Standing committees have been 
meeting some of the best professional witnesses, the 
professional community and organizations anywhere in the 
world to come before a parliamentary committee. What is 
democracy all about? When a government is elected, does that 
government make decisions without consulting people along the 
way?
<P>
	We just finished nine years of a government of that kind. It 
said it was consulting people all the time but it very seldom did. 
I ask the question: Where is it today? The leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois sat right here in the front row on this side of the 
House under the previous government. It is probably a good 
thing that he changed parties or he would not be in the House 
today.
<P>
	We talk about standing committees of the House of Commons. 
My goodness, my own county council back home has about 35 or 
36 very respected people on it. They have their committees for 
local government and they do a fantastic job. You save yourself 
a lot of heartache and trouble in the future. At least you have a 
feel for what is out there. You have some expert advice.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	We in our capacity as individual members in this House of 
Commons are not all experts. We cannot stand in our place, and I 
defy any members of the opposition parties to stand in their 
place, and say that we know it all, we do not have to talk to 
anybody. That is not the way a good government operates.
<P>
	A good government works with the people of the nation. It 
takes advice from the people of the nation. There are cases 
where you have to stand up and be counted because there is no 
real consensus of opinion. It is called leadership.
<P>
	You cannot have a democracy if you do not have leadership. 
Sometimes you have to make those tough decisions but make 
them we must. That is why we are here. That is why people are 
paying us to be here.
<P>
	We have played a great role in peacekeeping in support of the 
UN and we have heard a great deal about that today. However let 
us remember that when we are talking about those two things 
and when we are talking about a defence policy, what we have 
been doing in recent years in the international community as 
well as at home has been born out of our participation in two 
major world wars and the League of Nations in between those 
two world wars.
<P>
	The Korean war came as the really first test of the United 
Nations. Was it going to stand up and be counted? Were the 
nations that belonged to the UN going to stand up and be counted 
or were they going to take the side step as happened to many 
nations that were members of the League of Nations between the 
two world wars?
<P>
	It is very important that we continue as a nation to be good 
negotiators. It is important in this community that we have a 
good Canadian Armed Forces that has the ability and the 
capacity to operate in the international scene and to face all 
kinds of disasters and challenges. People who are in the forces 
joined because they know that is what their challenge is. They 
love the life they are in.
<P>
	Canada played a major role in the founding of the United 
Nations after World War II. In that respect, I suppose we built 
some of our defence policy at that time. If we were going to 
promote the United Nations and be a member of the United 
Nations from its founding day onward, we had to support it. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1532"> 1532 </A></B>
<P>
meant at times that we had to support them in settling 
international conflicts.
<P>
	If we do not take that attitude then we not only let ourselves 
down, we let the United Nations down and we let the 
international community down. Worst of all, we let the peace 
forces throughout the world down and we are going to run into a 
major conflict. There are all kinds of people out there looking 
for a scrap these days.
<P>
	Canada played a major role in the founding of NATO, the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Lester B. Pearson, St. 
Laurent and King before him played a major role in the NATO 
organization. We know very well that if it had not been for the 
NATO forces sitting there ready to do battle, ready to face the 
Warsaw pact head on, if it had not been for trying to promote a 
balance of power in the world in those days, and there is no 
question in my mind as a student of history, we would have run 
into another major conflict in the world.
<P>
	What would have happened in a nuclear arms war? We know 
the answer to that. I suppose we do not want to believe the reality 
of it but the potential was there. If we do not meet those 
challenges of today, if we do not have a good foreign policy for 
Canada and if we do not have a good defence policy for this 
country, I maintain that we will not be doing our responsible job 
as a nation in the international community nor will we be doing a 
good job for our own people right here in our beloved nation of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	The Ogdensburg agreement of 1940 signed by Mackenzie 
King and President Roosevelt is a good example of the kind of 
international responsibility that we participated in during the 
second world war.
<P>
	The North American air defence was another example of 
protecting Canada at the same time as helping to protect other 
nations.
<P>
	Canada has always believed very strongly in multinational 
defence operations. Here with a population of 26.5 million or 
whatever we have today we could not begin to defend our 
borders, our coastal waters and our far north if we were not 
members of an international defence alliance. That was the real 
basis of NATO. That is where we must maintain our relations 
with other countries in the world.
<P>
	Canada is a respected country around the world and that is 
why we can work with other countries in keeping the peace and 
keeping small battles down to a small roar instead of a big roar.
<P>
	We were very influential in the founding and the ongoing 
activities of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in 
Europe. That too is part of our defence organization because if 
we did not promote it we would not be promoting the well-being 
in the international community of those involved in that 
organization.
<P>
	During the cold war what happened? The cold war was almost 
a battle to see who would go broke first. Military equipment and 
new technology cost so much and so dearly that it was a matter 
of who put the most into it, who had the best tax base and not 
who could win a war but who could sustain the cold war the 
longest. We know that the Soviet Union went broke first, but in 
doing so it certainly put the United States into a healthy debt 
situation today. We know what our own situation is like here in 
Canada.
<P>
	The real basis of a defence policy is not just to get together at 
home and form a defence policy, but to get along with our 
neighbours and get along with the world community at large. 
That demands some expertise and some professionalism.
<P>
	I would stack the members of our Canadian forces up against 
any diplomatic organization in the world. We think about them 
as fighting people. They are ready to do that. They are good 
soldiers but they are also good negotiators because sometimes 
they find themselves in the middle of things when they have to 
negotiate or talk to the enemy or to try to bring parties together 
under peaceful conditions.
<P>
	I always say to members of our Canadian forces that not only 
are they good soldiers, they are good diplomats. They may not 
like my third definition for them but they are also good 
politicians because it takes that kind of leadership, that kind of 
negotiating skills that one requires in politics. We need that in 
the international community today. Our soldiers need that and 
our professionals need it when they go abroad.
<P>
	World problems did not go away with the ending of the cold 
war. There are some people who think they did. We are only 
kidding ourselves if we believe that. Look at what has happened 
in the former Yugoslavia. We call it a humane world. We think 
that parts of the world have been here so long that today they are 
very human and realistic in their outlook. What we have seen in 
the former Yugoslavia is a good example of what took place in 
the dark ages when there were wars among tribes, et cetera.
<P>
	Somalia is another good example of a nation divided within 
itself, fighting within itself and starving its people into doing 
what the military leaders wanted them to do or the local leaders 
wanted them to do. It is just a terrible situation.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	Our defence policy is going to have to be-and I state this in 
the strongest, sincerest terms-such that our numbers in our 
Canadian forces are going to have to stay at a healthy level at 
which we can carry out our foreign policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1533"> 1533 </A></B>
<P>
	If our forces are reduced to levels at which we really cannot 
have an effect on the international community, if we really 
cannot carry out our duties as effective peacekeepers, if we 
cannot really carry out our duties to help the United Nations in 
major challenges that come along, then we will not be playing 
our role and our foreign policy will not be in place. Our 
Canadian forces are a large part of the foreign policy of Canada.
<P>
	Questions have been asked across the floor of the House today 
of why we do not bring in a white paper now, why do we go to all 
this trouble of interviewing people and having hearings from 
experts, specialists and our Canadian forces personnel, and why 
do we not just bring in a white paper and table it and then have a 
debate.
<P>
	The last government, the Tory government that we had 
between 1984 and 1993, tried that out for size. The Tories 
brought in a white paper. Where is it today? What part of that 
white paper is valid today? Where would our nuclear 
submarines be today? We would have spent billions of dollars 
under that white paper that was not properly thought out before 
it was tabled in this House of Commons.
<P>
	That is not the way this government is going to operate. This 
government is going to operate in a responsible manner in which 
we know what we are talking about before we take off on the run 
with some white paper. That is going to be a very important 
document.
<P>
	We write our white paper after we put our policy together. Our 
policy means that we understand what the challenges out there 
really are. Our white paper should tell us that we are ready to 
face those challenges. It should provide for the changing 
conditions out there.
<P>
	I want to go back to my home base of Petawawa. On many 
occasions when peacekeeping groups were put together they 
were brought into base Petawawa and there we had paint shops 
set up. Vehicles that were going to serve the UN were all painted 
white. Then they went through another shop and the big initials 
UN were painted on them. Then they were loaded on to 
Hercules, on to flat cars and were taken by ship and by plane to 
the problem area, wherever it was in the world. That is a great 
operation. It is run from square one.
<P>
	We can bring an element of troops in from Calgary, others 
from Gagetown, others from base Kingston and others from 
Chilliwack if they are needed. It is a national operation. They 
are brought all together. The professionalism of our forces, 
which is going to be very important to promote in our defence 
policy review, is that they can work together. They train together 
and they are training together with our allies. Certainly that is 
going to be part of a defence policy. We have to continue to train 
with the Americans, with the British, with the Germans and have 
them over here, people from the international community.
<P>
	As we know, we have the international community already 
training in Canada in places like Goose Bay and Shilo, Manitoba 
and in Alberta. It is a very good operation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the hon. 
member's time has more than expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the member on his speech.
<P>
	In 1988 I ran against the nuclear powered submarine issue 
because it was an issue that Canada was looking at Cadillacs 
when we did not need them. The helicopter deal that we had 
during this election campaign was again Canada looking at 
Cadillacs.
<P>
	The member stated that the Department of National Defence 
is going to undergo review. I applaud that because basically we 
have to look at what the role of the Department of National 
Defence is going to be in the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Canada has been called a boy scout in the international arena 
in which we have been solving problems and helping countries 
that need help. I am watching right now Russia, which went 
broke in the arms race, selling off at bargain basement prices all 
its arsenal to different countries that are willing to buy it. This 
obviously is going to be a problem in the future.
<P>
	If the hon. member could polish off his crystal ball a bit, after 
the review in this country where does he see our position on the 
UN and NATO in the international arena?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. In response, I have heard the term boy scout used a 
great deal when talking about our Canadian forces. All I can say 
is that if we had more boy scouts like them, we would have a lot 
less trouble in this world. The term is used in a friendly way, but 
Canadian forces have always proven themselves, proven that 
they have metal, that they have courage and that they do their 
jobs well.
<P>
	If it were not for the qualities of our Canadian forces to bring 
people together we would be in a lot worse position in this world 
today than we are. I applaud the forces for that.
<P>
	Where do we stand after the review? I know that the hon. 
member would not want me to upstage the committee that is 
carrying out the review of the forces, nor would I try to prejudge 
it at this stage of the hearings which just got under way this 
morning as we went on with the defence committee.
<P>
	I would like to say a word, though, about the UN. Not only is 
Canada having a defence review, but the time is long overdue 
when we should have a United Nations review. There is no better 
country in the world to lead up that review and to promote it than 
Canada because of  the role that we played and the support we 
have given to the United Nations over the years, plus the fact 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1534"> 1534 </A></B>
<P>
that Canada had such a major role in the founding of the United 
Nations to begin with.
<P>
	We have to watch its operations now and upgrade it as well 
because that will mean that however the United Nations is 
upgraded will have an effect on our own defence policy in the 
future. We want to get better decision making powers out there.
<P>
	Where do we see NATO? I can give my views on that at this 
stage. If we are going to continue to have major problems in the 
world and fires such as we have, then we are going to have to 
have a good alliance.
<P>
	It is very important that we keep up the NATO alliance and 
keep our relationships together in the event that we have to pull 
that organization together for a major crisis some day. We do not 
have to be out there flaunting great forces every day of the week, 
but we have to keep it together and keep a good base for strength 
there in the future.
<P>
	I read something the other day that I think is a good example 
as we start this defence review. It said that we should build on 
our fires, not on the ashes of our past.
<P>
	Some of the fires of the past are what we used to organize the 
United Nations. What this country had was statesmanship in 
those days to organize the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Let us not lose it, let us build on those fires of the past and keep 
them there for many years to come. That is the only way we are 
going to retain any level of peace in this old world that we live in 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West):</B> Madam Speaker, I also 
want to congratulate the hon. member for his speech this 
evening. I certainly can appreciate, as he does very well, the 
history and the role of our armed forces, coming as I do from an 
area in which there is certainly a very strong military 
component. Although I have no bases in the riding of Halifax 
West, many people who live in the riding work either at the 
Shearwater base or CFB Halifax or the dockyard or on the ships 
themselves.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	I am certainly very pleased the government will be reviewing 
the defence policy of our country. It is certainly long overdue. 
We do have a strong role to play in peacekeeping. In terms of our 
foreign policy it is very important that we play a role in the 
world and continue to do so because the world is facing many 
strains. The pressures on the world are intensifying in many 
ways because of poverty growth, population growth and 
environmental problems world-wide.
<P>
	How does hon. member see these intensifying pressures 
affecting the role of the military in future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member mentioned 
lastly the environmental problems. If we could prevent wars 
such as the one that occurred in the Persian gulf we would be 
doing that entire part of the  world a great favour. The fallout on 
the environment as a result of the Persian gulf war has been 
horrendous in that region of the world.
<P>
	This is why I want to emphasize today that our new defence 
policy and our foreign policy have to put great emphasis on 
keeping those types of battles down to a minimum and trying to 
settle them peacefully before they blow wide open. This is 
where I think the United Nations comes in. If the United Nations 
had had more power to move quickly and to act, maybe we could 
have prevented some of those disasters from happening in the 
manner in which they did.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that wherever our forces bases 
are located, the people tend to live in the surrounding 
communities. That is good because they get to know one another 
very well. They get to know some of their problems and they 
have a feel for the civilian community. As we go on with this 
defence review it is going to be very important to emphasize 
civilian military relations in those communities and in 
communities where we do not have a military presence at all.
<P>
	The hon. member and myself have a feel for it. Other 
members who spoke today have a feel for it, but those who live 
in communities that never see the military from one day to the 
next do not have the same feel for it. That is why this defence 
review is very important. That is why it is important the defence 
committee travel Canada to have an impact on those areas and to 
let them know what is going in the military community.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour of 
the motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to order made 
Tuesday, February 15, 1994, the recorded division stands 
deferred until three o'clock on Tuesday, February 22, 1994.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Shall I call it 6.30?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1535"> 1535 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PUBLICWORKS">PUBLIC WORKS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in late January media reports informed us that Public 
Works Canada had completed a preliminary study which 
proposed that the public service in Ottawa vacate up to 25 per 
cent of its downtown office space and move to outlying areas. 
This study was part, I am told, of a Tory legacy following a last 
minute, poorly thought out public service restructuring plan 
announced in June 1993.
<P>
	These media reports told us that the cost of the proposal would 
be approximately $175 million over 10 years, while the annual 
savings for moving to the suburbs are estimated at about $20 
million a year. One does not have to be an engineer or an atomic 
specialist to figure out that it will cost quite a bit. Over a matter 
of 10 years we will not even recover the cost of the moves.
<P>
	I am not saying the proposal is being implemented. I have 
been trying to get some information from the department on it 
and as of today I have not received any. That is why I am rising 
in my place today to bring this matter to public attention again. 
If the proposal were implemented, the equivalent of three 
buildings the size of L'Esplanade Laurier could be vacated in 
downtown Ottawa. Obviously this is a large office space 
component and could have a very detrimental effect on the 
downtown core of the national capital city.
<P>
	Media reports also suggest that the implementation of the 
proposal would involve the departure of 11,000 to 14,000 public 
servants from downtown Ottawa. I want to address the impact 
this could have and I want to talk about the spinoff effects the 
policy could have.
<P>
	For example, we all know a public service job generates about 
two or three other jobs in the service sector. This will have a 
damaging effect on small businesses in the area; it will make it 
very difficult for them to survive. The downtown core will suffer 
significantly because of the disparity between the actual 
requirements of businesses now and the possibility of them not 
being able to survive in the downtown area depleted of public 
servants.
<P>
	The current state of the real estate in my capital, the Ottawa 
community, is not that great that we want to make a proposal that 
would make it more difficult to exist. Local taxpayers have 
invested heavily in transportation infrastructure, including the 
OC Transpo transit way. It was built on the assumption that there  
would be and would continue to be a high level of employment 
in the centre of the city.
<P>
	Finally there is the green government concept, the 
environmental impact this would have if thousands of public 
servants begin to work in the outlying regions but live inside the 
Ottawa community. I wonder how many will switch to public 
transportation rather than use their cars and private means of 
transit. This will mean more vehicles on the road. It has been 
recognized that exhaust is the main source of air pollution in 
Ottawa. Therefore it would have a detrimental effect on our 
environment.
<P>
	When I first raised this matter in the House in my question on 
February 1, the minister of public works indicated that no 
decisions would be made on the matter-and I believe 
him-until there are wide consultations with members of 
Parliament as well as with the ministries of industry and of 
intergovernmental affairs.
<P>
	The minister's office also offered a briefing to me and my 
colleagues from the region on February 1. I indicated that in my 
mind a briefing should be given no later than February 15. 
Unfortunately as of today I must report that no date, in fact not 
even a timeframe, has been provided by the minister's office for 
this briefing.
<P>
	I raise this out of frustration at trying to understand what is 
going on in terms of this supposed interim study which would 
affect seriously the downtown core of my city.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
gladly answer my colleague's question and explain what the 
situation is. He raised a few points when he talked about his 
concern for the economic well-being of downtown Ottawa.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
assured him in the House in response to his question on February 
1, it is the intention of the minister to listen to the points raised 
by the hon. member and those of our national capital region 
colleagues.
<P>
	The process of consultation is part of the openness we intend 
to pursue. With regard to recent media reports on government 
plans for office occupancy related to the national capital region, 
I would like to reiterate what the minister has said on the 
subject. The review is preliminary only. It was developed for 
strategic planning purposes and allows for all options to be 
considered.
<P>
	The government restructuring initiative involved the 
combining of some 16 departments into 8. This resulted in a 
need to review their space holdings. It is only part of a normal 
planning process. It is within the mandate of Public Works and 
Government Services to provide productive and affordable work 
places for the federal government. Given the magnitude of 
inventory of crown  controlled space in the national capital 
region, some 2 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1536"> 1536 </A></B>
<P>
million square feet of office space, this can only be achieved 
through long-term planning, the study of various options, and 
their impact on not only the departments concerned but on other 
departments, other governments, the economy, the 
environment, and the private sector.
<P>
	We recognize the impact that changes in government have on 
the economy in general and the real estate market in particular.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After salaries, facilities management is the major public 
service expenditure. The federal government, just like the 
private sector, seeks the most cost effective accommodations for 
its employees but also wants their work environment to be 
conducive to their productivity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I can only reiterate what the minister has said. It is a 
preliminary study. All options are on the table. No decisions will 
be made until full consultations have taken place.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUEBECCITYAIRPORT">QUEBEC CITY AIRPORT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Madam Speaker, last 
Friday, I asked the transport minister the following question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is the minister aware that the new radar facility of Bernières. . . does not work 
between the 241st and the 247th degrees, although all of the air traffic between 
Quebec City and Montreal uses that corridor?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What was the minister's answer? The decision was made a 
while ago, and other cities have lost their radar control terminal 
and safety was the basic criterion.
<P>
	My question had nothing to do with the timing of the decision, 
nor the name of other cities that might be subjected to the same 
fate, or even the criteria that led to this decision.
<P>
	I know for a fact that on November 27, 28 and 29, 1993 
calibration flights were undertaken to test the Bernières radar 
facility. I do not have the report in hand, but I am aware of some 
of the conclusions: first, the area between 241 and 247 degrees 
does not come under primary coverage; second, the primary 
north-east coverage of the airport is poor.
<P>
	Clearly, what it means is that between 241 and 247 degrees, 
the Bernières radar, which will take over after the Quebec 
airport radar control terminal has moved, at the latest on 
September 1st, will automatically be disconnected to avoid 
ground interference. Planes between Quebec City and Montreal 
all use this corridor. That means that for a few minutes these 
planes disappear. How can the minister believe that I can be 
satisfied with his answer when he says, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is no doubt in my mind that the transfer of the control terminal from 
Quebec City to Montreal will not jeopardize safety.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The fact that he did not answer my question, even though it 
dealt with public safety, gives rise to all kind of speculations, 
including the notion that this could be revenge against 
French-speaking air controllers who fought for language rights 
15 years ago.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	My supplementary related to the fact that, in his letter to the 
Official Opposition critic for Transport, the minister claimed 
that his civil servants' decision was based on a recommendation 
of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. In my 
supplementary, I reminded the minister that a report prepared 
for his department by an American group of experts, the 
Sypher-Mueller group, recommended not only that the Quebec 
City and North Bay facilities remain open, but that they be 
expanded.
<P>
	Again, the question is quite simple: Which American experts 
are we to believe? Those from the U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration whom the minister vaguely alluded to, totally 
out of context, or those hired by his department to carry out a 
specific study on the specific project to centralize the terminal 
control units of Regina, Halifax, Saskatoon, Quebec City, North 
Bay and Thunder Bay. The latter group unanimously 
recommended that the facilities in Quebec City and North Bay 
not be closed.
<P>
	I am not satisfied with the minister's answer when he keeps 
arguing that the same criteria apply to all units and emphasizing 
the fair and equitable way in which all decisions are made.
<P>
	My question was an important one. It questioned the very 
basis of the Department of Transport's decision to close down 
the control terminal in Quebec City.
<P>
	I deduce from the answers to these two questions that the 
minister cannot give the people of Quebec, the Association des 
gens de l'air, the aircrews, the flight attendants and the members 
of this House the assurance that the new radar facility in 
Bernières is capable of taking over from the unit in Quebec City. 
The minister also failed to demonstrate to the people of the 
Quebec region that the decision to close this unit is based on 
hard facts provided by the experts. This leaves the door open for 
all manner of interpretation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Minister of Transport answered the questions and sent a letter 
including a briefing note and also held a briefing session.
<P>
	What concerns me in this affair is that my colleague simply 
does not want to hear the answer.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1537"> 1537 </A></B>
<P>
	The member knows that the priority of the Minister of 
Transport is to provide safe and efficient service to pilots and 
their customers, Canadian passengers and freight carriers. To 
do so, we count on a considerable number of sophisticated 
aviation systems and on highly skilled personnel.
<P>
	Once again, the air traffic control system has some basic 
elements. One of these is the control tower at individual 
airports, as is the case for Quebec City.
<P>
	Another basic element is the regional control centre, like the 
one in Montreal.
<P>
	The member is well aware that the radar in Bernières will be 
fully operational when the transfer takes place.
<P>
	The technology exists to give pilots safe and efficient service.
<P>
	He is trying to convince us that Quebec City was treated 
differently. That is certainly not the case.
<P>
	The terminal control units in Halifax and North Bay, which 
had more traffic than the TCU in Quebec City, were also 
relocated, as were the terminal control units in Regina, Thunder 
Bay and Saskatoon.
<P>
	I hope that the member and his colleagues will take note of the 
invitation from the Minister of Transport to visit the regional 
control centre in Montreal so that they can all understand that 
their constituents will continue to receive safe and efficient 
service, in French, from a very sophisticated centre equipped 
with the most modern technology.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GRAINTRANSPORTATION">GRAIN TRANSPORTATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Madam Speaker, yesterday I 
rose in my place and put a question to the government which was 
answered by the Minister of Transport. However I believe he 
failed to catch the full impact of the question. He treated it as a 
pre-budget question which it was not.
<P>
	Essentially the question concerned the government's 
intention with regard to the Crow benefit under the Western 
Grain Transportation Act, something that the red book forgot 
and which the Liberal Party ignored during the election. It is 
time the government became more clear as to what its intentions 
are with that Crow benefit because it is very important to the 
continued development of the economy of western Canada.
<P>
	For those who do not know, the Crow rate was established to 
encourage settlement of western Canada. Settlement would not 
have occurred at the levels it did at the turn of the century 
without the Crow rate. In 1982 a previous Liberal government 
decided to kill the Crow and put in its place a Crow benefit 
which was supposed to continue into perpetuity.
<P>
	The previous Conservative government under Brian 
Mulroney decided to begin dismantling that Crow benefit 10 per 
cent starting August 1 of this crop year and tabled a bill from the 
Ministry of Transport which would have  the effect of doing 
away with that financial benefit entirely in four years.
<P>
	That means the government will save somewhere between 
$650 million and $730 million annually. I suppose that is why it 
causes great fear in my heart to think the Minister of Transport 
would only see it that far.
<P>
	Essentially this Crow benefit and the Crow rate that preceded 
it have been the underpinning of land values in western Canada. 
At the moment farmland values amount to something in the area 
of $35 billion. Doing away with this benefit will essentially 
make that land worthless.
<P>
	If the government wishes to do away with the benefit, it will 
be taking away about $35 billion of equity in western Canada's 
economy which cannot be easily replaced and is being used now 
to finance the restructuring of that western economy. People 
borrow against farmland to build small and large plants in their 
own communities to diversify the economy of that part of the 
country.
<P>
	If the Department of Transport has its way this opportunity for 
diversification will be cut off right at the knees. Not only will it 
be cut off but government will be cutting off all hope of future 
diversity financed from within the region. It will be killing the 
hopes and dreams of people and sometimes four generations of 
work of the people whose businesses will go bankrupt as a result 
of this policy.
<P>
	If the government does not understand how the economics of 
this work, it should simply take a quick look at my own 
community where the Crow benefit amounts to something like 
$29 a tonne. We produce about one tonne per acre and the cash 
rents in that area are about $25 a tonne. Doing away with the 
Crow benefit means that cash rents have a market value of minus 
$4 per acre. I can assure the spokesman for the government that 
minus $4 an acre return means that the land is not worth very 
much.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Madam Speaker, the member 
for Mackenzie has again raised the issue of the Western Grain 
Transportation Act.
<P>
	Yesterday he noted that the previous government had 
implemented a 10 per cent reduction in the government subsidy 
effective last August and that proposals for further changes had 
been tabled. Last year's reduction in the WGTA subsidy was a 
consequence of the previous government's December 1992 
economic statement.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport yesterday advised the hon. member 
to wait until next Tuesday when our colleague, the hon. Minister 
of Finance, will have the pleasure of tabling the first budget on 
behalf of our government.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1538"> 1538 </A></B>
<P>
	This budget will reflect one of the most extensive and open 
consultative processes that has ever preceded the tabling of 
budgets in this House. Canadians have reason to be confident 
that this budget will be seen as a major initiative toward getting 
people back to work and addressing the financial challenges 
facing the country.
<P>
	Last summer the previous government tabled a draft bill on 
reforming the Western Grain Transportation Act. It set in 
motion certain processes for consultation with interested parties 
on two key issues: method of payment as well as grain 
transportation and handling efficiencies.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. Minister of Agriculture, has stated 
that our government has no entrenched commitment to the draft 
reform legislation. We recognize that the WGTA is an extremely 
important issue to all Canadians. We also acknowledge that 
many people have devoted considerable time and energy to the 
consultative processes that were under way when we took office.
<P>
	For those reasons we have decided to complete processes and 
then determine our next course of action. I understand the 
ministers involved hope that by the summer they will be in a 
position to give a more definitive response concerning the 
government's plans for the Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
be adopted. The House therefore stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.33 p.m.)
