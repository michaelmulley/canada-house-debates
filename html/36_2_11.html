</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order this morning to clarify certain remarks 
that I made in the House on June 8, 1999 regarding our colleague, 
the member for Burnaby—Douglas. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the member for Burnaby—Douglas presented a 
controversial petition in the Chamber on behalf of a certain 
fringe group which was seeking the elimination of the reference 
to God in our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my original statement on the matter I affirmed my strong 
support for the reference to God in all acts and proclamations 
devised by the House.  I also quoted remarks attributed to the 
member for Burnaby—Douglas as printed by the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I still strongly support the reference, today I would 
like to clarify my original statement.  Before I do, I must say 
that I was very pleased to receive a telephone call from the said 
member earlier this month.  It is my understanding that it is not 
his intention to rise in the House to correct this apparent media 
misrepresentation himself.  He has assured me that he does not 
share the views expressed by the petitions he presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, and given his newly found support for the 
reference to God in the constitution, I would ask that my 
previous statement be amended to reflect this new reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for setting the record 
straight.  He did recognize that the original statement he made 
was based on inaccurate information.  Without in any way 
endorsing the premise of his statement today, I do want to thank 
him for correcting his previous inaccurate statement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-263, an act to to amend the Criminal 
Code (hate propaganda). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present this bill 
today which would expand the definition of “identifiable group” 
relating to the area of hate propaganda in the criminal code to 
include any section of the public distinguished by sexual 
orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current provisions of the code include reference to colour, 
race, religion and ethnic origin.  The purpose of this amendment 
is to expand the protections of the hate propaganda provisions to 
include gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people to protect 
these groups against public incitement of hatred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would note that the bill would give law enforcement 
officers the power to stop people like the Reverend Fred Phelps 
from crossing our border to spread his message of hatred and 
homophobia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many gay and lesbian people are victims of crimes based 
solely on their sexual orientation.  The bill will send out an 
important signal that Canada condemns all violence, including 
violence directed at gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is the first of three bills I will 
be introducing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would give individuals such as police officers, 
firefighters, emergency response personnel and good Samaritans, 
should they be subjected to blood products or body fluid products 
in the commission of their duties, the right to know the HIV, 
hepatitis B and hepatitis C status of the blood of the person

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is a fairly simple bill which has 
wide ranging ramifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, if somebody commits a violent act such as rape or 
murder three times, on the third commission of that offence the 
person would automatically serve life imprisonment without parole 
for 25 years.

for leave to introduce Bill C-266, an act to amend the 
Contraventions Act and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act 
(marijuana). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is the last bill which I will be 
introducing today.  It deals with the simple possession of 
marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the bill would decriminalize, not legalize the 
simple possession of marijuana.  A person who is found in 
possession of marijuana would receive a fine.  There would be 
three levels of fines.  The fines would then be used to pay for 
prevention and education programs for children to deter them from 
using illicit drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduce this bill as the result of the huge overloading of 
our courts, particularly in British Columbia.  It would save the 
taxpayer money, it would improve prevention programs to dissuade 
children from consuming illegal substances and it would go a long 
way to relieving the congestion in our courts.  It would also 
help in preventing people from taking up illicit substances.

(registration of political parties). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is the reintroduction of a private 
member's bill which was introduced in the last session.  The bill 
addresses the problem of the 50 candidate rule which, as most 
members will know, was struck down by a court in Ontario.  The 
court in Ontario said that two members would make a party.  There 
are 12 in my bill, consistent with what we do here in the House.

(electronic voting). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, as members may know, about three years 
ago the Government of Ontario introduced electronic voting in its 
elections act.  Now it is quite common for voting for council 
members and mayors to be done electronically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no such provision in the Canada Elections Act.  The 
chief electoral officer has asked that it be included. Therefore, 
this bill would simply insert that into the Canada Elections Act.

performing.

leave to introduce Bill C-270, an act to protect persons accused 
of a crime from undue public speculation and suspicion before 
guilt has been established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this enactment is to 
protect persons accused of a crime and their families from the 
effect of media reports that cause public suspicion, speculation 
and outrage before guilt has been established.  Early publication 
of criminal proceedings can cause irreversible harm that is not 
justified in the case of an accused who is later acquitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to note that this enactment does not in any way 
impede the right of the public to attend any court proceedings. 
The resultant restriction on freedom of expression, which is in 
effect a requirement to delay publication, is demonstrably 
justified in a free and democratic society in order to protect 
the principle of presumption of innocence.

draw the attention of the House to the following: Whereas, a 
majority of Canadians understand the concept of marriage as only 
the voluntary union of a single, that is unmarried male and a 
single, that is unmarried female; and whereas, it is the duty of 
parliament to ensure that marriage, as it has always been known 
and understood in Canada, be preserved and protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners pray that parliament enact

of God and the constitution.  The petition was signed by 
residents of my constituency of Burnaby—Douglas, as well as many 
other constituencies in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners note that the laws of our country have always 
been based on Judeo-Christian morals and values which have been 
passed down through the centuries via western civilization; that 
the majority of Canadians believe in the God who created the 
heavens and the earth and are not offended by the mention of his 
name in the preamble of the charter of rights and freedoms; that 
the preamble of charter of rights and freedoms acts as a 
foundation upon which the subsequent sections are based and sets 
forth the basic transcendental understanding for our rights and 
freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners pray and request that parliament 
oppose any amendment to the Canadian Charter of Rights and

the exclusion of reference to the supremacy of God in our

</I></B></P><P align=left>It points out that there are court cases presently outstanding 
regarding the Nisga'a treaty, some of which, including one by the

<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-9, an act to give effect 
to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an honour for me to bring 
forward this legislation, the Nisga'a final agreement act.  The 
act and the treaty it will enshrine mark the culmination of a 
journey begun by the Nisga'a people more than a century ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1887, the Nisga'a people have been actively seeking to 
resolve issues related to their land, culture and government. 
Generations came and went without solutions being found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the rest of Canada progressed into a modern and prosperous 
society, the Nisga'a were left behind uncertain of their place in 
the country, uncertain of whether there even was a place for them 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today marks a major step forward for the Nisga'a people, for 
British Columbia and for Canada.  There is a great deal of 
excitement these days about the dawning of a new millennium and 
the opportunities it presents for our nation.  However, as we 
enter the 21st century we still face the challenge of unfinished 
business from the 19th. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill represents a major step forward in bringing closure to 
unfinished business from a century ago.  It marks a new era of 
reconciliation and renewal between Canada and aboriginal people. 
By doing so it sets the stage for Canada to realize even greater 
achievements in the new century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For six generations the Nisga'a people refused to give up hope 
or to doubt that their goals would be achieved.  The fact that we 
are debating the bill today is testament to their dedication and 
perseverance.  I am sure history will prove that their efforts 
will make Canada a stronger and more complete nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize the efforts of my predecessors and colleagues 
in the House who have contributed so greatly to where we are 
today.  I pay tribute to the government and people of British 
Columbia for demonstrating that our country can and will 
accommodate the needs and aspirations of all those living within 
its borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 is a national achievement.  It represents a milestone 
not only for the Nisga'a people but for all British Columbians 
and Canadians.  The Nisga'a treaty is a reconciliation between 
past and present, between native and non-native.  It lets us put 
the mistakes of the past behind us.  By clearly setting out our 
relationship it will foster community economic growth for the 
Nisga'a and for other Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is an important step in the long process of 
nationbuilding within Canada.  As Dr. Joe Gosnell, president of 
the Nisga'a Tribal Council, pointed out on numerous occasions, we 
are negotiating our way into Canada, not out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this endorsement from the House a century old goal is 
within our grasp.  The Nisga'a treaty represents a pivotal point 
in the relationship between Canada and the Nisga'a people.  It is 
an opportunity to demonstrate our mutual trust and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people have been living in northwestern British 
Columbia for thousands of years.  When Europeans first arrived on 
the Pacific shores they found a well established society, one 
that was self-sustaining and able to care for its members.  The 
Nisga'a were prosperous people and entrepreneurial in spirit. 
They lived in organized communities and governed themselves 
according to the ancient Ayuukhl Nisga'a laws, their rules of 
social obligation and conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrival of European settlers had a dramatic effect on the 
Nisga'a and on other aboriginal people in British Columbia.  As 
in other parts of Canada the imposition of foreign laws, cultural 
and religious customs had a negative impact that is still being 
felt today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diseases that had never before been seen in North America had a 
devastating effect on entire communities.  The Nisga'a population 
was once more than 30,000, a number that subsequently declined to 
only 800.  Today the Nisga'a number almost 6,000 but that is 
still a far cry from where they once were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia the circumstances of aboriginal people were 
further affected by the lack of comprehensive treaties with the 
crown.  In most other parts of Canada these treaties were a 
prerequisite for settlement.  They provided some degree of 
certainty over land tenure and defined a relationship between the 
crown and aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The absence of treaties in British Columbia means that to this 
day most aboriginal people in that province are unsure of their 
place in Canada.  It also means great uncertainty for all 
residents of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than a century the Nisga'a have sought to rectify the 
situation.  They did not let the events of the past outweigh 
their desire to achieve an honoured and valuable place within 
Canada.  Despite serious obstacles that were placed before them, 
generations of Nisga'a leadership continue to pursue their goals 
through peaceful and lawful methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In more recent times the efforts of the Nisga'a have coincided 
with an evolution in the way individual Canadians and their 
governments view their relationship with aboriginal people. There 
is widespread agreement that the policies of the past have failed 
and a new approach is needed, one based on mutual respect and 
trust.  There is broad recognition that all Canadians will 
benefit from such an approach.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evolution of thought has produced a number of initiatives 
including the many task forces and royal commissions established 
to look into aboriginal issues, the launching in 1985 of the 
community based self-government policy, the passage by parliament 
of the Sechelt Indian Band Self-Government Act, through to the 
tabling in 1995 of the approach of the Government of Canada to 
the implementation of the inherent right and negotiation of 
aboriginal self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that self-government is like other 
aboriginal rights recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the 
constitution of 1982.  As the courts have suggested, these rights 
are best negotiated, not litigated, and this is precisely what we 
have done.  The Nisga'a treaty is the logical result of the 
evolution of Canadian thought and policy and measures up as a 
practical and workable arrangement that operates within the 
constitutional framework of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty establishes a shared understanding of how the 
Nisga'a people and other Canadians can coexist and achieve common 
goals.  It provides a fair, affordable and honourable settlement 
that accommodates the interest of all Canadians and will promote 
stability and opportunity for all residents of the Nass Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By clearly setting out the rights of the Nisga'a people as 
related to the ownership and use of lands and resources, the 
treaty provides certainty.  This certainty will foster an 
economic climate conducive to attracting investment and creating 
jobs while at the same time providing an opportunity for the 
Nisga'a to protect their culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot overemphasize the importance of certainty to the future 
of British Columbia.  During the approximate 500 public 
consultations and information meetings which were held in B.C. 
during the Nisga'a negotiations the business community made one 
thing perfectly clear: certainty is essential to a strong 
economic future for the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the cost of the status quo?  A 1991 Price Waterhouse 
study concluded that unresolved land claims in British Columbia 
cost the province $1 billion in investment and 1,500 jobs each 
year in forestry and mining alone.  The Nisga'a treaty is a major 
step toward ensuring that kind of economic activity is not lost 
for future generations of British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as certainty is achieved I know that the business 
community welcomes the opportunity to work in partnership with 
aboriginal people.  This is as true in my own region as it is in 
British Columbia where partnerships are springing up throughout 
the province as the private sector and aboriginal communities 
work together on economic ventures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have known me for a while know how much importance I 
place on these kinds of partnerships and the ability for native 
and non-native people to work together.  Throughout Canada but 
mostly in rural regions native and non-native Canadians live side 
by side.  They share many of the same challenges and dreams, but 
for far too long they have lived isolated from each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's world that isolation cannot continue.  The only way 
for aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians to realize their full 
potential is by working together.  The Nisga'a treaty will 
encourage that process in northwestern British Columbia.  It is 
important that members of the House and Canadians in general are 
aware of what the Nisga'a treaty will and will not do.  I will 
outline a few of those items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, the treaty establishes a full and final 
settlement of all outstanding Nisga'a claims in respect of 
aboriginal rights and title.  The Nisga'a will receive a 
settlement package including $196.1 million paid over 15 years, 
approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land in the Nass Valley 
area including surface and subsurface rights, and a share of Nass 
River salmon stocks and Nass area wildlife harvests.

value, implementation and other related costs is $487.1 million 
in 1999 dollars.  Canada's share is $255 million.  I want to be 
clear on the cost of the agreement.  It does not involve, as some 
have implied, a cash transfer of a half billion dollars. While I 
am sure members will go into great detail during committee study, 
it is important to underscore this point for all Canadians to 
clarify the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strong economy requires land and a resource base.  With this 
achieved the Nisga'a will be able to participate more fully in 
the local and provincial economies.  Once again the Nisga'a 
people will have the tools necessary to be self-reliant.  They 
will be able to harvest timber on their lands for housing or 
commercial use.  Given the natural beauty of the Nass Valley 
region it is likely the Nisga'a will explore economic 
opportunities such as outfitting, wilderness camping, ecotourism 
and sport fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other residents of the Nass Valley will benefit as well. 
Increased economic activity will produce inevitable spin-offs 
throughout the area.  As infrastructure on Nisga'a lands and the 
Nisga'a highway are upgraded jobs will be created and local 
businesses will profit from an injection of new cash.  A 
prosperous Nisga'a people will contribute to a stronger economy 
in northwestern British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As significant as is the Nisga'a treaty it is equally 
significant that it has been achieved within Canada's existing 
constitutional framework.  It does not directly or indirectly 
change the constitution.  Nor is a constitutional amendment 
necessary to bring the treaty into effect.  The Nisga'a treaty is 
a practical arrangement that defines the rights the Nisga'a 
people will exercise under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 
1982.  Although rights will be protected under section 35 it does 
not mean they are absolute.  The courts have confirmed that those 
rights may be infringed where proper justification exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of misunderstanding about the nature of 
the Nisga'a government envisioned by the treaty.  Quite simply 
the Nisga'a government will be a democratic government for the 
Nisga'a community.  It will work to protect Nisga'a language, 
culture and property and to promote the future prosperity and 
well-being of the Nisga'a people.  It will give the Nisga'a the 
control over their own lives and destinies that most of us have 
long taken for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty does not create an order of government apart from 
Canadian law and society.  Let me be clear about this.  The 
charter of rights and freedoms will continue to apply to the 
Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Let me see if I can say that again. 
The charter of rights and freedoms will continue to apply to the 
Nisga'a people, the Nisga'a government and all people living on 
Nisga'a land.  The charter will apply to all actions taken by the 
Nisga'a government, including when it can make laws and take 
decisions such as issuing permits and licences.  The Nisga'a 
government will only be able to enact laws that are consistent 
with the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only will the charter continue to apply.  Nothing in the 
treaty takes away from federal or provincial authority under the 
constitution and the sovereignty of the crown is clearly 
acknowledged.  Federal and provincial laws such as the criminal 
code or B.C.'s family relations act will apply.  Where the 
Nisga'a government can make laws they will operate concurrently 
with federal and provincial laws.  There will be no areas of 
exclusive Nisga'a jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout history treaties have been used to define the 
relationships people have with each other.  They represent solemn 
commitments.  As such they cannot and must not be changed at the 
whim of one party or the other. 
For that reason the Nisga'a treaty and the Nisga'a final 
agreement act will prevail when there is a conflict with federal 
or provincial legislation.  This is consistent with the 
constitutional protection of treaty rights.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean Nisga'a laws will necessarily prevail over 
federal-provincial laws.  The treaty clearly lays out the areas 
in which the Nisga'a government will have the right to enact 
laws.  These laws will only prevail in matters internal to the 
Nisga'a people, integral to their culture, and essential to the 
operation of their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For other areas the treaty clearly spells out the rules of which 
any conflict between Nisga'a laws and federal or provincial laws 
will be resolved.  In general, federal and provincial laws will 
prevail, or the Nisga'a law will have to meet or exceed existing 
federal and provincial standards in order to be valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as providing clear avenues of authority, the Nisga'a 
treaty is a sensible and practical arrangement that will provide 
for the political, legal and financial accountability of the 
Nisga'a government.  The treaty, its related fiscal financing 
agreement and the Nisga'a constitution all contain provisions to 
provide that the Nisga'a government will be accountable to its 
members and to the governments from which it will derive some of 
its funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government will be required to prepare and provide 
audited financial statements to its members and to Canada and 
British Columbia.  These statements must meet generally accepted 
accounting standards and any funding provided by Canada will be 
subject to review by the auditor general.  This standard of 
accountability has been embraced by the Nisga'a leadership. 
Beyond any government's moral obligation to be accountable to 
those it represents, obviously there is a practical reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modern self-government arrangements in the Nisga'a treaty 
clarify the responsibility for land management for all those who 
do business with the Nisga'a government and for those who live on 
Nisga'a lands.  In order for the Nisga'a to attract economic 
development, their laws and decisions will have to be open and 
transparent with their administrative policies and review and 
appeal procedures both clear and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Nisga'a government will be unique to the Nisga'a 
people, it will operate under principles of democratic, 
representative and accountable public administration common to 
other local and regional governments throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be proud that this treaty finally sets out the rights 
of the Nisga'a people.  We should be no less proud, however, of 
the measures it takes to reconcile Nisga'a rights with the rights 
of others.  The treaty protects the rights of other aboriginal 
people and the rights of non-Nisga'a individuals who reside on 
Nisga'a lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the treaty were found to adversely affect an aboriginal right 
of another first nation, it will be read down to accommodate that 
first nation's rights.  The parties would be obliged to make best 
efforts to amend the treaty in order to remedy the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For non-Nisga'a living on Nisga'a lands, the treaty contains far 
stronger protection of their rights than the existing Indian Act. 
Those individuals will continue to enjoy the right to vote in 
federal, provincial and regional district elections.  They will 
also have the right to vote for, or become members of, elected 
Nisga'a public institutions, such as school boards and health 
boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty also provides that non-Nisga'a living on Nisga'a 
lands will have the right to be consulted about all decisions 
that might directly and significantly affect them.  The Nisga'a 
government will have a duty and an obligation to give their views 
full and fair consideration.  Like Nisga'a citizens, non-Nisga'a 
people will have full access to procedures allowing them to 
appeal administrative decisions of the Nisga'a government, 
including judicial review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the negotiations leading up to the treaty, all 
parties were very mindful of the rights and interests of others. 
For example, people who are not Nisga'a citizens but reside on 
Nisga'a lands may very well benefit from services provided by the 
Nisga'a government. 
However, they will not be subject to taxation by the Nisga'a 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public will continue to enjoy reasonable access to 
Nisga'a lands for recreation and other non-commercial purposes. 
Access required to construct and operate licensed water supplies 
is protected, and the Nisga'a water reservation, amounting to 
only 1% of the Nass River flow, leaves ample volume for other 
uses which may be required in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few of the many ways in which the Nisga'a treaty 
protects and respects the rights of others.  This protection I 
should emphasize is not available under the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is a complex and carefully balanced 
agreement.  If any of my colleagues have yet to read the text, I 
urge them to do so in order to see the extent to which the 
concerns and aspirations of all Canadians have been addressed. 
Anyone taking the time to do so will realize that, as with all 
negotiations, there has been give and take by all parties, 
including the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is in the area of taxation.  Once the treaty is ratified the 
Nisga'a will enter an eight year period to phase out exemptions 
from sales tax and a 12 year period to phase out exemptions from 
income tax.  At the end of the phase-out periods the Nisga'a 
people will pay taxes the same way that other Canadians do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a will also undertake a share of the responsibility of 
funding their government.  The reliance of the Nisga'a people on 
transfers will be reduced over time and it will contribute to the 
cost of programs and services through the operation of an own 
source revenue agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more that people actually learn about this agreement, the 
stronger their support for it becomes.  I am certain other 
members will expand on areas of the treaty that are of particular 
interest to them.  However, I would encourage members to bear in 
mind how historically and symbolically significant this debate 
is. In many ways this debate is about how we as Canadians see 
ourselves and our country.  The fact that we have a treaty to 
debate is a testament to the spirit and intent of “Gathering 
Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan” in which we committed 
to address the needs of communities by building a real 
partnership with aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not be at this point today if Canadians had not made it 
clear to us that it is high time we resolved the unfinished 
business of the past in order to move into the future.  At the 
same time, while the Nisga'a people will never forget what they 
have endured, they have come to know a different Canada in recent 
generations.  It is a Canada that respects and embraces people of 
all heritages, whether aboriginal or non-aboriginal; a Canada 
that is grateful for the contribution aboriginal people have made 
and will continue to make; a Canada that is committed to 
reconciliation and renewal; and a Canada that knows its strength 
lies in the ability to forge partnerships among all those living 
within its borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty says a great deal about how far Canada has 
come over the last century and our limitless potential to go even 
further in the future.  It is a significant step in the path 
toward a better Canada.  It is fitting that we are poised to 
ratify the treaty during the United Nations decade of the world's 
indigenous people.  What better way to mark that occasion than a 
treaty that has become an example to nations around the world and 
a sign of hope to indigenous people in Canada and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would like to once again quote Dr. Joe Gosnell: 
“Now it is time to ratify the Nisga'a treaty for aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people to come together and write a new chapter in 
the history of our nation, our country and indeed the world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Given the importance of this issue to Canadians and given the 
need to clarify some of the comments that the minister made in 
his opening remarks on this legislation, I wonder if I might ask 
the House and indeed the minister if we could have unanimous 
consent to have a 15 minute question and comment session.

minutes of questions and comments on the minister's speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-9, an act to give effect to 
the Nisga'a final agreement.  In doing so I want to assure the 
Nisga'a people, the people of British Columbia and the people of 
Canada that our sole interest in the debate on this bill is to 
establish a new and better future for the Nisga'a people in 
relationship with each other and other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that after years and years of negotiation within a 
framework dictated by the Indian Act but controlled by the 
federal government and Indian affairs, most Nisga'a leaders feel 
they have no alternative but this agreement and the principles on 
which it is based.  For them it is this or nothing. We understand 
that.  We understand why they have to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is not in the same position.  We will 
oppose this bill because we do not believe the agreement to which 
it gives effect is in the long range interests of the Nisga'a 
people, the long range interests of the people of British 
Columbia or the interests of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Skeena and other official 
opposition members will present the evidence and the reasons 
behind our convictions. The House should pay particular attention 
to the perspective of the member for Skeena because he is not 
only the member of parliament for 2,300 Nisga'a people but is 
also the member of parliament for 20,500 other aboriginals in his 
riding and 62,500 non-aboriginals all affected by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has had intimate contact with these people to a far 
greater degree than the rookie minister.  It is the people in the 
member's constituency who will have to live with the immediate 
and practical consequences of the Nisga'a final agreement and so 
we should pay particular attention to what he has to say.  His 
speech was not written by departmental officials.  It will have 
been written by himself out of his own experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House should also recognize that the NDP 
Government of British Columbia that has supported this agreement 
is to all intents and purposes on its way out of office. It is in 
extreme disfavour with the people of British Columbia.  I suggest 
that its continued support of this bill and agreement should be 
severely discounted because of that fact.  We should recognize 
that British Columbia will no doubt soon have another provincial 
government whose members will oppose this agreement, both in the 
legislature and in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also hopeful that by the time this debate is over, 
Canadians in all parts of Canada and members of parliament 
representing all parts of Canada will understand that this bill 
and the agreement to which it gives effect have ramifications for 
them. In our judgment many of those impacts are negative.  The 
fiscal impacts will be negative.  The resource management impacts 
will be negative, like those of the Marshall case, and the impact 
on aboriginal and non-aboriginal relations will be negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not simply a bill or an agreement affecting a particular 
group of aboriginal people in British Columbia.  It is a bill and 
an agreement with ramifications for all of British Columbia and 
for all of Canada.  For that reason we are pleased to see the 
attention and scrutiny that the national media and media in 
different parts of the country are giving this bill and agreement 
because it will have effects far beyond the Nass Valley and 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement we have before us is an arrangement providing for 
the government of the Nisga'a people, the government of their 
local economy and the government of their relations with each 
other and with non-aboriginals.  The purpose of my comments this 
morning will be to make two main points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point is that the whole underlying approach to 
aboriginal government and economic development in this country 
and ratified by this bill is wrong.  The whole approach that is 
taken and the underlying principles are defective and will not 
lead to the desired ends.  This we intend to demonstrate in 
concrete ways. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point is that an entirely different approach to 
aboriginal self-government and economic development based on 
better principles is desperately needed for the 21st century, and 
that alternative approach we will attempt to describe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start by making the case that the bill and the agreement 
it reflects are based on the wrong approach.  Surely there is no 
one in parliament with the nerve to say that the approach the 
Government of Canada has taken to aboriginal people in the 20th 
century has been a success.  No one believes that.  It is the 
reason for embarrassment on the part of Canadians when we raise 
the subject because they know that something is terribly wrong. 
Surely there is no one here who is proud of the old treaty system 
or how it was arrived at, if we study how those treaties were 
arrived at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anyone here who would defend the reserve system as a 
great social invention of the 20th century that was a smashing 
success for aboriginal people?  Is there anyone here who would 
defend the Indian Act?  Is there any member in the House who 
would stand today if the Indian Act did not exist and move that 
it be adopted by parliament as a statement of our approach for 
the 21st century?  I do not think there is a single member 
regardless of party who is proud of the system, the approach and 
the track record of the poverty, family breakdown, violence, 
illness, shortened lifespans and the despair that system has 
produced for thousands and thousands of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment, mortality, illiteracy, suicide and 
incarceration rates on reserves among aboriginal people, 
particularly young people, are the consequences.  This is the 
legacy of a 130 year old system for dealing with aboriginal 
people in this country.  It was established and mismanaged over 
the century by successive Liberal and Tory governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are exceptions.  There are bands which have been 
able to raise their standards of living and which have succeeded 
in various economic enterprises and undertakings.  There are 
bands and aboriginal leaders who have improved services for their 
people and who do run responsible and accountable governments. 
There are individual aboriginals who make remarkable 
accomplishments in the arts, business, sport and other fields of 
endeavour, but it is sad to say these are the exception rather 
than the rule.  What they have achieved has often been achieved 
in spite of the system, not because of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find some of the accomplishments of these people amazing 
because of the obstacles they have had to encounter at every step 
of their career from childhood to their successes.  If the Indian 
Act did not exist, would anyone in their right mind get up in the 
House and introduce it today as a framework or solution for 
anything?  If the reserve system did not exist, would anyone in 
their right mind in the House get up and propose it as a 
solution?  No, because the system does not work and is going from 
bad to worse.  It is defective in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe the three greatest defects in the system.  The 
first is that the current approach grants special status to 
aboriginals based on race.  That is what status Indian means and 
it is defined in a statute supposedly approved by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status provided by the Indian Act is not privileged status. 
It is far from it.  That status denies aboriginals many of the 
political and economic tools available to other Canadians, from 
responsible self-government to all the tools of the marketplace 
and private enterprise for economic development.  That status in 
essence denies aboriginal people access to tools that the vast 
majority of Canadians take for granted.  That status builds 
barriers rather than bridges between aboriginals and the rest of 
the Canadian community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second defect of the current approach is that it provides 
for undemocratic and unaccountable governments.  The current 
approach to aboriginal political development fails to demand or 
to provide for genuine fiscal and democratic accountability from 
local aboriginal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the people of Britain get democratic government?  How 
did the people of upper and lower Canada get responsible 
government 150 years ago?  They got it by controlling the 
pursestrings.  Yet under the system created and managed by the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development local 
aboriginal governments get their money not from the people to 
whom they should be accountable but from the government and 
Indian affairs. 
Therefore aboriginal people do not have the most elementary grip 
on their own governmental institutions because of the way they 
are funded. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to get into the examples which abound on every 
hand.  They are in the report of the auditor general.  There are 
in the newspapers every year examples of fiscal and electoral 
abuse on reserves.  The federal government has failed to provide 
responsible government for aboriginals in either the fiscal or 
democratic sense at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are signs of change.  There is a grassroots movement 
starting among ordinary aboriginals demanding fiscal and 
democratic accountability from their governments and from Indian 
affairs.  So far their voice has been largely unheeded and I see 
no reflection of their concerns in the agreement we are being 
asked to pass this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third big defect in the approach that has been taken in the 
past with respect to aboriginal economic development, and that is 
perpetuated by the bill, is that it is based largely on socialist 
economics, collective ownership of land and resources, government 
ownership of land and resources, and excessive regulation of 
every economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an absence on reserves of the most basic of property 
rights.  There is an absence of contract rights.  There is an 
absence of free markets in housing, labour and capital.  The 
tragedy of the current approach is that to succeed economically 
many aboriginal people have had to leave the reserve in order to 
get the tools that other Canadians take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent 20 years in the management consulting business.  One of 
my areas of business was trying to facilitate relationships 
between aboriginal business people and oil and gas companies.  I 
could tell the House story after story of aboriginal 
entrepreneurs who had all the smarts to make it in business and 
had to go through hurdles to try to base their business off 
reserve: the simple business of being able to get capital and 
being unable to secure a loan by offering their property because 
if it was on reserve the bank would not accept it as security, a 
simple thing like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many small business people in the country got their start by 
pledging the little assets they had behind some loan to undertake 
some economic venture?  That simple tool which has probably been 
responsible for starting the majority of small businesses in the 
country was denied to native entrepreneurs because of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where has all this led?  Where have special status, 
unaccountable governance and socialist economics led?  Has it led 
to peace, order, prosperity and good government for aboriginal 
people?  No.  It has led to the record of poverty, misery and 
despair for thousands of aboriginals whom I have already 
described.  It has led to a series of land claims, court cases 
and court actions that are further poisoning relations between 
aboriginals and non-aboriginals from the forests and fisheries of 
British Columbia and now to the east coast.  In addition, the 
billions of dollars that Canadians commit to Indian affairs every 
year is now leading to an additional contingent liability for all 
Canadians of up to $200 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw an article in the newspaper this morning.  I will read a 
bit of it.  Can members imagine the enthusiasm created among 
investors or business people thinking of doing business in areas 
contingent to aboriginal lands and treaties?  It is entitled 
“$200 billion price tag placed on native demands” and reads in 
part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has calculated the cost of satisfying all 
aboriginal demands at $200 billion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This figure is bigger than the entire budget of the Government 
of Canada for an entire year. It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $200-billion figure is the federal government's first 
official estimate at adding up the potential of giving natives 
absolutely everything they are asking for.  It includes 
every...outstanding aboriginal claim against the government, big 
or small, serious or spurious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“There are thousands of these cases, and they are coming in 
every day”, said one Finance Department official. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The staggering figure will be explained further today in the 
1998-99 Public Accounts of government spending, officials said. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article goes on to talk about the impact of the Delgamuukw 
decision by the courts, in essence putting a lien on virtually 
every acre of land in British Columbia.  It goes on to describe 
the chaos created in the east coast fishery by one supreme court 
decision based on an interpretation of the faulty approach to 
economic development I just described.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the kind of article that, if read by people who are 
thinking of investing or doing business with aboriginal people or 
with anyone else, is a signal not to proceed rather than a signal 
to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy is that all three of those defects in the approach 
to aboriginal development and economic development are carried 
on, perpetuated and even strengthened by this agreement.  This is 
not a 21st century agreement.  This is the perpetuation of a 19th 
century approach to aboriginal governance and economic 
development that has not worked in this century and will not work 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point to various parts of the Nisga'a agreement which 
evidence that it is based on a 19th century approach and not a 
21st century approach.  Let us look first at the evidence of 
special status perpetuated by the agreement rather than a move 
toward equality.  I will give three examples in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first example refers to the form of government established 
for Nisga'a people under the agreement.  If the agreement were to 
give the Nisga'a people a form of federally chartered municipal 
government like the form of local government enjoyed by most 
non-aboriginal Canadians, one could argue that would be a step 
away from special status and a step toward equality, providing 
the Nisga'a people with the same tools of local government as 
other Canadians enjoy.  The government itself has argued that the 
Nisga'a agreement allows for municipal type self-government for 
the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I would contend this is a gross misinterpretation of the 
facts, and the government knows it.  What municipal government in 
the country has paramount power over 14 areas of exclusive 
jurisdiction and shared powers in another 16 fields of federal 
and provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a laws according to the agreement will override provincial 
and federal laws—and we must remember this is law that derives 
its status from a race based approach—in the following areas: 
Nisga'a citizenship; structure, administration, management and 
operation of Nisga'a government; Nisga'a lands and assets; 
regulation, licensing and prohibition of businesses, professions 
and trades; preservation, promotion and development of Nisga'a 
language and culture; direct taxation of Nisga'a citizens; 
adoption, child and family services, preschool to grade 12 
education and advanced education; organization and structure of 
health care delivery; authorization and licensing of aboriginal 
healers; Nisga'a annual fishing plans for harvest sale of fish 
and aquatic plants; and a Nisga'a wildlife and migratory birds 
entitlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the taxation regime established by the agreement 
perpetuates special status based on ethnicity rather than on 
moving toward the tax regime to which all Canadians are subject. 
It is true that within 12 years Nisga'a people will be paying 
income tax like other Canadians.  This is something we in the 
official opposition support, but that is where the movement 
toward equality in the tax regime ends.  The Nisga'a government 
will be exempt from a range of provincial taxes and stumpage 
fees.  It will not have to pay GST.  Individual Nisga'a citizens 
will be permanently exempt from having to hold or pay federal and 
provincial licences, fees, charges and royalties on fish and 
wildlife entitlements provided under the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface these points may appear minor to some, but when 
we remember the agreement is supposed to become the template for 
50 or more agreements to come in British Columbia, the precedent 
that is being set is for race based tax exemptions throughout 
British Columbia and indeed throughout all Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I should make special mention of the commercial fishery 
entitlement to the Nisga'a which will be granted for the Nass 
River.  This entitlement will comprise 26% of the total allowable 
catch on that river.  The parallels with what is happening now on 
the east coast are obvious.  There the Supreme Court of Canada 
ruled that natives possess an unrestricted right to earn a 
reasonable livelihood from fishing lobster.  This decision has 
led to violence between aboriginal and non-aboriginal fishermen 
and if perpetuated will lead to the destruction of the biological 
base of the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major difference between that situation and the one created 
by the bill and agreement before us is that in this case the 
government cannot hide behind the Supreme Court of Canada.  On 
the west coast, particularly in the case of the Nisga'a 
agreement, the government is setting the precedent for special 
race based access to the commercial fishery entirely of its own 
free will. 
This is a further example of the perpetuation of access to 
resources based on race which can lead, as we have seen on the 
east coast and we have seen with the disaster in the aboriginal 
fishery on on the west coast, to nothing but conflict and 
mismanagement of the resources it perpetuated into the 21st 
century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the lack of fiscal and democratic accountability 
in the agreement.  The various layers of Nisga'a government, the 
central Nisga'a Lisims government, four village governments and 
three urban locals, will have a broad range of powers.  Due to 
the terms of the agreement, individual Nisga'a will be very 
dependent upon this government in a variety of areas such as 
housing, social assistance and employment.  Indeed, most of the 
employment on Nisga'a lands will either be with the Nisga'a 
government or with Nisga'a government owned corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Nisga'a leadership may be an honourable one, and I do 
not dispute that and have never disputed that, the concentration 
of political power in the hands of government on Nisga'a lands is 
worrying partly because the government will in fact largely be 
spending outside money provided by the Canadian taxpayer and 
because of the precedent this arrangement sets for other treaty 
settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gordon Gibson, a former advisor to Mr. Trudeau and a former 
Liberal leader in the province of British Columbia, has written 
“Small governments with large powers may acquire the ability to 
control the citizens rather than the other way around”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To effectively constitutionalize such an arrangement as the 
Nisga'a does is a very disturbing precedent.  I would suggest 
that it is the rank and file of Nisga'a, it is the ordinary 
aboriginal person who, from time immemorial, suffers from these 
unaccountable governments that have been established under 
mandates from the Government of Canada.  It is not the chiefs and 
councils that suffer under that system, although some do.  It is 
the ordinary citizen.  What this treaty does is once again 
concentrate power in the hands of governments on aboriginal 
lands, not in the hands of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As disturbing as these provisions are, they pale in comparison 
to the effect section 9(k)(ii) of chapter 11.  It states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Nisga'a citizens are eligible to vote in Nisga'a elections and 
to hold office in Nisga'a Government. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-Nisga'a living on Nisga'a lands are disenfranchised by this 
provision.  They will have no right to vote in local elections or 
hold office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their recent agreement in principle which the federal 
government signed with the Labrador Inuit, non-Inuit were at 
least granted up to 25% but no more of the seats on local 
councils.  Even that provision has not been preserved or 
perpetuated in the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal minister of Indian affairs has tried to pretend that 
local elections really do not matter.  He has said that 
non-Nisga'a will still have the right to vote in federal and 
provincial elections and have certain rights with respect to 
judicial and other proceedings.  So do the Musqueam leaseholders 
and look what good that did them.  The right to vote at the 
federal and provincial level has not protected them from the 
actions of the local band council which this minister of Indian 
affairs so enthusiastically endorses.  It is hardly surprising 
that his words are of small comfort to those who are 
disenfranchised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it really the federal government's vision for the future of 
aboriginal government across B. C. and the rest of Canada that 
racially specific enclaves would exist in which one's bloodlines 
determine one's right to vote?  It is stunning that any 
government on the threshold of the 21st century would even sign 
such an agreement.  It is hardly a wonder that the government 
refuses to allow the people of British Columbia a chance to vote 
on the agreement because it knows very well what the people of 
B.C. would have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might also divert for a moment to respond to a comment the 
minister made in his remarks that somehow people would be 
protected in the democratic and political rights sphere because 
the charter of rights and freedoms will apply to Nisga'a people. 
The minister is right in saying that, but he forgets that the 
charter of rights and freedoms, besides defining those rights and 
freedoms, also contains section 25: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms 
shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any 
aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to 
the aboriginal peoples of Canada including— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any rights or freedoms may be acquired by the aboriginal peoples 
of Canada by way of land claim settlement. 
This is also part of the charter and, I suggest, leaves a great 
gap in charter protection for people subject to the agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal with the third defect of the current approach and 
evidence of its existence in the agreement.  It is the evidence 
of the socialistic approach to economic development. The model of 
economic development proposed in the agreement is one in which 
nearly all the revenues flow from the federal and provincial 
governments to the Nisga'a government.  It does not flow to the 
Nisga'a entrepreneurs, workers, taxpayers or citizens, it flows 
to the Nisga'a government in order to generate economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former British Columbia premier Glen Clark was quite excited as 
to who would pay a major share; the Canadian taxpayer of course. 
On December 14 of last year he bluntly stated that British 
Columbia would be the net beneficiary of money coming in from 
Ottawa.  Perhaps this would explain his enthusiasm for this.  It 
had nothing to do with the Nisga'a people.  It had something to 
do with the $200 million injection from Ottawa; over $200 million 
for the Nisga'a treaty alone coming in from taxpayers outside of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only will the revenues be flowing in from outside, it will 
be flowing through the Nisga'a government.  All of the nearly 
2,000 square kilometres of Nisga'a territory will be collectively 
owned by the government in fee simple.  It is the Nisga'a 
government that will decide which lands, if any, will be sold, 
leased or held as private property by Nisga'a or non-Nisga'a 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty thus bypasses the individual and concentrates 
economic and political power in the hands of the Nisga'a 
government.  In effect, the Nisga'a deal enshrines one of the 
worst aspects of the reserve system and does it in a so-called 
modern treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak for a minute on the responsibility for these 
defects.  Anyone who is looking for a 21st century approach to 
aboriginal government and economic development, and given the 
track record of the country in this century, would wonder how on 
earth these defects, which everyone knows about and no one on 
either side of the House would defend, got into the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, it is certainly not the Nisga'a's fault.  The 
Nisga'a have never been offered any other approach in these years 
and years of negotiations because their negotiations are with the 
department whose philosophy contains these three defects that I 
have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach comes from this and past parliaments, from the 
federal government and the department of Indian affairs.  It 
comes from and is reinforced by a swarm of bureaucrats, 
politicians, consultants and interest groups with a vested 
interest in the status quo, even though the status quo does not 
work for aboriginals, for British Columbians or for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After spending time in the consulting business and getting 
involved in the area of native economic development, I knew there 
was a cloud of consultants and lawyers from Edmonton and Calgary 
who lived off the system like parasites.  They had no interest at 
all in the economic well-being of aboriginals.  They had a 
checklist of who the band manager and chiefs were.  When they got 
booted out of one place for corruption they would go to the next 
one.  They lived off that system.  Those are the types of sick 
people who want to perpetuate the system.  There are far too many 
of them still active and influential on the government today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does parliament not acknowledge these defects I have talked 
about and start anew?   Why did the government not do that when 
it had a chance with Nisga'a?  I would like to tell the House 
why. For the Liberals to do so would be to admit that they have 
been on the wrong track for almost 130 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is very hard for us proud, egocentric 
politicians to do is to admit that we were wrong, in particular 
when we have made decision after decision that perpetuates the 
wrong original decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one bright light—and I remember reading this 30 years 
ago—that might have led in a different direction was when Mr. 
Trudeau in 1968 recognized this defect, in particular where 
special status based on rights led.  He made an attempt to depart 
from that when the current Prime Minister was his minister of 
Indian affairs. 
Let me just take a minute to read a couple of things that Mr. 
Trudeau said back in 1969.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go on treating the Indians as having special status— 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what this treaty does. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—adding bricks of discrimination around the ghetto in which 
they live...Or we can say you're at a crossroads—the time is now 
to decide whether the Indians will be a race apart in Canada or 
whether they will be Canadians of full status. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968 in the House he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a long term intention on the part of the government—and 
this to be debated, I suppose, as part of our Indian policy—to 
arrive eventually at a situation where Indians will be treated 
like other Canadian citizens of the particular province in which 
they happen to be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say “We do not think that there are different 
categories of Canadians.  We believe that all Canadians should be 
equal”.  We get castigated in the House for talking about the 
equality of all Canadians under the law.  This is the former 
prime minister, a more influential Liberal than any of the ones 
we see across from us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pierre Trudeau, in the House of Commons on April 30, 1982, 
said “We believe that all Canadians should be equal and it would 
be desirable to define rights in a way which does not distinguish 
between ethnic groups”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote a little from the current Prime Minister.  Some 
members in the House will recall that the current Prime 
Minister's first portfolio was minister of Indian affairs.  He 
was there at the time Mr. Trudeau was articulating this doctrine 
of equality.  He was the one who brought forward the so-called 
“red paper” that contained that statement, an attempt to go in 
a different direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time—and I have to assume that the Prime Minister was 
speaking from his own perspective, not just reflecting the words 
of Mr. Trudeau—these are things he said “Special treatment has 
made the Indians a community disadvantaged and apart.  Obviously, 
the course of history must be changed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House of Commons in 1969 he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many Indian people, the road does exist, the only road that 
has existed since Confederation and before:  the road of 
different status, a road which has led— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did the Prime Minister say the road to different status 
led?  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to a blind alley of deprivation and frustration.  This 
road...cannot lead to full participation, to equality in practice 
as well as in theory...the government will offer another road 
that would gradually lead away from different status to full 
social, economic and political participation in Canadian life. 
This is the choice. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened between 1968 and 1999?  The Prime Minister knows 
in his heart that the current system does not work and 
desperately needs to be fixed.  He knew in 1968 and must realize 
more pointedly today that it is failing the very aboriginal 
Canadians who he obviously cares a lot about.  He took an 
aboriginal boy into his own family.  I think his heart was where 
that was.  It was not just a policy decision.  Does he not lie 
awake at nights regretting that he did not more vigorously pursue 
equality when he had the chance in the 1960s, or wonder whether 
it was too late to find a solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not too late but the time is shorter than it was 30 years 
ago.  As with the national debt, the first rule for getting out 
of a hole is to stop digging.  If we want to start on the road to 
equality, the first step is to stop discriminating, which is what 
this does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a agreement was the opportunity to take that other 
road, but apparently the Liberal government is too rooted in the 
past and the status quo to provide the leadership required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the other groups in the House and perhaps some of 
their reasons for supporting this agreement.  The Bloc will not 
protest the bill because it provides a form of sovereignty 
association for an aboriginal group in British Columbia.  The 
Bloc sees the principle of sovereignty association as a stepping 
stone toward its ultimate objectives for Quebec.  The document, 
therefore, just incidentally, is diametrically opposite to the 
position the government takes when someone argues for special 
status for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP will not protest the bill because many of its members, 
in their hearts, are still committed to socialist economics. 
Even though socialist economics have been abandoned by most 
developed and developing countries around the world, the NDP 
still clings to it and seems to think that the only place 
socialism still exists in the 21st century is on Indian reserves; 
that this is some kind of progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only party whose position I find inexplicable on this 
subject is the Progressive Conservatives. 
It is true that the Tories are as much to blame for the current 
system as the Liberals due to their early complicity in the 
treaties and the establishment of the reserve system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this bill and agreement was a chance to abandon all that 
baggage.  No one in the House would have castigated the Tories if 
they had got up and said, “We were part of the early treaty 
system and the reserve system and the Indian Act.  We thought, 
our forefathers thought, it was the right thing to do”.  If they 
had stood up and said, “It obviously was wrong and the 
principles of it were wrong; we are going to acknowledge the 
wrong and we are going to go with a new route”, no one in the 
House would have catcalled or hooted.  In fact we would have 
stood up and applauded, but they have not done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories ought to reject the sovereignty association features 
and socialistic features of this treaty because it is contrary to 
their own principles, for example the creation of another race 
based aboriginal fishery, because that is already creating 
horrendous difficulties in Atlantic Canada where the majority of 
PC members are from.  We would think that the warning bells would 
be going off all over.  But the PCs in the House apparently have 
decided to support the bill despite all of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the official opposition is not subject to any of 
these conflicts or restrictions. We are not responsible for the 
present approach.  We had absolutely nothing to do with it.  We 
were not on the scene.  We are free therefore to criticize it and 
to pursue alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe in special status for anyone and we never 
have.  We argued that in the big constitutional debate. We do not 
believe in special status for English or French.  We do not 
believe in special status for aboriginals. We do not believe in 
race based status of any kind.  It is a formula for disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe in socialism.  We understand why the prairies 
embraced agrarian socialism in the depth of the depression.  We 
understand that.  We do not criticize it.  But we do not believe 
in it.  We do not believe it is the economic instrument of today. 
If we are trying to develop economies today, the last thing we 
would do is offer people collective ownership, state owned 
enterprise and that approach to economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might also add we just happen to represent the majority of 
federal ridings in British Columbia.  So do not let anyone think 
that there are not a lot of people out there who agree with the 
position that we are stating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is therefore in a position to dissociate 
ourselves from the old approach.  We want nothing to do with it. 
We want nothing to do with the Indian Act except to repeal it 
over time.  We want nothing to do with the department of Indian 
affairs except to dismantle it over time and transfer its 
functions and funding responsibility to accountable aboriginal 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want nothing to do with the traditional approach to treaty 
making.  We do not want our name connected with it for historical 
or political reasons.  It has been nothing but a disaster for 
aboriginals and an embarrassment to non-aboriginals, as it should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are therefore in a position to explore and offer an 
entirely different approach to aboriginal government and economic 
development based on different and better principles for the 21st 
century, better principles than those found in this agreement. 
That is what I would now like to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle that we believe should govern our 
development of a new relationship with aboriginal people is the 
principle of equality of all Canadians in law.  In place of 
special status and entitlement based on race, we offer equality 
of all Canadians in law as the guiding principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For further clarity, and we never pretend that it is easy to get 
there from where we are, the aim is one law for aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals alike.  To illustrate at a more practical level, 
there would be one law for fishery and resource development, not 
one set of laws for aboriginals and another set for 
non-aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me answer two objections that often come in comments from 
across the way to this commitment to equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first objection from some of our friends that do not think 
this through very carefully is to say that the equality approach 
fails to acknowledge, recognize or provide for uniqueness.  Some 
of the Liberals say, “You cannot treat people equally in law 
because they are not the same”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way we answer that is to give everyone the same rights, 
entitlements and powers in law but give them the freedom to use 
them differently.  It is possible to treat everyone equally in 
law and still allow people to exercise those rights in different 
ways to give expression to their uniqueness and diversity, 
whatever it may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely the point that the premiers addressed in the 
Calgary declaration. 
They wanted to affirm the principle of equality in law and 
equality of the provinces.  They wanted to give some recognition 
to the uniqueness of Quebec.  How did they say we do that?  We do 
it by giving everybody the same powers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing wrong with the fact that Quebec uses those 
powers to build a different house than Alberta or Nova Scotia. 
That is how we preserve the diversity of the country.  But we do 
not preserve it by giving different powers to different 
jurisdictions. That is why they argued that any power given to 
any jurisdiction ought to be given to everyone.  We can answer 
that objection that somehow equality suppresses diversity, 
whether it is in Canada as a whole or among aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another objection to the equality approach made by Liberal 
members is that it will not allow them to give special help to 
people who need special help. If we are going to treat everyone 
equally, we cannot give special help to someone without giving it 
to everyone and not everyone needs it.  We either perpetuate the 
inequality or we do nothing. There is a false premise in that. 
Equality does allow for special help.  All we have to do is make 
sure that the entitlement to the help is not tied to things like 
race, culture, language or religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, suppose we all agreed in this House that a large 
number of people in northern British Columbia needed special help 
in education.  Let us say that we discovered a large number of 
people with less than a grade 10 education.  It is very hard to 
make one's way in the modern knowledge based economy without 
getting to that first rung which is a good basic education.  A 
large number of people all across our country still do not have a 
good education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose we agreed among ourselves that we wanted to give special 
help to people who are educationally disadvantaged.  This is 
basically in the provincial area but suppose there was 
co-operation, we could devise between the provinces and the 
federal government a program that gave special help.  Everyone 
who has less than a grade 10 education would qualify for this 
service, but we would not tie that special help for a grade 10 
education to a person's race.  We would offer it to everyone.  In 
northern British Columbia or northern Alberta the majority of the 
people in that program might be aboriginal, but they would be in 
that program because of the need.  They would have responded to 
it because of the need, not because of their race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone will say that from an aboriginal standpoint it does not 
matter.  Either way aboriginals get special help.  I will tell 
members where it does matter.  If we want to get the support of 
that program from the entire community, it has to be available to 
everybody.  A non-aboriginal could ask, “What is this special 
program for helping the educationally disadvantaged aboriginal 
people?  I see that three-quarters of the people are from that 
community.  Are they being given some special consideration?” 
We would say, “No.  Anyone who has less than a grade 10 
education will qualify for this program just the same as the 
others”.  The equality approach is useful not just for 
addressing special needs but for getting community support from 
the others by treating everyone fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge that the mistakes of our ancestors, for example 
the old race based treaties, complicate achieving the goal of 
equality because we have made certain commitments to people based 
on race.  Where rights have been granted on the basis of race and 
now conflict with the rights of other Canadians or sound resource 
management or whatever, they should be acknowledged and we should 
at least offer compensation for voluntary extinguishment.  We 
should move in that direction rather than perpetuate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How tragic it is that the federal government has missed the 
opportunity to pursue this alternative approach based on 
equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia is the one part of the country where 
aboriginals are not subject yet to the weaknesses of the old 
treaty system.  As members know there never was a treaty 
negotiated with aboriginal people in British Columbia.  There was 
a chance in B.C. above all other places to go down the other 
route.  What does the federal government do?  Rather than go down 
the new route, rather than even experiment with it, the 
government takes the system that has not worked in every other 
part of the country and jams it on British Columbia.  I find it 
inexplicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the second principle we think should govern a 
modern arrangement with aboriginals.  Instead of accepting the 
current defective system of aboriginal government and its 
relationships with the department of Indian affairs, we believe 
we should institute this principle.  All Canadians, including 
aboriginal people, are entitled to the services of local 
governments which are fiscally and democratically accountable to 
the people they serve. 
Who would have thought that in the last year of the 20th century 
someone would have to stand in this House and press the argument 
of the entitlement of some Canadian citizens to responsible 
government, something that the rest of us have enjoyed for 150 
years?

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does affirming this principle lead? It leads to doing away 
with the department of Indian affairs and eventually transferring 
its functions and funding responsibilities to local and 
accountable aboriginal governments. But there is one catch, and 
it is a catch in here for the benefit of aboriginal people: 
local and aboriginal governments that are fiscally and 
democratically accountable to their own people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to aboriginal people when I discuss doing away with the 
department of Indian affairs that what will govern the rate of 
that will be the rate at which fiscally and democratically 
accountable local governments can be established.  The sooner 
they are established, the more quickly the power and the funding 
can be transferred.  The slower we are in establishing those 
governments at the local level, the slower the process will be, 
because their own people do not trust an unaccountable government 
whether it is aboriginal or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads us to propose reforms in the procedures and processes 
for the election of local aboriginal governments on reserves, 
including making available the services of Elections Canada to 
deal with allegations of vote rigging and intimidation on 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads us to propose the reform of fiscal accounting 
procedures for local aboriginal governments, including the 
provision of the services of the Auditor General of Canada to 
ensure fiscal responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose a third thing.  This point to be made in principle is 
difficult to implement, but I think we should pursue it.  It is 
the direction of a greater portion of the department of Indian 
affairs funding directly to aboriginal persons on reserves so 
that local aboriginal governments have to tax it from their own 
people in order to get access.  That would put the purse strings 
of the local aboriginal government in the hands of the people to 
whom that government should be accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Application of this principle of fiscal and democratic 
accountability to relations between aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals also means doing away with the tortuous, closed 
door, conflict of interest ridden approach to the negotiation of 
settlement of land claims and local aboriginal agreements 
employed unfortunately in the development of this agreement. 
Those processes would be replaced with an open, transparent 
negotiating process in which all interests are appropriately 
represented and which Indian affairs is not put in a conflict of 
interest situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Indian Affairs go into these negotiations, profess on 
the one hand to be discharging a fiduciary responsibility to the 
aboriginal people and claim to be representing the fiduciary 
interests of other Canadians who have a different interest?  We 
cannot do that.  When we ask people to do that, we end up with 
defective agreements, particularly ones where people will 
question the integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to note that because of this defect, because this 
agreement is the product of a long, closed door, top down, 
conflict of interest ridden process, that is why it ultimately 
will not carry the judgment of the majority of the people of 
British Columbia.  Those who watch polls, and we politicians 
study the polls, will notice that the support for the Nisga'a 
agreement in British Columbia is on exactly the same trajectory 
for precisely the same reasons that the Meech Lake accord became 
unacceptable in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall when this agreement was announced, and when 
Meech Lake was announced incidentally, with all the public 
relations and all the press releases and the minister giving 
grand statements et cetera, public support started out in excess 
of 60% in favour, 40% against.  There was 60% in favour because a 
lot of people did not know about it, but the rest were against. 
In March a survey by Feedback Research Corporation showed it down 
to 42% in favour, 32% opposed and 36% only vaguely familiar. In 
August 1999 a poll conducted by Market Trends Research showed 45% 
opposed, 36% in support and 12% undecided.  It is on that same 
downward trajectory as Meech, which started at 60%, 65% and ended 
up being voted down.  Why?  For the same reason that Meech was 
rejected, the top down, closed door approach.  People do not 
trust what goes on behind closed doors, particularly if they 
think political people are involved unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more the public finds out about the content of these 
agreements the more it is the same as happened with Meech.  When 
it was just a press release they thought it sounded good, but as 
people find out what is actually in it, they become less 
supportive rather than more supportive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The refusal of the provincial or federal governments to allow 
the people of British Columbia to voice their approval or 
disapproval for this agreement, Canadians being what they are 
when told they will not have a voice, results in the net effect 
of increasing their opposition to whatever is wanted, not 
decreasing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the minister to make statements that it is too complicated 
for the people of British Columbia to understand is an insult to 
the electorate.  The Nisga'a people had a referendum on it and 
presumably understood it.  I compliment the Nisga'a people on the 
effort they went through to try to inform their own people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says the Nisga'a people can understand it with the 
educational effort made, but the rest of the people of British 
Columbia cannot understand it so they cannot be given a chance to 
say it.  That is the way to generate opposition to the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address the third principle that we believe should be 
incorporated into a new approach to aboriginal economic 
development.  Rather than offering the Nisga'a or any aboriginal 
band the outmoded, discredited tools of collective ownership of 
property, centralized government planning, government ownership 
and excessive regulation, we should begin to find ways and means 
of adapting private enterprise and market based tools of economic 
development to the needs of aboriginal people.  That means 
finding a way to establish private property and contract rights 
on reserves.  That would do more to stimulate economic 
development than all of the collectivism in the agreement put 
together.  We should start to develop real housing and labour 
markets on reserves, including equal economic rights for men and 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government professes to be passionately concerned about 
equality of economic rights for men and women in the federal 
public service.  Why does it not look at the reserves that are 
under its jurisdiction by virtue of the Indian Act?  No one 
disputes its jurisdiction.  There is more discrepancy in economic 
and civil rights between men and women there than anything to be 
found in the civil service, no matter how bad it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems passionately concerned about that principle 
when it is applied to non-aboriginals.  It does not seem to be 
very interested in that principle when it applies to aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should look at the removal of trade and 
regulatory barriers for aboriginal business people rather than 
erecting more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 is riddled with references to regulatory powers or the 
right to establish regulatory powers.  Have we not learned in our 
own experience with economic development that government 
regulation kills economic enterprise?  Excessive regulation kills 
even more enterprise.  There is no recognition of that in this 
agreement whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has to be done?  No one has all the answers, but surely we 
have to start down the road, which this bill does not.  The bill 
and the agreement to which it gives effect make the same mistake 
as Indian affairs made on the prairies when it decided that 
aboriginals would be turned into farmers.  What did it do?  It 
gave them horses at the same time that non-aboriginals were 
getting tractors.  It gave them the technology of the previous 
generation.  That is exactly what this agreement is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on accountability for this bill and the Nisga'a 
agreement.  We in the official opposition recognize that we 
cannot by ourselves bring the principle of equality under the 
law, fiscal and democratic accountability, private enterprise and 
free markets to bear on aboriginal government and aboriginal 
economic development.  That would require a majority in the House 
committed to such principles and there is obviously not such a 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we can do is advance the principle of accountability for 
aboriginal government and economic development at least one step 
in relation to this bill and the agreement it represents.  The 
vote on this bill will force MPs to declare whether they are on 
the side of perpetuating the 19th century approach that does not 
work or whether they are searching for a 21st century 
alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The editorial comments on this bill will tell the public on 
which side the commentators and editorialists are.  No one, except 
maybe historians, remembers who was responsible for those 
original treaties which do not work.  Who was responsible for the 
original reserve system which did not work?  Who really created 
that residential school system which everyone now recognizes may 
have been well intended but did not work?  Nobody can remember 
who it was.  The historians know, but it has all faded into the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in this information age, an age of full disclosure, we 
can ensure that the names of those who perpetuate that system 
will be known far and wide.  They will be known in every 
aboriginal community.  They will be known in every community in 
Canada and they will be held accountable for that decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I should note that the public will be especially watching the 
votes of seven Liberal MPs from British Columbia:  the hon. 
member for Victoria, the hon. member for Richmond, the hon. 
member for Vancouver South—Burnaby, the hon. member for 
Vancouver Centre, the hon. member for Vancouver Kingsway, the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra and the hon. member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those ridings I believe a majority of people would support 
the argument that we have made here.  These members are going to 
have to decide, and I know that Liberals hate this kind of 
dilemma, whether they represent their constituents in this House 
on a fundamentally important principle or whether they toe the 
party line and line up behind 19th century approaches to 
aboriginal development.  We will be watching and we will make 
sure that every voter in that riding knows whether their member 
is on the side of the 19th century or the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by telling the House a story.  I have not had 
a lot of close aboriginal friends.  I have had some, most of whom 
have been in the business community.  The best aboriginal friend 
I ever had was a woman named Ernestine Gibot.  She was a 
Chippewyan Indian who lived the first 45 years of her life in the 
northern part of Alberta, west of Fort McMurray.  She made a life 
trapping and living the old way.  She suffered all of the things 
that aboriginal women and aboriginal people in general can suffer 
in those communities.  I could keep the House here for a long 
time listing all of the things that she suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day, for some reason, and I have no idea why she did this, 
she walked out of the bush of northern Alberta.  She was in her 
forties and had decided that she was going to start a new life 
and get a job.  She went to Edmonton.  She went around and around 
in circles, through the social programs, the help agencies and 
all the program places in Edmonton for seven years until she 
finally actually did get a genuine job.  I could tell the story 
of all that but it would take too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got to know her because I was doing some consulting for the 
Esso heavy oil plant at Cold Lake.  As some members from Alberta 
will know, there is a Chippewyan band right next to that plant. 
We were doing socio-economic impact studies.  I knew a fair 
amount about Cree, Woods Cree and Prairie Cree, but not a lot 
about Chippewyan people and I happened to mention to somebody 
that I was looking for somebody who could counsel and educate me 
on the ways of the Chippewyan people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A social worker in Edmonton who knew about that brought 
Ernestine Gibot to my office.  She told me her story.  She told 
me that she was unemployed.  I said to her that when we white 
people are unemployed we do not go around telling people that, we 
print up little cards that say consultant.  We look very busy and 
we hand these cards out.  Lo and behold, after a while someone 
actually gives us work.  She said that she did not think that 
would work but we could try it.  We printed up these cards that 
said “Ernestine Gibot, Consulting Services”.  I gave myself as 
a reference because she was giving me consulting services.  She 
handed these cards out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She could speak English, Cree, Slavey and Chippewyan.  She used 
to go to hospitals because she knew they needed translating 
services.  She would visit aboriginal people.  She would hand out 
these cards.  Somebody picked up this card and said that there 
was a position with the Edmonton Public School Board in native 
studies that she should go to look at.  Maybe the board could use 
her.  One thing led to another and, lo and behold, she got a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was so impressed with her story that I made it a point to 
study how she got from the bush to that first job.  At that time 
I was co-ordinating an economic discussion group that included 
representatives, some pretty hard-boiled fellows, from about 15 
oil companies, but they had a heart for native aboriginal 
development.  The group used to meet once a quarter to see if 
there was anything it could do to create more jobs or 
opportunities for aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of this group I said that I was going to study how 
Ernestine got from the bush in northern Alberta to that first job 
because maybe there were some lessons in it for us.  I traced her 
steps from agency to agency, from doctor to social worker, to 
priest, to consultant, around and around the maze that included 
maybe 50 or 60 contacts with organizations, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing I discovered was that she got help along the way.  If 
she had not been in the system that I have described she might 
not have met these people, but in virtually every case the person 
who helped her had to step outside the box defined by the 
aboriginal Indian affairs system in order to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian affairs doctor who told her to get out of the north 
said that it was not his job to tell her where to live, but he 
was going to take off his Indian affairs doctor hat and talk to 
her as a friend.  He told her to get out of there or she would be 
dead within a year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The priest that she went to said:  “I am supposed to uphold the 
sanctity of marriage and I cannot tell you to leave your husband 
who has been very abusive to you, but I am taking off my priest's 
hat and I am telling you to get out of where you are because you 
will be dead in a year”.  He had to step outside the box in 
order to give her that kind of help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the social worker who eventually brought her to 
me.  She was supposed to take people around to these make work 
projects created by the government.  That was her job.  She was 
not supposed to talk to consultants doing business with the evil 
oil industry, but she stepped outside that box because she really 
wanted to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a long story short, if members want to read the story of 
Ernestine Gibot, it was written up in the October 1984 edition of 
<I>Reader's Digest</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to members that if we really want to do something for 
aboriginal people, either on governance or on economic 
development, I believe that we have to step outside the old box. 
We have to step outside.  This bill does not step outside the 
box.  It creates the same box for the Nisga'a people and puts 
nails in its lid.  That is why I appeal to members to oppose the 
bill.  That is also the reason I will move the following 
amendment in order to facilitate further discussion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK66">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor:  Bill C-9, 
an act to give effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, be not now 
read a second time but that the order be discharged, the bill 
withdrawn, and the subject matter thereof referred to the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

concerning his opposition to the Nisga'a agreement.

order.  This is a very important issue.  I am disappointed that 
the Liberals will not allow this to continue.  We would like to 
see some questions go to the leader, and I would like to know 
from the minister why he opposes questions going to the Leader of 
the Opposition on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid that is not a point of 
order.  The question before the House is whether there is consent 
to allow a question period.  Consent was requested and denied. 
The rules of the House provide that the first three speakers on a 
bill of this kind do not have a question or comment period. 
Without consent we cannot do it.  If members want to change the 
rules, of course, there are routes for doing that and I know that 
members will want to pursue them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Given the nature and the importance of this issue I wonder if I 
could seek the unanimous agreement of all members in the House to 
ask the government if it would bring into the Chamber at least 
one Liberal member from British Columbia— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The House leader of the official 
opposition knows that is not a point of order and that indeed it 
is quite out of order to refer to the absence of members from 
this House, pleasurable as that can be on occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The leader of the NDP asked for permission to ask 
questions of the Leader of the Opposition and was denied.  I 
wonder if we could ask permission for members from all sides of 
the House to put questions to the Leader of the Opposition. 
Perhaps members of the Liberal Party would also enjoy that 
opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak on Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin with a brief aside and some comments to 
the Leader of the Official Opposition.  Perhaps we cannot ask 
him questions, but we can at least react to his speech as a 
whole.  I saw him, and in particular I heard him, imputing 
motives to each of the political parties in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, I must challenge the entire argument put forward 
by the Leader of the Opposition. 
I agree with him on only one point: that the Reform members are 
probably going to be the only ones voting against the bill on 
native people we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition has just told us about the woman 
who came out of the woods to conquer the work force.  The Reform 
Party's attitude, its intransigence on the aboriginal issue, the 
immigrant issue, are what will perhaps make it the only one 
voting against bills of such scope addressing aboriginals, 
immigrants and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have a story for the Leader of the Opposition.  When I was 
a little boy of nine or ten, I was not an army cadet, but my 
friends were.  I remember that they had a review every year.  We 
all lined the streets to see the cadets all march past together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly remember being there with my mother watching the 
parade pass by. The neighbour, whose son was in the parade, 
exclaimed “My goodness, look at that.  My son is the only one in 
step”.  I looked at my mother, who smiled, and I realized she 
was thinking the same thing I was: her boy was probably the only 
one out of step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more or less the same thing with Reform.  They are pretty 
much the only ones not in step as far as the aboriginal question 
is concerned, probably because of their excessive intransigence 
with respect to bills relating to aboriginal people and 
immigrants.  So I felt it was important to start off with that 
little story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like as well, at the start, to salute all the Nisga'a, 
who must be following today's debate on television.  I would 
like to congratulate them and pay tribute to those who came to 
parliament hill in the summer to provide support and 
explanations.  They are here again for the debate.  I want to 
tell them that I am extremely proud of the work they have done. 
Joe Gosnell has been here on parliament hill for a few days, as 
has Harry Nyce, who is currently in the gallery and following 
the debate with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, after about 100 years, now is not the time to become 
discouraged.  I repeat the comment made by Joe Gosnell: “Just a 
few more days and the canoe will reach the bank”.  They will 
have an agreement on self-government.  On this point, they can 
certainly count on the support of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in the House, we often debate the legal scope of a given 
section, the political scope of a decision the party makes, but 
I would also like to draw to the attention of my colleagues in 
this House the fact that there is also human scope to these 
debates.  As members of parliament, we defend the viewpoints of 
our electors and of also certain persons we may be representing 
in specific instances such as in native matters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems important to me as well for us to always take this into 
account in our analysis grid when we consider a bill.  We have 
to look at how those affected by our decisions will react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indian affairs, in my opinion, is an absolutely extraordinary 
portfolio for the person holding it, because there are a number 
of ways to act.  I personally am among those who believe 
strongly in interpersonal relationships.  There is nothing 
better than visiting a native reserve to understand native life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had occasion to go to a number of native reserves and I 
have had the opportunity, the privilege and the honour of twice 
visiting Nisga'a territory. 
I am pleased to say that my first visit had nothing to do with 
bills before the House.  Having done some reading on the topic, 
I felt that this was one of the greatest aboriginal nations in 
Canada.  Having some familiarity with native peoples in Quebec, 
I thought I might like to get to know something about native 
peoples in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore went to Nisga'a territory.  One thing that made 
quite an impression on me was the landscape.  I have been twice 
now and I am still struck by it.  One can understand the 
attachment of native peoples to their sea, their land, their 
waterways, including the Nass River, and all the fauna; all this 
is woven into their philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The colour of the river running through the Nass valley is very 
striking.  There is nothing like it in Quebec or in Ontario. 
It is greenish and crystal clear. It is the runoff from 
glaciers.  I could see that not only was the landscape 
extraordinarily beautiful but that it played an important role 
in the vision that aboriginals have of their land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck not just by the landscape, but by the people living 
there, because this is where the importance of the bill before 
us today begins to hit home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I could speak as knowledgeably today if I had not 
experienced life on their land.  Through these trips, I 
discovered not only the great Nisga'a nation, but also the human 
drama behind their desire for greater control over their 
destiny.  I consider it very important to say this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was impressed by the lava beds, where close to 2,000 Nisga'a 
died following an eruption which occurred several centuries ago. 
The area is now a national park. People should see how the area 
was devastated and how nature is coming back to life again after 
hundreds of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a show respect for the terrible tragedy that struck 
these communities. There were two communities and 2,000 Nisga'a 
died because of the eruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see how this event is explained in the 
Nisga'a territory. There is a bit of mysticism and also a great 
deal of symbolism. We are told, among other things, that before 
the disaster, young children had begun to not respect nature and 
to make wildlife suffer. 
Today, the elders explain to the young Nisga'a that they must 
always respect nature and anything that lives in it. It is their 
belief that the disaster occurred because that respect was lost 
at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This says a lot about the philosophy and the importance that 
aboriginals attach to nature, to what they call “Mother Earth”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to visit a village which, in my opinion, 
has the nicest totems of all. I visited many aboriginal 
villages, but I never saw such fine totems as those found in 
that Nisga'a community. Along the Nass River, artists build 
totems that are some fifty feet high, a task that can take them 
up to a year. Again, their deep respect for nature is well 
illustrated with sculptures representing animals such as wolves, 
owls, hawks and also whales, for which they have great respect. 
All animals are represented on these huge totems, and it is most 
interesting to discover the Nisga'a culture.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You also meet great people.  My driver, Eric, the person who was 
my guide last time, is on parliament hill at this very moment. 
He made a point of showing me all that and of taking me to visit 
his mother, of introducing me to his family and taking me to the 
salmon smokehouse, where people eat it together and where it is 
shared, and with great respect once again accorded fish 
resources.  Such things move me and now permit me, when I come 
to the bill, to say “This is not only beautiful country, there 
are fine people living there as well”.  Today we must make it 
possible for these people to fly on their own.  And here I only 
hint at the symbol of the bird. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, at the moment, and this is one of the first 
disagreements I will have with the leader of the official 
opposition, the Indian Act can no longer remain unchanged. It 
represents a cage for them.  The Nisga'a are like a great 
powerful bird, like an eagle, and are imprisoned in a cage 
called the Indian Act.  The key to opening this cage is the bill 
before us today, which will permit the Nisga'a to fly, establish 
infrastructures, elect their people and see that the values 
reflected are their very own.  I think this is how they will 
integrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few minutes I will speak at length of the issue of 
equality.  The Reform Party has not understood that equality is 
not the panacea that will solve everything.  We Quebecers do not 
like to be told that Quebec is just another province. 
I do not think the Nisga'a like to be told they are Canadians 
like everyone else.  I beg to differ; they are not like every 
other Canadian.  There were several attempts, even by the 
Liberal government in 1969, to assimilate these people. The 
government of the time was forced to backtrack because it would 
have had a revolt on its hands if it had continued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important not to assume that equality will solve 
everything.  That is not true.  Quebecers have always demanded 
distinct status; there has never been any willingness to give it 
to them.  Now the aboriginal people are being given distinct 
status.  They will, of course, continue to evolve within the 
Constitution as we know it; they will continue to be citizens of 
British Columbia and of Canada, but they will first of all be 
Nisga'a citizens. 
One does not need to be an expert in aboriginal affairs to 
understand that these people's first reaction is to recognize 
their own nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go on to various reserves and ask people “How do you see 
yourself?” I ask those in Quebec, for instance, whether they 
consider themselves Quebecers or  Canadians.  The answer is 
always “I consider myself a Montagnais” or “I consider myself an 
Inuit” or “I consider myself an Abenaki”.  They go on to 
identify with something else, but they acknowledge their own 
status first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to explain the democratic and peaceful process 
engaged in by the Nisga'a, for this situation has been 
continuing for over 100 years as the Nisga'a have tried to solve 
the problem, to attain greater independence.  As long ago as 
1880, they were making representations to the Parliament of 
Canada, saying “We would like to have greater control over our 
future”. Things took a long time to get moving.  During the 
1970s there started to be some slight recognition of aboriginal 
title and ancestral rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met Mr. Calder, a great Canadian and a great Nisga'a in the 
Speaker's office.  In 1973, he was the first to succeed in 
making any progress toward recognition of ancestral and 
aboriginal rights. 
He is a great Canadian, a great Nisga'a, and he was responsible 
for the great step forward in case law and the philosophy of the 
courts with respect to the recognition of ancestral rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1973, there was the Calder ruling and, during the 
negotiations, this was what forced the federal government to 
recognize that it would have to negotiate with the Nisga'a.  In 
fact, I have been, and am still, critical of the government for 
always lagging behind the courts.  It is time it showed a bit 
more leadership and resolved certain native problems for once 
and for all.  But it is still reacting to supreme court 
decisions, the Marshall ruling being the most recent example. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same with the Calder ruling.  It was not until 1976, 
a few years after the decision was handed down, that the 
government said it would begin negotiating with the Nisga'a. 
Since these are tripartite agreements, it tried to get British 
Columbia to take part.  In 1990, this province joined the 
negotiations.  Finally, in 1996, an agreement in principle was 
signed and, in August 1998, a final agreement was reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been done, parliamentary steps had to be taken. 
These too were tripartite.  The Nisga'a were the first to cast 
their vote: 61% of those eligible to vote in the referendum were 
in favour of the treaty. 
Those who want to dismiss the treaty out of hand, without 
knowing anything about the more than 100 years of history behind 
it, without knowing the recent history, when people have been 
pushing for this for thirty some years, which is how long 
negotiations have been going on, and when this has all been 
worked out between three parties, chose perhaps to ignore this 
or are simply unaware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I think it is important that the rules of democracy 
and parliament be respected.  It is true that there was also 
considerable opposition in British Columbia before it was 
passed.  As well, there are perhaps some people around who are 
scaremongering, who are dwelling a bit on the negative.  I am 
thinking of the leader of the opposition, among others.  I have 
read a number of articles that appeared in B.C. newspapers, and 
I know who is stirring up the opposition in this kind of bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, it is up to us. 
We are the last.  Once the Senate has given its approval, it 
will be law.  We will see exactly what I was saying earlier. 
The Nisga'a will fly on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are constitutional issues of course, and there have been 
constitutional debates in British Columbia over whether we are 
amending the Constitution or not.  We are not of that school. 
We say the Constitution is not being amended.  The balance of 
powers among the provinces, Canada and British Columbia is not 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution remain unchanged with 
this bill.  That is our claim.  We are not saying that we have 
the absolute truth.  We can understand people's contesting it. 
For us, however, that is what we think, and I will put it in 
context right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it is spelled out in the agreement.  The charter 
of rights and freedoms has priority.  No one on Nisga'a 
territory can violate the charter of rights and freedoms without 
risking correction by the courts.  It is very clear in the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there will be no more reserves, as provided in the law. 
Now it will be Nisga'a lands with a Nisga'a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also legal decisions and validity issues.  If anything 
is to be tested, there will always be the courts to turn to. 
There is no way the Nisga'a can decide 56 things and there be no 
possibility of appeal.  There can be no appeal on Nisga'a 
territory.  That is not the way it will be at all.  The British 
Columbia superior court, the Supreme Court and the Federal Court 
will always have the right of appeal.  Legal guidelines have 
been put in place and they are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I reread the treaty for the second or third time.  I 
thought to myself that at last, after 100 years of trying, 30 
years of intense negotiations, the ideal marriage had been 
reached between aboriginal tradition and modernity.  I looked at 
several particular points, which I will use to demonstrate this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land issue: now the Nisga'a will own their own lands in fee 
simple.  Moreover, all the lands are listed in the agreement. 
They are all given.  They have already been assigned to certain 
individuals.  These individuals will become direct owners of the 
lands in question.  There is no longer collective ownership as 
there was under the Indian Act, and it is important to realize 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has often been said “Under the Indian Act, ownership is 
collective”. 
When ownership is collective, people do not pay attention, they 
are dependent; the decision on how property will be allocated 
comes from Ottawa, and it is often the band council that 
decides.  Now it is very clear: all lands will be owned in fee 
simple.  These people will, therefore, own these lands.  This is 
an important step, and also a very important difference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for forestry resources, and the whole natural resource issue, 
this will be a favorite topic for my Reform friends from the 
west, who will say “It is dreadful that there are so many 
uncertainties”.  I have looked at the forestry and fisheries 
aspects and the underground resources, and there are dozens of 
pages explaining how this will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is explained to us how this is going to work, I would 
remind the House that this agreement was signed between the 
Nisga'a Nation and British Columbia and that, despite the 
minister's signature, what is missing is the legislation to give 
effect to that agreement.  This is what we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as far as I am concerned, the certainty is there. 
As regards forestry resources, we can see that it is all set out 
in the agreement, which is a lot better than the way it was 
before.  I have already visited Nisga'a territory, as I 
mentioned before, and I visited Chilcotin territory in British 
Columbia as well.  I have also visited Carrier Sekani territory. 
What did I find there?  Beautiful countryside, I agree, but 
deteriorating rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember visiting Chilcotin territory and meeting about 100 
trucks, which were doing their best to remove the timber 
resources as quickly as possible.  That was before there were 
agreements with the native peoples.  I have often criticized 
that with the minister and the main provincial ministers as what 
I would call the “race for the natural resources”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That must be criticized, because the pulp and paper 
manufacturers, while I have a lot of respect for them, clearly 
get themselves ready to clear cut the land when they know an 
agreement on self-government is imminent and promises native 
peoples “Your lands are yours; do as you will with your 
forests”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what the native peoples do.  I was offended that, in 
the course of the steps toward self-government, there was a rush 
to take away the natural resources and that, afterwards, the 
negotiations mysteriously began to move.  It was easy 
afterwards.  They were told “We will give you this land”, but, 
strangely, there is nothing left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is some certainty with the Nisga'a agreement. 
Everything is laid out in black and white: riparian management; 
cut block design and distribution; road construction, 
maintenance and deactivation; reforestation; soil conservation; 
biodiversity; hazard abatement, fire preparedness and initial 
fire suppression; silvicultural systems and logging methods; and 
forest health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I have every confidence in native peoples 
because, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, for them, 
Mother Earth is their life.  One has only to see how they view 
the earth to understand that these are not people who are going 
to engage in clearcutting.  These are not people who are going 
to jeopardize the future of their forests just to make a buck. 
For me, this is a given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will also be required to conform to certain standards and 
existing crown standards will apply to all this.  We therefore 
have certain guarantees, in my view, and anyone who says 
otherwise is simply fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for access and roads, because the land will be turned over to 
the Nisga'a, it is mentioned in the agreement that the public 
will have reasonable access.  Naturally, access will also be 
granted to non-Nisga'a owners in fee simple because there is 
something else the Nisga'a have understood perfectly well and 
that is that the non-natives, non-Nisga'a who are remaining on 
Nisga'a lands will not be simply cast out.  They will continue 
to be told “You have property; it is yours.  You have taxes to 
pay and you will pay them to the federal and provincial 
governments respectively”. 
Therefore, the agreement states that these people must have 
access to their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also pleased to see that the 
Nisga'a Highway received considerable attention in the treaty. 
I would call that modern.  As I mentioned earlier, the treaty is 
a blend of tradition and modernity, and the Nisga'a Highway is 
one example, an attempt to link the four Nisga'a communities by 
means of a very interesting corridor.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the fisheries, again there is certainty.  I cannot 
understand why anyone would try to link this with the Marshall 
decision.  The problem in that case was that there were no 
provisions in place. Here, the agreement contains, from page 111 
to 143, a clear, point by point, explanation of the way 
aboriginal fisheries will be administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, people will not need any licences.  It must 
be clearly understood that, according to Nisga'a tradition, 
fishing, hunting and gathering are traditions that have been 
part of their lives since time immemorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood therefore that if these people decide to 
go fishing it is certainly not our job to tell them to go buy a 
fishing or hunting licence from the provincial government.  They 
will naturally go to the Nisga'a government.  When I say that 
everything is explicit, it must always be kept in mind that this 
is a tripartite agreement.  British Columbia, Canada and the 
Nisga'a are in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision is for the harvest of a certain percentage of 
sockeye salmon to be allowed.  There is also a percentage set 
for pink salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are surpluses, how will they be divided?  That is also 
set out.  There are also provisions on steelheads, both 
summer-run and winter-run, because these fish run twice a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found that the salmon wheel was a most ingenious way of 
catching salmon. 
I saw a salmon wheel when I was in the Yukon and I thought it 
had been invented by Yukon aboriginals, but the Nisga'a told me 
that they were the ones who had invented it.  It is interesting 
how it works.  Since the salmon always swim upstream, a paddle 
wheel is installed.  The paddles are in the water and, because 
the current is still flowing downstream, the wheel turns.  When 
the fish come upstream, they are scooped up by the paddles and 
deposited in a box.  This is how the aboriginals capture their 
fish live.  I thought it was quite an ingenious method and I was 
told that it had been used by native peoples for a very long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also numerous provisions having to do with aquatic 
plants, as well as the three kinds of crab found there.  Nothing 
has been left to chance. 
There are dungeness, snow and king crab.  The agreement contains 
related provisions, as well as provisions regarding halibut, 
shrimp and herring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an annual fishing plan, which the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans will help prepare and which will reflect 
the needs of aboriginals and all parties.  It is an annual plan 
because the resources can fluctuate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, it is not all that complicated.  It is almost the 
opposite of what is now happening on the east coast, where there 
are hardly any provisions and where everyone is busy 
interpreting the court ruling with their own interests in mind. 
Here, there will be no room for interpretation since it is all 
spelled out in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, we have to note the concern for conservation where 
the Nisga'a, provincial and federal governments agreed on the 
creation of a conservation trust, to be called the Lisims 
Fisheries Conservation Trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the trust is to promote the conservation and 
protection of species.  The native people, as I have said, have 
always treated them with respect.  They have no interest in 
lakes or rivers being emptied and the subsequent end of their 
traditions.  I think this is good evidence of what they want to 
see happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is even a provision on processing plants. There is no 
desire to kill the local economy, so provision has been made for 
a transition period in which the native people have agreed not 
to establish processing plants.  For eight years, they will let 
the existing plants continue to operate, that is process fish. 
The plants will be informed however that, in eight years' time, 
the aboriginals will be in a position to have their own 
processing plants.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as environmental assessment is concerned, it is not 
complicated.  Provincial and federal laws are to apply on 
Nisga'a territory.  For example, environmental assessment and 
protection studies must meet provincial and federal standards. 
If they want even stricter standards, there will be no 
objection.  Once again, this is a good security device. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now speak briefly about the Nisga'a government. 
Recognition of a Nisga'a government is consistent with 
self-government.  There will be a central government, and the 
agreement clearly describes how officials will be selected. 
There will be four governments, one in each of the villages, 
with jurisdiction over certain areas. They have prepared their 
constitution, which is in a way their raison d'etre, and one of 
the topics it addresses is how all these powers will be divided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have also determined the relationship with non-Nisga'a. 
Thist will be the point I will address next.  The agreement 
contains a Nisga'a citizenship proposal.  Persons other than 
Nisga'a citizens residing within Nisga'a territory have access 
to its lands, its buildings, its assets and its public 
institutions.  The minister has already referred to this.  Those 
with children may want to send them to the Nisga'a village 
school. 
Naturally, the parents will have a vote and a voice on the 
school board.  They will also have a voice on the board of the 
health institution, because it may be faster to seek care at the 
village hospital or dispensary than to go to Terrace or Rupert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This demonstrates considerable openness, since these people will 
not be paying taxes but will be allowed to participate. 
Non-aboriginal residents will perhaps pay school taxes, but their 
other taxes will go to the provincial and federal governments. 
The fact that the Nisga'a permit them to be part of these boards 
does, however, show openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government will, of course, be responsible for 
establishing the Nisga'a institutions.  It will have complete 
jurisdiction over the creation of the small Nisga'a public 
service. 
Who is better placed than the Nisga'a themselves to administer 
the powers devolved on them?  Let us forget about the old system 
where everything was set out in the Indian Act.  In the old 
days, when some small change was to be made on the reserve, 
people had to contact the liaison officer in Ottawa to find out 
if it was allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The magnificent eagle has been let out of its cage and now it 
can soar.  It needs space to soar and that is what the bill and 
the agreement provide, including the way the Nisga'a 
institutions will be run and the way the Nisga'a public service 
will be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will certainly be keeping a careful eye 
on things and will be prepared to give advice, but the people 
must be given the ability to govern themselves, and the Nisga'a 
government is going to establish precisely that ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will also be legislative power.  Since the agreement gives 
the Nisga'a full jurisdiction over culture and language, the 
Nisga'a government can be expected to introduce relevant 
legislation.  This should come as no surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we must recognize that the Nisga'a have shown considerable 
openness in allowing non-natives a role in public institutions. 
We must also recognize that now they can, and must, fly on their 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a citizenship is perhaps the main stumbling block for the 
Bloc Quebecois.  One has to understand the Nisga'a situation. 
Quebec's approach to citizenship is very inclusive.  One must 
also understand that our territory and population are much 
larger than theirs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a code of citizenship, which will contain a 
Nisga'a citizenship law.  This is where people say “Yes, but 
this is a racist law”.  That is what some people are tempted to 
say.  I have heard the Reform Party say that this is a racist 
law and an ethnic government because it is based on ancestry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply reply to the member who is using this argument that 
this is the way it has been for 100 years.  I agree with the 
leader of the opposition that it has perhaps not been working 
well for 100 years, but we cannot just abolish the Indian Act 
and declare all citizens equal overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it at the start of my speech and I will repeat it:  the 
Bloc Quebecois cannot accept an egalitarian Canadian society. 
The Bloc Quebecois has always felt, with the members of the 
Parti Quebecois, that there were two founding peoples.  If there 
were indeed two founding peoples, their rights must be 
recognized.  If we are all equal, all drowned in the sea of 
equality, we no longer make this distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how we come to understand the position of the Nisga'a. 
We have a critical mass of 7 million Quebecers, 80% of whom are 
francophones, so we can resist equalizing trends. But the 
Nisga'a may not be able to do so, as they number only about 
5,000.  Attempts at equalization must be resisted.  In Quebec as 
in Canada, the people form a mosaic. 
People from different cultures add to the shared culture.  I see 
this in the case of Quebec and in the case of Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that the native culture had and still has its 
own worth.  If there is an attempt to equalize it, as the 
Liberal Party wanted to do in 1969 with its white paper, which 
said: the aboriginals must be assimilated, equalized, society 
would be pretty dull.  It would be equal, but there would be no 
features or cultural characteristics to distinguish one group 
from another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These distinctive features must be recognized and given 
expression. 
I think the bill, the agreement before us, contributes to that. 
It makes it possible to say to people “We recognize that you are 
different; you will develop, however, in a climate of 
negotiation with us in which we will come to an agreement, but 
you are different”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Quebecers and the Nisga'a are proud of being different. 
That is why we can understand them.  Clearly, the government 
would much prefer an all inclusive approach.  That is what it 
wants to do in Quebec, but for reasons of critical mass and 
population size, I understand the Nisga'a have to do it this 
way.  I understand things have been this way for 100 years, 
otherwise who would be Indian today and who could decide who is 
Indian?  The Canadian constitution decides it to some extent, in 
section 35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But then there are rules whereby an Indian Affairs registrar is 
responsible for determining who is and is not an Indian.  Not 
everyone wishing to be determined an Indian can be. 
Unfortunately, that is how the law is, and the native people are 
the victims of this.  They have been told for 100 years that, if 
they marry whites, their blood will be diluted and they will 
eventually no longer be aboriginal.  That cannot be done away 
with overnight, otherwise the Nisga'a nation will eventually 
disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the people have taken the necessary steps to 
safeguard their culture, their language and their nation.  This 
is why, even if there have been certain problems around defining 
citizenship, there will be agreement because we are sufficiently 
open-minded to acknowledge that they need this if they are to 
perpetuate the Nisga'a nation in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be said that this is no disaster for the 
non-Nisga'a, as I have already said, for they are still entitled 
to own land within the territory. 
There are some one hundred non-Nisga'a on the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are indicating to me that I have a minute left, Madam 
Speaker, so I will wrap up my remarks.  I would have liked to 
have touched on marriage breakdown, because that is a concern 
introduced by the Reform Party.  Perhaps there will be an 
opportunity to address this again later, but I would like to 
conclude by saying that we Quebecers are able to understand what 
the Nisga'a journey toward self-government is all about, because 
we are on the same journey.  I want the Nisga'a to know we are 
going to be with them on their journey toward self-government 
because we in the Bloc Quebecois believe in it.

would like to indicate at the outset that I will be sharing my 
time with my colleague the member for Burnaby—Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased and proud today to have the opportunity to 
express my enthusiastic support and that of my party for 
ratification of the Nisga'a treaty that is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1887 the Nisga'a people travelled more than 1,000 kilometres 
by canoe to Victoria to seek justice and reconciliation.  They 
sought to negotiate a treaty, but were turned away at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty now before us is a historic achievement.  For 
the Nisga'a themselves it ends 111 years of justice denied. 
Today we finally ensure the Nisga'a their rightful place in the 
Canadian family. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty provides the Nisga'a with the plan to which they are 
entitled. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement is based on mutual respect that recognizes 
mistakes and injustices of the past and that begins the important 
process of healing.  This treaty is an important step for the 
Nisga'a, but it is also an important step for all British 
Columbians and for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can see that in so many ways the status quo is not 
working.  It is certainly not working for aboriginal people.  We 
see it in the high levels of poverty, unemployment and ill health 
suffered by aboriginal people in the Nass Valley and in other 
regions of Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the European settlers arrived, the Nisga'a were a 
community of 30,000 people.  Today they number less than 5,000, 
ravaged by disease, by poverty and assaults on their way of life. 
As Nisga'a Chief Joe Gosnell has said, “The remaining Nisga'a 
are the survivors of the march toward progress”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status quo has not always worked for non-aboriginals either. 
Instability and uncertainty have hindered economic opportunity 
and in some instances economic investment and prevented many 
communities from achieving their full potential.  This treaty 
recognizes that we must put this devastating period of 
uncertainty and conflict behind us. It recognizes that we will 
achieve peace and fulfilment through mutual understanding, 
recognition and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only look to the east coast to see what happens when 
that leadership is lacking, when we fail to negotiate in good 
faith with those affected, with respect and with forethought. We 
see the chaos that results when the courts are forced to decide 
because the government abandoned its responsibility to negotiate 
in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want another century of conflict.  We need to 
settle the issues that divide us and move forward together on a 
firm foundation of respect and certainty.  This treaty helps us 
to do exactly that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a will now be equipped with the tools needed to 
develop their community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people will now have the tools that they need to 
build the self-reliant communities that they desire for 
themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, some have used misinformation, innuendo and fear in 
an effort to discredit the Nisga'a treaty in an attempt to 
persuade Canadians that too much has been given away to the 
Nisga'a, or that this treaty is somehow threatening to 
non-aboriginal Canadians.  This campaign of deception must be 
countered with the truth.

by the Canadian constitution, the criminal code and the charter 
of rights and freedoms.  It is a fact that under the Nisga'a 
treaty, land and resource management issues are settled and 
important environmental protections are assured.  It is a fact 
that non-native property owners maintain guaranteed rights.  It 
is a fact that Nisga'a traditions and culture will finally be 
permitted to flourish without taking anything from anybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These important accomplishments have been achieved through 20 
years, two decades of consultation and negotiation in good faith. 
How can these accomplishments therefore be bad for Canada?  It is 
surely irresponsible and intolerable that some choose to use this 
debate to drive a wedge between aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
people instead of using it as a way to heal longstanding 
divisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is not about establishing a separate solitude for the 
Nisga'a as some Reform Party members insist.  It is about the 
Nisga'a assuming their rightful place in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all witnessed the wonderful festivities surrounding passage 
of the Nisga'a bill in British Columbia.  As the Nisga'a marched 
in the streets in celebration they carried in one hand British 
Columbia's flag and in the other hand Canada's flag.  What an 
important symbol it was of a coming together after years of 
conflict and injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is not about separation.  It is about extending a 
long overdue welcome to first nations people who have been too 
long treated as second class members of the Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we in the House have the opportunity to walk with history. 
With the ratification of the Nisga'a treaty we take a first but

us rise to our responsibilities to offer leadership, 
responsibilities that Canadians rightly expect of us as

treaty and in so doing play a modest but historically significant 
role in ushering in a new era of co-operation and mutual respect 
among aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Gosnell spoke of that journey.  As my leader indicated, 
that journey started many years ago.  The Nisga'a people were in 
the Nass Valley when the Europeans first arrived. Their lands and 
resources were stolen from them with no compensation or due 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They started the journey for compensation and justice many years 
ago.  In 1887 the chiefs journeyed in a canoe to Victoria but the 
doors were closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a leaders worked tirelessly over the years on behalf of 
their people, even when it was illegal to do so.  From 1927 to 
1950 it was illegal for the Nisga'a people, or any other 
aboriginal people in Canada, to hire a lawyer to pursue their 
land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally in 1973 the Supreme Court of Canada in the Calder 
decision involving Frank Calder affirmed some very fundamental 
rights of the Nisga'a people.  The present Prime Minister, then 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, agreed in 
August of that year to embark on a process of negotiation.  Here 
we are many years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to a number of lawyers who have worked tirelessly, 
arm in arm, side by side with the Nisga'a people: Tom Berger, who 
argued the original Calder decision to the highest court of the 
land and others who have followed in his path like James Aldridge 
who has been there for many years tirelessly defending the rights 
of the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember as a young new member of the House sitting on the 
historic constitution committee in the winter of 1980-81 and 
hearing the eloquent plea of the Nisga'a leadership, people like 
Chief James Gosnell, Rod Robinson and others pleading for 
justice.  They were not asking for any kind of special rights or 
treatment but for equality and justice, for healing and 
reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud that it was the former leader of the New 
Democratic Party who stood in the House on February 17, 1981, to 
announce that an amendment would be accepted by the government 
which would ensure that aboriginal and treaty rights of first 
nations people would be as firmly entrenched in section 35 of the 
constitution as all other rights.  Ed Broadbent, the New 
Democrats and the Liberal government of the day can be very proud 
of their accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The Nisga'a treaty does not in any way involve 
an amendment to the constitution because under the provisions of 
section 35 the aboriginal and treaty rights of Canada's first 
nations are recognized and affirmed.  The aboriginal rights which 
have now been translated into treaty are the fundamental rights 
to land claims and self-government of the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people including the Liberal Party in British Columbia and 
the Reform Party federally say that there should be a referendum 
on this issue.  Not only is that deeply offensive, as the concept 
of fundamental minority rights should not be subject to a 
referendum, but who would vote in that referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget the federal government is paying 80% of the 
cost of this treaty settlement.  It is one of those rare examples 
in which the federal government actually transfers funds to 
British Columbia.  In order for there to be a referendum there 
would have to be a national vote.  Frankly it is outrageous that 
the people of Ontario alone would be able to outvote the people 
of British Columbia on this fundamental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge and salute the personal leadership of provincial 
New Democrats including former premier Mike Harcourt, former 
premier Glen Clark, as well as a number of ministers of 
aboriginal affairs, John Cashore, Andrew Petter, Dale Lovick and 
others.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty has strong support in British Columbia from many 
diverse communities.  It was ratified by the B.C. legislature in 
a free vote following the longest debate in the history of the 
British Columbia legislature.  There were extensive public 
hearings across the province of British Columbia.  The aboriginal 
affairs committee of the B.C. legislature, ably chaired by a 
former federal colleague, Ian Waddell, gave people an opportunity 
to be heard on the issue.  The treaty was ratified by 72% of 
those Nisga'a who voted.  Sixty-one per cent of all eligible 
voters supported the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to say a word about that because the member for Skeena 
attacked the ratification process.  He said in a letter to the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> in May that almost one-half of the Nisga'a 
people did not support the treaty.  In addition to the fact that 
is blatantly false I point out that the member for Skeena was 
elected with a percentage of 42.4% of the eligible votes cast and 
got 27% of all votes in his constituency.  By his own criteria 
three-quarters of the people who could have voted for him did not 
vote for him.  Reformers are steeped in hypocrisy in their 
approach to this treaty, and the people of British Columbia know 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party critic, the member for Skeena, has not even had 
the decency to meet with the leadership of the Nisga'a people 
since the treaty was signed.  These are his constituents and yet 
not once has he met with them since the treaty was signed.  He 
said that he debated Chief Joe Gosnell in 1995, but that was four 
years ago.  Where has the member for Skeena been since then?  He 
has shown total contempt for the Nisga'a people and for other 
aboriginal peoples in his community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the strong support for the treaty from a very broad 
cross-section of the British Columbia community.  The business 
community is seeking certainty at long last.  The labour 
community, IWA President Dave Haggard, sent a strong and eloquent 
letter to the former minister outlining the support of working 
people for the legislation, along with the British Columbia 
Federation of Labour and many others.  There is strong support. 
Faith leaders as well strongly support the legislation and the 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from a message to the people of British Columbia by 
former premier Glen Clark who said that the Nisga'a treaty was 
not about politics but about people, a people who lost the land 
of their ancestors without ever signing a treaty; a people who 
saw their children taken away to residential schools, their 
culture systematically dismantled, their families decimated by 
the ravages of disease, alcohol and dysfunction; a people who are 
still subject to being governed under an antiquated Indian Act; a 
people who negotiated peacefully, patiently and in good faith for 
many years; a people who want to be part of Canada, who have 
negotiated their way back into Canada and who are prepared to 
surrender over 90% of their traditional territories and their tax 
exempt status to achieve that dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is about politics.  It is about people.  It is about 
justice and it is about time.

pleasure today to speak to Bill C-9, an act to give effect to the 
Nisga'a final agreement.  The legislation marks the end of a long 
process for the Nisga'a people, one that has spanned more than 
100 years since the Nisga'a representatives travelled by canoe in 
1887 from the Nass River Valley to Victoria to begin this long 
process.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with the Nisga'a people on a number of occasions and 
each time they have stressed that they are not only prepared for 
this process, but they are eager and anxious for it to begin.  As 
they say, there has been enough dialogue on this matter and they 
have welcomed visits from interested parties seeking to see how 
prepared they are for this new initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is the first modern day treaty to be signed 
in British Columbia and will be the 14th in Canada.  It sets a 
strong precedent for other treaties that may be under 
negotiation.  At the same time however, it is clearly stated in 
the treaty that in no way does the treaty impact the negotiation 
of other treaties within the province of British Columbia.  On 
the contrary, each first nation will negotiate on its own merit 
to pursue its own goals and aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this treaty does show is that negotiated settlements can be 
reached that satisfy all parties and provide a peaceful, informed 
and effective means of delineating responsibility and 
accountability on behalf of the federal government, the 
provincial government and the Nisga'a people.  Each party had to 
make some concessions.  That is what negotiation is about.  The 
end result is a treaty that has already been ratified by the 
Nisga'a nation and the provincial government in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people accepted the treaty when they held a 
referendum on November 7 and 8, 1998.  The treaty had to be 
ratified by a majority of all registered voters regardless of how 
many actually voted.  There were 1,451 people representing 61% of 
the Nisga'a nation who voted to accept the terms of the final 
agreement.  There were 558 votes against the treaty and 11 
spoiled ballots.  This meant there was an acceptance rate of 72% 
although there was a voter turnout of 85%. The 356 people who did 
not vote meant that the treaty was approved by 61% of the Nisga'a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to explain the voting process because there has 
been a lot of discussion about the voting process and quite 
frankly, a lot of criticism about the voting process that is 
completely unwarranted.  The Nisga'a constitution which was voted 
on during the referendum required a 70% approval rate.  It 
received 73% with 1,480 votes in support of the constitution and 
525 against.  The end result was that the treaty and the 
constitution were approved by more than 70% of the Nisga'a people 
voting in the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criteria establishing eligibility for the ratification vote 
is outlined in the Nisga'a final agreement in chapter 22 on 
ratification, section 6.  That section states that it is anyone 
who meets the criteria of the enrolment committee, is 18 years of 
age or older, is ordinarily resident in Canada and is not 
enrolled in any other land claim agreement. To determine who 
meets the criteria of the enrolment committee, section 1 of 
chapter 20 on eligibility and enrolment states that the person 
must establish some Nisga'a ancestry, including adoption and 
marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important to note is that it does not mention that the 
person must be ordinarily resident on reserve, a condition of the 
Indian Act and one that was recently the focus of a court ruling 
in Corbière. In that case the court ruled that band members 
living off reserve should have the opportunity to vote in some 
matters where their interests are involved.  The requirement to 
live on reserve prevents a number of band members from voting 
even when the decisions of the chief and council may impact on 
resources or assets held communally by the band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ratification process for the Nisga'a final agreement 
requires approval from three parties: the Nisga'a people, the 
province of British Columbia and the federal government.  The 
province of British Columbia approved the agreement when it 
ratified legislation on April 23, 1999 with Bill 51.  At that 
time the provincial government used closure to end debate and 
push Bill 51 through the legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now legislation is before us that will ratify the treaty.  I 
welcome the opportunity to address this matter.  The government 
has indicated that closure may again be used to limit debate on 
this matter.  I will wait to address that issue later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party have made it clear on a number of 
occasions that they have some problems with certain provisions of 
this treaty and maybe even the treaty itself.  This is from a 
party that prides itself on its grassroots connections, yet it 
refuses to recognize that the Nisga'a people themselves voted in 
a referendum to accept this treaty, 61% of whom accepted the 
treaty and constitution of the Nisga'a final agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully that will lay that issue to rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the Nisga'a treaty does not change the Canadian 
constitution. The constitution under section 35 recognizes and 
affirms treaty and aboriginal rights. These rights which are set 
out in the Nisga'a final agreement for the Nisga'a people 
continue to be affirmed by the constitution.  The treaty is not 
part of the constitution; rather, it is recognized by the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To amend the treaty, provisions within the treaty document set 
out the requirements that must be met to effect such change.  The 
Nisga'a people and the other signatories recognize the real 
possibility that changes will be made to the treaty and a process 
is in place to allow this to happen.  It is a process that does 
not require the consent of a number of the provinces across 
Canada that a constitutional amendment would entail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement outlines the amendment provisions in 
the chapter on general provisions, section 36, and states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for any provision of this agreement that provides that an 
amendment requires the consent of only the Nisga'a nation and 
either Canada or British Columbia, all amendments to the 
agreement require the consent of all three parties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Nisga'a nation to consent to an amendment to the final 
agreement, it requires the support of two-thirds of the elected 
members of the Nisga'a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Race based government is another assertion that the Reform Party 
has used to argue against this treaty. The treaty allows the 
Nisga'a people to be self-governing and to establish laws in 
areas where they are in the best position to do so, areas such as 
protecting their cultural artifacts. At the same time, federal 
and provincial laws provide minimum standards with which the 
Nisga'a must comply or surpass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, non-Nisga'a people living on Nisga'a land will have 
representation in areas in which they are affected. Non-Nisga'a 
citizens will continue to vote for their municipal, provincial 
and federal representatives, as will the Nisga'a people.  The 
Nisga'a people also have the ability to set rules governing who 
becomes a Nisga'a citizen.  This does not exclude non-Nisga'a 
people from possibly being included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement clearly states that the charter of 
rights and freedoms continues to apply to the Nisga'a people. 
Interpretations differ as to how the charter applies to 
aboriginal people, but the Nisga'a agree as stated in the treaty 
that the charter continues to apply to them. When I met with 
representatives of the Nisga'a nation they were clear that in 
their minds the charter applies to the Nisga'a government. The 
exact wording of the Nisga'a final agreement states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to Nisga'a 
government in respect of all matters within its authority, 
bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of Nisga'a 
government as set out in this agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people will elect members of the Nisga'a government 
so it will be a democratic style of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way to look at this treaty and the legislation that we 
are debating today is the position the Nisga'a people would be in 
without such a final agreement.  Under this treaty Nisga'a land 
will no longer be reserve land under the Indian Act.  This allows 
a much greater opportunity in terms of resource management and 
economic diversification or development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Indian Act the Nisga'a people required authorization 
from the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
whenever they wanted to develop a resource or pursue activities 
that would encourage self-reliance.  All of that changes with 
this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, aboriginal rights and treaty rights are 
exhaustively set out in the final agreement.  We all know that 
the decision in Delgamuukw supported and encouraged negotiated 
settlements as opposed to continued litigation.  This is exactly 
what the treaty represents, a negotiated agreement settled by all 
parties involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With conclusive aboriginal treaty rights, this will encourage 
industry to develop partnerships with the Nisga'a people since 
there is certainty as to who owns the resources. The forestry and 
mining industries have suffered in British Columbia because of a 
lack of certainty that exists regarding resource ownership in the 
province. The provincial government and the first nations have 
suffered the economic consequences as companies refuse to invest 
funds in exploration and development activities when they are 
unsure with whom they should be negotiating. 
It has been estimated that as much as $1 billion and 1,500 jobs 
have been lost in British Columbia because of this uncertainty 
and the unwillingness of the forestry and mining sectors to 
invest in such an environment.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Nisga'a people this treaty removes that uncertainty. The 
Nisga'a people should benefit from increased resource development 
projects on Nisga'a land once the treaty ratification process is 
complete.  The Nisga'a people will be in the position to develop 
their own resources through whatever avenues they wish to pursue. 
At the same time, federal and provincial environmental standards 
will provide guidelines on how these resources are extracted and 
developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to address timber resources 
on Nisga'a land.  Nisga'a land was heavily logged from 1958 on 
and the remaining timber is located in areas that are harder to 
access.  Currently there is approximately 230,000 to 250,000 
cubic metres of timber being harvested annually on what will be 
Nisga'a land under the final agreement.  The Nisga'a have 
concluded that if this cut is reduced to 115,000 cubic metres, it 
could be sustained for 250 years with regeneration.  At the 
current rate it is not sustainable.  The sustainable rate of 
115,000 cubic metres is not, however, a large amount of timber by 
British Columbia standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke with the Nisga'a people they indicated that they 
will be looking at harvesting timber at the sustainable rate of 
115,000 cubic metres as established in the treaty.  At some point 
in time however, they may wish to pursue other options such as 
investing in timber resources off Nisga'a land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the Nisga'a final agreement explicitly states 
that the Nisga'a nation, a Nisga'a village or a Nisga'a 
corporation will not establish a primary timber processing 
facility for 10 years after the effective date of the treaty. 
This provides for a window of time for Nass Valley timber users 
to develop their own agreements with the Nisga'a nation or find 
other suppliers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another section of the Nisga'a final agreement that has 
relevance in relation to the provision I just mentioned is the 
ownership of water.  Under the agreement, British Columbia will 
establish a Nisga'a water reservation, in favour of the Nisga'a 
nation, of 300,000 cubic decametres of water per year from the 
Nass River and other streams wholly or partially within Nisga'a 
lands.  This represents 1% of the average Nass River flow and 
should enable the Nisga'a people to pursue some industrial 
applications where industrial water use is required.  That will 
further their economic development opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty was negotiated on the basis of a nation to nation 
concept.  It also recognizes the inherent rights of aboriginal 
people, in this case the Nisga'a, and the PC Party recognizes the 
inherent right of aboriginal people to be self-governing. This 
treaty meets those expectations and establishes certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at what is happening in the fishery on the 
east coast to understand the importance of signing treaties.  The 
Supreme Court of Canada in Delgamuukw and now in Marshall has 
shown that aboriginal and treaty rights are important rights for 
aboriginal people and all Canadians.  An exercise in these rights 
can influence activities of both aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now in Nova Scotia there is a lot of controversy over the 
introduction of aboriginal fishers into the fishery and how this 
is going to be accomplished while maintaining the fishery for 
non-aboriginal fishermen and protecting the resource.  These are 
complex questions and there are no easy answers. Fishers, both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal, with the help of the federal 
negotiator, are in the process of finding answers to these 
questions and figuring out how to proceed to implement the 
supreme court ruling of September 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the help of the federal negotiator in 
this case has really not been productive.  What has happened is 
that non-aboriginal fisheries representatives, aboriginal fishers 
and chiefs and councils have met and, as a side agreement, have 
actually worked out and negotiated a temporary agreement for the 
time being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty did this same process in reverse.  Instead of 
asking the court to determine what rights they have over what 
resources, and having to sit down after the fact to negotiate 
some kind of an agreement, they negotiated their own treaty.  The 
federal and provincial governments sat down with the Nisga'a 
people.  They carefully reviewed all of the issues that are 
needed to allow the Nisga'a people to become self-governing, 
while at the same time settling a land claim and allocating 
resources.  Anyone involved in the east coast fishery can attest 
to the perseverance such an effort must have entailed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to bring attention to the fact that the 
Nisga'a treaty is a final document that has already been accepted 
by the Nisga'a people and the B.C. provincial government. 
Furthermore, this treaty cannot be changed.  The final agreement 
has been signed by the federal government and is now the 
ratifying legislation that is before us.  The legislation can be 
amended, but the treaty is not part of the constitution; instead 
being recognized and affirmed by the constitution.  Therefore it 
does not require the acceptance of the provinces to do so. 
Instead the three parties to the agreement have the opportunity 
to amend the treaty should it be necessary to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning, there has been a lot of dialogue 
already on this treaty.  It has taken more than 100 years to 
arrive at this final goal for the Nisga'a and there has obviously 
been opportunity for them to evaluate and determine what they are 
looking for and how this treaty recognizes those goals.  As well, 
the Nisga'a people have been very accommodating in terms of 
explaining the treaty and answering any questions I have had on 
provisions within the final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all of my colleagues to contact the Nisga'a people 
should they have questions on this treaty.  At the same time, 
however, it concerns me that the debate on the Nisga'a treaty may 
be cut off.  As I said, the Nisga'a people have had 100 years to 
formulate and determine what objectives they are seeking in a 
treaty and now other Canadians need time as well to evaluate what 
is involved.  I recognize that the Nisga'a people are anxious to 
begin what will be a new opportunity for them, but a reasonable 
and informed debate should encourage acceptance by people who may 
not completely understand what is entailed by this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the more positive results of the final agreement 
is that it removes the Nisga'a people from under the auspices of 
the Indian Act.  No longer will the Nisga'a land be reserve land 
under the Indian Act and no longer will the federal government 
determine how and when resources are extracted and developed on 
Nisga'a land.  Instead it will be the Nisga'a people themselves 
who will make these decisions.  They will have to live with the 
consequences and surely they will make some mistakes, but so did 
the federal government.  The opportunity to have the freedom to 
make those decisions and to become self-reliant outweigh any 
downfall that may result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people have been preparing for self-government for a 
long time and they have stressed to me that they welcome the new 
opportunities that await them.  They are anxious to begin and 
this process in the Parliament of Canada represents the final 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to an informed, reasoned and unlimited debate on 
this treaty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is almost impossible to know where to begin after that speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made the presumptuous statement that there was no 
need for a referendum in British Columbia.  That issue is before 
the courts, but he has decided for the courts.  Obviously he 
knows best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about a nation to nation concept.  I wonder if he 
believes that the Nisga'a nation constitutes a sovereign nation 
on the same basis as the country known as Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about conclusive agreements and things such as that. 
Let him talk to the residents of Burnt Church.  All of his 
soothing words will not help there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not a race based government, then what is it?  Is it a 
public government bill?  It is not a public government bill.  It 
applies only to the Nisga'a and no one has a choice as to whether 
they are a member.  It is based on their race.  I certainly 
cannot stand by and listen to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says that it is non-constitutional.  Does he 
understand the treaty to be under sections 25 and 35 and that the 
government portion of the treaty forms part of the agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would like him to answer is this.  What is his 
stand on a referendum for the residents of B.C., notwithstanding 
the fact that he has already made the decision for the courts of 
British Columbia?  The Nisga'a had a vote because the legislation 
affects them.  That is fair.  But does it not affect all British 
Columbians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say that the treaty is too complex to be understood 
by laypersons.  The average British Columbian could not possibly 
understand it.  Does the hon. member agree with that statement? 
Would he deny everyday rank and file British Columbians a say on 
a treaty which is going to affect them and be the template for 
more than 50 other treaties of a similar type?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wrote down six 
questions.  I might have missed one or two, so I will start with 
the nation to nation concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It completely and utterly astounds me that Reform members of 
parliament can stand in the House and continually talk about the 
constitution of Canada and the charter of rights and freedoms and 
fail utterly to understand how they apply to Canadian 
citizenship, to Canadians and to aboriginals in the country.  It 
is totally amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we will have an opportunity to continue this debate. 
Quite frankly, I look forward to that because there are a number 
aspersions that have been put forward by the Reform Party of 
Canada that simply do not hold water and will continue not to 
hold water.  They need to be looked at and explained one at a 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning a referendum for the people of British Columbia, the 
B.C. legislature approved and ratified the treaty.  It decided 
there would not be a referendum for the people of British 
Columbia.  That is the reason there has not been a referendum in 
the province.  It has nothing to do with the Parliament of 
Canada.  I would suggest that it is improbable, impossible and 
even immoral that the entire Canadian nation should vote on this 
matter.  This is not a matter for the people of Ontario, Quebec, 
Nova Scotia or any other group to dictate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deal with first nations in the country on a nation to nation 
basis.  We may not like that.  We may not approve of that. Every 
individual member of the House may have individual thoughts on 
that, but first nations are protected under the constitution and 
we deal with first nations on a nation to nation basis.  We deal 
nation to nation with 630 first nations.  That is why we have 
this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone wanting to look at the Burnt Church issue will find that 
it is directly the result of the lack of dealing with the 
aboriginal issue in the country, the lack of a modern treaty, the 
result of going back to something that was established in 1760 
and the result of those laws being forced upon Canadians in 1999 
by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants to think that we only accept supreme 
court decisions when we like them.  A person going to court runs 
the risk of losing his or her case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We allowed the Supreme Court of Canada to decide an issue 
concerning Burnt Church and the Donald Marshall decision in Nova 
Scotia that should have been negotiated between the Mi'kmaq 
chiefs and the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, P.E.I. 
and Newfoundland.  It should never have been in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Delgamuukw the supreme court clearly stated that it is not 
the place to settle every issue and difference in the country, 
that we should be negotiating in good faith to settle 
differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty is protected by the constitution, but it does not 
affect or change the constitution.  That is how it applies.  The 
hon. member should read it over and understand how it is affected 
by the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is complex.  Not for one moment has the Progressive 
Conservative Party said that it is not complex.  However, let us 
be very clear when we state that we approve of full and open 
debate in the Parliament of Canada and that we do not approve of 
closure on this bill or any other bill.  We support clear, 
informed and open debate, and will continue to do so.

Speaker, on behalf of the people of Selkirk—Interlake I would 
also like to say that this issue is so major for every Canadian 
that I do not agree with deciding it in undue haste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If debate is limited, how can Canadians understand what is going 
on with this issue which involves the Nisga'a people?  I believe 
it does have broader implications for the rest of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I support negotiating treaties with aboriginal first nations 
people.  In my riding there are lands being purchased to add to 
reserves, which is not causing any problem other than minor 
questions over some tax issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Nisga'a treaty, it seems like the Nisga'a 
people have had their say, which is good, but I do not understand 
why the other aboriginal people who live in the vicinity of the 
Nass Valley have not had their say.  I do not understand why we 
are rushing through this debate and why Canadians are being asked 
to sit quietly in the dark while the Liberal government, which 
was not elected on this issue, purports to be able to speak for 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties, in essence, can only be entered into on a nation to 
nation basis.  In view of that, it is incumbent that we have a 
full debate here and that the Canadian people fully understand 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not agree that a full understanding by all 
Canadians and a full agreement by all Canadians would ensure a 
peaceful future, not only for the people of the Nass Valley but 
for their neighbours and in fact all Canadians across the 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that all Canadians 
need to fully understand this treaty and its implications.  I 
support informed, full, clear, open and continued debate on this 
issue.  I stated earlier that the Progressive Conservative Party 
of Canada does not in any way, shape or form support closure on 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake had several other 
questions.  One of them I had a bit of difficulty following, but 
it certainly was a bit of a contradiction.  He stated that he 
supported dealing with first nations on a nation to nation basis, 
and I think the hon. member has a full understanding of how the 
constitution of Canada applies to first nations and the fact that 
we do deal with the 630 first nations in Canada on a nation to 
nation basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he also thought that the Nisga'a referendum should have 
had some dialogue or something in the process to allow for 
comments.  Perhaps he was talking about overlapping land claims 
or other first nations who live in northern B.C.  If we accept 
the theory that we deal with first nations in Canada on a nation 
to nation basis, then we cannot say that other first nations 
should have some say in the treaty that we formulate and go 
forward with for the Nisga'a.  We cannot have it both ways.  It 
can only be one way or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing to understand is that the charter of rights 
and freedoms will still prevail.  The constitution of Canada will 
still prevail.  The Nisga'a government will be a municipal style 
of government with some provincial rights and some federal 
rights.  At the end of the day we will give the Nisga'a people an 
opportunity to move forward, to go into the second millennium and 
have their rightful place as equal partners in the Canadian 
federation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very proud to be here to show my support for the proposed 
legislation to ratify the Nisga'a final agreement.  I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Malpeque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most impressive characteristics of the Nisga'a treaty 
is the balance it achieves.  The Nisga'a people have 
demonstrated, over more than 20 years of peaceful negotiations, 
that they approach issues from a balanced perspective. 
They have sought to resolve their disputes through discussion, 
mutual understanding and give and take.  This same approach is 
reflected throughout the treaty. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to speak about one area of the Nisga'a treaty 
where it was particularly important to achieve such a balance and 
where the parties were successful in doing so.  The treaty not 
only protects the rights of the Nisga'a people, but it also 
respects the rights of those who are not Nisga'a citizens who 
will live on or within Nisga'a land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians, we are very fortunate because our country is the 
best place in the world in which to live.  In great part that is 
because of the importance we place on democratic values and our 
willingness to celebrate and respect each other's differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Respecting the rights of the Nisga'a, as well as the rights of 
those who are not Nisga'a but who will live on or within Nisga'a 
land, was one of the key objectives sought by the government in 
negotiating the treaty.  The Nisga'a have been living in the Nass 
Valley and looking after their own affairs for a very long time 
and we tend to forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the treaty, we are agreeing on practical arrangements 
that provide the Nisga'a with an appropriate form of 
self-government within the context of our Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government is for the Nisga'a people.  It is 
designed in a manner so that they will have the opportunity to 
protect their culture, their language and their property.  As 
such, it is different from other local governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where other local governments are elected by all residents in 
their area of jurisdiction, under the Nisga'a treaty only Nisga'a 
citizens may vote to elect Nisga'a government members. There is a 
very good reason for this.  Using a residency criteria to 
determine Nisga'a electors could erode the protection the treaty 
is designed to provide.  If at some future time residents who are 
not Nisga'a citizens become the majority, they could effectively 
control the Nisga'a government and make decisions regarding the 
allocation or disposition of treaty entitlements. As far as I am 
concerned, that would defeat the purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing for such a possibility would be incongruent with the 
spirit and intent of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 
which recognizes and protects the existing aboriginal and treaty 
rights of the aboriginal people of Canada.  Only the Nisga'a 
themselves should have the right to determine Nisga'a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we all live in a democratic country.  The 
individual rights of Canadian citizens are also protected by the 
Constitution Act, 1982, including the charter of rights and 
freedoms.  While the Nisga'a treaty provides an opportunity for 
the Nisga'a to protect their culture, language and property, this 
is balanced with protection for the rights of those who are not 
Nisga'a but live on Nisga'a lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, the rights of all residents on Nisga'a land 
will be protected by the charter of rights and freedoms which 
will apply to the Nisga'a government as it does to the other 
governments in Canada.  Residents of Nisga'a lands who are not 
Nisga'a citizens will not be deprived of their right to vote. 
They will continue to be eligible to vote in federal, provincial 
and regional district elections.  They will also have the right 
to vote for and become members of elected public institutions 
which affect all residents of Nisga'a lands, such as the school 
boards and health boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final agreement also provides other specific rights to 
residents of Nisga'a lands who are not Nisga'a citizens.  For 
example, they have a right to be given notice and provided with 
relevant information when the Nisga'a government intends to make 
a decision which might significantly and directly affect them. 
They also have a right to a reasonable period of time to prepare 
their views for presentation to the government who must then give 
full and fair consideration to those views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat that those living within the boundaries of Nisga'a 
lands who are not Nisga'a citizens have the right to a full and 
fair consideration of their views.  That is not all. 
All persons living on Nisga'a lands will have the same procedures 
available to them for appeal or review of administrative 
decisions of Nisga'a public institutions. These protections are 
far stronger than those now provided under the Indian Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also deserves to be noted that not all Nisga'a law-making 
authorities will apply to those who are not Nisga'a citizens but 
who live on Nisga'a land.  For instance, while Nisga'a law-making 
powers over traffic control will apply to all residents of 
Nisga'a land, Nisga'a law-making authority in the areas of social 
services and adoption will only apply to Nisga'a citizens. This 
only makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, even though those who will reside on or within 
Nisga'a land but who are not Nisga'a citizens may receive certain 
benefits of services from the Nisga'a government.  The treaty 
does not allow the Nisga'a government to tax them.  Contrary to 
statements made by those who oppose the treaty but do not seem to 
know too much about it, the Nisga'a government will only have a 
treaty right to tax Nisga'a citizens and only on Nisga'a land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every aspect of the final agreement has been examined in great 
details to ensure that the rights of those who are not Nisga'a 
citizens are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example can be found in the chapter on administration of 
justice which provides for the establishment of a Nisga'a court. 
A Nisga'a court can only operate if it is similar to a provincial 
court and approved by British Columbia in accordance with the 
treaty.  The Nisga'a treaty specifically states that the Nisga'a 
court cannot impose on a person who is not a Nisga'a citizen a 
sanction or penalty that is different in nature from those 
generally imposed by provincial or superior courts in Canada 
without that person's consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the negotiation of the Nisga'a treaty, federal and 
provincial negotiators briefed and consulted extensively with the 
residents of the Nass Valley and others who have interests within 
the area proposed to be Nisga'a land.  Their views were taken 
into account in concluding the final agreement.  None of these 
private properties will become Nisga'a land.  Canada's policy is 
that private lands are not on the table during treaty 
negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the final agreement requires that the Nisga'a 
government, on the effective date of the treaty, grant 
replacement interest to all those who have property interests in 
areas of Nisga'a land before the treaty came into effect.  Not 
only will these interests be replaced but they are protected from 
expropriation by the Nisga'a in perpetuity under the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will see that great care was taken during the 
negotiation of the Nisga'a final agreement to ensure that the 
rights of all residents on Nisga'a land continue to be protected 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the Nisga'a track record, over more than 100 years 
stands in testimony that the Nisga'a deal with their non-Nisga'a 
neighbours in a fair and respectful manner.  This high regard is 
reflected in the recent words of Chief Joseph Gosnell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a citizenship and the ability to participate in Nisga'a 
government is not restricted to persons who meet the eligibility 
criteria.  Nisga'a government has the authority to grant 
citizenship to people, extending to them the rights and 
responsibilities of all Nisga'a citizens.  The Nisga'a insisted 
on this power in recognition that there will be residents who are 
in every meaningful way full members of the community and should 
be included in the democratic functions of the Nisga'a 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for the Nisga'a to prosper and attract economic 
development, their laws and decisions must be open and 
transparent and their administrative policies on review and 
appeal procedures clear and fair to all.  The Nisga'a final 
agreement provides a sound basis for the Nisga'a to complete 
those objectives.

know of her deep interest and personal involvement in the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a deal, the Indian Act, Delgamuukw and the Marshall 
decision are all part of an ethos that the rest of the House 
agrees with but that we in this party do not, for many reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not seem odd to her that the money and the resources 
from the Nisga'a deal will go to the collective rather than to 
the individual?  We have seen that half the budget, $3.5 billion, 
has gone to over 600 bands in the country.  There has been 
widespread mismanagement by many of these bands, but not all, and 
the people on the bottom are being excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Pacheedaht reserve in my riding, the chief is being 
excluded from knowing what is happening on the reserve in terms 
of some very important decisions.  When he asked the department 
to intervene on his and his people's behalf, the department said 
that it could not because the leadership would not let it. The 
people on the bottom are being excluded because they do not have 
the power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not think that in order to achieve economic 
emancipation one requires political independence?  Does not the 
Nisga'a deal, along with the Marshall, Delgamuukw and all of the 
other decisions in the envelope, represent the balkanization of 
Canada?   How does she square the Nisga'a deal with being a 
template for decisions dealing with aboriginal treaties and 
demands by aboriginal people across the country?   How are we 
going to pay for it?   How are we going to ensure that together 
we will be able to move forward with an economic future that will 
provide certainty, power and a brighter future for both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to 
understand that to this day aboriginal people have not been given 
a fair opportunity to exercise their rights within Canada. 
Unfortunately we have to make agreements and treaties in the 
modern day scenario to ensure that the aboriginal people who have 
rights within the constitution have some mechanism other than 
what we have today to exercise those rights properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Progressive Conservative member mentioned, treaties like 
the treaty in Nova Scotia have not worked to this day.  For 200 
years we have been trying a system that does not work. I am sure 
we can all agree on that.  We have to provide a mechanism so 
these Canadians can get the opportunity to govern themselves 
because they have not yet had the opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite disappointed in some of the comments I heard from 
opposition members this morning.  They do not feel these people 
can take care of their own affairs under this new treaty. I know 
from my own area that they have been doing their own governing 
for many years and they have a system that they want to implement 
for their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the systems that we have had to date have not 
worked.  We have to provide new treaties so these people can 
become participants in Canada and have the same benefits other 
people in Canada are entitled to.

are not able to care for themselves.  It is in fact just the 
opposite.  We would like to see aboriginal people across the

themselves on the same basis as all other Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as all 
members of this place are aware, fisheries is important to many 
of Canada's aboriginal people in coastal communities.  As it does 
in many other areas, the Nisga'a final agreement reconciles and 
balances the rights of the Nisga'a people with the interest of 
all Canadians.  There is a major section in the document on 
fisheries.  Most important, the Nisga'a final agreement protects 
the rich fisheries resources of the Nass Valley.  Without 
conservation all of us would suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my former capacity as parliamentary secretary to the minister 
of fisheries I had the opportunity to discuss a number of times 
with members of the Nisga'a community the importance of fisheries 
and how the Nisga'a final agreement would in fact operate.  I 
asked many questions on all areas and they were very forthcoming 
and direct in answering them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an agreement to share the fisheries resources and 
provide a certain future to everyone who relies on the fishery. 
It also recognized, and very importantly so, a co-operative role 
for the Nisga'a in fisheries management while retaining the 
overall authority of the minister to regulate all Nass fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain some of the history that has led to the 
agreement on the fisheries provisions.  The Nisga'a people have 
traditionally relied on the Nass River salmon fishery along with 
the other marine resources of the Nass area.  They continue to 
harvest salmon as well as other fish species such as halibut, 
shellfish and crabs.  Those who have visited the Nass Valley know 
how important fisheries are to the Nisga'a people and the Nisga'a 
community.  Fish is a staple of their diet and is featured at 
every feast and ceremony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1992 the Nisga'a have also taken on an increasing role in 
fisheries science.  Through the prize winning Nisga'a fisheries 
program, developed in consultation with Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans scientists and funded through the aboriginal fisheries 
strategies, the Nisga'a have been contributing to fisheries 
management activities for Nass River salmon stocks.  A joint 
technical committee of Nisga'a and department of fisheries staff 
co-ordinates the Nisga'a fisheries program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of these activities is the fishwheel program which 
tracks the number of sockeye salmon returning to spawn.  Since 
1994 the Department of Fisheries and Oceans began using these 
estimates to manage Nass sockeye.  Before then it was quite 
common for many more sockeye to escape than were needed on the 
spawning beds.  The Nisga'a effort has helped the department to 
manage commercial harvests to catch as many fish as possible 
while still meeting its conservation targets. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1977 to 1992 over 800,000 sockeye salmon that could have 
been safely harvested swam past the fishing fleet and on to the 
spawning beds.  Those fish are there for the future.  This 
practice will benefit all those who make a living the from Nass 
sockeye fishery, including commercial fishermen.  Other Nisga'a 
programs also provide valuable information to help manage and 
conserve salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Nisga'a were awarded the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans management prize for these efforts.  This is what we mean 
when we talk of fishery stewardship.  It is a very good place to 
begin an enduring relationship such as the one the treaty 
establishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a moment about conservation.  I said that the 
Nisga'a final agreement places conservation first.  Let me 
explain how.  The final agreement plainly states that the Nisga'a 
right to fish is subject to conservation.  For salmon, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans can set minimum escapement 
levels necessary for the health of salmon stocks below which the 
Nisga'a may not fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Canada and the Nisga'a wanted to continue the good work of 
the Nisga'a fisheries program.  In this treaty Canada has agreed 
to contribute $10.3 million to the Nisga'a $3.1 million to create 
a trust to promote the conservation and protection of Nass area 
fish species.  The careful monitoring of returning salmon runs 
required by the Nisga'a final agreement will provide the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans with the information he needs to act to 
protect that fisheries resource, if action should be required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservation remains the first priority.  The salmon allocations 
contained in the final agreement are based on a percentage of the 
return to Canada, subject to a conservation limit and capped at 
higher run sizes.  These salmon allocations are based on a modest 
increase over the current harvest levels by the Nisga'a.  For 
example, the allocation for the most valuable species, sockeye 
salmon, will be 10.5% of the return to Canada, capped at 63,000 
fish.  There is no uncertainty here.  It will be 10.5% and that 
is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final agreement precisely sets out the Nisga'a share of the 
Nass River salmon fishery, regardless of changes in the 
population of Nisga'a, long term changes in the abundance of 
salmon or other factors.  Everyone will know the rules.  There 
will be room for all users of the resource.  It is extremely 
important that everyone knows the rules and that they are laid 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A separate harvest agreement which is not part of the treaty 
provides for commercial allocations of pink and sockeye.  When 
there are commercial fisheries for these species the Nisga'a will 
have a share.  The share for sockeye salmon is 13%.  The Nisga'a 
share will have the same priority as commercial and recreational 
fishers; no more and no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important feature of the certainty we all seek is the 
accounting system set out in the final agreement.  It ensures 
that the Nisga'a catch is consistent with their share and that 
the Nisga'a do not harvest from other people's shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fisheries is one of the most important economic 
opportunities the final agreement provides to Nisga'a people. The 
salmon harvested under the harvest agreement can be sold in 
accordance with laws which regulate the sale of fish and with the 
terms and conditions set out by the minister in the Nisga'a 
annual fishing plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fish harvested under the Nisga'a treaty entitlements may only be 
sold when commercial fishermen can also sell those Nass salmon 
species.  I should also mention the Nisga'a have indicated that 
proceeds from a portion of their commercial harvest will be used 
to support their fisheries stewardship activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty and the harvest agreement result in some reallocation 
over and above the current Nisga'a harvest.  To ensure that the 
fishery continues to be viable for other fishers, the additional 
Nisga'a harvest will be offset by a voluntary licence retirement 
program.

British Columbia's north coast will not go down as a result of 
the treaty.  As I have said, we have protected the interest of 
all Canadians through the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be clear, let me state again that the Nisga'a final agreement 
confirms the minister's continued authority for the management of 
fisheries and fish habitat.  The Nisga'a have an advisory role as 
members of the joint fisheries management committee.  This will 
provide recommendations to the minister to help facilitate 
co-operative planning and management of Nisga'a fisheries.  There 
is nothing that limits the minister's ability to seek and 
consider the advice of others in the use of this resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a fisheries will be regulated by the fisheries act, the 
regulations, and the annual Nisga'a plan approved by the 
minister.  The fishing plan will include the timing, the method 
and the location of the harvests.  The fishing plan must be 
integrated as necessary with conservation plans and the fishing 
plans for other users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compliance with the Nisga'a annual fishing plan will be 
enforceable under the fisheries act and under Nisga'a law. 
Federal and provincial enforcement personnel can enforce Nisga'a 
law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we all agree that the current treaty process has not 
worked.  We also agree that the rights of aboriginal people have 
been excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  Is the Nisga'a treaty not 
just an extension of our segregationist Indian act of today? 
Would not a better way of improving the health and welfare of 
aboriginal people, with which every member of the House would 
agree, be by not empowering the group selectively but by 
empowering the individual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only by empowering individuals and giving them the tools to 
stand on their own two feet will they have a chance of 
contributing to their families and their communities.  This will 
enable them to get back the pride and self-respect that are 
essential for them to move forward with the rest of us to a 
brighter future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not be ensuring that aboriginal people have the same 
municipal powers as everybody else, the same rights under the 
laws as everybody else, and the same individual rights as every 
Canadian?  Should we not be ensuring that aboriginal people will 
be able to share in that like everybody else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think members can see 
the putdown and the background of where the Reform Party is 
coming from on this issue through that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about aboriginal people moving forward with 
the rest of us.  This is an agreement that talks about moving 
forward together.  I was talking about the fisheries management 
agreement as an area where we work together in co-operation with 
the Nisga'a nation so that we as a whole country move forward. We 
are not in that situation as we have seen by going to the supreme 
court on the Marshall decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an agreement worked out with the Nisga'a people so that 
we can all make better use of the resources and share in the 
resources of the country.  Canada as a whole should be better off 
as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  There are still approximately three minutes

</I></B></P><P align=left>Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among

prevent breast cancer in the future.

the government to increase its commitment to develop more 
research into breast cancer.

for breast cancer.  Women who have breast cancer should make sure

This is a real crisis.  One expert is not hesitating to blame 
Parks Canada for the disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, the government has tabled a bill to create marine 
conservation areas, for which Parks Canada would have 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government think about adding to the

the federal taxpayer should not either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government to even consider for one minute spending one 
more dime of tax revenues to bail out the NHL would be a 
monumental travesty of justice when thousands of farmers are 
going bankrupt in the worst farm crisis since the depression.  If 
the government helps millionaire hockey players and owners out of 
a currency imbalance but will not help farmers out of an 
international subsidy war, then something is terribly wrong in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put additional tax dollars into pro sports before food, 
health, education, housing or yes, even some tax relief, would 
push Canadian priorities so far out of balance that voters would 
never forgive the Liberals' stupidity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own polls say tax aid for pro hockey is the 
lowest spending priority for Canadians.  Some 94% in my own 
riding survey opposed subsidizing the NHL more than the millions 
we already provide to it. One fellow said it best:  “Farm aid, 
yes; hockey aid, no”.

the minister responsible for homelessness secretly hired 18 new

A million dollars could have provided shelter for 30,000 homeless

million on staff or to help provide shelter for 30,000 Canadians?

to his law practice afterward working with the firm of Borden and 
Elliot and in 1961 helped form the firm of Wahn, Mayer, Smith, 
Creber, Lyons, Torrance & Stephenson, now known as Smith Lyons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I asked the member for Davenport who had served in 
his constituency association in 1964 about his remembrances.  He 
felt that Mr. Wahn served a valued role as a parliamentarian. He 
called him a small <I>l</I> liberal of the first order with a true 
understanding of democracy.  He said that Mr. Wahn had a skill 
for organizing community meetings and citizen fora and for 
explaining and obtaining feedback on some of the most complex 
issues that affected the country.  He had regular meetings from 
November until June each year with invited colleagues from 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was viewed as a first rate bridge between Ottawa and Toronto. 
He had a highly developed social conscience which resulted in 
effective representation on behalf of his constituents on issues 
such as pensions, disability and services for immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in the services for new immigrants that he made a huge 
impact. The Deputy Prime Minister reminded me that a large number 
of the constituents in St. Paul's in those days were of Chinese 
origin.  Mr. Wahn would say that some of his constituents thought 
he was Chinese but when they found out that he was not Chinese 
they voted for him anyway.  I think he had earned his stripes in 
the way of immigration services and by being an excellent 
constituency representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we now strive for antidotes to the cynicism and apathy about 
government, politics and politicians, we must endeavour to look 
to the example of the true constituency MPs like Ian Wahn. Every 
day he demonstrated a true respect for the role of the citizen in 
a working democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for St. Paul's, the success of Ian Wahn in the 
area of citizen engagement and social justice provides a daily 
inspiration to me.

died at the age of 83. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A native of Saskatchewan and a lawyer by profession, Mr. Wahn 
served in Holland and Germany during World War II.  From 1962 to 
1972, he made his career in federal politics.  He was elected 
four times to represent the Toronto riding of St. Paul's as a 
Liberal, defeating Progressive Conservative Roland Michener, who 
would go on to become Governor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his political career, Mr. Wahn's interests included 
finance, justice and industry. 
During his last term of office, he chaired the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and External Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a tribute to his father, one of his two sons spoke of his 
charisma, his kindness and his consideration for others.  His 
greatest desire was to help correct what he felt to be wrong. 
It was therefore not surprising that he introduced bills that 
reflected his social vision with respect to abortion, divorce, 
birth control, and immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I pay tribute to a politician 
who, for ten years, devoted his energies to the service of his

country's call and served in Holland and Germany with the Queen's 
Own Rifles of Canada during the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the war he worked as a lawyer.  He worked on such projects

the House from our members, he won the respect of both sides with 
his outstanding character, kindness and diligence.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NISGA'A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK238">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-9, an 
Act to give effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the Nisga'a treaty, which is arguably, in my 
opinion and in the opinion of many of my colleagues, one of the 
most important bills the House will ever deal with, certainly the 
most important bill that I will likely deal with as a 
parliamentarian in my time in office and in my time in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to the Nisga'a treaty in previous debates in the 
House at length.  I have talked about many different aspects of 
it.  I could go on today to talk about such issues as the costs 
of the treaty.  The government originally tried to persuade us 
that the cost of the treaty would be $200 million.  It now admits 
that it will be $500 million.  However, an independent study 
indicates that in fact it is probably more like $1.3 billion and 
counting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about such issues as resource allocation and 
forestry concerns in British Columbia.  People in the forest 
industry have reviewed this agreement and they say, contrary to 
what the government says, that this agreement does not provide 
certainty, does not provide a level of comfort for the forest 
industry and in fact creates greater uncertainty than existed 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about fisheries issues, such as the creation of a 
new Nisga'a only commercial right to fish, which will be 
exclusive.  We have said to the government in the past that we 
have no objection to increasing Nisga'a participation in the 
fishery, but do it the right way, do it by buying existing boats 
and licences and conveying those so that everybody is 
participating on a level playing field, rather than creating a 
Nisga'a only right, based on blood lines, which will give the 
Nisga'a exclusive access to a resource which other Canadians will 
be denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to refuse to listen.  It will not 
listen to advice from the official opposition.  It will not 
listen to British Columbians.  It does not care what British 
Columbians think.  In an interview two days ago the minister said 
that this is not an issue about British Columbia, it is an issue 
that goes beyond British Columbia.  We do agree with him on that, 
but the immediate impact is going to be felt in that province, 
which happens to be my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that he frankly does not care what British 
Columbians think, he is going to ensure that this treaty passes 
anyway.  That is the height of arrogance.  How does this 
government expect to win public support for this kind of 
initiative when the minister of the crown who is responsible for 
the treaty displays that kind of attitude? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about other issues, such as the fact that the 
agreement grants the Nisga'a central government legislative 
supremacy in at least 14 areas that go beyond the reach of this 
parliament or the provincial legislatures.  Consider that for a 
minute.  It goes beyond the reach of this parliament.  That means 
that for all times Nisga'a laws will prevail over federal or 
provincial laws in the event of a conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our friends in the Bloc Quebecois have certainly picked up on 
this.  In an interview yesterday the member who is the aboriginal 
affairs critic for the Bloc Quebecois said they are supporting 
the treaty largely because they see very interesting similarities 
between the Nisga'a treaty and what they see as their vision of 
sovereignty association for Quebec with the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will rightly deny the Bloc and the PQ that kind 
of relationship, that kind of accommodation, but it will provide 
it to the Nisga'a people in northern B.C. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government truly believes it is a good idea, is it 
prepared to offer the same accommodation to Lucien Bouchard as it 
has offered to the Nisga'a people and the Nisga'a government in 
northern B.C.?  Is the government prepared to offer that exact 
same accommodation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there is no way that the government would offer that 
same accommodation.  If it is good enough for B.C., why is it not 
good enough for Quebec?  I will tell the House that the 
government will never go down that road when it comes to Lucien 
Bouchard and the sovereignists in Quebec, but it certainly is 
going down that road in British Columbia.  The implications are 
enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on to talk at length about that.  I could talk about 
the unconstitutional nature of the treaty.  There are two 
separate legal challenges in British Columbia right now, with 
more coming.  At the heart of this agreement is the 
constitutionality of it.  The federal government, by agreeing to 
convey and cede legislative authority in 14 areas, is doing 
something that it has no constitutional right to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would refer members of the House to a Supreme Court of Canada 
decision which was rendered in 1950 in the Lord Elgin Hotel case 
in which the supreme court said that the constitution of Canada 
does not belong to parliament, it does not belong to the 
provincial legislatures, it belongs to the people of this country 
and the parliament of Canada has no right to cede legislative 
authority in any area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sections 91 and 92 of our constitution exhaustively set out 
legislative jurisdiction and authority in this country between 
the federal government and the provinces.  The Liberal government 
is trying to use extra constitutional means to get around that to 
provide supreme legislative authority to the Nisga'a central 
government in at least 14 areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that is a mistake.  It flies in the face of what the 
Supreme Court of Canada said in 1950 in the Lord Elgin Hotel 
case.  It flies in the face of what Canadians said in 1992 when 
they said no to the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not really care about what Canadians think 
and what Canadians say.  That is obvious.  Ever since the 
Charlottetown accord was defeated the government has been 
constructing backdoor ways of doing all the things in the 
Charlottetown accord that Canadians said no to.  That is what 
this Liberal government is about.  As a Canadian I am very 
offended that the government would act in that manner.  I know 
that people in British Columbia are extremely offended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members that in the debate on the Charlottetown 
accord in my province of British Columbia, leading up to the vote 
on the referendum, the major consideration for many British 
Columbians in deciding whether to accept or reject the 
Charlottetown accord was the aboriginal self-government 
provisions that were contained in that accord.  If that clause 
was not contained in the Charlottetown accord it is very likely 
that support for the entire concept would have been much higher, 
certainly in British Columbia and maybe in many other areas of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is intent on constructing, brick by brick, the 
Charlottetown accord in the face of Canadians who said no to it. 
I do not understand how the government could be so arrogant as to 
do that, but that is what it is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about how this is going to affect individual 
people.  I heard the minister of Indian affairs say two or three 
times that the Nisga'a treaty is a way of bringing the Nisga'a 
people into Canada.  I have to ask myself the question:  Where 
were they before the treaty?  Were they outside Canada?  I do not 
think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday evening I happened to have an opportunity to have 
coffee at the Vancouver airport with a lady by the name of Mazie 
Baker, who is a member of the Squamish band.  She had the same 
questions for me.  She heard the minister of Indian affairs 
saying that this was a way of bringing the Nisga'a people into 
Canada.  She asked:  “Does that mean I am not a Canadian?  Does 
it mean that until the Squamish band signs a treaty with the 
federal government I am not a Canadian?”  She was always under 
the impression that she was a Canadian and she wanted me to ask 
the minister on her behalf whether she was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand how the minister could make a statement like 
that without thinking about how it would impact and how it would 
get people like Mazie Baker thinking.  Mazie also asked me, as 
many other native women have in British Columbia, why the 
government is prepared to concentrate power in the hands of the 
Nisga'a central government or any government to the extent that 
it has.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a problem that does not exist with native people alone. 
We have the problem nationally.  We always have to implement 
checks and balances whenever we have governments to ensure that 
power is not too closely held.  As a matter of fact, that is one 
of the main planks of the Reform Party's policy.  We think that 
power is too concentrated in Ottawa.  We have some constructive 
ideas about how to decentralize and spread that power base out 
over a wider area, rather than having it concentrated in the 
PMO's office like it is right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grassroots people ask us why the federal government is prepared 
to ignore our rights as individuals in favour of collective 
rights only.  They have no problem with the concept of collective 
rights, but they want their individual rights to be recognized. 
They ask what they will get out of the treaty process as an 
individual, whether they will be able to own a piece of land and 
make personal decisions about what to do with that land with 
their family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to know if they will get some kind of cash benefit 
that will be real and meaningful which they can use as a means of 
getting a head start and maybe starting a small business.  They 
say that they will not get that.  What they will get is a 
government above them which will have a tremendous amount of 
power and control over resources, land, cash and so on.  They are 
not happy with that prospect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked to native women from across Canada, but particularly 
in British Columbia.  I met in the spring with Marilyn Buffalo, 
who is the head of the Native Women's Association of Canada. 
Marilyn expresses the view very well that aboriginal women in 
Canada, particularly those who live on reserve, do not enjoy very 
much in the way of rights.  They certainly do not have the same 
rights as non-aboriginal women living off reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of a marriage breakdown, a non-aboriginal woman has 
the protection of the law for access to the marital home and a 
guarantee that she is half owner of family assets, including the 
marital home.  On reserve, because there are no private property 
rights, there is no opportunity to ensure that those rights are 
guaranteed for aboriginal women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of a marital breakdown, most often it is the woman 
and children who are out on the street.  The Nisga'a treaty, 
which is supposed to address the problems existing today in 
Canada, does nothing to address that.  I argue that it will make 
it infinitely more difficult in the future for the federal 
government to correct the situation, if it ever chooses to do so, 
because of the legislative authority that will be granted under 
this agreement for all time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear from native people all the time concerning their rights 
and the lack of accountability which they encounter.  Many times 
we get calls, letters and faxes from grassroots native people 
living on reserve asking for our help.  We have received serious 
questions and in some cases serious allegations about the misuse 
of band funds, the misuse of assets and about nepotism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they write a letter to the minister of Indian affairs he 
writes back telling them it is a matter for the band to resolve. 
The government takes a hands off approach, but at the same time 
that same ministry is directing huge blocks of funding into that 
same band leadership with very little in the way of strings 
attached or accountability.  Most often the grassroots people who 
we hear from have difficulty getting the money together to make a 
phone call because they are so broke.  They do not have resources 
and they are not getting access to the resources on reserve. 
They are not getting the accountability they are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the government time after time ignores 
the pleas and cries for help from those people.  In having coffee 
Friday evening with two members of the Squamish Band, Mazie Baker 
and Wendy Lundberg, I could sense their level of frustration when 
they asked “Why is it that when we write to the minister it 
falls on deaf ears?  Why is it that we cannot be heard?” 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They came to Ottawa in the spring when Bill C-49 was debated to 
testify before the Senate committee on aboriginal peoples.  They 
tried to encourage the Senate to make amendments to that 
legislation which would protect their rights.  They made a very 
cogent presentation to the Senate and to the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
Both committees ignored them.  Their rights were not protected. 
The amendments they proposed were not accepted.  They travelled 
all the way here and went back empty handed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are still crying out for help.  They want their individual 
rights respected and protected but they are not getting it.  They 
have told me they have looked at the Nisga'a agreement.  They see 
it as a further entrenching of the status quo, making it 
infinitely more difficult to ever see their individual rights and 
the individual rights of other people respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly we see grassroots Nisga'a people writing letters to 
the editor and expressing their views.  When the ratification 
vote took place it was a mere two months after the deal was 
publicly unveiled.  Until that time it was secret deal.  Neither 
the grassroots Nisga'a people nor the rest of the non-aboriginal 
people in British Columbia had any real idea of what the deal 
contained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had a period of only eight or nine weeks after the deal was 
unveiled to consider an agreement that was 220 to 230 pages long, 
with 400-odd pages of appendices, before they were required to 
vote on it in a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the vote showed that just over 60% of 
the Nisga'a people supported the deal.  It is very important for 
members of the House to be reminded that many Nisga'a people had 
trouble with the agreement for one reason or another and did not 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond me why the government wants to think of the Nisga'a 
people, or any aboriginal band for that matter, as some kind of 
homogeneous group that thinks the same way, wants the same things 
and agrees on the same set of principles, conditions and so on. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  They are every bit as 
much individual as we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me to the main point I want to make.  The government 
and previous governments have encouraged aboriginal people over a 
long period of time to see themselves as separate and apart from 
the rest of Canada, to the extent that aboriginal people, 
particularly aboriginal leaders, look at the principle of 
equality as some kind of a threat or negative thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfortunate.  Nothing could be further from the truth. 
True equality is not only the best way to preserve harmony in 
society.  It is the very best way that we know of to guarantee 
democratic rights to individuals, to provide individuals with 
economic opportunity, and to ensure that native people are 
treated in a manner that allows them to get on with their own 
lives and to make personal decisions about what they want to do 
instead of being herded on to reserves and told that if they want 
to be identified as a Nisga'a, as a Tsimshian or a Tsuu T'ina 
they have to live on reserves with no property rights and in 
abysmal conditions.  That is the only way they can maintain their 
identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that equality is about equality in law and allows plenty 
of room to respect and celebrate cultural differences.  I do not 
think there is a person in this place who does not respond to the 
fact that we as Canadians have a very rich heritage. 
The unique languages, customs and traditional dress of aboriginal 
people are part of our Canadian culture.  We see it expressed in 
many different ways, but celebrating one's cultural diversity 
should not lead to segregation in law, which is what the federal 
government's position has been for a very long time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As my leader pointed out this morning in his speech, in 1968-69 
the federal Liberal Party under the leadership of Pierre Trudeau 
seemed about to break from that kind of thinking.  It seemed to 
be on the verge of a new way of proceeding forward but lost its 
courage.  In losing its courage it has broken faith with 
grassroots aboriginal people.  Many of the very serious and 
abysmal conditions we see on reserves today could have been 
avoided had the Liberal Party not done that.  We urge its members 
to reconsider following through on 19th century thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my leader said this morning, we should think outside the box 
and look for another alternative that puts individual rights over 
collective rights and puts the opportunities that may be accorded 
by the federal government in the hands of individuals, not in the 
hands of collectivities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
having listened to the member for Skeena I find it incredible 
that so much misinformation continues to come forward from that 
member and other members of the Reform Party.  There are many 
contradictions in the arguments they put forward in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few moments ago we heard the member for Skeena state that 
he and the Reform Party believe that aboriginal people such as 
the Nisga'a people should get on with their own lives and that 
they should be treated with respect, dignity and equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member, his leader and other members of the Reform Party 
really believe that, why would they deny the Nisga'a people the 
treaty when they finally sat at the table as equals with respect, 
dignity, due process and open public process to negotiate the 
treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the Reform Party is absolutely hypocritical 
in its approach to this question.  On the one hand the Reform 
Party claims to be upholding the rights and equality of 
aboriginal people, but on the other hand it is prepared to 
sabotage the agreement.  I would like the member to comment on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite astounding this morning to listen to the leader of 
the Reform Party say that he wanted to show another way for 
treaties in the future.  He wanted the Nisga'a people to adopt 
what in effect was the market ideology.  That is what he was 
calling on the Nisga'a people to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member believes in the individuality and rights of 
aboriginal people, surely he must admit and acknowledge that they 
have their own position, history, experience and arguments to 
determine their own future.  Why would the Reform Party say that 
it is its way or no way, that it is the market ideology or 
otherwise the Reform Party will trash them?  I would like the 
member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I reject the suggestion 
that the Reform Party, myself personally or anyone connected with 
the party is intent on trashing anyone.  That type of 
mischaracterization is not at all helpful to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as one objects to a policy direction of the government 
when it comes to aboriginals or immigration, it seems the conduct 
of its members is to come after one's personality, character, 
motives and morals.  They question those because they do not want 
to debate the substance of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to correct the record for the hon. member who has 
spoken about public forums.  There were no public forums in 
advance of the treaty being unveiled, none whatsoever.  I happen 
to live in the area for which the treaty was negotiated. 
We begged the negotiators to bring this process out into the 
open.  They said no.  They had signed a document that secretized 
this process and they said they would stick to that.  They would 
not make it public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of market ideology I know the hon. member, being a 
member of the NDP, is firmly committed to socialist doctrinaire, 
but surely she must recognize that this doctrinaire has failed 
everywhere it has been tried in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times do we have to see failure before we get to the 
point where we say maybe it does not work?  Why would the 
Government of Canada be encouraging an economic system that is an 
obvious failure everywhere it has been tried and be foisting it 
upon the Nisga'a people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the hon. member should consider very carefully that 
what is in the long term best interest of the Nisga'a people is 
something that works.  Surely after 132 years of policies and 
treaties that do not work members of the House should be 
interested in something that does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would make one further point.  If treaties were so good for 
aboriginal people, one should be able to make the argument that 
those parts of Canada covered under treaty and all the aboriginal 
people there should be better off than in British Columbia where 
they are not covered by treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member's benefit, if she has not visited reserves 
in other parts of Canada, they are not better off.  I would argue 
that in many cases they are worse off where they have treaties. 
She should not tell us that treaties are the answer.  They 
certainly have not been the answer for 132 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I sense 
that the member for Skeena cares deeply about these issues, but 
I wonder whether his information is accurate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago the member told us about aboriginal women and 
how they did not have equal rights.  I would like to remind him, 
or perhaps even inform him because I am not at all sure he has 
read the treaty, that the rights of aboriginal women are fully 
protected under Canada's legal framework through the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about subsection 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 
1982, which guarantees treaty rights equally to men and women. 
Let us also not forget that the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms applies to all decisions of the Nisga'a government.  All 
decisions have to be accepted in an indirect way through the 
charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind him that political rights are 
provided equally to men and women under the Nisga'a final 
agreement and the Nisga'a constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and this is also an important part, federal and 
provincial human rights legislation will apply to the Nisga'a 
government and to the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about marital breakdown.  Unfortunately it happens all 
too often.  In the case of Nisga'a men and women the British 
Columbia family relations act will determine the division of all 
matrimonial property, and not Nisga'a law.  We see once again 
that Nisga'a women, just as Nisga'a men, are protected by the 
constitution of Canada, by provincial laws and by Canadians laws. 
I would like the member to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
her questions.  I believe by the tone of her comments that she is 
truly interested in this subject as well.  I thank her for that. 
I would like to respond to her questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of women's rights it is true the agreement says 
that provincial jurisdiction or provincial laws will apply.  The 
hon. member has to understand that before there can be a division 
of marital assets there has to be a property right attached to 
them.  Right now on reserves in Canada it is the band council 
that decides who will live in which house because those houses 
are not individually owned by anybody.  They are owned by the 
band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a potential for the creation of some kind of private 
property right in the Nisga'a agreement but there is no 
commitment to it.  Without that commitment we cannot guarantee 
those matrimonial rights to Nisga'a women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about charter rights.  Yes, it does say that 
in the agreement, but that is something the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development in my view is using to mislead 
or misrepresent the agreement.  The preamble to the Nisga'a 
agreement states that the charter of rights and freedoms will 
apply.  That is true.  We certainly concede that.  It is there in 
black and white, but we must also understand that section 35 of 
our constitution recognizes and affirms aboriginal rights.  Those 
are collective rights.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 25 of our constitution requires the courts to take into 
consideration those rights in the event of a conflict between the 
charter rights of individual Nisga'a people and the collective 
rights of the Nisga'a as a people.  It is not only that the 
courts must take that into consideration, but they must give a 
higher priority to the collective right over the individual 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the member to get out her constitution and read section 
25 and section 35.  It is very easy to come to the conclusion 
that our charter rights are put in peril by the section 25 
requirement of the courts to say that section 35 will trump 
individual rights. I urge her to take a look at this because it 
is very important.  If we do not do that, then in five, ten, 
fifteen years from now we will see that the fallout from that 
will be some court cases that are going to be seen to be patently 
ridiculous by most Canadians.  Nisga'a individuals will be losing 
challenges at the supreme court when their charter rights are 
violated.  They will not be on the same level playing field as 
all other Canadians.  That is really unfortunate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to speak to the House today in support of Bill 
C-9, the bill introduced by the government to implement the final 
Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people live in the Nass valley in northwestern 
British Columbia and have lived there for hundreds if not 
thousands of years.  When the European settlers reached their 
land, they found a well-organized and self-governing society. 
That society met its own needs by harvesting the abundant 
resources of the land on which it lived and by trading with its 
neighbours.  It boasted a rich culture and traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When British Columbia became a province and joined Canada in 
1871, aboriginal people made up the majority of its population, 
yet they had no recognized rights in the political decision 
making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of the Indian Act resulted in the introduction of a 
band-based administrative regime being imposed upon the first 
nations, which were henceforth required to submit to close 
supervision by federal representatives.  Potlatches were also 
outlawed by the government, despite being a tradition at the 
core of the political and social system of the first nations. 
As well, children were separated from their families and sent 
far away to Church residential schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these dramatic changes, the Nisga'a and other first 
nations of British Columbia have survived as a culture and as a 
people. 
They cherished their traditional values and their identity and 
held on to their profound belief that they still held the rights 
of ownership over their traditional lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as 1880, the leaders of the first nations demanded 
treaties that would establish a fair relationship between their 
people and governments.  The Nisga'a were at the forefront among 
the first nations of British Columbia in exerting pressure on 
the governments to negotiate treaties.  I would remind the 
members of this House that the Nisga'a have always used 
diplomacy and peaceful means to achieve this end, even though 
governments continued to reject their requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1927, parliament amended the Indian Act to make it illegal 
for Indians to spend or collect money in order to advance their 
claims. 
Thus, native people were denied a right enjoyed by all other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these provisions of the Indian Act were repealed in 1951, 
the first nations began again to organize themselves in order to 
pursue their claims for recognition and the ability to negotiate 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968, the Nisga'a, under the leadership of the chief at the 
time, Frank Calder, initiated proceedings in the courts that led 
in 1973 to a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada.  In this 
decision, which was extremely important, the court found that 
the Nisga'a could have had ancestral titles at the time before 
settlement.  However, the justices were divided equally on the 
matter of the continued existence of these titles.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to this decision, the federal government adopted a 
policy on global land claims, and in 1976 began negotiating a 
treaty with the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982, when the Canadian constitution was patriated, the 
rights of the native peoples of Canada were finally recognized. 
Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, recognized and 
confirmed the existing ancestral rights and the treaty rights of 
the native peoples of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, section 35 does not contain a definition of the rights 
included in “existing ancestral rights” that remain to be 
determined through negotiation or recourse to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of these treaties is to reconcile the historic 
rights of native peoples with a contemporary context, 
recognizing that they were living here and governing themselves 
before the arrival of the Europeans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, Canada's native peoples have unique rights, which are 
protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  These 
unique rights have to do with their earlier occupation of this 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who claim that the Nisga'a treaty establishes a government 
that creates inequality should take a closer look at what it has 
really accomplished.  This treaty spells out clearly the rights 
the Nisga'a will have in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was pointed out that Canada's first nations were among the 
most disadvantaged groups in our society.  In all areas, 
especially literacy, employment, health and development, 
conditions in their communities were far below Canadian 
standards.  It is inexcusable that a group of persons should be 
at such a disadvantage in a country like Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty will help ensure that the Nisga'a truly have 
access to the benefits and privileges to which they are entitled 
as Canadians, while retaining their identity as aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Nisga'a treaty accomplishes.  This treaty 
recognizes that the history of the Nisga'a precedes the 
establishment of Canadian sovereignty and it does so in a manner 
fully consistent with the equality provisions of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It confirms the unique rights of the Nisga'a, while respecting 
the rulings of the highest courts of the land.  In so doing, it 
establishes a fair balance between these rights and the 
interests of other Canadians and makes these rights an integral 
part of Canada's constitutional and legal framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, Canada is not a country where native peoples must 
stop being native peoples in order to be Canadians.  By means of 
this treaty, we will show that it is possible to be Canadian, 
while continuing to live in the Nisga'a culture.  That is my 
vision of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty establishes the rights of the Nisga'a in a number of 
areas, particularly those having to do with land and resources. 
It also sets out a practical set of legislative rights to which 
the three parties to the negotiations, the federal and 
provincial governments and the Nisga'a, have agreed. 
The Nisga'a government will be subject to the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, and the Criminal Code of Canada will 
continue to apply on Nisga'a territory, as will federal and 
provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative jurisdictions set out in the treaty are designed 
to enable the Nisga'a to protect their culture, their language 
and their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equal rights for women, for example, will be protected by both 
the Charter and the treaty itself, regardless of what the hon. 
member has just said in his speech.  Provincial divorce 
legislation will also continue to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a Final Agreement protects the rights of the Nisga'a 
while recognizing the rights of the non-Nisga'a.  The legislative 
powers of the Nisga'a will be restricted by the provisions of 
the final agreement, which will also guarantee that special 
mechanisms are in place to protect the rights of the non-Nisga'a 
living on Nisga'a land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criticism that this treaty gives the Nisga'a the power to take 
away the rights of other Canadian citizens is simply absurd. 
For example, the final agreement calls for the Nisga'a to be 
entitled to a water reserve. 
This water supply represents only 1% of the average flow of the 
Nass River.  In order to use this water, the Nisga'a must apply 
for a permit from the British Columbia government as any person 
must.  Anyone can apply to use the other 99% of the flow.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards fisheries, the Nisga'a's treaty guarantees the 
sharing of this resource between the Nisga'a and Canadians.  In 
fact, under the provisions on fisheries in the Nisga'a treaty, 
the Nisga'a's right to fish is itself subject to preservation 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for example, conservation measures required a moratorium on 
fishing, the Nisga'a would not fish, even for domestic purposes, 
because the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has the final say 
on managing fisheries in the Nass region. The Fisheries Act will 
continue to apply to both the Nisga'a and other fishers.  In 
each of its provisions, the Nisga'a treaty protects the rights 
and interests of all those who work and live in the Nass region 
or visit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows very well that ratification of the Nisga'a 
treaty is the step that must be taken in order to look to the 
future rather than remain prisoners of the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague on her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all members are aware, we are joining with the government 
majority in supporting the Nisga'a treaty, because we believe 
that it is only fair to do so. We certainly believe that the 
treaty is fair. It will offer the protection of a number of 
important pieces of legislation, including the Criminal Code, to 
which my colleague referred. 
The treaty interests me because I have already had an 
opportunity to discuss it when I was a member of the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, of which I have very 
fond memories.  Unfortunately, I must inform the member that I 
will no longer be serving on this committee. I can see her 
disappointment already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for her is this:  The Nisga'a treaty recognizes the 
right to a form of citizenship for Nisga'a residents. I myself 
introduced an amendment to the Citizenship Act in the previous 
parliament asking that citizenship in Quebec be recognized. As 
members know, there is such a thing as Quebec citizenship. We 
wanted this amendment so that we could present explanatory 
material about it during swearing-in ceremonies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Setting aside her somewhat indecent haste, I ask my colleague 
whether she would agree to support such an amendment,  since the 
Nisga'a are being allowed a form of citizenship. I think it 
would be only right to recognize citizenship in Quebec as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Madam Speaker, the only response I can give 
to the hon. member is that when we were both on the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration, we disagreed on various issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, what I am here for is to answer questions on the bill 
before the House, and that is the only answer I can give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the hon. member's question is not relevant to the 
debate we are having in this House today, but I will be pleased 
to meet with him in private to discuss citizenship and 
immigration issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for her 
intervention and her analysis of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that concerns me.  This is the first modern 
day land agreement where self-government rights are actually 
contained within the land claim agreement. 
As a result of this, section 35, as it has been interpreted by 
the supreme court, means that the rights contained in the land 
claim agreement can never be unilaterally reclaimed in the future 
by the government that gave these rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>From these rights flows the ability to create legislation. Up 
until this point, legislation has been the prerogative of the 
federal and provincial governments only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member square this with the government's claim 
that there is no constitutional amendment through the back door 
when through this means the constitution will be irreversibly 
affected without the consent of the province, according to the 
amending formula? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
understanding of this clause is not the same as that of the hon. 
member who has just spoken.  He tells us the federal government 
will not have the possibility of reclaiming the lands it has 
just confirmed as belonging to the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a treaty is finished, it seems to me it is good for life. 
In other words, it is an agreement between the Nisga'a of 
British Columbia and the Canadian government.  I do not see what 
pretext the Canadian government could use to go back on its 
word, to go back on its signature and withdraw terms of a treaty 
it had agreed to sign with the Nisga'a people. In my opinion, 
there is no question of the government going back on its 
decision. 
Once legislation has been enacted, that is that; it must be 
respected.  I cannot see any reason whatsoever for reference to 
the constitution.  This treaty will be given effect by this 
House without any recourse to the Constitution of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe the member 
has missed the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government already has an agreement with the 
provinces and with Canadians in the constitution that there is an 
amending formula.  Now it has made an agreement to a different 
amending formula without referring to the constitutional means of 
doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot have it both ways and still square its 
actions.  Canadians have a right to expect that the constitution 
will only be amended according to the amending formula agreed 
upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now see in this treaty that there is a means of amending the 
constitution without the proper amending formula.  In my mind, 
this is amending the constitution through the back door, not 
through the regular means that the provinces and the Canadian 
government have agreed to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on this.  This is a 
bastardized way of dealing with the constitution that is 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B>  Madam Speaker, the fact that I do not 
agree with the hon. member does not mean that I do not understand 
the hon. member's question.  I understood it clearly enough, but 
I disagree with the conclusion that he draws from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have said is that this is not a constitutional issue. The 
fact that I did not see it as being a constitutional issue does 
not mean that I have misunderstood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement that will be signed in the House and passed as 
legislation in the House does not necessitate directly or 
indirectly an amendment to the constitution of Canada.  I can 
only repeat that so many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member has made his own interpretation of the 
law, but that is his interpretation.  It is not my interpretation 
nor the interpretation of my party or the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam  Speaker, I will 
share my time with the member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP supports the treaty.  The major problem that we see is 
that as a treaty it will not be honoured.  We just had the 
example before us in the supreme court where the Marshall 
decision came down over a treaty from 1760 because that treaty 
was not honoured. 
The Northern Flood Agreement was a treaty that was not honoured 
and it forced native people into dire poverty when there was 
great wealth made off an appropriation of their land and 
resources.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We see treaties as a devolution of power which is bringing power 
down to the grassroots level and putting it in the hands of the 
people who are directly affected by decisions being made.  This 
will help the Nisga'a people because that is what they need. They 
need power, they need their land and they need their resources to 
be able to get on with their lives and make decisions on how they 
will carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are going to see as soon as the treaty is ratified is 
the whole implementation process.  As I said, my biggest fear is 
that the implementation will force the Nisga'a people back into 
negotiation and that they will, in fact, have to take that to the 
court in order to have their treaty implemented as was desired. 
That is the biggest fear I have and I hope that does not happen. 
I believe that as Canadians we should be honouring treaties; that 
Canadians do not see themselves as conquerors; that in effect we 
have to make compensation for what was taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian people of this land had a race-based decision made in 
favour of them.  That legislation was the Indian Act.  It took 
away their language, their land, their culture and even their 
children.  What we did was kick them out of their home and 
through negotiations we basically said that maybe they could come 
back into the basement.  We said that we would make a little room 
but that they should not expect too much.  I think that is a real 
shame on our part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly believe Canadians want to make reparation and 
compensation for the wrongs that were done, wrongs that can never 
be changed.  We cannot give them back their children or their 
land, but the least we can do is give them back some of what they 
held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On an international level, what Canada is doing is not all that 
wild or crazy as some members of parliament would have us think. 
There is the Nordic autonomous regions which are self-governing 
areas within Denmark and Finland.  They are based on the 
historical and ancestral rights of a different culture within a 
country.  They have their own parliament and some have their own 
flags, their own stamp and their own government. They are in 
charge of making laws that will determine the destiny of their 
people, but they do not have power over foreign affairs, defence, 
or the monetary system.  Their federal or state government will 
pay for any decisions that they implement.  The Governments of 
Greenland, the Faro Islands or Aland must therefore come up with 
money that they need to implement the laws that they have 
instituted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the group of islands, known as Aland, their citizenship 
is determined by birth, by language and by culture, and they have 
to be able to speak the language of the people.  If someone wants 
to become a citizen he or she has to stay on Aland for at least 
five years and be able to speak the language adequately. 
Interestingly enough, a person can lose his or her citizenship 
there if he or she leaves for a period of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the world there is a wide variety of approaches to 
accommodating different cultures and different groups within a 
larger body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a national level, when it comes to treaties and the 
recognition of different cultures, different language and 
different histories within Canada, we have recently seen the 
creation of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon recently signed an umbrella final agreement which 
began the implementation and the final claims agreements of the 
14 first nations, with 8 of them having been completed and signed 
off self-governing agreements at this point.  They are 
governments with land, with laws and with the ability to decide 
how they will educate their children and how they will carry on 
as a group and have community rights.  This was fought quite 
bitterly in the Yukon.  It was through my whole generation that 
the claims were negotiated to get to a point where we could make 
real change for the first nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since these claims have been signed, the sky has not fallen in, 
the world has not gone to pieces and the first nations people and 
non-first nations people get along better than ever.  The ability 
for a people to set their own ways and determine their lives has 
made a big difference for everybody in the Yukon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming closer to the Nisga'a treaty, it actually fits in very 
well with the document by the former minister of Indian affairs 
entitled <I>Gathering Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action 
Plan</I>, which was to say that we would negotiate rather than 
litigate.  Again and again we are seeing that every time first 
nations people go to court it costs them and their people.  That 
is money being diverted away from education and health and into 
the courts, a place where nobody wants to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the very clear decisions of the supreme court, it has 
become more and more important to negotiate, rather than letting 
the courts make very black and white decisions over people's 
lives, decisions where repercussions, such as we have seen on the 
east coast over the Marshall decision, can be avoided.  The 
really harmful reactions and violence by desperate people could 
have been avoided if our government had been willing to negotiate 
before it got to a crisis point.  Unfortunately, it is certainly 
not over on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision should give us a warning that it is 
critical to respect treaties that were based on friendship and 
peace.  They were not based on anyone being conquered.  They were 
based on the philosophy that we would share the land.  Obviously 
the pilgrims and settlers who came to North America were not 
going back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty states that the Nisga'a people can make laws but only 
for the Nisga'a people.  They can only tax Nisga'a people.  Their 
laws will not apply to anyone who is not a Nisga'a, nor can they 
tax anyone who is not a Nisga'a person. There are laws such as 
travelling on highways that will apply to non-Nisga'a residents. 
This only makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be dealing on a nation to nation basis with the Nisga'a 
people.  They will not be lesser than.  By getting rid of the 
Indian Act, they will no longer be people who are considered 
unworthy to even make their own wills, to have marriage 
ceremonies and to make even the most basic decisions over their 
lives that so many of us take for granted but which have been 
denied to them.  Historically, they were not even seen fit to 
vote in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The really good element of the treaty is getting rid of the 
Indian Act and empowering the Nisga'a people to get on with their 
lives and to live their lives in dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the legislation coming before the committee 
and to having a very close look at every detail of it before it 
is ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party wholeheartedly supports the vision of 
the Nisga'a people, of the provincial government and of the 
federal government that would negotiate the treaty in order to 
free these people to live their lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am honoured to speak in the House today on what is truly a very 
historic occasion, the first day of debate on the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague, the hon. member for Yukon, for her very 
thoughtful comments, particularly as they relate to the 
international situation concerning aboriginal land and what has 
taken place in other jurisdictions.  She has shown us, in a very 
thoughtful way, that what is happening here in Canada is very 
much in context with what is taking place in other parts of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a person from British Columbia, I must say that the work, 
endurance and patience of the Nisga'a leadership and the Nisga'a 
people has really been outstanding.  They have been negotiating 
the treaty for more than 20 years.  For more than 100 years, they 
have been moving through a process, sometimes with huge conflict 
and huge oppression, to get to get to this point today.  The 
leadership that has been shown and the support that has come from 
the grassroots of the Nisga'a people is something that really 
makes this a historic occasion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin my remarks by quoting Nisga'a Tribal Council 
president Joseph Gosnell.  Yesterday as he arrived in Ottawa he 
called on the Reform Party leader to ensure that the members of 
the Reform Party caucus stopped making incorrect allegations 
about the Nisga'a treaty which is currently before parliament.  I 
thought it was very significant that the tribal council president 
was making this statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the role of the official opposition is to 
oppose government initiatives— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of our democratic tradition.  He continued: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and we have no fear of a genuine debate in parliament.  However 
we also believe that it is the responsibility of all members of 
parliament to provide accurate information, and not to attack the 
Nisga'a treaty on the basis of allegations that are just not 
accurate. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to read that into the record because I had hoped that 
on the opening day of debate of this historic treaty that it 
would be an honourable debate, that it would be a debate where 
yes, there would be criticisms and there would be issues, but it 
would be a debate based on facts and real information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the leader of the Reform Party, the Leader of the 
Opposition, chose not to listen to the wise words of the Nisga'a 
Tribal Council president. What he and the hon. member for Skeena, 
the Reform Party spokesperson on aboriginal issues, chose to do 
less than an hour ago was to continue their campaign of 
misinformation and allegations of grossly inaccurate information. 
They chose to continue a campaign of fearmongering and 
divisiveness within the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say shame on the members of the Reform Party for doing 
that.  Shame on them for not sticking to the facts and having an 
honourable debate in the House.  What they chose to do today is 
really a contempt of this process and of parliament.  I wish it 
had not happened that way, but that is the way it seems to be 
going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to debate and have an intelligent criticism, but 
it is something quite different to deliberately manufacture and 
peddle misinformation and completely false allegations about this 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go over a couple of things that were said this 
morning by the Leader of the Opposition.  First, he said that it 
was their sole interest to establish a new and better 
relationship with the aboriginal community, among the aboriginal 
community.  Then he went on to say that it is not in the long 
range interests of the Nisga'a people to have this treaty.  This 
was repeated by the hon. member for Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Leader of the Opposition characterized the treaty as 
being a perpetuation of a 19th century approach.  I would say 
that it is the Indian Act that is the case and the experience of 
a separate law for separate people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe I heard the hon. member in her intervention 
refer to me and say that I was deliberately misrepresenting or 
deliberately misleading.  I refer you to Beauchesne's where it 
clearly says that hon. members cannot use that kind of language 
in the House of Commons.  I would ask that you ask the hon. 
member to withdraw and apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  If indeed the hon. 
member for Vancouver East has said such a word, I would ask her 
to withdraw it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not believe I said 
such a word.  If I did, I certainly did not intend to use 
unparliamentary language, but I do believe that inaccurate 
information is being presented in the House and that is a matter 
on the record.  I certainly did not intend to use unparliamentary 
language and I will withdraw any language that I used that is 
unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go through some of the arguments that were used 
this morning by the Reform Party.  One of them was that this is a 
perpetuation of a 19th century approach. 
I want to state very clearly that I think what we have seen in 
the past through the Indian Act would represent that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else, this treaty represents a genuine attempt by all 
of the parties involved, the Nisga'a people, the provincial 
government and the federal government, to produce a modern day 
treaty within the constitution of Canada, within the laws of 
Canada, to provide self-determination and a sense of pride and 
future for the Nisga'a people. For the leader of the Reform Party 
to suggest otherwise, I believe, is a misrepresentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard from the Reform Party this morning that this 
treaty will now become the template, the one size fits all for 
all future treaties, including the 50 in British Columbia and 
however many there are in Canada.  This is completely wrong. This 
has not been stated anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty went through a very good process. I hope it is 
reproduced and used as a model for other treaties.  The treaty 
itself is something that stands on its own merit.  It is not 
written in this treaty or in any other policy or legislation that 
it will be replicated.  I want to put that to rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard that the Nisga'a treaty will somehow mirror what 
has been a very tragic situation with the fishing industry on the 
east coast, that we will see a parallel with the Nisga'a treaty. 
Again the Reform Party is dead wrong in the line it is peddling 
on that.  The Reform Party is misleading people and presenting 
information that is simply not the case.  In actual fact, this 
treaty clearly outlines that if other groups are prevented from 
fishing for whatever reason, then that will also apply.  It is 
clearly very erroneous information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard from the member for Skeena that this treaty is 
going to cost a huge amount of money.  I think he mentioned the 
figure of $1.2 billion.  I may have that slightly wrong but it 
was of that magnitude.  Again I want to say that this information 
is inaccurate and simply not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty provides for a total of $253 million in a one time 
payment over 15 years from the federal government to the Nisga'a 
people.  There are also contributions from the B.C. government in 
terms of a land value of $108.6 million and $37.5 million in 
forgone forestry revenues.  Again, the arguments are false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard that this has been a secretive deal and a closed 
door process.  This treaty had many public hearings and fora. 
More than 40 hearings alone were held by the parliamentary 
committee in British Columbia. Anyone who wanted to be heard 
could state their case and opinions on this treaty.  Again, it is 
misinformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we do have a choice here.  We have a 
choice to negotiate treaties in good faith in our modern day 
world and recognize aboriginal people as full citizens, or we can 
continue with chaos and litigation in the courts.  I think most 
members of the House have made the correct decision.  It is 
unfortunate that the Reform Party has chosen not to do the 
honourable thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank the member for her intervention and her ongoing 
intelligent and clear thinking on this matter and her study of 
the issue.  She is representing an alternative view in British 
Columbia from the one that we have heard repeatedly from the 
Reform Party on this bill and a number of other bills relating to 
aboriginal and first nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a woman from British Columbia and a member of parliament, she 
is addressing issues generally from her constituents but more 
broadly for people from British Columbia as well.  I say this to 
her because the Reform Party keeps alluding to the fact that it 
is concerned about women, that it speaks for women's issues and 
wants to protect women's rights. I would like to quote from some 
sections of the treaty with respect to women's rights and ask her 
if she agrees with the provisions of the charter and the treaty 
or the Reform Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble of the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Nisga'a Final Agreement states that the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to Nisga'a Government in 
respect of all matters within its authority, bearing in mind the 
free and democratic nature of Nisga'a Government as set out in 
the Agreement; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 28 of the charter provides that notwithstanding anything 
in the charter, the rights and freedoms referred to are 
guaranteed equally to male and female persons.  Likewise in 
section 35 of the constitution there is a provision on aboriginal 
treaty rights.  Section 35(4) in contemplating concerns over the 
protection of aboriginal women's rights states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal 
and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed 
equally to male and female persons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member believe these provisions to protect women, or 
does she believe the Reform Party which seems to be trying to 
scare aboriginal women and women in general in British Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
across the way for his thoughtful comments. Obviously he has done 
quite a lot of research on some of the questions that have been 
raised by members of the Reform Party.  Again they are are 
speaking very loudly and on numerous occasions are somehow 
suggesting that the rights of Nisga'a women will be diminished 
under the treaty.  Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree entirely with the member's comments in terms of the 
Canadian constitution, the charter of rights and freedoms, and 
the treaty itself which clearly lays out an enhanced citizenship 
for Nisga'a men and women.  This is really what the treaty is 
about.  It is the heart and soul of the treaty to recognize full 
citizenship and full equality.  If we cannot get that straight, 
then I think Reform members need to go back to their researchers 
or wherever they get their information and check their facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first heard them put out this line that the Nisga'a 
treaty was somehow denigrating the rights of women, I was really 
shocked.  I wondered whether this could be the case.  I checked 
to find out if that was correct and of course it was completely 
false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very clear on the record that the rights of 
aboriginal women within the Nisga'a treaty are fully protected. 
The treaty itself enhances the sense of citizenship and 
participation for all Nisga'a people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member said that she feels the debate should deal in facts. 
She mentioned the oppression the Nisga'a had been under.  I would 
like her to put some factual evidence before the House to 
document the oppression the Nisga'a have suffered under the 
provincial NDP governments, the federal Liberal governments and 
the federal PC governments that have governed this country and 
that province for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, we are at this point 
today because of what has historically happened to aboriginal 
people.  This agreement is so historic because it is moving away 
from a paternal colonizing administration and legislation that 
did oppress aboriginal people in this country. The treaty will 
move us beyond that and move the Nisga'a people forward to the 
future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with another government MP. It 
is a pleasure to join the debate.  I pick up with interest and 
pleasure the remarks of the very thoughtful hon. member for 
Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that the Nisga'a treaty is not and never was a 
template. 
Government MPs spent six months telling the Premier of British 
Columbia that it was not a template, that it rested on its own 
particular historical facts.  They are very warming facts. The 
Nisga'a paddled their own canoe a long distance to Victoria. They 
waited 100 years and negotiated for 20 years in goodwill and good 
spirit, with great patience and great dignity.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to pay tribute to the Nisga'a negotiators and 
Joe Gosnell, who emerges as one of the outstanding figures of our 
contemporary public life, but also the government negotiators. 
They are not the same in the case of every treaty.  I met the 
government negotiators in this particular case and I was 
impressed by their dedication, their hard work and their open 
mindedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is a special case.  It deserves in my view 
and it deserved in the past quicker treatment than we have given 
it.  I think for more than a year after the signature is too long 
a delay considering the time that has been spent already in the 
past on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the features that are so distinctive in this treaty? 
One is the element of negotiation—and I have spoken on that and 
will have more occasion to come back to that—in good faith and 
in the spirit of goodwill.  The phrase was borrowed from 
international law.  The World Court used it.  The Supreme Court 
of Canada picked it up in a recent judgment, but it is the 
essence of the continuing process involving 50-odd treaties still 
to come in British Columbia.  We expect the parties, government 
and the Indian people, to negotiate in good faith.  The Nisga'a 
did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also expect adequate public hearings, which is a matter that 
relates to the time, the opportunity and the place.  The member 
for Vancouver East has detailed far better than I could the 
extensive character of the hearings, having regard to the 
remoteness of the area involved.  It is not a city where one can 
take a taxi from one end to another in a matter of a few minutes. 
A remarkable job was done by the House committee on aboriginal 
affairs and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also stress the fact of absence of countervailing 
interests properly proved and adduced before the relevant 
authorities who negotiated and the House committee.  That is a 
crucial issue in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would stress again the point which is in the treaty itself. 
The Nisga'a people here showed admirable self-restraint.  They 
accepted and put in the text that it is subject to the Canadian 
constitution and to the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody had any doubt on this particular point and to make 
assurance doubly sure, the government caucus from B.C., the 
senators and the MPs sought assurances from the then minister for 
aboriginal affairs and her parliamentary secretary that we would 
put this beyond any question by even the most unreasonable of 
people.  That is why there is an express mention in the enacting 
legislation by the federal parliament. Incidentally similar 
guarantees were incorporated in Bill C-49, the Native Land 
Administration Act, as a result of the representations by B.C. 
MPs and senators which were gracefully accepted by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay tribute to the former minister concerned and 
her parliamentary secretary who is still with us for listening 
and paying attention to these representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitutional issue has been raised.  It is not in my view 
relevant as an element of criticism of the Nisga'a treaty 
because, as I have explained, the matter has amply been taken 
care of, but references were made to sections 25 and 35 of the 
charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of Chief Justice Bryan who was a medieval judge. 
When people asked him about a law he said “You do not have to 
tell me what it says.  I wrote the law.  I know what it is 
about”.  It is a fact that has been noted that Senator Perrault 
and I, when the original draft of the charter appeared, suggested 
that this matter should be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it should be noted that sections 25 and 35 create no new 
rights.  They are what is called saving clauses.  They save 
rights that already exist, whether customary or under existing 
treaties.  No more, no less.  There is a Latin phrase for it, ex 
abundanti cautela, but it simply means one says what already 
exists.  One leaves it to subsequent events in a pragmatic, 
common law way to define the actual content and extent of those 
rights in concrete cases.

but when I returned I remember discussing it with the new justice 
minister who succeeded the present Prime Minister.  I said 
“There are treaties that are unknown quantities.  Is there any 
problem here?”  We agreed as a matter of interpretation that it 
would be a most unreasonable interpretation to say that we could 
change the constitution in this way.  It would be an absurd 
interpretation but we at least adverted to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in response to these sort of fears, unreasonable as they 
may be, that the B.C. caucus spent some three or four months 
discussing with the previous minister of Indian affairs and the 
parliamentary secretary the inclusion of the provisions that the 
treaty, notwithstanding that it already says it in terms, because 
of the federal enacting legislation is legally subject to the 
constitution and to the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is there.  It is part of the travaux préparatoires which 
courts must take into account in interpreting the treaty.  It has 
been said in this parliamentary debate, not merely by myself but 
I think by all members on the government side who preceded me, 
members of the New Democratic Party and members of other parties, 
that the parliamentary intent is that it is subject to the 
constitution and the charter of rights.  The words are clear but 
that it is also parliamentary intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come back to the larger issues that are involved. It is a 
historic process for B.C.  It is the first B.C. treaty.  How 
fortunate that the people involved in it, the Nisga'a people, 
were reasonable people, and that they negotiated in good faith. I 
expect similar behaviour or similar conduct from those involved 
in the subsequent treaties.  It was a model of negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect is that it is not simply a negotiation in good 
faith.  It is also the concept of good neighbourliness.  It is a 
phrase that the English court of appeal threw out in 1935, that 
one must act in relation to one's own rights as one would expect 
them to be applied if one were a neighbour.  The World Court has 
picked up the concept of good neighbourliness.  It is also by the 
way part of the French civil law, but it returns again I think in 
the context of the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an appreciation here that there is no such thing as 
absolute rights which are conceived in a vacuum.  All rights 
exist in a social context.  It is a recognition that there may 
need to be the balancing of rights with other rights.  I think it 
is the core of the Nisga'a negotiation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are into concepts of comparative equity when good citizens, 
good neighbours work together and try to work things out by 
negotiation if there are differences.  If there are differences 
they cannot surmount then the effect of the application of the 
constitution and the charter is that the constitutional 
principles and due process of law including judicial review are 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I anticipate that treaties such as this one will be before the 
courts over a long period of time.  I do not mean by this 
antagonistic litigation.  I mean where parties seek the advice 
and interpretation of the courts when we have what is at the core 
of the English concept of equity, a continuing process of working 
together by the parties, trying to interpret general principles 
in terms of accommodation of interests of a larger community 
which, in Canada, includes the so-called two founding nations 
that are really relatively recent arrivals, the original nations 
and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this spirit that I welcome the debate as it has emerged 
and I welcome the assurances we have had from many people 
intervening in the debate that they regard this as an optimistic 
sign.  There is no reason for fear.  This is a process of full 
community engagement that we are entered upon.

hon. member who just spoke referenced several issues that deal 
with the constitution and the charter of rights and freedoms. 
The Constitution Act, 1982 states very clearly in subsection 
52(1): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any 
law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution 
is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the constitution of Canada applies 
to the Nisga'a treaty and that the charter of rights and freedoms 
applies to the Nisga'a treaty.  That can be argued in several 
different directions and the Reform Party has done that in 
several instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member's opinion on whether or not the 
charter of rights and freedoms applies and whether or not the 
constitution of Canada applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am happy to give 
categorical assurance that the member is correct.  The 
constitution and the charter apply and to the extent of any 
inconsistency would override action to the contrary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, with respect to the question just put to my hon. 
colleague from Vancouver Quadra I would like to quote from a 
article published in today's edition of the <I>National Post</I> 
by a gentleman known to the member for Vancouver Quadra, Mel 
Smith, former principal constitutional adviser to the Government 
of British Columbia for over 15 years.  He referred to the deal 
and wrote in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents a significant diminishment of the legislative 
powers given to senior governments by the Canadian Constitution, 
to a new kind of government unknown to the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be specific, the Nisga'a agreement would make Nisga'a laws 
constitutionally paramount on at least 17 province-like subject 
matters.  This would include Nisga'a laws on: education...higher 
education...the delivery of health services, child and family 
services; business, trades and professions...land use; land 
registration; laws related to Nisga'a fish, aquatic plants and 
wildlife entitlements.  The list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Couple this diminishment and divestment of legislative powers 
with the fact that these aboriginal government rights cannot be 
retrieved in the future, and...the treaty makers have stepped 
beyond the bounds of the Constitution.  They have, in these 
respects, given away forever the constitutional right of the B.C. 
Legislature to make laws applicable throughout the province. This 
they simply do not have the right to do. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the member for Vancouver Quadra respond to the 
thoughtful argument brought forward by Mr. Smith, former 
principal constitutional adviser to the Government of British 
Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I know Mr. Smith very well and respect his 
quality as a constitutional adviser to two premiers of British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that the Nisga'a treaty involves a delegation of 
power, but it cannot override the constitutional division of 
power, section 91 and section 92, and the two levels of 
government they have created.  It does not create a third level 
of government.  The Nisga'a never asked for this, but it does not 
in any case so create. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a great honour for me as 
member of parliament for Western Arctic to rise in the House to 
participate in the important debate on the proposed bill to 
ratify the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us for ratification an historic reconciliation 
between Canada and the Nisga'a people, a people whose culture, 
language, lands and way of life predate the creation of Canada 
itself.  Indeed, the existence of the Nisga'a people and their 
rich cultures stretches back tens of thousands of years to the 
very beginning of human memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also acknowledge that since the first tentative 
intrusions by European colonists 150 years ago the Nisga'a have 
patiently asserted their right to have their collective existence 
recognized and respected.  This agreement recognizes the modest 
yet fundamental rights necessary to secure their existence as a 
people: rights to land, self-government and an economic base. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many other first nations, the Nisga'a have sought 
partnership and accommodation within the Canadian federation.  It 
has been a long and often difficult road.  The agreement 
symbolizes Canada's acceptance of the Nisga'a as an integral part 
of Canada and of the Nisga'a willingness to join Canada as 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 100 years, the Nisga'a people have patiently and 
peacefully advocated their rights.  While doing so, they have 
fought in wars on behalf of the country.  They have waited for 
the right to vote.  They have waited to have recognized their 
right to speak their own language and to freely practise their 
spiritual traditions.  They have had to struggle for the right to 
control the education of their children.  Finally, the moment has 
arrived for the Parliament of Canada to recognize, to accept and 
to welcome their existence as a people and partners in the 
federation by ratifying the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what the agreement represents is a recognition 
of the fundamental human right of the Nisga'a people to survive 
as a people and to continue to reflect their unique place in the 
human family.  This is a right protected by international human 
rights instruments. As the nations of the world have collectively 
matured, we must now recognize that colonization is the 
fundamental violation of a people's right to exist.  Today we 
understand that the collective rights to land and to 
self-government are an integral part of the right of first 
nations to express their collective identity and existence as a 
people within the constitutional framework of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are rights that people around the world are entitled to. 
Each people has a right to a measure of self-government and a 
right to economic and social development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the struggle for recognition of the rights of aboriginal 
peoples, the Nisga'a have a unique and special place in the 
history of Canada. We all owe a debt of gratitude to the Nisga'a 
people for their courage, their persistence and their leadership 
in the struggle for aboriginal rights in the country.  It is an 
important part of Canada's political development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Nisga'a people who approached the first colonial 
government in British Columbia in 1887 to seek recognition of 
their traditional land title and to suggest the negotiation of a 
treaty.  It was the Nisga'a who petitioned the privy council in 
England in 1913 for a settlement of their basic rights.  It was 
the Nisga'a who persevered through some shameful years in 
Canada's history when first nations were legally barred from even 
pursuing justice in the courts.  It was the Nisga'a who seized 
the first opportunity to resume the quest for legal justice. When 
these discriminatory laws were finally repealed, it was the 
Nisga'a who devoted time, resources and their heart and soul to 
bring the Calder case finally to the Supreme Court of Canada in 
1969. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a young girl when I was first struck by the power and the 
conviction of the Nisga'a people.  It was a turning point in my 
mind that aboriginal people are not a powerless, homeless, 
lawless and without leadership people.  I felt that power, in the 
words of Frank Calder, a great Nisga'a leader and great Canadian 
leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the Nisga'a and the Calder case, the Canadian legal 
system finally recognized that the aboriginal people have 
aboriginal title, that is, traditional collective rights to land. 
It was in response to the Calder case that the federal 
government established a modern land claims policy to create a 
process to finally seek some accommodation with the first nations 
of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many successful agreements reached under federal 
land claims and self-government policy. This agreement addresses 
both issues in a fair and balanced way. Modern agreements such as 
this one allow first nations to participate meaningfully in the 
political, economic and social development of the country.  These 
agreements allow first nations to live in Canada, not as a 
conquered peoples, but as true partners in Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is finally the turn of the Nisga'a to benefit from these 
policies and to have recognized certain basic and fundamental 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also mention that the agreement achieves the very 
important objective of providing a clear and precise legal 
framework for the exercise of Nisga'a rights.  It does so in a 
way that complements and respects federal and provincial 
jurisdiction, while allowing some space for local self-government 
by the Nisga'a people in matters that directly affect them. 
The lands of the Nisga'a will no longer be reserved under the 
Indian Act.  The Nisga'a final agreement provides for fee simple 
ownership and integration of Nisga'a tenure into the provincial 
land registry system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of natural resources, the Nisga'a final agreement 
provides Nisga'a citizens with the right to harvest fish and 
other resources subject to conservation interests and legislation 
enacted to protect public health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a may make laws relating to environmental assessment 
and protection.  Federal and provincial laws prevail to the 
extent of conflict.  To avoid duplication, the agreement provides 
for the negotiation of a harmonization agreement.  In the 
meantime, federal and provincial assessment processes will 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government will have authority to make laws in areas 
affecting Nisga'a government, citizenship, language and culture. 
The Nisga'a government will be required to consult all residents 
within Nisga'a lands who are not Nisga'a citizens about the 
decisions that significantly or directly affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example of what we have achieved, the agreement explicitly 
provides that it is a full and final settlement of Nisga'a 
aboriginal title and other rights protected under section 35 of 
the Constitution Act, 1982.  What clearer demonstration of legal 
certainty and final settlement could one ask for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen from these few examples, the Nisga'a final 
agreement provides a careful balancing of rights and powers. This 
has been achieved as a result of a thorough and detailed process 
of negotiation that began in 1976 when the federal government 
first accepted the Nisga'a claim for negotiation.  Each and every 
aspect of the Nisga'a final agreement has been carefully 
considered and discussed by representatives of the Nisga'a, the 
province of British Columbia and the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, the former Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and the current Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, have each carefully considered the 
agreement and have recommended its ratification by parliament. As 
parliamentarians and as Canadians, we can all take pride in the 
agreement and support its ratification without hesitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a have placed their faith in the Government of Canada 
to respect the agreement and to open a new chapter of our history 
together.  We must respond by ratifying the agreement and getting 
on with the business of faithfully implementing it in partnership 
with the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement lays a pragmatic and solid foundation for the 
future.  It contains the essential ingredients for a new 
relationship that the government committed itself to in 
“Gathering Strength”, our response to the report of the royal 
commission on aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement is the latest in a series of 
important settlements with first nations across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the situation of each first nation is unique, each 
successful agreement such as this one encourages first nations 
and governments all across the country to talk to and accommodate 
each other as we build the country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all parliamentarians to support the ratification of the 
Nisga'a final agreement, to recognize the strength in diversity 
and to welcome the collective existence of the Nisga'a people 
within Canada.  I extend my congratulations to the Nisga'a people 
and my best wishes for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the Reform 
Party is continually charged with misrepresentation of the facts. 
I ask the member to look at chapter 16 on taxation at page 217 of 
the agreement if the member has it in front of her.  Maybe she 
does not have it in front of her or is not familiar with it, but 
certainly we in the Reform Party are familiar with it.  Chapter 
16 at page 217, paragraph 3, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time Canada and British Columbia, together or

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is taxation without representation any way it is sliced. 
The words are in the agreement.  They are not the Reform Party's

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does she agree with that concept of taxation without

should be amended so that condition or that clause is removed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not 
believe that the agreement should be amended.  The member 
opposite should get a life.  We could nitpick about the agreement 
and various aspects of the agreement.  He should read the list of 
facts and myths.  A number of things have been alleged.  Anyone 
can read it.  It involves taxation as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member, quite honestly, is not as well intended 
as I would like him to be.  If the hon. member took some time to 
spend with the Nisga'a people, they could put a very convincing 
case to him as they have to me as an aboriginal person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years I have learned from the Nisga'a people.  Many 
people across the country have learned from the Nisga'a people, 
except for the member that represents them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I resent the hon. member 
suggesting that taxation without representation is nitpicking. I 
suggest that the hon. member read her history with respect to the 
American war of independence.  That is how the people who were in 
the colonies known as the Americas broke away from Great Britain. 
It was over that very issue.  I can say that it is a fundamental 
principle of democracy to not have taxation without 
representation.  The hon. member is not very well-schooled if she 
believes that is nitpicking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does she believe that the principle of taxation without 
representation incorporated into the agreement is the right way 
to go or not?  Could she just answer the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Madam Speaker, what I am not 
well-schooled in are the so-called principles and learnings of 
the Reform Party.  I do not come from the school of Mel Smith who 
draws the template for all Reform's agenda on the aboriginal 
people.  I am glad to say that I do not have that background and 
I never will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to say there were numerous consultations.  I am glad 
the government supports the Nisga'a agreement. If the member of

the Northwest Territories, but unfortunately not in this debate 
because she has been asked two direct questions and has refused 
to answer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is very simple.  Does she agree with the principle 
in chapter 16 of the agreement which provides for taxation 
without representation?  Does she think that is a principle which 
ought to be incorporated into laws that govern Canadian citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Madam Speaker, the Nisga'a 
people have been afforded certain responsibilities and 
authorities.  Otherwise, what would be the point?  Why have an 
agreement if there will be no difference and it will be the 
status quo? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial taxation authorities are not affected 
by the Nisga'a authority and there are no other Nisga'a 
government taxation authorities in the final agreement.  Even the 
municipalities and the school boards have the authority to levy 
taxes.  Are we saying that we will diminish the document, the 
Nisga'a agreement, to that of a school board or a municipality? 
That is his opinion and one he is entitled to, but I, frankly, do 
not believe in that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to address some of the issues 
concerning this very historic Nisga'a agreement.  I congratulate 
the last speaker, the hon. member from Yellowknife, who gave a 
very impassioned and informative debate.  I know that she feels 
integrally connected to this debate and to the people through her 
own heritage and I have a great deal of respect for her work on 
this bill and for her work in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people have roamed over the land of North America 
since the mists of antiquity.  The Nisga'a final agreement was 
ratified only this year, but the history of these people goes 
back for generations and centuries.  The Nisga'a people approved 
this agreement, as did the provincial government of British 
Columbia, when Bill 51 completed the legislative process in April 
of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that this was a process that went smoothly. 
There was a great deal of acrimony and the debate itself was 
eventually brought to closure by the British Columbia government. 
The NDP Government of British Columbia received a great deal of 
criticism over its handling of the debate.  Let us hope for the 
sake of democracy that that type of attitude is not mirrored by 
the current government in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end of the debate on the treaty occurred in a very cursory 
way some would argue.  We are hoping that will not be necessary 
here and we look forward to a detailed, informed and open debate 
in the House on Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty, as I mentioned and as previous speakers have 
alluded to, is a very historic document that will be debated, and 
it is certainly our responsibility as parliamentarians to give an 
open minded approach to all the views of all the people we 
represent in the House.  It is also our responsibility to deal 
with reality and not myth when it comes to a treaty of such 
significance.  Nor should we ever in the House try to pit groups 
of people against one another in a debate of such importance and 
of such far-reaching implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen quite recently with the decision of the Supreme 
Court of Canada in the Queen v Marshall case the implications of 
treaties that are signed.  In that instance we now realize that a 
treaty that was signed over 230 years ago has modern application 
and modern impact on the people of this country in 1999. 
Therefore, it is not a great leap of faith to say that the 
Nisga'a agreement that will be signed, ratified and passed 
through this House will certainly have the potential to affect 
future generations of Canadians and certainly the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 5,500 Nisga'a people, with approximately 2,400 of them 
living in the upper Nass Valley region of British Columbia. 
Under the treaty they will have title to 1,930 square kilometres 
of land and will receive $190 million as a cash settlement to be 
paid over a number of years.  Those are the very basic cursory 
points of the treaty.  It is a very complicated treaty that 
touches on a number of elements of everyday life and human 
existence, but the settlement itself is a step toward 
independence and self-sufficiency on the part of aboriginal 
people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement will be the first modern day treaty 
in British Columbia, but this is certainly not the first time the 
Nisga'a people have been involved in groundbreaking activities. 
This fact was alluded to as well by the previous speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a 1969 decision in the Queen and Calder v the Attorney 
General of British Columbia case, and subsequently in 1973 a 
ruling from the Supreme Court of Canada in that case, which 
opened the door to the negotiated land claims settlement for the 
Nisga'a.  It was Frank Calder, a Nisga'a aboriginal, who 
initiated the court action on the basis that aboriginal title in 
the Nass Valley had never been extinguished.  The supreme court, 
while not ruling that aboriginal title to the land actually 
existed, said that aboriginal people who had owned the land prior 
to European settlement and that had provided them with the basis 
on which to argue for land claim agreements did in fact exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government at that time realized the implications of 
the ruling and initiated a comprehensive land claim policy with 
the intent of negotiating land claim agreements where aboriginal 
people claimed they had traditionally lived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, this is often the case that we see again today in this 
country. 
It is sad that very rarely negotiations between the federal 
government and our first nations people result in a peaceful and 
equitable agreement.  More often, and I am not saying this in a 
partisan way, governments in this country tend to litigate rather 
than negotiate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I hearken back to previous comments and reference the 
Queen v Marshall, where now the country, in particular in this 
instance the east coast of Canada, has been thrown into a huge 
chasm of confusion and misunderstanding as to what rights have 
actually been granted by the Supreme Court of Canada.  I 
certainly recognize that that is a debate for another time 
between this place and the Supreme Court of Canada as to who 
should be making laws in such an important area that has such 
broad implications and such broad effect throughout the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement will be a modern day treaty in 
British Columbia and will represent the 14th in Canada's history. 
Other modern day agreements include the James Bay and Northern 
Quebec agreement, the Northeastern Quebec agreement, the 
Inuvialuit final agreement, the Gwich'in agreement, the Nunavut 
land claims agreement, the Sahtu Dene and Métis agreement and the 
seven Yukon first nations final agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reference two other pieces of legislation that 
have been debated recently concerning aboriginal people in Canada 
which share some similarities to the piece of legislation before 
the House today.  They are Bill C-39, which was an act to amend 
the Nunavut Act and the Constitution Act, 1867, and Bill C-57, 
which was an act to amend the Nunavut Act with respect to the 
Nunavut court of justice and to amend other acts in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These acts were instrumental in the creation of Canada's newest 
territory, Nunavut.  With respect to the application to today's 
debate, I would suggest there is a groundbreaking and very 
innovative approach being taken to the modern application of the 
Canadian justice system in this new territory.  Again, although 
time does not permit us to get into the greatest of detail in 
this regard, it is a very forward looking and inclusive system of 
justice that blends two of these cultures into a very workable 
and modern approach to justice in this country.  It brings about 
some of the concepts of restorative justice, which is a system 
that in many ways is borrowed from our aboriginal people, which 
is very inclusive and community oriented, the concentration being 
on including the victim and the community and having a face to 
face, in some instances confrontational, approach between the 
perpetrator of a crime and those who suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always taken a very traditional approach to justice in 
this country, borrowed from the British model, that puts the 
state in the place of the victim, often very much to the 
detriment of the victim, making it a very sterile and sometimes 
non-inclusive approach to the healing that needs to take place. 
Aboriginal people have taken a much more hands on and inclusive 
approach that I believe is the spirit of this new justice system 
that will be in place in Nunavut and, to a large degree, brought 
about by the effect of the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nunavut land claims agreement was not a self-government 
agreement at all.  Instead, it established a public government 
system that is similar to that which is in place in Nunavut 
today.  That agreement also established a judicial system whereby 
the Inuit people in Nunavut could install a system that would 
better address the objectives of the Inuit people themselves. 
There is a more inclusive blend of aboriginal or Inuit justice 
with our modern day justice system which also includes and 
recognizes that all Canadians must be bound by the same laws of 
the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very encouraging and exciting from a justice 
perspective to look at the way we are able to blend these two 
cultures and make them work in a more effective way which in fact 
enhances all Canadians.  In particular, I know that those 
involved in justice throughout the land will be watching very 
closely to see the modern application of this justice system in 
Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same can be said with respect to the establishment of this 
treaty, since the Nisga'a will have the opportunity to set up the 
Nisga'a court system. 
They may very much desire to watch closely the system that is 
just getting under way in Nunavut.  The Nisga'a nation itself 
will no doubt benefit from that experience.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of this treaty will allow the Nisga'a government 
to appoint the judges of the Nisga'a court.  The treaty will also 
provide for the means of supervision of judges of the Nisga'a 
court by the judicial council of the province of British Columbia 
or by similar means.  We are seeing a very proactive and 
inclusive approach which will allow our current justice system to 
blend with this new system of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Nisga'a people will be provided with their own 
policing services.  The police board of the Nisga'a government 
will assume this responsibility.  In all of these cases, however, 
provincial and federal laws will continue to apply.  The Nisga'a 
rules must comply and must work hand in hand with our existing 
federal laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to leave anyone with the impression that this will 
be some form of an abrogation from the law.  It is simply a 
melding of a new system of justice that will hopefully enhance 
our current system.  I would suspect that in the future other 
provinces may very well borrow some of the concepts that may come 
about as a result of the implementation of this new justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour relations and industrial relations will not be governed 
by Nisga'a law.  Instead, they will remain under the jurisdiction 
of provincial and federal legislation and apply evenly across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the remarks of the hon. member for South Shore who 
alluded to the fact that there are many merits to this 
legislation.  That is not to say that there is not room for 
improvement.  As with all legislation that is brought through the 
process and brought to this House, there will be ample 
opportunity, even by virtue of the process that we are embarking 
on today by having this type of open debate, to bring forward 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would hope that the government would be open minded enough 
to be prepared to change the legislation through ideas that might 
emerge on the floor of the House of Commons, but I suspect more 
appropriately at the committee where members of the opposition 
will sit down with the government in the normal course of affairs 
to discuss this treaty in further detail.  I know that all 
members of the opposition and the government are looking forward 
to embarking on that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people will no longer operate under what have often 
been described as the onerous and even regressive rules of the 
Indian Act.  Instead, the Nisga'a final agreement will set out in 
detail how the Nisga'a nation will continue to operate and the 
authority and accountability that the Nisga'a Lisims government 
will entail.  This is something that the Nisga'a people have been 
working toward for over 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The earlier legislation that the Conservative Party supported 
regarding first nations land management outlined exactly why it 
is important for first nations to move out from under the Indian 
Act itself, particularly in regard to areas covered under 
resource management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Indian Act first nations must request authorization 
from the federal Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development to develop resources on a reserve.  With the Nisga'a 
final agreement and the earlier First Nations Land Management Act 
this will no longer be the case and will no longer be necessary 
under the legislation.  The Nisga'a people will be able to 
determine how, when and where they will use their resources.  Not 
only will the Nisga'a people profit from this increased autonomy, 
I would suggest so too will the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forestry and mining companies that have often been very 
reluctant to invest in resource activities in recent years, 
particularly after the Delgamuukw decision which ruled on 
aboriginal title, will now view doing business in this particular 
part of British Columbia in a different light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the uncertainty that existed, which continues to exist, 
concerning who owns land and resources in much of the province of 
British Columbia, the resource industry has been very slow to 
invest in exploration and development, costing as much as $1 
billion in lost revenue because of this atmosphere of 
uncertainty.  Stability and economic confidence will hopefully be 
one of the main results in this sector of resource management 
coming from this particular bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the Nisga'a people will have a greater opportunity in 
the area of resource development, but this is only a small part 
of what the final agreement entails.  We all know that autonomy 
and the ability to be the masters of their own destiny is very 
much the wish of not only the Nisga'a people, but Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of British Columbia is subject to aboriginal land 
claims.  This will be the first agreement to combine a land 
claims agreement and self-government agreements under one 
umbrella, one that also includes taxation.  There has been much 
debate, as there was moments ago, over the issue of taxation. 
Under this agreement the Nisga'a people will begin to pay taxes 
over a phased in period of eight to twelve years.  In the long 
term this should allow the Nisga'a nation to become increasingly 
self-reliant and less dependent on the federal government for 
funding and service provision.  This is certainly a concept that 
all Canadians would embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well in the maritime provinces that a feeling of 
dependency, a feeling of being less empowered and less entitled 
to the future profits and profitability of this country is very 
intimidating and stifling. I am not drawing a direct parallel 
between those who live in the maritimes and those on first 
nations.  But I can say that this feeling of uniformly sharing in 
the country's wealth is something we should all be very quick to 
encourage.  I am hopeful that this agreement is a step in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reference very briefly the consultation.   We are 
embarking on an exercise in consultation simply by debating this, 
but I am led to believe that there were over 500 separate 
consultations before coming to the final draft and agreement 
which was inked by the Nisga'a people and the Government of 
British Columbia.  Some would argue that that is a large number 
of consultations.  However, an agreement that has such far 
reaching and important ramifications is one that requires a great 
deal of consultation.  One only has to quickly reference the 
agreement itself to realize that it is a very involved and 
detailed agreement that speaks to many of the intricacies of the 
relations that will exist between the Government of Canada, the 
people of British Columbia and the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement is without a doubt a historic 
document that details aboriginal rights for the Nisga'a people. 
It is a comprehensive and extensive outline of the rights and 
responsibilities that the three parties will be subject to once 
the agreement has been ratified, which is the road we are on at 
the present stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the 
Canadian constitution, but it does not become part of the 
constitution. There is need for clarity here as well.  This does 
not exclude the Nisga'a people from the application of the 
constitution. This does not empower them with special rights 
outside of the constitution.  This is simply an agreement that 
will be bound and subject to the application of the Canadian 
constitution and charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically reference sections 1, 15, 24 and 25 which speak 
to the general application of rights and freedoms in this 
country.  The charter speaks of rights and freedoms not being 
construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal 
treaty, or rights, or freedoms which pertain to aboriginal people 
across the country.  This is not a derivation or a step away from 
the law of the land that applies to people throughout the 
country.  The Constitution Act, 1982 will be in full force and 
effect and in the final analysis will be something that will work 
very much together with this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is recognized and affirmed by section 35 of our 
constitution.  A process for amending the agreement is outlined 
in the treaty and requires the consent of the Nisga'a nation and 
the federal or provincial governments, depending on the 
amendment.  This is an important clause. As with all agreements, 
we know that an evolution will occur.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Oftentimes circumstances will arise, court cases will appear on 
the horizon and they may exist now. It is fair to say that these 
court cases could have a devastating or perhaps a very positive 
effect on future agreements.  However there is a section in the 
agreement which speaks to the amending formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Nisga'a nation to approve an amendment, two-thirds of 
the elected representatives of the Nisga'a government will have 
to accept the amendment.  As I said earlier, the legislation 
represents what is, it is hoped, an open agreement at the end of 
the day when it comes to friendly amendments, but time will tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final chapter in the long process of this agreement is 
before us.  It is a process that began in 1887 when the Nisga'a 
people first travelled to Victoria to present their proposal for 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 court ruling in the Delgamuukw case emphasized the need 
for negotiated settlements with aboriginal people.  In Delgamuukw 
the court suggested that continued litigation was not the 
appropriate or most effective means of reaching an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement demonstrates that negotiated 
agreements can be reached and that negotiators deserve credit for 
their perseverance in continuing that long process.  As a result 
we have an agreement that is workable and which is before the 
House today. It should be seen as a signal, a positive sign for 
Canadians, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, that we should continue 
on this path of co-operation in building this beautiful country 
our ancestors have left to us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. House leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party on his very eloquent remarks in support of the 
Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I underline the point that he made with respect to the 
Delgamuukw decision.  Of course when we hear representatives of 
the Reform Party saying to scrap this treaty and go back to the 
beginning, that effectively ignores the mandate we have been 
given as parliamentarians by the highest court of the land in 
Delgamuukw to honour and respect the rights of Canada's first 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member care to comment on the suggestions that 
have been made, particularly by the member for Skeena, the member 
who has not met with leaders of the Nisga'a by the way since 
1995, long before the treaty was signed.  He has refused to meet 
with the leadership of the Nisga'a for the last three or four 
years.  It is unbelievable when he represents that community.  He 
has said that the treaty provides for taxation without 
representation.  He said it entrenches inequality for aboriginal 
women and that it provides for a race based government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the treaty itself states that the Nisga'a 
Lisims government may make laws in respect of direct taxation of 
Nisga'a citizens on Nisga'a land, full stop, and that there can 
only be taxation of non-Nisga'a citizens if the provincial or 
federal governments delegate that authority to the Nisga'a 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would like to comment on that gross 
misrepresentation by the Reform Party and also on the Reform 
Party's suggestion that in some way this entrenches inequality 
for aboriginal women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  He has a history of a long and distinguished 
career in this place.  He comes from the province of British 
Columbia, so obviously he has more insights than most on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the commentary and the statement about taxation 
without representation, I think many will find it somewhat 
offensive.  When they get into the nuts and bolts of the 
agreement they realize that there is a provision for 
representation.  The taxation scheme that is set up is a fair 
one.  Although there is certainly a nuance here with respect to 
how the taxation may differ from our current system, I would say 
that confrontation without consultation or information, which is 
at the base of some of the comments that we have heard in this 
Chamber, is equally offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing we need or that anyone should desire is to bring 
in any element of racism about this particular agreement.  We 
should be concentrating on the facts, not perpetrating mistruths 
or exaggerating effects that this agreement will have.  Let us 
talk in reality.  Let us deal with the facts that will move this 
agreement forward in a positive way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all 
the hon. member said that public consultation meetings were held. 
I do not ever recall seeing him in the northern part of British 
Columbia.  I am not aware that he has ever made a trip there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For his own information there were no public information 
meetings ever held to solicit any input from the public until the 
agreement was already announced. Then the provincial government 
had a dog and pony show that went around the province supposedly 
to get input from ordinary British Columbians.  Subsequent to 
that, not one word of the agreement changed, not one word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That public consultation was hollow.  It is the kind of 
consultation we expect from the provincial NDP government.  It is 
the kind of consultation we expect from the federal Liberal 
Party. It is interesting to see that these parties are all on the 
same page when it comes to public consultation.  It is just a 
matter of putting on a show for people and saying that they have 
consulted but they are not interested in legitimate public input 
on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member goes to the issue of taxation 
without representation.  The member is a lawyer. The member knows 
that agreements mean what they say they mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 217, in chapter 16 of this agreement under taxation it 
is stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.  From time to time Canada and British Columbia, together or 
separately, may negotiate with the Nisga'a nation, and attempt to 
reach agreement on: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a.  the extent, if any, to which Canada or British Columbia will 
provide to Nisga'a Lisims Government or a Nisga'a Village 
Government direct taxation authority over persons other than 
Nisga'a citizens, on Nisga'a lands; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absolutely a contemplation of providing the taxation 
authority to a Nisga'a government over non-Nisga'a residents 
living in the Nass Valley.  That is taxation without 
representation as the member knows full well that the non-Nisga'a 
residents living in the Nass Valley will not be able to run for 
office.  They will not be able even to vote for the 
representative they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to respond to that. Does he not agree that 
these words mean what they say they mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me start off by saying 
that I very much enjoyed my recent trip to Castlegar just over a 
month ago.  I had a wonderful visit in Victoria.  I really 
enjoyed the time I spent in Prince George as a student planting 
trees in the beautiful province of British Columbia.  I take 
exception to the member's suggestion that I am not familiar with 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the specific question of representation and 
taxation, we do know that this process and the 500 consultations 
I referred to in my remarks represent time that was spent after 
an initial agreement had been put in place. Time was then taken 
to consult, to negotiate and in some instances renegotiate parts 
of the agreement. The agreement itself in the section to which 
the hon. member has referred is not fixed.  It speaks of the 
ability for future consultation or reworking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for there being no representation, certainly the agreement 
addresses that by allowing there to be direct voting for school 
boards, for any kind of boards that are going to be set up within 
this particular region.  That is a direct ability for persons to 
vote for whom they want to represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure what the member is speaking of when he says that 
there will be no ability.  No, a person cannot vote for the band 
chief.  But a person is going to have input into those boards 
that will be regulating everyone living within that territorial 
area of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not correct to say that this is taxation without 
representation.  The representation is there.  The clauses of the 
agreement speak to future changes that might come about.  This is 
a very workable agreement.  It is pliable.  It is open.  It is 
something I am surprised the hon. member is not supporting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him whether he shares my opinion that it is 
essential that all members in this House support the Nisga'a

the early 1980s be followed. Quebec's National Assembly—and I 
know all members will remember this fact—recognized native 
rights at the start of the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we listen to the debate and consider the speeches by the 
Reform Party, with its usual narrow-mindedness, and then the

Unfortunately, I am unable to answer his question in French. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very quick to recognize that the province of Quebec 
has an exemplary record in many instances in dealing with 
aboriginal people.  It has been a leader in many areas when it 
comes to issues of negotiation.  It has a different law in many 
ways with respect to the application of the civil law.  Perhaps 
in some ways it is more well versed in this type of negotiation 
under the civil law as it applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I embrace the idea that solidarity is what is perhaps most 
needed when it comes to an issue such as this one.  A very 
important signal will be sent to aboriginal people in Canada in 
the spirit of this particular agreement.  The last thing we want 
to see is more contentious and divisive debates.  The last thing 
we want to see is a decision coming out of the supreme court 
which basically forces the government in many instances to 
negotiate with a gun to its head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the record of the federal government in taking 
cases involving aboriginal people to the Supreme Court of Canada 
or the federal court is an absolutely abysmal one.  I suggest the 
hon. member is on the right track when he clearly states that 
negotiation in good faith is what is most needed and desired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is certainly the spirit of this agreement.  It is why 
members of the Progressive Conservative Party are supporting it. 
We are looking forward to getting it to the committee where we 
can perhaps bring about some necessary changes and move the 
matter forward for the benefit of all.

thick in either English or French, while the ways and means 
motion before the House is in both official languages and is only 
1 millimetre thick.  That means that parliament was able to study 
roughly one-100th of the total material referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty which the bill implements is the first of its kind. 
It is meant to be a template for the remaining 50-plus treaties 
to be negotiated in British Columbia.  It would create and 
constitutionalize features of government, taxation, 
representation, fisheries and resource management that are unique 
in that they are based on race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not public government.  It is a private government which 
is not based on residency but on citizenship in the Nisga'a 
nation.  Other people cannot obtain Nisga'a citizenship no matter 
how long they reside on their lands.  They will always be guests 
with none of the rights that accrue to citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for interest sake, I would like to refer to a statement 
made to the special rapporteur and presented to the United 
Nations working group on indigenous populations: “It is the 
first time in our life that we are standing on lands that the 
white man has a right over and we as indigenous people are merely 
guests.  I am therefore very grateful to the people of 
Switzerland for allowing us to be here”.  That appears to be the 
type of thinking we are up against.

It is not open to anyone except by hereditary means.  They will 
not have any part in the election of the legislative body that 
sets the level of taxation levied or the amount of fees for 
services that are to be set.  They will be at the mercy of a 
system that, no matter how well meaning the participants are, 
will deny their democratic rights and will do it for all time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the legislation creating Nisga'a government were outside the 
constitutionally entrenched land claim as it should have been, 
the treaty would be more acceptable.  Furthermore, if it did not 
form part of a final agreement, it would be possible to test 
drive the proposed government model.  One would not buy a car 
without driving it first to see if it fit one's needs, runs well 
and has a guarantee that would cover the cost of repairs if it 
fails to live up to the sales pitch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of these concerns this new governance model is not open 
to amendment in the House.  Time allocation will likely be used 
to limit debate.  There is no way to make changes that may be 
found to be necessary for a government which is founded on the 
failed practices of the 19th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the legislation before us today we are told that it will help 
build the economy.  This is stated not as a fact but as an 
article of faith without the slightest evidence to support it. 
The sad history of Indian affairs on which the agreement is based 
does not give me, and it should not give it to any member of the 
House, any reason for confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of the House knows, unless in complete denial, that 
conditions on Indian reserves which constitute a society apart 
from the mainstream are abysmal.  The commonly accepted 
indicators point to complete failure.  Time and time again 
statistics show that all social indicators on Indian reserves are 
much worse than for the general population.  Infant mortality 
rates are higher than for the general population.  Drug abuse is 
rampant.  Diabetes is a scourge.  Rates of incarceration, 
unemployment, inadequate housing and lack of economic activity 
all bear witness to the failure of the system that has been in 
place since the 1800s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To digress for a moment, I draw the attention of the House to 
the interim report of the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development on aboriginal economic development.  In 
its report the committee calls on the government to invest in 
social housing in Indian communities and in northern communities 
inhabited largely by Inuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the House to see and understand the contradiction in 
terms evident in such a statement.  Social housing is neither a 
driving factor nor an indicator of economic development.  If it 
is anything at all it is an admission there is no economy to 
stimulate or to build on.  That the Liberal government thinks 
that social housing is an indicator of an economy rather than an 
indicator of abject failure shows that it has no idea what 
success is or how to achieve it.  Therefore we must take its 
predictions of growth in the Nisga'a economy with a grain of 
salt, and I should suggest with much more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the agreement a collectivist approach rather than a private 
enterprise approach is entrenched.  Therefore all indicators of 
failure will be entrenched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty is being presented as a fait accompli by the 
government in partnership with the Government of British 
Columbia.  We know the Liberals are supremely confident that they 
and the B.C. New Democrats have it right and that the public has 
no need to look into what they have created.  Historically this 
has been the modus operandi of the Liberals when faced with the 
big questions facing Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty years ago Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau introduced his 
white paper on Indian affairs which accurately defined the 
difficulties facing Indians because of the walls created by 
discriminatory legislation like the Indian Act.  He proposed 
solutions to the problem that were visionary in their day and 
were breathtaking in their scope.  His minister of Indian affairs 
at the time was in complete agreement with the prime minister. 
That Indian affairs minister is our current Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ask what caused the failure of this grand vision for 
aboriginal people.  What led to such a complete rout of the 
government of the day and the utter rejection of its vision, 
which continues to this day and which it rejects?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was caused by the Liberals' propensity to create 
grand doctrines all the while talking only to themselves.  It is 
this predilection to shut the public out of the process and then 
spring some grand design for the public good on an unsuspecting 
public that caused it to fail.  In thirty years nothing has 
changed.  The Liberal government still has not learned anything 
about democracy and the need for wide consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the agreement is so good it should stand up to public 
scrutiny by B.C. residents in the same way it was put to members 
of the Nisga'a band.  They should not be denied a voice in the 
affairs that concern them so directly.  I suggest members of the 
House support the amendment proposed by the Leader of the 
Opposition in which he calls on the government to withdraw the 
bill and refer the subject matter to the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to a clause in the bill that to some extent sheds some 
light on the mindset of the government when we address these 
issues.  The preamble to Bill C-9 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Canadian courts have stated that this reconciliation is 
best achieved through negotiation and agreement, rather than 
through litigation or conflict; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes on with a number of other whereas clauses.  This 
clause serves no purpose in the legislation other than to tell 
the world that the Liberal administration had to be spanked by 
the supreme court and sent to its room.  We would surely agree 
with that sentiment on this side of the House.  However, it is 
our contention that the Liberal government is regrettably the 
senior level of government in Canada at this time and ought to 
behave in an adult fashion and not go to its room so easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the taxation agreement as an example of what I 
mean.  In section 37 under land claims agreements it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If within 15 years of the effective date, Canada or British 
Columbia enacts legislation giving effect to another land claims 
agreement applicable in northwest British Columbia that provides 
that all of the lands that were set apart as Indian reserves of 
an Indian band whose members were represented by a party to the 
agreement cease to be reserves, and provides in the land claims 
agreement that is referred to in that land claims agreement: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) tax powers that are not available to Nisga'a Lisims 
Government or Nisga'a Village Governments; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) tax exemptions that are not available to Nisga'a Government 
or Nisga'a Villages; 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and British Columbia, on request of the Nisga'a Nation, 
will negotiate and attempt to reach agreement with the Nisga'a 
Nation to provide appropriate adjustments to the tax powers of 
Nisga'a Lisims Government, and to the tax exemptions available to 
the Nisga'a Nation and Nisga'a Villages, taking into account the 
particular circumstances of the other land claims agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rather lengthy legal text I read means just one thing. There 
is none of the vaunted finality in the agreement in respect of 
taxes at least.  If any other band negotiates a better agreement, 
and that is inevitable, the federal and provincial governments 
must come to the negotiating table at the request of the Nisga'a 
government to add to the powers and exemptions that were not 
included in this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the reasons I have stated I will be opposing the legislation 
and I call on other hon. members to vote in favour of the 
amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition.

Speaker, the member for Skeena, a colleague of the hon. member, 
indicated on a number of occasions that he believed the Nisga'a 
treaty in some way entrenched inequality of aboriginal women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the provisions of subsection 35(4) of the 
Constitution Act, 1982 that guarantee all section 35 rights, that 
is the aboriginal treaty rights in the constitution including

persons, how could the member possibly argue that it is in any 
way unequal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Burnaby—Douglas for the opportunity to speak to this issue. 
There is already inequality on Indian reserves.  Otherwise Indian 
women would not be speaking out about the need to look after 
their equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During debate on the last piece of legislation that went through

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our understanding that women's rights will not be looked 
after carefully in the agreement. This is not the way in which 
rights should be handled.  When the agreement says that it 
respects the free and democratic nature of Nisga'a government, 
what is it really trying to say?  It is not just a straight 
statement of fact.  There is a qualifier in the ways and means 
motion which I think a good lawyer will find a way around.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague about the agreement and 
property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the agreement does it give Nisga'a people individual 
property rights.  It is one of the fundamental aspects if a 
marriage breaks up, or there is desertion or anything like that. 
Without property rights being entrenched in the agreement, would 
that not put a severe handicap on the spouse who has been 
deserted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member has 
stated the case very well.  Most of our rights have sprung from 
the ability to own, deal with, dispose of, or invest in private 
property and not property held in a collective.  That is a good 
point.  How will the collective deal with the individual rights 
when two individuals go to court to try to work out some form of 
an agreement where their property will be assigned to one spouse 
or the other? 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
states very clearly in the Nisga'a final agreement that the 
rights of Nisga'a men and women are equal and protected under the 
law.  It states that very clearly.  Let us put aside the 
assertion that somehow there is inequality between men and women 
in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other assertion that needs to be set aside is that this is 
not a democratic process or is not democratic enough, or it could 
be more democratic.  The Nisga'a government went before its own 
people and 61% of the voters in Nisga'a lands voted in support of 
the agreement.  Looking at the total number of people in the 
Nisga'a lands, 75% voted for the agreement.  The Reform Party 
itself agreed to change the way that party works.  Some 25% of 
Reform Party members voted for that and it was good enough.  I 
would like a comment from the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Madam Speaker, where we see a real 
lack of democracy on the issue is that it is an agreement that 
affects all people in British Columbia.  The people of British 
Columbia were denied a voice in the implementation of the treaty. 
They heard about it secondhand.  I said that in my speech. Other 
members have said it and they will say it time and time again. 
The people of British Columbia were denied a voice in the 
democratic process.  Their rights were overlooked.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, should there be settlement with the Nisga'a and other 
aboriginal people?  Absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are undeniable historical grievances and they have to be 
settled and settled fairly.  The question is in what manner 
should they be settled?  A number of steps need to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be a deadline for claims to be submitted.  This 
is necessary for two reasons.  We cannot reach settlement if new 
claims are continually popping up.  Also, we cannot reach fair 
and final settlements if the aboriginal communities themselves 
have overlapping claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a represent only one of more than 50 aboriginal groups 
in British Columbia and a third of those are not currently 
involved in negotiations. 
There is absolutely no way to reach realistic settlements when we 
do not even know what some of the groups might be willing to 
settle for.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Nisga'a treaty not yet complete, the Gitanyow band are 
now claiming that much of the Nisga'a treaty land is their 
traditional land and they are preparing a court battle over the 
title.  Guess who is going to pick up the legal bill for both 
sides? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total potential settlement package has to be affordable. It 
is no good coming up with a package if the total cumulative 
effect of that package and all the others to follow absolutely 
destroys or bankrupts an economy of an entire province.  It has 
to take into consideration the cost of financial settlements, the 
cost of land settlements and the future cost of lost revenues 
primarily through lost natural resource revenues. Here we have 
the first of what I believe is a huge deception on the impact of 
the proposed treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial promotional material designed to sell the treaty to 
the public implied the cost was $312 million.  That was extremely 
inaccurate and I believe deliberately misleading.  That figure is 
only the actual cash component of the direct financial 
compensation to be paid. It did not include such considerations 
as the value of the land to be transferred or lost provincial 
forestry revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government attempted to pacify British Columbians 
by claiming that most of the costs would be borne by Canadian 
taxpayers, not B.C. taxpayers.  Last time I heard B.C. was still 
in confederation and we are Canadian taxpayers, and it is damned 
expensive at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public must be consulted on the process and on any potential 
settlement.  Settlements cannot be made piecemeal.  Before one 
treaty is signed the public should know the bottom line and that 
means the total cost and impact of all settlements.  There has 
been very little consultation with the public at large and 
virtually no indication that what has been heard has impacted on 
the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An agreement in principle was reached in 1996.  From that time 
until now, despite a considerable amount of concern raised by the 
public, not one single word of the agreement has changed as a 
result of the public meetings that were held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier the Nisga'a are one of over 50 aboriginal 
groups in B.C.  The proposed settlement will be the floor and not 
the ceiling for all future settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the cost of the Nisga'a treaty, I want to look at two 
components of the treaty: the financial costs and control of 
B.C.'s forest resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An actual financial analysis of the treaty has now been 
completed and it places the cost at approximately $1.3 billion. 
The total Nisga'a population represents 3.74% of B.C.'s 
aboriginal population. Of those, only one-third live on Nisga'a 
land and receive any kind of benefit from this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty becomes a template for all future settlements.  The 
final cost of all settlements would exceed $35 billion.  If we 
think that is far fetched, then we should ask ourselves what 
aboriginal group is going to settle for less than the provincial 
and federal governments are willingly giving to the Nisga'a? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under forestry, using the same proportional arguments as the 
financial concerns, this treaty would ultimately give an 
aboriginal population representing less than 5% of the B.C. 
population harvesting rights for almost 20% of the provincial 
annual allowable cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply cannot afford either one of these situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties when signed have to lead to equality and finality. The 
settlement must be available to individual aboriginal people. To 
do otherwise extends an already existing feudal type system that 
will ultimately fail, just as it is failing now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time the federal government alone spends $9,000 for 
every aboriginal man, woman and child on a reserve in this 
country. Despite this, many aboriginal people on those reserves 
live in a state of abject poverty.  The reason is that much of 
the money is used up by the bureaucracy and what is left is 
passed on to certain band leaders.  In some cases not so much as 
one single dollar makes its way to those truly in need. Under 
this agreement individual rights and access to benefits are still 
non-existent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Nisga'a agreement a central government will own all of 
the land and control all of the money and resources provided for 
by this agreement.  For an individual to voice criticism is to 
risk exclusion from the benefits of those government owned and 
controlled holdings.  It is a top down mechanism and it is 
fatally flawed.  It totally ignores the principles of public 
scrutiny and equality of citizens. The Nisga'a agreement empowers 
government instead of people and that is a certain formula for 
failure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people will remember studying the old English feudal system 
of medieval times where the lord owned all the land and 
everything that grew on it.  The peasants were allowed to live on 
the land, to put up their dwellings and to raise crops, all of 
which belonged to the lord.  They had no ownership or rights of 
any kind other than what he allowed.  It was a very oppressive, 
undemocratic system full of flaws and resentment that came to a 
deserving end centuries ago.  So why is this House considering 
going into the 21st century proposing the same kind of system for 
Canada's aboriginal people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen examples of this.  The Stoney band situated 
west of Calgary has a total of 3,300 people living on three 
different reserves.  Many of those people live in absolute 
squalor, some in the basements of condemned homes.  This is 
despite the fact that the Stoney band has an annual income of $50 
million.  That money goes first to the three band leaders who 
collectively draw half a million dollars in salary plus unlimited 
expense accounts while many of their people live in despair.  Is 
this a system that is going to solve aboriginal problems?  I do 
not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might argue that these leaders are elected and can be 
thrown out of office if they do not do a good job.  Well, I am an 
elected member of parliament.  If someone does not like what I 
do, they can speak out against me.  They can stand for election 
and try to beat me in the next election. If they do, fine.  If 
they do not, life goes on.  But what if I owned the house of that 
person who complained and tried to beat me out?  What if I owned 
their bank account?  What if I controlled all of their principal 
activities on the land?  They could still run against me and if 
they win, that is fine.  But if they lose, they have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the inherent problem with the current reserve system. 
Much of the government funds that the band leaders receive and 
will continue to receive even under this agreement are based on 
the reserve population.  It is in the interest of the band 
leaders to keep the reserve population up and discourage band 
members from leaving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-Nisga'a people living on land handed over to them will not 
have a vote on decisions affecting them.  They say they will have 
a vote on the school board.  They will not have a vote on 
anything that deals with their taxation.  They will not have any 
property rights.  They will not be able to vote for the Nisga'a 
government itself.  They will not be allowed to run for 
government office.  Never mind the school board.  I have heard 
the flippant answers that come from the other side.  They will 
not be allowed to run for government.  They will not be allowed 
to vote for local government, the kind of government that deals 
with their taxation on any property that they happen to reside 
upon.  But they will be subject to those taxes the government 
decides to impose on them and that is taxation without 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promotional material in support of the Nisga'a agreement states 
that the Nisga'a will be subject to all provincial and federal 
taxes.  That is not true.  While the Nisga'a agreement does 
terminate some special treatment for members after eight to 
twelve years, it also leaves in place many exemptions such as 
property tax, taxes on capital and many others.  Nisga'a 
corporations are tax exempt, as is their forestry. The Nisga'a 
along with all other status aboriginals however, will continue to 
get such benefits as free post-secondary education and be user 
fee exempt on various medical services.  These benefits are race 
based and the ultimate goal of settlement must be the full 
equality of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have more, Madam Speaker.  I am not even going to get to my 
fifth point because of the little time left.  It is unfortunate, 
when we are trying to get as many speakers on as possible, that 
this government has already said that it is going to cut off this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And using the word debate is a sham.  This is not a debate. The 
government does not intend to change one piece of legislation, 
not one clause, no matter what evidence comes forward.  It is 
going to put something through, an agreement that with its 
appendix is thicker than the Ottawa phone book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I apologize for interrupting my hon. colleague but he is 
making such important points I think it would be important for at 
least one member of the cabinet to be in this place to hear such 
an important debate on Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is not a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, I conclude by pointing out 
that we are debating a piece of legislation that has incredible 
impact on British Columbia, a document that is thicker than the 
Ottawa phone book, and yet the government will not even consider 
a single change to it.  If this government wants to make even a 
pretence of being democratic, it will agree to hold hearings in 
British Columbia, listen to the concerns of British Columbians 
and make sure the final agreement is fair to all.

have any direct input into them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is important for us to 
understand that we are here to represent people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a two hour live televised debate with a provincial 
minister from the NDP government.  During that debate I offered 
to pay for a scientific poll of his riding if he would agree to a 
vote according to the results.  He refused, but I did the poll 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his riding and in the neighbouring riding of another NDP 
member, the poll turned out that the majority of people opposed 
it.  What is more interesting is that we did a breakdown inside 
the poll, as polls often do, and identified which of the people 
who were contacted were NDP supporters.  Seventy per cent of the 
people who identified themselves as supporters of the provincial 
NDP said that they wanted a referendum and a voice on this.  That 
government did not listen and we now have this government not 
listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have documents from the previous federal minister of Indian 
affairs and the provincial minister of Indian affairs. They have 
both told the people that they hoped they would recognize their 
tenure, but that if they did not they hoped they would be offered 
compensation.  That is a typical example of what is happening to 
British Columbians on this issue.  It is also happening to 
ranchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got another briefing note by the Department of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food for the minister stating that 1,000 farms in the 
Okanagan alone would be affected by the Nisga'a agreement, yet 
these governments are all prepared to walk through it.  I do not 
know if it is because of guilt from the past, but they refuse to 
listen to reason.  The irony is that not only is the agreement 
bad for non-aboriginals in British Columbia, it is not even good 
for the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have listened to the Reform's debate and, quite frankly, it seems 
that we come around to this point every time where the Reform 
wants to take this wrecking ball approach to public policy 
debate.  If nothing is working, we tear it all down to the base 
common denominator and then somehow build some constructive 
process on top of that after there is nothing there to start 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a fair amount of talk about the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  We have gone to the supreme court far too many times in 
dealing with first nations in the country.  Every time we have 
gone to the supreme court we end up with a decision that binds us 
by law to abide by and to live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member looks at the Sparrow, Delgamuukw, Simon, 
Gladstone, Smokehouse and all of the supreme court decisions of 
the last decade and some from the decade before, would he advise 
us to continue to go to the supreme court?  I have heard the 
comments about what is happening on the east coast of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or, are we not far better off to sit down in a public policy 
debate with first nations, the federal government and the 
provincial governments and establish some type of a treaty 
process, that may not be perfect for everybody but is perfect for 
the majority, and come to some concrete examples and terms of a 
decision that all Canadian can live by? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not think that this is a much better 
process than allowing the Supreme Court of Canada to dictate 
Canadian laws to Canadians?

have public debate and public claims on this, yet the public has 
not been included.  If all of the public were included we would 
have a much better agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that he mentions the Delgamuukw case.  I keep 
forgetting whether it is his party or the NDP party, they are so 
intermingled these days.  When the Delgamuukw case began in 
British Columbia, it was won by the provincial government. 
However, by the time the decision came down in came the NDP 
provincial government which encouraged the people to appeal.  It 
then fired all the lawyers who had won the case and conceded a 
number of points they had won.  The court finally had to hire 
back those lawyers as friends of the court in order to have 
somebody speak on behalf of British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, Delgamuukw is a big problem, but one of the governments 
that was an author to the damn report is the reason for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand today on behalf of the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla to 
speak to Bill C-9, an act to put into effect the Nisga'a final 
agreement.  This is a very significant issue today and it is very 
important that members of parliament be able to represent their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing today and what we will see throughout the 
debate is an attempt by the federal Liberal government to not 
allow the debate to go forward.  It will use every means possible 
at its disposal, including closure on debate, and every tactic it 
can to not have a full hearing on the Nisga'a final agreement. 
The people of British Columbia have not been able to express 
their views on the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important, particularly for the members of our party, 
but certainly all members from British Columbia, to speak on the 
issue and to reflect what their constituents have been telling 
them because the deal is very significant.  It is probably one of 
the most significant agreements for the aboriginal people in 
Canada for quite some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deal will hand over to 5,500 Nisga'a ownership over an area 
of land that is one-half the size of the area that I come from, 
the Okanagan Valley.  The Okanagan Valley is home to over 200,000 
people as compared to 5,500.  Along with ownership of the land, 
these 5,500 individuals will get the rights to resources such as 
timber, water and minerals, and a major say over the wildlife 
resource management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a will also get cash payments.  According to an 
independent analysis done by R.M. Richardson and Associates, the 
total cost of the deal will be a minimum of $1.3 billion or 
$260,000 per Nisga'a.  The agreement is dramatic because the 
federal government intends to make Nisga'a the blueprint for over 
50 other agreements that will come down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that the people of British Columbia are 
concerned.  Let me point out that to date I alone, as the member 
of parliament for Okanagan—Coquihalla, have received literally 
thousands of names on petitions from people who are concerned 
about the agreement.  They want questions answered.  That is why 
it is important to have a full hearing of this debate, even 
though the Liberal government is going to throw up every 
roadblock it can to prevent that from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the grassroots plebiscites in the province of B.C., over 90% 
of British Columbians opposed the deal.  It is also worthwhile 
pointing out that only 60% of the Nisga'a people agree with the 
Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of agreements like this is to help solve the 
lingering social and economic problems facing aboriginal people 
in the country.  If the agreement was going to solve those 
lingering social problems that have been faced by aboriginal 
people in the country, I and my colleagues would stand today in 
full agreement of the deal.  Unfortunately, that is not the case. 
The agreement leaves more uncertainty than the Nisga'a had 
before.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all is said and done, there is no doubt in my mind that 
this bill will pass.  It will be a matter of history that the 
Reform Party of Canada stood alone, stood separate from all of 
the other political parties in the House of Commons, the 
Liberals, the Bloc Quebecois, the NDP, and the red Tories at the 
end of the hall, and the other NDP at the end of the way here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that at the end of the day, after the votes are 
counted and this deal has passed, the social and economic 
problems faced by the Nisga'a will not have changed one iota.  In 
fact this agreement will guarantee that the Nisga'a people will 
see another hundred years of poverty in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement does not give the Nisga'a people the tools they 
need for a modern economy in the 21st century.  It does not do 
that.  That is unfortunate.  That is why the members from British 
Columbia and the members from the Reform Party of Canada are 
standing here today.  Although we are standing alone as a 
political party, we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the 
Nisga'a people and every aboriginal group across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see settlements that are final, that give the people 
the tools so that they can democratically elect their governments 
in the 21st century. We want to make sure that they have the 
tools to participate in the economy. These are very real 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One really important issue is the lack of property rights on 
reserves.  It has been one of the major stumbling blocks for 
aboriginal peoples.  It plays a leading role in any economy. 
Without the right to private property it is almost impossible to 
raise capital to start or expand a business.  Aboriginal people 
cannot benefit from the hard work of past generations because 
they are unable to inherit property. Under the Nisga'a final 
agreement all land will be collectively owned by the Nisga'a 
government.  It will have the right to determine what land, if 
any, will be sold privately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By concentrating power into the hands of the Nisga'a government, 
the Nisga'a people do not gain individual rights and equality 
with other Canadians.  Since much of the spending power of the 
Nisga'a government will be handed to them by Ottawa, they fail to 
become fiscally accountable. The Nisga'a will not acquire the 
opportunity and responsibility to make their own future and to 
pass the fruits of their labour on to their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the House considers this agreement or any other 
agreement, we should have a full debate on the issue of property 
rights for aboriginal people.  Property rights should be the 
cornerstone of any 21st century agreement with aboriginal people. 
Without them we are condemning the aboriginals in Canada to 
repeat the 19th century and all that entails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget which party has been in government for most of 
those 100 years.  It has been the Liberal Party of Canada and the 
red Tories at the other end of the hall who have insisted on 
agreements such as this which have made the aboriginal people 
suffer in abject poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a solution I would like to suggest three points which at 
minimum the Nisga'a agreement should ensure.  There should be 
adequate protection of Nisga'a land occupants with guaranteed 
tenure and ownership rights to compare with non-aboriginal 
Canadians.  There should be special measures to ensure that 
people have the same rights regarding the division of marital 
assets whether or not they live on Nisga'a land. There should be 
the guaranteed right on individual property ownership on Nisga'a 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal and provincial legislation should apply on Indian lands 
to protect people living on that land.  We hear a lot from the 
people on the other side of the House that everybody who lives on 
that land will be covered by the same federal and provincial 
agreements or laws that are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to a situation in my riding of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla.  Members may recall that I introduced a 
private member's bill regarding the situation at the Driftwood 
Mobile Home Park.  The 51 families who resided at Driftwood 
Mobile Home Park were evicted.  They were told they had to leave 
their homes.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was that?  It was because their septic system failed.  After 
they had paid rental for years and years to have their mobile 
homes on that property their septic system failed.  Why did it 
fail?  We found out that because it was on reserve land proper 
inspections were not done.  The landlord and tenant act did not 
apply to these people because they lived on reserve land.  It was 
a huge injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did we see the Liberal government standing up to support those 
51 low income families at that time?  No, it did not.  Nor did 
members of the NDP or the red Tories at the other end support 
those 51 low income families who lost their homes.  Some of them 
only received 50 cents on the dollar for their investment. They 
are low income people.  They are without homes.  They are living 
in my riding.  There are four other mobile home parks in jeopardy 
of the same fate.  Why?  It is because the Liberal government 
depends on agreements which are set up to fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not solve the problem.  I wish the House would 
reconsider this whole area.  At the end of the day I can 
guarantee that I will be standing shoulder to shoulder in support 
of the Nisga'a people for their future and their economic 
development when all these other people are long gone. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have one question and a point that I would like to raise.  The 
hon. member says that private property rights are not protected 
in the Nisga'a agreement when in reality if he has read the 
agreement he must be aware that private property rights are 
protected in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private landowners, non-Nisga'a landowners who live in the Nass 
Valley, are not under the Nisga'a agreement.  They still have 
full title to their property.  It even goes so far as to give 
them ownership of the roadbeds leading to that property. 
Therefore private property rights are definitely protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it a bit incongruous that government members are not 
standing to debate and defend the Nisga'a agreement.  They have 
left it up to opposition parties in the House that may or many 
not agree with each other.  Surely the Government of Canada, 
which represents the people of Canada, should be doing the job of 
defending the treaty that I am on my feet doing right now.  It is 
a good treaty and I would like to hear more from government 
members.  I would like to hear from the hon. member on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
Unfortunately the member is not from the province of British 
Columbia which really makes his argument moot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia want to see an agreement that 
makes sense, an agreement that does not protect the property 
rights of Nisga'a people.  We are talking about the Nisga'a 
people and their property rights.  They do not have property 
rights in this agreement.  This is what needs to be protected. 
They need to be protected in this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have the tools, which the agreement does not have, 
to give Nisga'a people those property rights in the 21st century, 
what are we giving them?  We are giving them more of what they 
are used to now, more of what they have had for the last 200 
years, and that is abject poverty.  They will not be able to 
participate actively in the economy of the country and in the 
economy of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said in my comments, they do not have the right to own 
that property.  They do not have the right to hand it down to 
their heirs.  They do not have the right to participate through a 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says he would like government members to stand 
and defend the Nisga'a agreement.  Probably the reason they are 
not is it is indefensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement is a bad agreement.  It does not make sense for 
the Nisga'a people.  I just hope at the end of the day when the 
deal is signed, because undoubtedly it will be, that the hon. 
member will be willing to go to British Columbia and explain it 
five years from now when the impact of the agreement on the 
Nisga'a people is truly felt.  I hope the member is still around 
to explain that he stood in support of the agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would ask the member to comment further on the issue of property 
rights.  We have heard all day from Reform Party members that 
this treaty somehow does not allow property rights for Nisga'a 
people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree, if he has read the treaty, that the 
treaty transfers ownership of the land back to the Nisga'a people 
as a people but that the treaty allows various ways for people to 
privately own the land they live on?  It specifically says that 
individuals cannot get less in terms of property rights than they 
already have.  They can only get more.  I ask the member to 
confirm that is exactly what the treaty says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Madam Speaker, the agreement does not 
confer individual property rights on the Nisga'a people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am particularly interested seeing as how the last 
speaker is my neighbouring colleague in the Okanagan.  I go into 
the south part and he goes into a major part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of a briefing note from the provincial ministry of 
agriculture to the minister of agriculture, Corky Evans, who is 
now running for the leadership of the NDP government out there. 
It states clearly that the Nisga'a treaty sets up a precedent 
that will affect every rancher in the province of British 
Columbia who lives within 10 kilometres of a reserve.  In the 
Okanagan alone that could affect 1,000 ranchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear my colleague who represents a good part of 
that area and those 1,000 ranchers comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Madam Speaker, because I come from an area 
that has a ranching industry and an orchard industry natural 
resources are very important to our area.  Because the agreement 
is set up the way it is, it has a direct impact on ranchers, 
orchardists and the natural resource sector. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the Reform Party has always believed that treaties with our 
native people should be concluded as quickly as possible, so I 
really wish that I could stand before the House and offer my 
support for the bill.  Unfortunately the bill is full of concerns 
that have deep ramifications for not only my home province of 
British Columbia but for the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions under which many aboriginal people in my riding 
and many other regions of Canada live are absolutely appalling. I 
have seen homes without water and proper heating.  I have spoken 
with people who are desperately poor having been unemployed 
virtually forever and who are hanging on through subsistence 
welfare cheques.  I have seen the emotions of people as they 
begged for someone to help them.  I have witnessed their sense of 
hopelessness and helplessness.  I have been an eyewitness to the 
less than enthusiastic police investigations into filed 
complaints of wrongdoing that occurred on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes real courage for our native people to step forward in 
these circumstances.  After the witness reports, the pictures and 
the paperwork it is truly wrong and upsetting to have the whole 
thing swept under the carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have observed firsthand the lack of personal initiative that 
many aboriginal people have for individual advancement, that 
personal drive which gives all of us a reason to roll out of bed 
in the morning and strive to do our best during the upcoming day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do many aboriginals feel this way?  The answer is simple. 
Either their own peers, the Indian act or a combination of both 
strive to hold them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 10 years approximately $60 billion have been 
poured into the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. If money alone could solve these problems, I would 
have thought they would have been solved years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not money.  There has been plenty of money poured 
into DIAND.  Simply put, the resources have never reached those 
at the grassroots level that need it most.  The reality is there 
has been a litany of broken promises from both the government and 
many of the native leaders.  Bureaucratic red tape and corruption 
have made it nearly impossible for the individual grassroots 
aboriginal person to get ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the summer of 1998 I attended a meeting of grassroots 
aboriginal people in Airdrie, Alberta, initiated by the Reform 
Party.  Following the meeting and after hearing from many 
aboriginal people I hosted a meeting on aboriginal accountability 
in my own riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan.  I expected 25 people. 
That was the number of invitations that went out.  Over 50 people 
crowded into a room representing 15 different bands from all 
across Vancouver Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again grassroots aboriginals in attendance 
expressed serious concerns over their respective band councils 
and leadership.  Of all the people in attendance the only ones 
who did not see that there was an accountability problem were 
those few who worked for the band councils or the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Person after person stood up to talk indicating that they had 
the same concerns within their band that other speakers had 
expressed. They also added they thought that they had been the 
only ones with this problem until they came to the meeting. 
They were grateful that others were willing to step forward and 
publicly discuss the issues.  The primary concern was 
accountability among their own leadership.  That is not new.  I 
will refer to some quotes from that meeting:

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am leery of the agreement and the lack of firm details of 
accountability within the band.  I am also very concerned about 
the welfare of women and children under the agreement.  Contrary 
to words spoken on the other side, the rights of Nisga'a women 
have not been included in the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women's rights deserve to be fully addressed.  I have had the 
opportunity to talk with many grassroots aboriginal people at 
friendship centres and native women's associations.  We have 
discussed a great many matters ranging from land settlements and 
equality to health care and family matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from the heart on this issue.  I have witnessed 
firsthand the terrible price women and children have paid through 
the native patriarchal system.  Women and children typically have 
had very few rights bestowed upon them by the elite of the band 
councils.  If the Liberal government is so concerned with the 
family, why does it not put its words into action for it is time 
to walk the talk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my next concerns is the matter of personal property 
rights.  Under the current agreement the Nisga'a council, village 
or corporation will be the owners of the land and therefore the 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe strongly that to take full responsibility for one's 
actions has both rewards and consequences.  Consequences tend to 
mean very little if there is no personal risk and no cost to the 
individual personally.  The reward is based on the same principal 
that to risk something to succeed there will be personal gain. 
Simply put, what one owns one cares for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is not only a problem within our aboriginal 
community as a whole but a symptom of our society at large.  To 
be truly effective I strongly urge the government to implement 
individual property rights for all Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several positive aspects of the agreement.  One of 
them is to move the Nisga'a people out from under the oppressive 
Indian Act.  I hope and pray that the Nisga'a people will not be 
moving from one oppressive regime to another.  I have to ask 
myself a question.  If this agreement was to apply directly to 
me, would I be satisfied to live under it?  My simple answer is 
no. I would not want to be placed under the terms of the 
agreement.  Nor do I believe that all Nisga'a people truly want 
to be placed under it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although a majority of the Nisga'a people did pass the agreement 
the final result was certainly not overwhelming.  A total of 61% 
approved the agreement, 39% were against it, and 15% of the 
eligible voters declined to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the greatest concern to me is that the agreement sets 
the framework for all treaty settlements in Canada.  There are 
many agreements yet to be negotiated.  However to use the 
agreement as the cornerstone, I am afraid, sets the country on a 
long road to the courts and confrontation.  I hope that is not 
what my colleagues on the other side are looking for.  They only 
need to look at the west coast and review the Musqueam land 
battles.  They only need to look to the east coast and try to 
make sense of the fisheries fiasco the government has created.

belief that the agreement will not bring the Nisga'a people into 
Canada but will create a mini-state within the nation, a nation 
within a nation, a nation that in 14 different areas has the 
right to supersede the laws of the Canadian constitution and the 
province of British Columbia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food for being in the House this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 18 I had the opportunity and the pleasure to rise in 
the House to question the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
about an issue that is very close and dear not only to my heart, 
but to the constituents of Brandon—Souris as well as to 
agricultural constituents all across this fair country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House has been told many times, the minister of 
agriculture and his department have put forward this wonderful 
program called AIDA that is going to solve all of the problems of 
western Canada and western Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to rise on October 18 to ask the minister 
of agriculture why it was that only $90 million had been 
distributed to the four provinces for which the federal 
government administers the AIDA program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who do not know, and perhaps the parliamentary 
secretary does not know, there are four provinces that have the 
AIDA program administered for them by the federal government, and 
those provinces are Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Nova 
Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the commodity crisis that we are now suffering throughout 
western Canada, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are without question 
the hardest hit because they have a dependency on grains and 
oilseeds more so than other provinces and other commodities that 
are being grown and produced throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $90 million is very important because as of October 18 that 
was the amount of money that was distributed to those four 
provinces.  However, the minister of agriculture, in response to 
my question, suggested that in the four provinces where the 
federal government delivers the program well over $200 million 
had been delivered, as identified in <I>Hansard</I>.  That, in 
fact, was not true and I would like the parliamentary secretary 
to explain to me how a $90 million distribution of funds could be 
mistaken for a $200 million distribution of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I brought this up was because not only was the money 
not being distributed, the applicants for the AIDA program were 
being denied.  In those four provinces, 8,000 applicants had been 
approved for the AIDA program and some 10,000 applicants had been 
denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supplementary to that question, I asked the minister if in fact 
he thought that the 10,000 applicants who had been denied did not 
require any assistance with the farm crisis.  Needless to say, it 
was question period, not answer period, and the minister decided 
to go off on some different tangent and he never did answer the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the parliamentary secretary would like to answer tonight. 
Did those 10,000 applicants who have been denied apply simply on 
a whim?  Did they apply because they thought there was going to 
be $900 million distributed, which we have seen is not happening? 
Did they apply because they did not need the assistance?  Or, 
did they apply and get refused because the program itself is 
flawed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program is definitely flawed, as we have found out.  There 
are no negative margins covered in the program right now. 
Perhaps the parliamentary secretary would like to explain why, 
when the program was designed and developed not to include 
negative margins in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should tell you, Madam Speaker, that the process of 
application is very— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member at this point as his time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I know the 
hon. member has been very persistent in his questioning on this 
topic.  It is a very important topic for his province and for all 
farming communities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government understands the root cause of the financial 
problems facing some farmers.  The causes are worldwide low 
prices for some commodities and recent adverse weather here in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The low prices have been aggravated by the use of trade 
distorting support by some of our trading partners.  The Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-food is working very hard on the 
international front to demonstrate that this continued action 
will undermine efforts toward agricultural trade reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures I have are figures for Canada.  They are not figures 
for the four provinces alone.  As of October 21, 1999 claims 
totalling $220 million have been paid out.  This represents an 
average payment of $14,034 per farmer.  Currently the AIDA 
administration is processing approximately 1,200 applications per 
week.  Farmers continue to have access to the NISA program and 
the government continues to put money in producers' NISA 
accounts, with more than $126 million already contributed this 
year.  More than 135,000 farmers have some $2.7 billion in 
accounts.  That is a substantial reserve to draw on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken appropriate measures to deal quickly with the 
results of adverse weather and the low prices for some 
commodities and we are laying the groundwork to ensure that our 
trading partners enter the WTO negotiations with a commitment to 
meaningful changes.  Along with our work with provincial 
governments to strengthen our long term safety net system, we are 
providing Canadian farmers with the short and long term support 
they need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, in the House on October 14 I asked a question of the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  The question was quite clear. 
However, the lack of an answer I received was also very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rejection of the 30 day moratorium on fishing in the 
Atlantic region shows clearly that the minister is continuing to 
ignore the seriousness of the situation.  The government has 
shown the people most directly concerned that it has absolutely 
no leadership.  Through its clumsy handling of the situation the 
government has struck fear into the hearts of fishers in the 
towns and villages throughout Atlantic Canada.  My question was 
very clear.  What has the government done and what does it intend 
to do to restore a feeling of security and peace of mind to 
people in native and non-native communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of the government's seriousness in regard to this very 
serious question shows how it does not understand the seriousness 
of the problem.  The minister totally ignored the question and he 
tried to laugh at it.  However, the answer was clear, the 
government had done nothing and was planning to doing nothing in 
our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no initiative to talk to people in our 
communities.  That is clear.  If we talk to people in our 
communities they tell us that there is a need for action and 
resources to bring our communities together.  We cannot let the 
situation worsen, like the government has been doing with its 
lack of leadership.

Richibouctou-Village, Sainte-Anne, Saint-Thomas, Cap-Pelé and Port 
Elgin are wondering whether they still have a future in fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities need to see leadership from this government, 
something that does not exist, at present. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to see leadership now, not a year from now.  Both native 
and non-native communities need a strong government that will 
look after their welfare.  This will only be accomplished by 
enforcing conservation measures and by putting in place rules and 
regulations that will ensure that the lobster, scallops and 
shrimp are there.  If we do not take measures to conserve our 
natural resources, the victory which the natives achieved by the 
supreme court ruling will no longer be a victory because in 10 
years there will be no resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are serious fishermen who are worried.  I spoke with 
fishermen yesterday.  They are asking if they will be able to 
fish next spring.  Will they be able to go out and fish?  What 
will be the rules and regulations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also talk about the lack of DFO officials on our 
waters; not only during this crisis, but before it.  I went out 
on the wharfs this fall to talk to the fishermen while they were 
preparing to fish.  At that point I heard a lot of complaints 
that there were not enough DFO officials on the water to protect 
the species.  Now, with this additional crisis, we know that DFO 
manpower cannot handle it and will be further burdened if there 
is no leadership from the minister in Ottawa.

resolved, because there are more—

of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, thank you for 
the opportunity to describe the measures we are taking to plan 
for the implementation of the Marshall decision in a manner that 
is sensitive to the very real concerns of fishers and fisher 
communities in the Atlantic provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deviate from my text for a moment.  I would like to say 
to the hon. member that we are taking the issue seriously.  Mr. 
Mackenzie is in Atlantic Canada working on the issue at the 
moment.  Mr. Mackenzie comes to us as the chief federal 
representative.  He was born and bred in Nova Scotia.  He was the 
chief federal land claims negotiator on the Labrador Inuit 
Association claims and he did work on the major fisheries 
component.  We have also had the nickel concerns in the Voisey's 
Bay issue and we have come to an AIP. I am confident Mr. 
Mackenzie will assist in resolving this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mackenzie's immediate task is to work out arrangements for 
short term fisheries management.  The first task is well under 
way.  He has been holding discussions with aboriginal and 
commercial groups throughout the maritimes.  Mr. Mackenzie is 
concentrating for the time being on the lobster fishery. The hon. 
member pointed to the other species.  That is correct. There are 
other species to be concerned about in those areas where 
commercial openings are imminent, but arrangements will be 
necessary across the board.

point, we will have a plan in place for—

passed.  Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
