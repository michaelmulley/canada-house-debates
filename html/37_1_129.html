	Mr. Speaker, hon. colleagues, I rise in the Chamber to speak about the first world war and the fate of some Canadian soldiers, a fate that has been essentially forgotten in the pages of history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the young nation of Canada, the promise and optimism that infused the dawning  20th century was abruptly cut short by the first world war. No one anticipated such carnage, or that we would soon be sending young citizens into a war that would see 65 million people from 30 nations take up arms, where 10 million people would lose their lives and 29 million more would be wounded, captured or  missing.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never before had there been such a war, neither in the number of lives taken, nor in the manner of their taking.  New weapons would turn fields of battle into slaughter grounds, while the rigours of life in the trenches would kill many of those who escaped bullet or bayonet.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This “war to end all wars” challenged our small country of 8 million to its limits. Almost 650,000 served in the Canadian Forces in the Great War. Over 68,000—more than one in ten who fought—did not return. Total casualties amounted to more than one third of those who were in uniform. Thousands came home broken in body, mind, and spirit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service of Canadians in uniform was as remarkable as it was distinguished. History records their sacrifice in places whose names resonate even to the present day. Battle names such as Ypres, The Somme, Vimy Ridge, Passchendaele and Amiens.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who lived then and the historians who followed would declare that Canada came of age because of its actions and ingenuity during World War I. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where history speaks of national sacrifice and achievement, it is too often silent on the individual stories of triumph, tragedy and terror of those who fought and died on the terrible killing fields of France and Belgium.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who went to war at the request of their nation could not know the fate that lay in store for them.  This was a war of such overwhelming sound, fury and unrelenting horror that few combatants could remain unaffected.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the majority of the Canadians who took up arms and paid the ultimate sacrifice, we know little of their final moments, except that they died in defence of freedom.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I want to talk about 23 of our fallen.  I would like to tell the House about these soldiers because these circumstances were quite extraordinary.  These 23 soldiers of the Canadian Expeditionary Force occupy an unusual position in our military history.  They were lawfully executed for military offences such as desertion and, in one case, cowardice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can revisit the past but we cannot recreate it.  We cannot relive those awful years of a nation at peril in total war, and the culture of that time is subsequently too distant for us to comprehend fully.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, however, do something in the present, in a solemn way, aware now, better than before, that people may lose control of their emotions, have a breakdown for reasons over which they have little control.  For some it would have been known today perhaps as post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give these 23 soldiers a dignity that is their due and to provide a closure for their families, as the Minister of Veterans Affairs on behalf of the Government of Canada, I wish to express my deep sorrow at their loss of life, not because of what they did or did not do but because they too lie in foreign fields where poppies blow amid the crosses row on row.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, we fully support what the minister has done today.  We believe this is not only owed to our veterans but that it is one of the ways in which the great country of Canada can  avoid covering up or trying to hide and instead can give recognition where recognition is due.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada can be proud of its participation  in World War I and of  its significant contribution to world peace and political stability.  It was also a time when we became a nation.  In World War II we were one step ahead in lending support to the allies. Not only that, we made a defining difference to the outcome of both wars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians do not realize that 94 of our Canadians received the Victoria Cross which is awarded for bravery, a daring act of valour or self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy.  Even with our small population, Canada received about 10% of all honours issued worldwide.  Let no one ever doubt that Canadians were among the very bravest in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the hon. minister has noted, when we speak of the horrors of war we describe experiences and traumatic events that, even for the best of our soldiers, were very hard to overcome.  Every soldier handled the horrors and terrors to the best of their ability.  Yet, not unlike today, there were some who were not able to cope with the events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have toned down the language  that was used at that time.  What is sometimes referred to today as post-traumatic stress disorder was simply called shell shock or some other negative term. Before that, some soldiers were simply labelled as cowards or deserters but they were not deserving of those titles. That is what the hon. minister  has done in bringing this issue  forward.  Whatever the label, whatever the cause, there exists in our history what might be called a dark spot, but today that dark spot has been erased forever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-three of our soldiers who were executed in a foreign land and whose graves occupy foreign soil are today receiving what is rightfully theirs:   the formal recognition of their deaths recorded forever in  <i>The First World War Book of Remembrance</i>. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this act it is my hope and indeed the hope of the opposition  that closure will be given to the families of these individuals to this event in history.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, and the entire Quebec nation I am sure, I would like to express our satisfaction with the acknowledgement of the involvement of these 23 soldiers in World War I.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 23 young men volunteered to defend freedom.  They took part in a cruel war, and one we realize today was completely pointless: 30 countries, 10 million dead, 29 million wounded.  These young men came to question certain decisions, to wonder about the appropriateness of certain commands.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For daring to think, for daring to question, the cruel law of war , instead of trying to understand them, had them executed, forgetting the months of sacrifice they had given in the service of their country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are correcting that error, at least in some part, by entering their names among our heroes in the Book of Remembrance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to encourage their descendants  to be proud of these men.  I would also like to extend to them the condolences of my party and myself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind them of the words of the great French author, Alexandre Dumas, “Those whom we have loved and lost are no longer where they were, but they continue forever to be wherever we are”.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure on behalf of the federal New Democratic Party across the country to welcome the veterans affairs minister's comments today in the House of Commons and let him know we support without question the induction of the names of these 23 brave men into the hallowed book of remembrance on Parliament Hill.  It is a wonderful act.  It is long overdue,  but we are glad some closure can be brought today.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot help but think about soldiers, those who die on the battlefields and witness the horrors of war, and notice the courage and bravery these men and women have shown throughout the history of our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courage and bravery are also shown in this room today by the Minister of Veterans Affairs who brings great honour and courage to his department.  On behalf of the New Democratic Party I wish him and his family the very best of the holiday season and  better health for  the near future.  May God bless him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who comes from a family liberated by Canadians in World War II, I will also mention   the sacrifices made by Canadians.  When a young man or woman  signs up they do not know what it must have been like until they get there and smell, feel and see the horrors.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in the Chamber could say they would not show a bit of cowardice or challenge to authority if someone told them to get out of a foxhole and run toward a bunch of shooting arms in their way?  How many of us would have the courage to do that?  Unless we are in that situation we do not know what goes through the mind of a young man or young woman.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of these 23 men have a rightful place  in the book of remembrance.  We are proud to stand here today with the Minister of Veterans Affairs to show our support not only to him and the department but to the families of these men. As he said, lest we forget their names, forever they will be honoured in the House of Commons.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. minister for what he has done today in the House of Commons for these 23 first world war veterans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an honour to rise today and pay tribute to these men. When the Great War began in August  1914, Canada was still in its infancy.  In many ways the volunteers who joined the Canadian expeditionary force reflected Canada itself:  young, full of innocence and eager to prove themselves.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the soldiers, regardless of what part of Canada they came from, could have been prepared for what they encountered.  The barrages of artillery and constant machine gun fire that surrounded them always left them wondering “Why am I here?  Only for my people back home in Canada and around the world”. They constantly waited for the whistle to blow that would send them across the mud fields of the  Somme, Vimy Ridge or Passchendaele.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother's only brother, my uncle Samuel Cook, was one of those who was in the first world war.  He was shot.  The bullet went through his neck, through one side and out the other.  However he  was one of those who came home.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the honour and privilege of visiting Vimy and seeing all the names of  those who were lost in the war.  Their bodies did not come home.   Their names are on the monument. These 23 men walked past  friends who had fallen on barbed wire fence and much too often had fallen to death.  In the four years of fighting 10 million soldiers were killed and 20 million were maimed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war was a psychological nightmare for all.  We are not here to debate the 23 soldiers who were executed for military offences.  We are here to remember and honour them.  They experienced horrors we can only imagine. Even then it is beyond our grasp. We are aware now that the horrors and subsequent reactions were beyond their control.  We cannot go back in time to help them through the horrors but we can give these 23 soldiers a dignity that is their due.  They were Canadians. They were soldiers. They were men who made sacrifices. Their names  should now be included in our <i>The First World War Book of Remembrance</i>, and rightfully so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the minister and the House, particularly at this special time of Christmas. Lest we forget.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-107121"></A><a HREF="#Int-107141"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107128"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to resume debate on the motion with respect to the budget following last night's adjournment of proceedings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget presented by the hon. Minister of Finance yesterday represented a time of  choosing for the government, a time to set things right and get priorities straight. However this was a budget that occurred 652 days since the previous accounting to this place on behalf of the Government of Canada, the longest stretch ever in the history of our parliament without an accounting of the nation's finances. That in itself is unacceptable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubly unacceptable that the government was forced into finally presenting a budget plan to the House because of the onset of an unexpected international security crisis and a recession which has come to fruition under the watch of the finance minister. It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in a position where the government had to scramble to put together something that would have the appearance of a fiscal plan at a time of crisis and uncertainty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the budget it is quite clear that the government had an opportunity to get its priorities straight and  make difficult decisions to provide adequately for national and economic security. Those were the tests it faced in the preparation of the budget. It failed those tests. It failed to get its priorities straight. It failed to make the difficult decisions and provide adequately for our national and economic security. The government has failed the test.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear when we look at the budget that the predictions offered by the senior communications officer in the Prime Minister's Office bore fruit when she said in an unprecedented shot at the finance minister that “This budget will be written by one person. It happens to be the Prime Minister of Canada, not the finance minister”.  Apparently that came from Francoise Ducros, director of communications in the Prime Minister's Office.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If indeed it is true that it was the Prime Minister who wrote the budget, and it appears to be, that might explain why it took 652 days. It certainly explains why the budget so closely resembles the tax and spend and spend and spend budgets of Liberal governments during the vintage years of the Prime Minister when he was finance minister in the late 1970s and a member of cabinet in the early 1980s. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not seen spending increases in a federal budget at the levels proposed since the heady days when the current Prime Minister was part of a government which helped drive Canada into a deep, deep fiscal hole from which we are still trying to recover.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said last night, if the budget were to have a title it would be “2001: A Waste Odyssey”. We have seen a proposal in the budget for an increase in program spending in the coming year of ostensibly 9.2% or $11 billion. That is the largest program spending increase presented to this place in living memory. It is a 9.2% increase. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in perspective, in a year when the economy is projected to grow at only 1.1% the government is proposing a spending increase nine times as large as the rate of growth in the economy and about four times the combined rate of growth in  inflation plus population. That is irresponsible. It is unsustainable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the 9.2% program spending increase proposed here is only ostensibly 9.2%. When one looks more closely through the fog of the budget numbers as presented by the finance minister it turns out the spending increase next year will more likely be in the range of 10.6%, moving spending up to $133 billion. </p>


	<A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say that? I say that because what was known as the contingency fund, the rainy day cushion against downturns in the economy, has been reduced from $3 billion to $1.5 billion and even that $1.5 billion has been pledged to expenditures in other areas. The government expects to spend that money if in fact it does not end up consuming what is left of the contingency fund to finance an unexpected downturn in revenues as a consequence of the Liberal recession.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect a 10.6% increase in spending  next year.  That follows from an $8 billion or 8% increase in spending in the current year or a  combined spending in two years of over 18%. That is unprecedented in the fiscal annals of this parliament.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spending far outstrips the productive capacity of the nation. We do not know whether the government will stop there.  Its track record on spending is a business and its spending is out of control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the House an example for the current fiscal year 2001-02. In the fall 1999 budget the finance minister stood in his place and projected that spending in the current fiscal year to end next March would be $121 billion.  He then said in the fall  2000 budget that spending in the current fiscal year would be $130 billion.  He now  advises us that spending in the current fiscal year will be $136.6 billion. If he plays games with the contingency fund as he suggests, spending would  likely  be closer to $140 billion.  That is $19 billion more than initially projected and $19 billion off budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of a budget is for the finance minister to give parliament a transparent picture of the fiscal plans for the nation of the executive branch  and to allow parliament to pass judgment on it.  How can we pass judgment on budgets from the government knowing that its track record is to overshoot spending projections by as much as $19 billion or 20% for a given fiscal year? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that the 10.6% budgetary increase projected for the  2002-03 fiscal year  would likely outstrip anything we have seen in the fiscal history of the nation if the government follows the precedents it has set.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of that would be understandable in certain circumstances.  Increasing spending in and of itself is not necessarily a fiscal evil if there were a legitimate national emergency.  One can make that the case if we were to find ourselves in emergency-like circumstances following the end of our holiday from history on September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the official opposition have been the most vocal and consistent voices of fiscal prudence and discipline.  We have recognized the need for additional security spending in the current environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me anticipate one of the objections from some of my colleagues opposite by saying that objecting  to huge increases in overall spending does not mean that we are objecting to increased security spending.  What we  are objecting to is the government's total abject failure to set priorities.  That is the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed in the Minister of Finance for whom I have some considerable regard.  On September 17, 2001, in an article in the Toronto <i>Star</i> the Minister of Finance was quoted as saying:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small> —and Ottawa is reviewing its $124 billion in spending on an item by item basis to see where reductions can be made.  We are looking at what are the lower priority areas and how do we make sure that we can fund the higher priority areas.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a sensible remark.  I was  encouraged when I heard it because it echoed  what we in the Alliance had been saying for years: the idea of reallocating, setting priorities and cutting in low priority areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentiment was endorsed overwhelmingly by the report of the Standing Committee on Finance.  The official opposition concurred in that report partly because it called for the reallocation  of spending from low priority areas to high priority areas. The report stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>To the extent that new spending on security and defence could lead to a deficit, the government must balance this new spending with spending cutbacks elsewhere. The committee recommends that the government make a firm commitment to balanced budgets.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an official opposition publication although we concurred in this recommendation.  This is a recommendation from every  government member on the Standing Committee on Finance including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  They understood, as did virtually every business group and responsible think-tank that appeared before the finance committee, that in difficult times difficult decisions and choices must be made. Yet not one cent of reallocation, not one dime of reduced spending in wasteful areas, is found in the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that says to us is that in the exercise of setting priorities the government has no priorities: every dollar is of equal priority; additional resources for the frontline of our military are  equally important as grants and handouts to TV and film producers; additional resources for the provinces to improve  the quality of and access to public health care are equally important as the billions of dollars in grants and handouts and corporate welfare provided by the Minister of Industry; and additional resources for our police, security and intelligence agencies are equally important as the hundreds of millions of dollars of waste detailed in the recent auditor general's report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Coyne, a leading commentator on fiscal matters in Canadian journalism stated in today's <i>National Post</i>:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>At no point in the entire document is a single area identified where the government might reduce spending. Not one.  Everything, it seems, is a priority.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I studied formal logic in college and  that is a non-sequitur.  Priorization means that certain things are identified as being more important than others.  Yet the government has utterly failed in that exercise.  A  bar was set by its own Standing Committee on Finance,  by every major business group in the country and  by all clear headed people. The government has imperiled the fiscal health of the nation by failing to get its priorities straight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have given the government whatever small share of credit is due to it for eliminating the large deficits inherited from the Mulroney government.  However  the vast majority of the deficit elimination which occurred between 1993 and 1997 was attributable to increased revenues through higher tax rates and  working families putting in more hours and working harder to pay more to the government.  Canadians were principally responsible for giving the government a windfall in revenues through which it moved toward a balanced budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government essentially made the wrong choices in terms of spending.  The vast majority of its program spending cuts were reductions in transfer payments to the provinces to finance the top public spending priority, namely health care.</p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cut departmental spending by less than 4%, except in the Department of National Defence,  RCMP and CSIS, the frontline agencies of national security, which it cut by over 20%.  It was a government that made  wrong decisions.   It cut health care, national security and raised taxes.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless we did manage to find ourselves, thanks  to economic growth and  free trade with the United States, in a surplus position for the last four fiscal years. The budget imperils that hard won taxpayer surplus through fiscal irresponsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians may not be acquainted with the Byzantine accounting methods of the government. Let me offer a brief tutorial on how the government has engaged in its fiscal planning in recent years.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance developed an innovation starting in the mid-1990s.   It was based on an honest analysis of the grotesque fiscal failure of the Mulroney government. The finance minister used to come in with rosy scenarios that were blown out of the water by economic circumstances.  We always ended up, year after year from 1984 to 1993, exceeding the projected deficit.  That reduced international and market confidence in the fiscal credibility of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current  Minister of Finance sensibly proposed that the government adopt as a line item in its budget something known as a contingency factor.  He set it at about $3 billion a year and it was supposed to increase over the years.  He added a second prudence   line, known as the prudence factor, which was to take into account potential fluctuations in national income and the growth of the economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two factors together were to act as a fiscal cushion should the government's projections not be realized,   should revenues fall short of their projected level and should expenditures outstrip those that were planned, which  incidentally happened in every year of the government's mandate.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prudence  and  contingency factors, cumulatively representing $4.5 billion in the last fiscal year, would soften the blow and prevent us from moving into a deficit position. Further, if    the combined prudence and contingency factors were not spent by the end of the fiscal year,   they would be applied to reducing the national debt.  That has helped some of the nominal reductions in debt we have seen over the past two or three years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the whole idea of  prudence and  contingency is to have a fiscal reserve  when times get tough.  We do not need a fiscal prudence plan for good times.  We need it when the economy turns sour  as it currently has under the government's leadership.  Yet the government has decided at precisely the wrong moment to make the wrong decision to eliminate the prudence factor and to cut  the contingency factor to $1.5 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government's projections for the economy were  slightly off  we would find ourselves in an  underlying deficit.  However  the government applied a new reasonable term  called  the planning surplus or  planning deficit.  It appeared in all  budget documents since 1996.  If the government's surplus were to exceed the combined value of the prudence and contingency factors it would  then   be known as a planning surplus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed in this place last spring my colleagues will recall that the Leader of the Opposition and I and others raised questions day after day with the Minister of Finance about projections coming from independent private sector economists indicating that the government was headed for a planning deficit; that is to say, it would have to eat into the  contingency and prudence factors to stave off an actual deficit.</p>


	<A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister danced, denied and did not fess up, but what has happened is quite clear. By failing to make tough choices, by failing to set priorities, by allowing the Liberal leadership campaign to take over the spending agenda of the government, by allowing spending to grow at a grotesque rate of 18% over two years, the government is now in a planning deficit and is skating oh so close to an actual deficit. It is skating far too close to threatening the progress that Canadian taxpayers have made over the past years in the hard won fight against the deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there will be a combined planning deficit of $6.2 billion in the fiscal years 2001 through to 2003. What we projected in the spring has come true. I believe the finance minister's denials have been discredited along with much of his credibility as a fiscal manager.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make another brief note about the way the government presents its budget. This may seem to some an arcane point, but it is critical to the ability of parliament and Canadians who are concerned about such matters to properly assess the fiscal progress of their government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very interesting. If we look through the budget document, I would submit that about 80% of it is produced by the government's propaganda department or sales and marketing. It has nothing to do with transparent presentation of the fiscal plans of the government. There are selectively chosen charts and tables that the government thinks would be helpful in presenting the most positive gloss on its fiscal story.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the document, some plans and programs are presented on a one year horizon, others on a two year horizon, some on a three year horizon and occasionally we actually see five year numbers creep in when the government needs a five year horizon, for instance, to squeeze in its tax plan or its security spending increases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this was a public company and the finance minister was its treasurer, and he presented a document of this sort, I submit that the auditing firm reviewing a document like this would throw the book right back at the treasurer. The board would fire him and he would end up making licence plates in a provincial institution. This is not a document presented according to generally accepting accounting standards for the public sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the central functions of parliament is to give the representatives of the people an opportunity to provide the checks and balances to provide scrutiny against the power of the purse exercised by the crown, vested in the cabinet. We essentially are unable to do so because we do not know where the government is going in five years, as I already have said. In the past three fiscal years alone its combined overspending, above and beyond what it had projected, was $13.2 billion. For the current year alone, it is as much as $19 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our concern about the fiscal direction of the government, made yet more acute by the planning deficit presented in yesterday's budget, we need to see consistent, transparent, five year projections of the government's fiscal plan. We made this point last spring. The official opposition has done its homework. At the finance committee on May 17, the hon. Leader of the Opposition demanded a commitment from the finance minister that he would provide a five year forecast in this budget to allow for full transparency.</p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess what the finance minister said? “We will be providing five-year numbers in the fall, Mr. Day”. That commitment,  “preference for five-year planning horizon”, was the  preference of the Standing Committee on Finance. Again, the finance minister has flip-flopped  on his commitment to provide transparent projections and has rejected the recommendation of his  government dominated finance committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem like an arcane point, but it is not.    Last spring we issued  a warning about a planning deficit, which has been borne true.  On behalf of the opposition, today I issue a warning that the government is driving us toward not just a planning deficit, but an actual deficit in the out years of its fiscal plan. We want full accounting. We demand it and that is our right in this parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This failure to get priorities straight  has not only jeopardized the fiscal health of the country, not only are we again threatened by a deficit, but the government has utterly failed in this document to address one of the largest and most pernicious factors in our long term economic slide as a nation. That is our national debt of $547.5 billion which is still costing us nearly $41 billion in interest or $7,500 in interest payments paid through taxes for an average family of four.  It is still the third highest level of public indebtedness in the OECD and the second highest level of indebtedness in the G-7, second only to the infamous fiscal basket case of Italy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not sustainable and yet we see in the budget document not one patina of debt reduction. I refer to page 24, the fiscal outlook, wherein the finance minister projects a net public debt in 2000-01 of $547.4 billion; in 2001-02, $547.4 billion; 2002-03, $547.4 billion; and a net public debt in the year 2003-04 of $547.4 billion. There is not one dime in debt reduction for a country with the third largest debt in the developed world, the second highest debt in the G-7.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is wrong. The parliamentary secretary is absolutely right. It is wrong for the government to have dropped debt reduction as a priority. Government members say that the debt will shrink as a percentage of national income over time and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the  finance department is calling my colleague across the way with talking points. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> He needs a lot of help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jason Kenney:</b> He needs help. Debt reduction is one of the top priorities of Canadians for obvious reasons and should not be a discretionary matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, those of us in the official opposition should take some pride for being a bit prophetic about these things. When we proposed, as we have for years, the idea of a legislated debt reduction plan in law with an annual requirement of at least $6 billion in debt reduction,  we did that for a purpose. We understood that when times got tough, Liberal politicians were likely to let debt reduction fall right off the chart. That is what they have done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been completely vindicated in our call for debt reduction legislation, which we proposed would require, at bare minimum, an annual debt reduction of $6 billion plus 75% of any unanticipated surpluses. This is legislation that has been adopted and which has worked practically in Alberta, Manitoba and  Ontario. There are other less stringent statutes in other legislatures, which have been very effective.</p>


	<A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has given us an object lesson in the need for a debt reduction strategy and today we renew our call for that kind of statutory fiscal discipline so that an irresponsible finance minister does not have the discretion to pass onto future generations a burden which belongs to us.  It is a moral responsibility and one which we must take up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure to pay down the debt, the risk posed of a future deficit and  the reality of a planning deficit  imperils our economic security.  The government, as I said at the outset, had two obligations in this budget.    One was to provide for national security.  The other was to provide economic security. Again we submit that it failed on both counts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of economic security, Canada is still suffering the effects of a decade of decline and economic drift, mainly under the management of this government.  In  2000 the total tax burden was 44.3% of gross domestic product, up from 1999.  However the Canadian standard of living has been falling for 20 years.  Personal disposable income is below where it was 18 years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between Americans and Canadians, in terms of personal disposable income, increased by $2,900 between 1989 and 2000.  That gap now represents $7,557.  Those figures are in Canadian dollars  or dollarettes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a $7,500 gap between the average  Canadian and the average American thanks to a decade long decline in our standard of living, our personal disposable income, our productivity and our competitiveness, fuelled principally by these destructively high levels of debt and taxation, as well as a burdensome regulatory regime which crushes much of the creative energy out of our economy.  That is the long term economic challenge facing this nation; a $7,500 gap in the    personal disposable incomes of the average Canadian versus the average American.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we extrapolate that to an average family, as the current Minister of Foreign Affairs did when he was Minister of Industry at a speech he gave in the spring at the Empire Club,  $7,500 times four, the average Canadian family is about $25,000 behind  or poorer than its American counterpart in terms of personal disposable income.  That is a consequence of the decade of drift.  On an annual basis, our labour productivity is growing at half the level as that in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best evidence of our relative decline in wealth and productivity as a nation is very obvious to any one of us who has followed the sad story of the Canadian loonie.  That lame loonie, under Liberal management, reached 62.37 U.S. cents three weeks ago, the lowest  value of our currency in its history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the value of a currency reflects the international market's perception of the value of an economy.  The international currency markets have clearly   given the government and its fiscal management a failing grade with the value of our currency. The government has said  that it is just an aberration, or that it is just because of low commodity prices or it is a flight to safety in the United States. It is excuse after excuse. Every time we reach a record low, we hear another excuse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that since the government came to power in 1993, we have seen a reduction in the value of the loonie of over 20%.  We have lost value over the past couple of years against the Mexican peso, against the British pound sterling, against a number of other currencies, including the Japanese yen. In fact, the Bank of Canada reports that we have lost 20% of the value of our currency against a basket of six major international currencies over the past several years.</p>


	<A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that this budget ought not to have simply addressed the immediate fiscal agenda of the government but rather the long term economic agenda of Canada.  We cannot afford to take a break in the race to international productivity and competitiveness.  We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines and say there is an international recession or a security imperative that we must address. That is not an excuse.  There is no excuse for complacency in the fight to improve the standard of living of working families in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be relentless and tireless in moving to reduce our debt levels, our tax levels and our regulatory burden and to liberate our labour markets so that we can see more wealth in the country, more investment, more savings, more employment and a higher level of personal disposable income that real people feel in their real lives.  That should be the first economic responsibility and priority of the government,  yet it clearly is not. Not only is the government threatening a deficit and neglecting to pay one cent on the national debt, it  did not offer one dime in new tax relief in the budget. When  a nation has the highest level of personal income tax as a percentage of national income in the G-7 and the government does not offer a dime in new tax relief as the country goes into a recession and people are losing their jobs, it is shockingly irresponsible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, next year the government will be raising those taxes that are most sensitive for the labour market.  It will be raising payroll taxes.  Combined payroll taxes will be going up next year by 6%.  There is a $40 billion cumulative surplus in the employment insurance account which, parenthetically, is more than twice than what is necessary, according to the auditor general, to finance benefits in the most extreme downturn. Notwithstanding that, there is a cumulative surplus of $40 billion and an annual surplus of $6 billion in the EI account.  Yet the government has announced a rate reduction per $100 of premiums of only five cents for employers and employees next year.  That will be far outstripped by the largest increase in CPP premiums in Canadian history, which means that the average employee will be spending an extra $300 next year on payroll taxes split between the employer and employee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean when we are in a recession where unemployment is going up, as it did last week? Last week Statistics Canada reported that unemployment had risen from 7.3% to 7.5% with a loss of 43,000 full time jobs.  Yet the government, starting January 1, will increase the price of a job.  It will make it more difficult for small businesses to hire people on the first rung of the ladder in the labour market.  That is irresponsible as we move into a recession.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do is make it easier for people to be employed.  We need to reduce the cost of hiring Canadians by reducing payroll taxes.  We could reduce the combined employer-employee EI premiums by 25 cents to the break even level. The government would still be left with at least a notional surplus of $40 billion. We could also look at more meaningful fundamental reform to secure the future of public pensions.  By giving younger workers an option to direct a portion of their savings into regulated private savings vehicles, we would allow them to increase their returns at lower cost, thereby decreasing the overall payroll tax burden even further.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday in his budget speech the finance minister said that in the mid-1990s some Canadians were concerned about the sustainability of the public pension system but  they no longer are. He is dead wrong.  Canadians who understand the demographic time bomb and the dynamics of the aging population know that the changes made to the Canada pension plan in 1997 and 1998 simply are not sufficient to manage the enormous future expectations of our retiring population.</p>


	<A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1105)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has failed to provide stimulus to the economy in the midst of a recession into which it has led the Canadian economy, even though Canadians want and understand intuitively that tax relief helps  create wealth. According to a Léger poll  from November 18, 74% of Canadians prefer tax cuts to spending as a key to jump-starting the economy. Almost precisely the same result came from an Ipsos-Reid poll published last Friday.  Three-quarters of Canadians said  they wanted to see tax relief in this budget to stimulate growth in this recession and a majority of Canadians said they opposed new spending if it meant moving us into a deficit in this recession.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians get it.  They understand, after all  the pain we have gone through over the past decade in the country, that leaving more money in the pockets of entrepreneurs, working families and home-keepers does more to create wealth and jobs than giving that money to government politicians and bureaucrats like the ministers of industry,  culture,  heritage and HRD to waste. They understand that and so too should the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government might say  there is no more room for tax relief.  First, the government alleges that it is providing, get this,  $100 billion in tax relief over five years.  When we go to Wal-Mart and see something  priced at $9.95 we understand that is a marketing gimmick.  It is choosing a price level for marketing purposes.  The finance minister, when his bureaucrats were trying to come up with a tax plan last year, said “We have to make this $100 billion, a nice big round, three digit figure. We have to get that number as close as we possibly can to the Alliance's vigorous $125 billion tax cut”. He said “Whatever you do, boys, add up the numbers so they come up to $100 billion”.  That is exactly what they did.  It was a joke.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that the real value of that tax cut was $42.5 billion. Of the $100 billion the government claimed, $7.8 billion was increased social spending, transfers to persons, through the program known as the Canada child tax benefit.  It is not a tax cut.  It is an interesting and worthwhile program, but it is a spending program, not a tax cut.  There was $29.5 billion eaten up by the increase in CPP premiums that I just talked about. Of the government's notional tax cut, $20.7 billion was the effect of indexation of the tax brackets, of the thresholds and the exemptions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just think about that for a moment.  The government is saying “We will no  longer tax you on inflation and that non-taxation of inflation will count as a tax cut”. The government is saying that it is counting as a tax cut a non-tax increase.  Based on that logic and accounting, with revenues of $130 billion and an economy of one trillion dollars it could say that there is an $870 billion tax cut. When we net all that out, the total real tax reduction, for which we give the government some credit for grudgingly moving in our direction, was $42.5 billion or $58 billion less than advertised.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after it is fully implemented, that will still leave Canada with the highest income tax burden as percentage of national income in the G-7 and in fact in the G-8.  Let me just say that Russia is experiencing an economic turnaround today.  It has doubled its tax revenues and is  improving its balance sheet.  Why?  Because it adopted a single rate tax of 13% two years ago.  Sometimes good ideas, when given a practical chance, actually work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On corporate income tax the government did nothing yesterday.  It was not just  the Alliance  that again had recommended further tax relief.  In fact, the finance committee in its report tabled in this place a couple of weeks ago recommended the immediate elimination of the capital tax, which is an insidious tax on innovation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtually every single business group that came before the finance committee echoed this recommendation, which is why it found its way into this report.  That quote is:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Committee recommends that the federal government encourage a harmonization of the capital tax base, and the elimination of the capital tax.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Liberal majority on the finance committee.   I see one of the members here who approved this.  Are they upset that did not  find its way into this budget?  This is not a huge revenue item.  It would represent notionally forgone revenue of $1.3 billion a year, which is a relatively small piece of revenue.  It is less than the finance minister throws around as baubles to his leadership campaign friends, for TV producers and high speed Internet programs and such.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is $1.3 billion, but every major business group in the country says  this must happen.  For instance, Bruce Burrows of the Railway Association of Canada stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>At the risk of sounding repetitive, by eliminating the capital tax...the federal government would be sending a strong, positive signal to investors at a critical point in the business cycle.

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about its innovation agenda, but when businesses, the leaders who actually innovate in our economy, who create wealth, who make profits and who employee people, say that this is the best way to help our economy innovate, the government does not listen.  Instead, it gives $110 million to the industry minister to hook up people to the Internet. What is the government thinking?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no capital tax relief and there is no further corporate tax relief.  There is no tax fairness for the resource  sector,  which is still being penalized at  a second level of 28%.  Over half a million Canadians work in the energy industry involving oil, gas and mining.  It is a core industry in Canada. Those industries are being penalized by the government with a discriminatory rate of 28%.  Every  major group from that sector has called for changes, but none have been offered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say, lest I sound too polemical, that there were some minor technical tax changes in the budget that we approve of. We are pleased to see that after vigorous efforts on our part the government accepted certain technical changes to the treatment of venture capital.   We also are pleased to see that the government accepted the recommendations we made allowing more generous treatment in terms of capital gains for gifts of shares to registered charities. This was something that was pressed for very effectively by Nesbitt Burns  vice-chairman  Donald Johnson in Toronto. Those are some baby steps in the direction of tax reform.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no personal income tax relief contained in this budget.  Payroll taxes have been increased. There is no capital tax relief.  The government ignored the public's call for further tax relief.   In fact, to close out my remarks on taxation,  the government, believe it or not, is increasing taxes and revenues in this budget. With the $1.2 billion increase in CPP premiums next year, the new air traveller security charge announced and a $430 million tax increase presented to us in the supply motion currently before the House, we are talking about $2 billion in additional taxes next year.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister claims  that he is providing stimulus for the economy in this recession.  He says  there will be what he claims is a $20 billion tax cut in the calendar year 2002.  Nonsense: if we do the real accounting the actual tax cut the government is offering is in the range not of $20 billion but of $9 billion. If we net out an additional   roughly $1 billion in tax increases proposed in this budget for that year, it comes down to $8 billion, which is a measly portion for such an overtaxed economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has failed to get its priorities straight when it comes to tax relief, when it comes to the long term slide in our economy, when it comes to reallocation.  Let me address this now in terms of government expenditures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked about the huge spending increase proposed in this budget, but the government will say that   it is  important spending.  For instance, it will say that  the delivery of $160 million for fetal alcohol syndrome and youth health care programs delivered by the Department of Indian Affairs and the health care department  is important spending.  I do not think any of my colleagues would disagree with that.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1115)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that one of the moral imperatives of the government must be to address the root causes of poverty and despair on our aboriginal reserves, but  let us be clear.  There is $10 billion of combined spending from all three levels of government on aboriginal persons.  There is $7 billion alone at the federal level. While that department  has received the largest spending increases of any department over the past six or seven years, we continue to see the standard of living of people who are the ostensible recipients of that generosity deteriorate, the despair increase and the hope disappear. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is wrong with the way in which we are actually allocating those moneys.   Certainly the auditor general has   identified at length the waste, mismanagement and frankly, corruption in the administration of programs through aboriginal affairs.  I have a 10 page briefing note of misuse of taxpayers' money by band councils which was extracted from the auditor general's report.  There were hundreds of millions of dollars of waste. My colleague from Vancouver Island North, the official opposition critic for aboriginal affairs, will be detailing some of the waste.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that we should be putting money into fetal alcohol syndrome, youth education and health care for aboriginal people, but we should be finding that money by taking it away from the waste and corruption that the auditor general has identified. Instead of increasing overall spending and ignoring the wasteful spending, we should cut the wasteful spending to target it strategically in areas like fetal alcohol syndrome.  That is called priority setting.  That is what the government has failed to do.  It  does it in various departments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at some of the waste in the budget.  First, we just need to refer again to the auditor general's report last week.  She referred to grants and contributions of over $16 billion which are rife with waste.  She said that there is waste and abuse in at least 16 departments. She identified grotesque examples of this kind of waste. We all know what they are. That has been added to in the budget.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister has given the Minister of Industry, as I mentioned before, $110 million for his pet project for the Internet so that he could say that he   won something in the budget in the  bizarre ego game that goes around the Liberal cabinet in the budget-making exercise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was $160 million for the Minister of Canadian Heritage's friends in the TV industry.  What is that about?  We are talking  about kids starving on aboriginal reserves, about Canadians waiting six months for  critical operations, about a military with equipment that dates from the 1950s and we are giving $160 million to TV producers?  Where is the government's priorities?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be $170 million given to the Minister of Health for health programs that will not actually deliver any health care to people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Coyne said in his article today that he is not sure when it was decided that the leadership campaign should be publicly funded but  at least the Minister of Finance should have been told.  In other words the Prime Minister seems to have written the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is waste.  We have identified $6 billion to $7 billion of low priority spending which could be reallocated to the urgent and high priorities of national security, tax relief and health care. Some $6 billion of waste. There is at least $1.2 billion in corporate welfare grants from the government.  There is $1 billion a year in regional development schemes like western economic diversification.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often when we talk about regional development in this party people think we are picking on one region.  I will offer up, and I think my colleagues from the west would agree with me, we do not want western economic diversification and its $300 million of business welfare.  Let it go into the private sector along with FORD-Q and ACOA.  There is $1 billion there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are subsidies to bloated crown corporations like the $1 billion annual subsidy to the CBC.     We know that company could offer it more effectively by raising capital through the private sector.</p>


	<A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1120)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked about waste in the department of aboriginal affairs, not core spending but waste. As well, there are certain tax expenditures that the government could crack down on to save taxpayers money. For instance, we are losing about $800 million a year on a tax break that is being abused by certain people in the film  production business. That should be cracked down on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mintz commission recommended over $2 billion in base broadening measures for the corporate tax system which have not been implemented by the government. These measures alone could be implemented so that we could afford the tax measures for the resource sector and afford the elimination of the capital tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues remind me that in terms of priorities, our farmers are going bankrupt because they are on the losing end of an international trade war being subsidized by the treasuries of the United States and the European Union. It is virtually not even an issue on the foreign policy agenda of the government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked for $500 million, a relative pittance in international terms as emergency support for our agricultural sector. The government has been able to find $160 million for TV producers, an $800 million tax break for movie producers that it still has not closed, but it cannot find $500 million for farmers who are going bankrupt and are losing fourth and fifth generation farms. The government does not have its priorities straight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, we have identified $6 billion in waste and low priority spending. I would include in the list over $2 billion in equity positions which the government still has in Petro-Canada and Hibernia. The government made commitments   to sell those shares years ago. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in the 1997 budget that the finance minister said the government would liquidate its shares in Petro-Can, shares which reached historically high   values about six or seven months ago and which are now on the decline. The government has already lost an opportunity for $2 billion that could go to debt reduction which would reduce the interest payments by a couple of hundred million dollars. That is $200 million that could then go to health care and agriculture. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is holding on to Petro-Canada and Hibernia shares because the Prime Minister has some strange 1970s twisted dream about government ownership of the energy sector. He does not want to lose hold of that symbol of the national energy program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of reallocating, instead of making choices as the finance minister said he would do, instead of selling redundant assets, instead of allowing crown corporations to raise their funds in the private sector instead of from taxpayers, instead of ending corporate welfare, the government has not done one of those things. This is why we find ourselves driving into a big fiscal hole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not been able to calculate the full effect of yesterday's budget, but before yesterday's budget, it was very clear that the government was missing a $50 billion opportunity over the next four years to get its priorities straight. Let me explain. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every private sector economist and business group  has encouraged the government to limit its program spending increases to 3% per year on average, which would be the average combined rate of inflation plus growth in population. In fact the finance committee reiterated its longstanding recommendation that the government limit spending increases on the program side to 3% a year. If we were to do so, that is the combined level of inflation and population so it would mean no absolute cuts in program spending but, as I have expressed, the government has been raising spending at rates of 6%, 7% and 8% per year. If the government were to restrain its program spending to the level of 3% that we have  recommended, it would have over the next four years an additional $50 billion available for tax relief, debt reduction, health care and agriculture, in other words, the priorities of Canadians. That does not even account for the effect of the reallocation of $6 billion a year that we in the opposition have suggested.</p>


	<A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1125)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance often says that our numbers do not add up. If he takes out a calculator and extrapolates the program spending line of 5% minimum, which is what the Liberals are on, versus the 3% that we recommend, he will find an extra $50 billion that could go to working families to improve their standard of living, to eliminate capital taxes, to pay down the debt, to reduce payroll taxes, to improve the quality of and access to health care for Canadians. In other words it would   get the  priorities straight, which the government has failed to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the last section of my remarks regarding national security. The government has agreed that the budget must address the urgent imperative of national security. We do not need a lot of poetry about what happened on September 11. We all suffered an abrupt wake-up call on that morning. It has changed our world but I really do not think it has fundamentally  changed the government's priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months ago today, violence of the worst kind was inflicted on our neighbours, friends and relatives to the south. We realized that the idea of globalization is not a concept; it is a reality and it is here, particularly for those of us on this continent. We share such a marvelous relationship with that great democracy to the south.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do our part. We have a moral obligation as a free and democratic nation not to be a grudging or half-hearted participant in the war on terrorism but to be there on the front line, shoulder to shoulder with the United States of America and our treaty allies every step of the way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget yesterday the government outlined  some $7.7 billion in ostensible security measures over five years. Again with its goofy accounting some of these measures are over two years, some over three years and some over five years, but we do not have the time to break down the accounting here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say that of the moneys it is proposing for security areas,  first of all, it is not all security. Some $600 million of it is for infrastructure at the borders, which is good. We endorse that. We recommended half a billion dollars for infrastructure at the borders so that we can accelerate trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We endorse and support a  number of the measures: increased resources for screening incoming immigrants and refugees; prescreening overseas; hopefully new technology for passport screening; biometric identification technology or at least we hope prototypes  will be experimented with; and additional personnel at both customs and immigration. These are all measures we support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed the government actually has taken a step in the right direction in terms of funding for both the RCMP and CSIS. However I would point out  the reason it had to take a step in that direction is that since 1995 the government  has cut  resources drastically for our front line police and security intelligence services. It is proposing a $1.6 billion cumulative increase for these two agencies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSIS budget, even after these increases, will fall far short of where it was in real terms in 1993. It will still be 20% lower than the $244 million it was at in 1993. In fact we in the official opposition have recommended a much larger increase to the  intelligence agency. We have proposed a $100 million annual increase and the Liberal budget breaks down to a $55 million annual increase. We proposed an increase roughly twice the size of what the government has. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as an example, we currently spend less than $200 million Canadian on intelligence. The United States spends some $30 billion U.S. on intelligence. We literally spend a fraction of one per cent of what the Americans do in relative terms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the RCMP, it saw its budget gutted. As a result the RCMP saw the amount of federal officers decrease by 16% from 5,200 in 1994 to 4,300 in 2000.</p>


	<A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1130)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over $100 million a year is needed just to reverse the decline in officers.   RCMP resources were already stretched to the limit before September 11.  We do not think the funding increase for the RCMP is adequate.  It falls short of the minimum $250 million needed for 2,000 new officers.  That is why we have called for a $315 million increase to the annual RCMP budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the border measures and new infrastructure to expedite trade at the 49th parallel. However the sharp edge of national security is our military and national defence.  It represents our ultimate power as a nation to assert our values in defence of freedom and democracy.  The budget is an embarrassment and an abject failure when it comes to providing adequate resources for our men and women in uniform.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some 56,000 people, 44,000 less than there were in 1993, who wear a uniform which symbolizes their willingness to die for Canada and its values.  These are people who stand willingly to make the ultimate sacrifice. We as a parliament, and indeed taxpayers of the country, must be prepared to make a sacrifice for them by giving them the  equipment they need to do the job we assign them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's defence budget was an embarrassment.  The government announced $1.2 billion for the military over five years, an average annual increase of just $240 million.  That is far short of the $1.3 billion minimum the auditor general said is required to bring the forces up to a level of minimal operational effectiveness and further short of the $2 billion the Conference of Defence Associations has recommended for operational effectiveness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence spending last year totalled $9.7 billion.  That is $1.6 billion lower than the 1993 total of $11.3 billion in nominal, not real terms.  The defence budget would have to increase to $12.6 billion just to bring inflation adjusted spending in defence up to the 1993 level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of these drastic military cutbacks is that Canada now has the second lowest defence expenditure in NATO.  To our everlasting shame we are virtually tied with the lowest defence expenditure, that of the Duchy of Luxembourg which has a standing army of 800 people.  In relative terms it is the only country that spends less than we do on the military.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spend less than half the NATO average.  As a percentage of national income our defence expenditure is 1.1% of our gross domestic product.  The NATO  average is 2.1%.  Our American friends whom by neglect we effectively  force to subsidize our defence spend 3.3% of their national income on defence.  That is three times what we do in relative terms.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada ended the second world war with the third largest navy in the world, the fourth largest standing army, and one of the most effective and respected air forces. It was a true valiant defender of freedom from 1940 to 1945.  Now we are an open joke in international defence circles, not because of a lack of bravery, expertise or courage on the part of our fighting men and women but because of a lack of equipment, resources and personnel through government funding.  It must end.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought September 11 would wake us to this new reality.  If we were to simply raise our spending to the NATO average, not exceed it but meet it, it would require a doubling of our defence budget.  Clearly that is something we cannot achieve overnight.  It gives us a picture of how far behind we have fallen.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yesterday's budget the government provides only $300 million for new equipment.  About three-quarters of new defence expenditure announced yesterday will be allocated to new tasking being given to our military such as guarding important installations, nuclear power sites and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are giving the military a dollar but saying it must use 75 cents of it to do new tasks.  We are giving it virtually nothing in terms of new equipment. It is no wonder the budget has been roundly condemned by experts in the Canadian defence community.</p>


	<A NAME="T1135"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1135"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1135)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Alliance Party have  recommended an immediate increase of at least $2 billion in addition to the $1 billion or $2 billion for operational costs immediately associated with Operation Apollo so we can, it is hoped, eventually achieve something like the NATO average.  My colleague   from Lakeland, the opposition critic for defence, will be expanding on this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not a security budget.  The government took some small steps in the right direction in certain areas and thankfully followed our advice in some of those areas.  However the war on terrorism is not over.  The war in Afghanistan was phase one of a task that will take years  and potentially decades.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's budget reflects a basic flaw in Liberal political thinking.  The Liberals believe peace is the ordinary condition of humankind. They believe in the perfectibility of human nature.   They cannot understand that every now and then we are interrupted by violence and the reality of history.  They cannot understand that there is evil on the planet from which we must protect ourselves and all other free nations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this one more time because I feel it so strongly.  We have a moral obligation to do our part and no less.  It is so wrong for us to get on our moral high horse, as Liberals so often do in Canada,  and criticize our friends in the United States for their many failings while at the same time allowing and essentially forcing American taxpayers to subsidize our defence.  It is wrong and it must come to an end.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget has failed to get the government's priorities straight.  It has failed to present clear, easily understood and transparent projections for the future of the government's accounts.  The government has put Canada into a planning deficit based on its previous accounting standards before it moved the goal posts in this budget.  It has refused to give even a token acknowledgment of the need for debt reduction in  a country with the third highest debt in the developed world.  It has done nothing to respond to the recession into which it has led us.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the budget in terms of the tax relief three-quarters of Canadians are demanding.  There is nothing to help us reverse the decade of drift we have suffered  under the Liberal government.  There is nothing to set priorities straight, reduce wasteful spending, reallocate spending and liquidate redundant government assets.  The budget  has fallen far short of what is minimally necessary to provide our military with the resources to defend and advance our national security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, the budget falls far short of what I expected from the finance minister.  Once again it reflects the politics of his boss, the Prime Minister.  It is a shame.  It is a missed opportunity, the consequences of which will be clear to us in the years to come.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today we are still wondering why the Minister of Finance brought his budget down now instead of waiting until March.  Two months ago, he was asked to move it ahead, particularly with respect to defence and security, and to support the flagging economic and employment situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person did not need to be a  genius—and I include the minister in this group—to figure out that the economy was in a downturn.  That is why he was asked to move up his budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday brought a rude awakening, however. An examination of the budget shows that it contains nothing significant for the economy.  This budget even includes one totally ridiculous measure, which demonstrates this government's lack of finesse and intelligence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the first industry hit by the economic slowdown, and even  more so by the events of September 11, was the airline industry.  We were expecting the government to help this industry.  It did the opposite.  It imposed an additional tax of $2.2 billion on air travel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What prompted the government to slap another tax on the sector hit the hardest by the economic slowdown and the events of September 11, as it was claiming to be supporting the economy?  Where is the logic?  This measure alone shows how ridiculous and illogical the budget is.  It also shows how little impact it has on  the economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance had the means to support the economy.  We will return to this a little later, when we talk about the surpluses and the tradition that has established itself in parliament since the Minister of Finance took office. I refer to the systematic annual underestimation  of the government's true surpluses and the real manoeuvring room available to him, as of this year, to assume his responsibilities  as the Minister of Finance and support the economy and employment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone looked for  support for the health and education sectors.  In Quebec as in the rest of Canada, everyone has been calling for the past year for an infusion of money into health care and education.  Last year's agreement was not enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the provinces and the government of Quebec drained, obviously even the slightest increase is immediately welcome, because health care and educational needs are growing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the means at the disposal of the Minister of Finance, nothing in the budget provides for the return, through the Canada social transfer, to the government of Quebec and the provinces, of the wherewithal  to enable them to meet their obligations in providing health care, education and income security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really quite incredible that, given today's headlines about the lack of resources for seniors and the sick, the Minister of Finance is unmoved by their fate and that reserved for education.  Our Minister of Finance is cold and insensitive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance has cut the Canada social transfer by $35 billion since 1995. This is approximately the amount by which he has paid down the debt. He has used the sick, the elderly and the most disadvantaged members of our society to pay down the debt. And he has used these unexpected surpluses in the EI fund—$7 billion again this year, which the Minister of Finance will pocket instead of helping the unemployed—to produce these surpluses and these annual performances. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about employment insurance.  From a strictly logical point of view, we would have expected to see the government act on the 17 recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and  reform the EI system so that the majority of workers who find themselves unemployed are not disqualified from receiving benefits. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are facing a major downturn, or a recession, to call it what it is, where thousands of people, and there will be more in the weeks to come, will join the ranks of the unemployed.</p>


	<A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1145)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of helping these people through a difficult period, the Minister of Finance has decided to maintain the status quo and continue to deny them benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this economic slowdown, many people will find themselves in a tough spot tomorrow morning, thinking that they are entitled to EI, because they have never had to apply for benefits during the last eight or nine years of economic growth.  They will be in a tough spot when they find out that they do not qualify, because the criteria are too restrictive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actuary has just given his forecast a few days ago; the ink on the documents is not yet dry. The actuary said that the surplus would be $7 billion. This is $8 billion less the $1 billion set aside by the Minister of Finance for reductions in premiums; the balance is $7 billion. In his budget, the Minister of Finance notes that the surplus in the EI fund is barely  $3.7   billion.  This is cooking the books.  This is what we have come to expect of him in the past five years; that he will underestimate the surplus.  As MInister of Finance, he is not doing his job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also expecting announcements to be made to help and support regions that are  experiencing problems. Instead, the Minister of Finance mentioned the transport tax that will hit the airline industries. The regions will be severely affected by this measure. A person flying from Gaspé to Mont-Joli will pay $24 more on a return ticket, as though air fares in the regions were not high enough to begin with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things being equal, it is the regions that will be hardest hit by this new tax. Another tax. This is another fee being charged that relegates people living in the regions to the status of second class citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about tax breaks. Yes, last year's tax breaks have been maintained. That is precisely what we did not want. We wanted the minister to restore some balance to the tax breaks, because the tax breaks introduced for the next five years help those in very high income brackets for the most part.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me provide an example. This year, Mr. Speaker, you would be lucky if you earned $250,000 or more, because you would save $9,000 in federal taxes. I know that this is not the case for you, Mr. Speaker, but those earning $250,000 were coddled by our millionaire Minister of Finance. He will be saving $9,000 in federal income taxes this year. A person earning $40,000 however, will save $300. Last night I took part in—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>Shame.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</b> It is shameful, yes. Last night I took part in an open-line broadcast. A gentleman called in and said that his family income was approximately $10,000 per year. He has a permanent disability, and a dependent. Last year and this year—this year, I am referring to last April—he paid $600 in federal income taxes. His income is $10,000, he is a person with a disability and has a dependent. Is this what a fair tax system looks like? Is this what tax breaks that help everyone look like? It is time to stop kidding us and taking us for fools.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had asked that some balance be restored to these tax breaks to help middle and low income earners. Nothing. All this time, our Minister of Finance, whom we have been watching closely since 1993, with his shipping lines in Barbados for example, has been working on a tax convention between Canada and Barbados that has been denounced by the OECD.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OECD is not full of members of the Bloc Quebecois. The OECD has said that  tax conventions signed with countries such as Barbados, which is a tax haven, facilitate tax avoidance. They facilitate unfair tax practices. They even facilitate, to some degree, money laundering in a number of tax havens, which have been clearly identified by the OECD.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Minister of Finance pushes on, as though it were no big deal to allow this tax convention to be maintained. The auditor general recently said that in a sample of 53 of the richest taxpayers in Canada, among them, they had $800 million in assets in Barbados, completely sheltered from federal taxes, while back home, we are forcing a person earning a yearly income of $10,000 with a dependent and a disability to boot to pay. We are making him pay federal income tax, but $800 million in assets belonging to 53 of the richest people in Canada is tucked away in Barbados, sheltered from the Canadian tax system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tax convention is being allowed to remain in effect. It is shameful. Since 1993, we have been asking the Minister of Finance to reform the tax system to make it fairer, to close tax loopholes and put an end to injustices.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance carries on as if nothing were amiss, as if he had done everything possible, as if his cumulative tax cuts of $100 billion, which he speaks of ad nauseam, were helping everyone.  Easy, one accumulates funds for five years and ends up at some point with a huge sum.  Who is going to benefit from this?  His gang, not the people watching us here, not the people who helped put public finances back on an even keel.  The middle income families and the workers with their contributions to the EI fund, as well as the employers, particularly small and medium size businesses, are the ones who financed part of the spectacular announcements our poor excuse for a  Minister of Finance has been making to us for the past five years.  This is disgraceful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are patting themselves on the back as far as international aid is concerned.  It has been stepped up by $300 million per year.  Under the circumstances that have been a concern to us ever since the events of September 11, it became evident fairly quickly—and to everyone, not just my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois—that there are two ways of combating terrorism.  There is force, via national defence and security, and then there is the ongoing battle we must be engaged in against world poverty.  This is what produces the breeding ground for international terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda recruit their future terrorists, the people who will become suicide bombers,  and where?  In areas fertile for terrorism, that is in areas where children and adolescents living through civil wars, or just plain wars, have been  without hope since they were very young.   Year after year, they have to deal with growing injustices.  They have access to the media and see how rich the West is.  They know  our children are born with hope for the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countries with  pockets of incredible poverty, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, offer a fertile terrain for terrorism.   There  it is easy to recruit people who have nothing left to lose and everything to gain for the future of their people.  Because of their vulnerability, they can readily be convinced that they will become heroes, immortalized by a glorious death.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to recruit terrorists in these breeding grounds, and this is why international aid becomes one of the key facets in any strategy against terrorism.  What do we learn from the budget?  That there will be $300 million more annually. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is increasing international aid from 0.25%  of the GDP to 0.26% of it, one tenth of one percentage point.  Is this not incredible?  The objective proposed by the OECD of  0.7% of the GDP is the figure proposed by former Prime Minister Pearson, winner of the Nobel peace prize and initiator of Canada's peacekeeping force.  At the rate we are going, we will never achieve this objective.  We calculated the growth of the GDP with spending at the rate presented yesterday.  At the rate of $300 million a year, we will never reach 0.7% of the GDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have to understand that we must, of course, look after the poor and our fellow citizens.  However, the events of September 11 should perhaps make people give thought to the wars going on overseas, in the middle east and elsewhere, and the human suffering involved.  Globalization brings human suffering closer, through the media and unfortunate events such as those of September 11.  In this case, we can no longer say that the events are happening elsewhere and do not concern us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are taking place elsewhere right now and they concern us.  The government, which has not been pulling its weight in international aid—this fact is recognized worldwide—should have further increased international aid, and did not do so in the latest budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of infrastructure, things are shameful.  The government said it was going to invest in infrastructure in order to stimulate the economy and get the jump on projects.  In Quebec, in the most recent budget, Ms. Marois, the finance minister in the Landry government, with few means at her disposal, decided to push projects along in order to stimulate the economy and help people get through the economic slowdown.</p>


	<A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1155)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the government has the means, but not the ideas.  It is incredible. It is putting $600 million new dollars into infrastructure over the next three years. It talks about a foundation that will perhaps one day be receiving funding. But it has budgeted nothing for this period, when what was required was rapid action to stimulate the economy. Now it is talking about creating a foundation, which it might fund in the future. Why has it not used the money at its disposal? Why has it not put it directly into the trilateral agreement with the provinces and municipalities? It would have been so simple. But it would not have been a good idea  politically.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a government that is interested in appearances only, and that resorts to propaganda. It actually says that health and education are its priorities, when for every dollar the government of Quebec spends on health, it spends only 13 cents, and for every dollar the government of Quebec spends on education, it spends only 8 cents. And it calls these priorities? Right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It mails out propaganda to everyone saying that it considers health and education priorities. Is this not a shocking misrepresentation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of parental leave, the budget contains nothing in the way of a transfer to Quebec City for the young families awaiting the introduction of Ms. Goupil's parental leave system. Is it not disgraceful to put one's popularity as a manager  generating spectacular unexpected surpluses ahead of the needs of young families? It is reprehensible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about aboriginals: $185 million over two years is peanuts.  Following through on the recommendations in the royal commission of inquiry would have required a minimum of $500 million, and $238 million  this year alone  to help young aboriginals with their post-secondary education. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very fine and well to say that one wants to help aboriginals and support their initiatives. But when one says before the budget is brought  down that it will be a budget for aboriginals as well, and then announces spending as paltry as this, it is a disgrace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Minister of Finance have the means to do this? Of course. We will repeat again  what we have been saying for the past five years, namely that, this year again,  the Minister of Finance has systematically underestimated the surplus. This year's surplus will not be $7 billion, with nothing under these new initiatives; it will be $13 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the minister is again hiding a net surplus of $6 billion. This is $6 billion  he could have invested in health, to  help the elderly, in education,  and in  employment insurance reform, to help  the unemployed. This is rather incredible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past eight years, the Minister of Finance has been telling people “Help me put our fiscal house in order; help me deal with our deficit; help me make sure that we have a sound tax system”. The public said “Yes, we are prepared to make sacrifices”. But when the time comes to help these same people make it through  difficult times, the Minister of Finance runs and hides. He  has abdicated his responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nine years of economic growth, this once  we asked him to come up with innovative ideas to support the economy, to do his job as manager of the public treasury, so as to get us out of this recession as quickly as possible. But the Minister of Finance is  not proposing anything to support the economy.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought he would confuse us with his defence and security issues. People are not stupid. Defence and security, sure, but economic security is also important. Helping the unemployed and those who will join them in the future because of the economic slowdown is also important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no. The minister claims that he has done everything he could, that he does not want to have a deficit again. What a joke. It is ridiculous to say that we could have a deficit this year or next year. We have looked at the worst case scenarios for economic growth. We did a thorough analysis of the government's expenditures and revenues, and concluded that it is “i-m-p-o-s-s-i-b-l-e” to have a deficit, particularly  with yesterday's budget. It is plain impossible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance tells us that we must be careful. He is also budgeting a surplus of only $3.7 billion for this year in the employment insurance fund. He must really think we are stupid to come up with something like this.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are condemning this budget and, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I will propose an amendment to the amendment presented this morning. We will work very hard to explain to the public  this budget, which does not include any measures to help  those who will the worse off in the coming weeks. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have two questions for the member. First, almost all of his remarks are based on a fictitious surplus of about $13 billion. Given that he is the only economist in the country with such a far-fetched forecast, my question for him is the following: why should the government believe him rather than all the other economists in the country, unless he is perhaps the most brilliant economist in the land?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question concerns health.  In terms of health funding in Canada, it seems to me that the BQ and the PQ are talking from both sides of their mouth. On the one hand, they never acknowledge income tax points that we have given in the past as federal transfers. The federal share of government spending in Quebec is actually 30%. They never mention it, because this figure includes tax points. On the other hand, today they are asking that tax points to be transferred; in other words, they want the federal government to provide the Quebec transfer in the form of tax points. After which, Quebec would not count these transfers. So, from the separatist perspective, this is a great idea. However, from the perspective of the federal government or of Canadians who are not separatists, why would  such a proposal be considered?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as usual, the parliamentary secretary is extremely cynical, and his words are verging on demagoguery and insult.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have here in my hands is a calculator. If our Liberal colleague were less lazy, he would take his out,  as he did when an economist for the Royal Bank—and a little more objective then than he is now—and would do his calculations as we do, according to the economic growth forecasts by the major Canadian banks and financial institutions, the Desjardins movement, the Caisse de dépôt et de placement du Québec, the Royal Bank, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and so on.  We come up with the same figures as the Minister of Finance for the growth of the GDP over the next few years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while making use of the economists' hypotheses—we are intelligent enough here to do some calculations and use some non-partisan discernment—we also use this little thing I showed, called a calculator, and look at the government's funds coming in and going out, the month-by-month expenditures, and formulate certain hypotheses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind my cynical colleague that, every year for the past five, we have called a press conference to release our estimates of the surplus, six months or often even a  year before the Minister of Finance releases his, or before the end-of-year surplus is announced.  In five years, we have been out a total of $3 billion, while the Minister of Finance has, particularly since 1995, been $60 billion out in his predictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why should the public believe us instead of the Minister of Finance?  Because they have been deceived by the Minister of Finance for the past five years.  For five years, the Minister of Finance has made some unbelievable errors in calculation.   For five years, the Minister of Finance has been concealing surpluses.  Why now should they favour the transfer of tax points to the government of Quebec?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see why he is no longer with the Royal Bank.  Because economic analysis is not his strong suit.  Once tax points have changed hands, they no longer belong to the one who has handed them over.  It is like selling a house; it is no longer yours once you have sold it.  The tax points from the 1960s and 1970s for funding health care, education and so on were handed over to the government of Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member wants  these points to be taken into account, let us also take into account the tax points that the province gave to the federal government for the war effort, when it gave up its direct taxation field. If the hon. member takes into account the tax points given by both sides, he will be surprised to see how much the federal government owes to Quebec. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we in favour of transforming federal cash transfers into tax points for the Quebec government? For two reasons. First,  to protect ourselves against the political decisions and drastic cuts that the Minister of Finance has been imposing  since 1995 in the Canada social transfer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we want the transfer of tax points for personal income tax, because it will grow in the coming years. It has been growing at an annual rate of 6% of federal revenues over the past four years. These are two good reasons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that even a federalist such as the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party is in favour of  a transfer of tax points. There is a consensus on this issue in Quebec. The hon. member should know that, since he lived in Quebec for a long time. But it is true that, at some point,   partisanship made him forget everything, including his past, his analysis and his qualifications as an economist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we favour a transfer of tax points? It is for these three main reasons. There may be a fourth reason, which is that we are convinced that the needs are in Quebec. The needs are in the Canadian provinces. These are urgent needs in areas such as health and education. This government does not have the brains to  realize it. The budget  it delivered yesterday shows without a doubt that it does not have a clue as to what  people's priorities are.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Bloc Quebecois member too.   The people of Canada  have another need.  I refer here to farmers and farm producers across Canada.  There is nothing here at all for the farmers.  I have looked through the whole thing.  There are 300 pages.  There is nothing at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers throughout Quebec and in western Canada are facing a major crisis.  I am thinking of farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, who are involved in the production of wheat and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the member propose for our farmers with regard to subsidies or federal government aid?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-107158"></A><a HREF="#Int-107160"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107156"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvan Loubier: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased by the question from my colleague of the New Democratic Party, since I used to be an economist with L'Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec.  I am still very much attuned to farming issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the problem of  farm subsidies remains unchanged.  In recent years, and especially with the eighth GATT round, which led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization, it was decided to reduce trade distorting subsidies.   That was in 1993.  It concerned 140 countries belonging to the WTO.  It was agreed to reduce these subsidies to a given level annually until they were finally eliminated and to retain only those subsidies that did not have a distorting effect on international prices and exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, some countries made greater efforts than others, and Canada is one of these.   We were, to put it another way, more catholic than the Pope, as we would say in Quebec.  We cut our subsidies more than the Americans and the Europeans, so that, at the moment, prices on international markets remain depressed.  Western exporters are facing lower prices on the export market.  These lower prices are the result of the unfair American and European subsidies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we again find ourselves in a situation like this, where  competition hinges not on the quality of our agricultural products—wheat, pork, dairy products, and so forth—but on the subsidies provided by governments of the larger nations or regions in the world. It is essential that the current round of WTO negotiations correct this problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for this government, it has thrown out the baby with the bath water. In attempting to do something about subsidies which were causing distortions, it jeopardized, and is still jeopardizing, the survival of farm families. Even though  they are among the best producers in the world, with top quality products and an excellent price-quality ratio in a normal market, they are not able to compete with producers and exporters receiving billions of dollars in subsidies annually.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that the government did something, stepped up its negotiations and took a stronger stand internationally, first, so as  to reduce subsidies, which are distorting international prices and, second, to put a little money in the pockets of agricultural producers in Quebec and in Canada, to give them a new lease on life. This is what it will take to keep our agri-food industry going. Otherwise, its survival is at risk.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to indicate at the outset that I intend to divide my time with the NDP finance critic, the hon. member for Regina--Qu'Appelle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened very carefully to the budget address yesterday delivered by the finance minister. In that budget address he congratulated himself on the clear-eyed vision contained in the budget. I believe those were the words. I would suggest that the finance minister needs to make an urgent appointment with an optician, an optometrist or an ophthalmologist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us hope that in the process he will discover one of the really short-sighted measures or  shortcomings in the budget, which is to give the kind of resources to our health care system and recognize what an important part of the definition of security this is for the average Canadian.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister also made it clear that the central purpose of the budget was to make Canadians safer and  to ensure that Canadians had greater security. I am compelled to say that, even in terms of the definition given by the government, the stated purpose and principal objective of the budget, it has failed miserably. It has failed miserably because its definition of security is so narrow that it excludes a great many of the priorities that Canadians would list if we asked them what  things  they wanted their government to accept some responsibility for to create greater security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget in many ways is a fraud, a deception. It really is a bogus budget because it conveniently ignores many commitments already made by the Liberal government. It actually ignores a number of things contained in its own red book. There is nothing new about that. It completely ignores previous commitments made but not budgeted in previous budgets. It is very evident that it absolutely dismisses and discards a number of priorities, which the government stated when it brought forth its most recent Speech from the Throne. There are many I could list but I will just give two examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is increasing the security and helping to lift out of poverty first nations people in the country. Second, whatever happened to the commitment to climate change? There was absolute silence in this budget about taking any proactive measures or leadership to finally live up to our Kyoto commitments. Security, at its most basic, is about Canadians having the opportunity to breathe clean air and drink safe water. On those issues the government virtually was silent in the budget introduced yesterday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is in the budget? The budget contains a lot of measures that are regurgitated, repeated and recycled from previous budgets, in fact measures that are already implemented and in the financial stream. When we set aside all  the measures that fall into that category, what we have essentially is $1.5 billion in the budget that could be described as a genuine allocation of resources to deal with Canadians' priority concerns about security and a mere $1.5 billion that could be described as genuinely stimulative of the economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely true that there are some measures to deal with airport security and some measures to reinvest in policing and border controls, but let us be very clear that that is only one kind of security, physical security which is important, and we support those measures.</p>


	<A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However let us also not forget, even though the government would conveniently like to forget and hope Canadians forget, that what is largely required in this area is to reinvest and reinstate dollars to provide for adequate RCMP and other policing, to rehire immigration and customs officials and others who actually lost their jobs because the government decided that public sector jobs did not matter and that public services  were not what Canadians wanted.  Thank goodness the government has finally recognized it and is responding to the urgings we have made again and again, </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations for this belated revelation on the part of the government.  We welcome its conversion to the view of the majority of Canadians that public services do matter, not just in a crisis, not just in the aftermath of something as horrifying as what happened on September 11, but day in and day out, year in and year out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the security provided by our military?  It is true there are some measures in this budget that address the chronic underfunding of our military in a number of important areas.  However when we take account of the $510 million already committed in Operation Apollo, what is left is less than $1 billion allocated to the military  over the next five years. This is unbelievable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from Halifax.  I have a lot of  families in my riding, as do  my colleagues from  Dartmouth and Sackville--Musquodoboit Valley--Eastern Shore, which I think is the longest name of any riding in the country.  Does anyone know what those families think of when they think of security?  They think of their loved ones, their mothers or fathers, who are committed to military duty for  the country and who stand up for Canadians. They think of their loved ones when their jobs require them to fly in a Sea King helicopter, and they are racked with fear and insecurity about the possibility that the Sea King will crash.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the NDP defence critic, and I just did a quick calculation of the budget figures.  We have concluded that, based on the allocation of dollars in this budget over the next five years for Canada's military, we could purchase one and a half new helicopters in each of the next five years.  That is what we have.  That is without beginning to address what is needed in the way of more resources for recruitment, for training   and for  adequately paying military personnel.  A great many of those families are not only racked with the insecurity of what it means to have loved ones go off into a military combat arena, they are racked with the insecurity of families who are not even adequately paid and have inadequate shelter.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security is  a dual concept.  Clearly, there is the physical security, but there is also the economic and social security,  security for the poor, particularly the children, the  homeless, the unemployed, low income families and   small farmers, who are going through a serious crisis these days.  There is the security of Canadians who have to live through the  recession.   </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister has tried to create the impression that this is a stimulative budget, that it will address many of the economic and social concerns in the country and at the same time give the kind of stimulus that is necessary to ensure that Canada does not tip into a recession.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little basis for confidence that the budget will avert the recession that is surely coming down the road.  Today's analysis of the budget makes it very clear that this is not a stimulative budget.  It would have required an investment of $9 billion to $10 billion on top of the security provisions that were clearly going to be part of the budget. When we strip away all those already announced, already implemented provisions, the stimulus is approximately $1.5 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether Avery Shenfeld, senior economist with the CIBC world markets, was among the 100 economists who said in advance, through the  Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, that we needed an investment of $10 billion to avert a recession.  However, he said in <i>Globe and Mail</i> today  said:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question although I find it absolutely shocking to think that the secretary of state would not be aware of what the NDP's long time policy has been with respect to overseas development assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make it very clear.  The first plank in that priority platform would be to do what the government has steadfastly refused to do, and that is to move decisively and dramatically in the direction of restoring overseas development aid to .7% of the GDP.  This was  a commitment made by the government when it sought office, yet  it has brought us an unprecedented reduction of overseas development assistance,   down  I believe to .25% of our GDP. That is unbelievable.  This is less than one-third of what the Liberal government said it would do and far less than what many countries in the world, which are a great deal poorer than Canada, have long  implemented in their respective budgets.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the most serious crisis in the country right now is facing our farmers who provide food for our breakfast, lunch and dinner every day.   In the budget there is just a paragraph about having further talks with the farmers and not one red cent to assist our them.

	Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is absolutely right.  We have a serious farm crisis on the prairies, in other sectors of the agricultural economy and in other parts of the country as well.  Yet the government's commitment to deal with that crisis constitutes nothing more than a commitment to continue discussions about what might be done.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely clear that we need to put in place workable income stabilization programs.  We called in advance of the budget for a commitment to do that.  That is exactly  what the farmers and farm families have called for.  That is exactly what farm communities, municipal leaders and business leaders in those farm communities have called for.  They know that, if the government does not begin to act on the farm crisis,  it will devastate not just the lives of a great many farmers and their families but it will devastate whole rural parts of the country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, continuing overseas development programs when the Liberal government has gutted the existing programs is laughable so  I have no suggestions along those lines, although I am sure it was suggestions about eliminating things that led to the paltry budget measures of the government  for ODA.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that I want to give credit where it is due.  It is welcome that the government has finally seen fit to commit to some increases, but I am very worried. When I look in the budget for a line item that makes it absolutely clear  those dollars have been committed, they are not there. In this budget no dollar amount has been allocated for increased overseas development aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we asked finance officials about this they said the dollars would come out of the surplus, if there was any.  I do not call that an ironclad commitment to remove the shame and embarrassment of the government's paltry commitment to overseas development aid.  I do not think it  gives much comfort to many Canadians who have been fighting for an improved allocation of international development monetary assistance.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the budget  presented yesterday is really one that contains an awful  lot of smoke and mirrors in terms of the wizardry of the Minister of Finance.  In fact, there are probably more tricks in this budget than there are in the Harry Potter movie.  There is a lot of smoke and mirrors and a  lot of bark  but very little bite in this budget when it comes to what is really necessary for the people of this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is really a budget of missed opportunities on the part of the federal government.   The only thing the government addresses is the issue of national security and much of that was under pressure from the United States in terms of our national security budget, which will be $7.7 billion over the next six years. About $2.2 billion of that, though, will be recuperated in terms of a special fee or tax on air travellers in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was travelling the country with the finance committee, person after person  told us what they really wanted was economic security.  The government has missed an opportunity to provide some economic security for the people of our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this question: Where is the economic security for  Canadian farmers who are suffering and leaving the land?  A farm bill in the United States that has gone through the house of representatives will supply American farmers with $173 billion over the next 10 years if it goes through the senate and gets approved by the president. This money is on top of $70 billion already  approved and spent in the last four years in the United States.  American farmers get four times as much from their government as our farmers get in Canada. European farmers get seven times as much as our farmers.  Where is the security for the farmers of Canada?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the security for the 7.5% of the Canadian population that is unemployed?   There is an accumulated surplus in the EI fund of $36 billion, much of which is  used through general revenues to fund a tax cut for wealthy people and corporations.   Where is the security for the unemployed? Why did the government not extend eligibility benefits?  Why do we not make sure that the benefit period is  extended? Most unemployed people now do not qualify for EI.  In fact it  is predicted that in Toronto  about 80% of those who are unemployed   worked in the service industry and will not qualify for unemployment insurance benefits.  Where is the security for the unemployed in Canada?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the economic security for our aboriginal people, the first nations of this country?  The United Nations human resources index states that Canada is the third best nation to live in, but when using the same index for first nations people Canada becomes the 63rd best nation to live in.  People are living in Third World conditions in Canada, yet there is no economic development and no economic security for them in this budget.  Why is it not there?</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is there something about the economic security of  children in Canada? I remember very clearly  that, twelve years ago, in 1989, one child in seven was living in poverty in our country.  Now, twelve years later, the ratio is one child in five, or   20% of all children, living in poverty.  Where is the security for children in Canada? </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the security for people who need housing?  There are many people in need of housing.  If we were to build houses in Canada it would create two and a half jobs per house.  Where is this in the budget?  This is also missing.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is there   national  security for our health system?  Our health system has suffered  substantial budgetary cuts,     substantial cutbacks,  in 1995, to the hands of the Minister of Finance.  However, yesterday, there was absolutely nothing for our health system in the minister's budget. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in the budget is there security for people who need jobs in this country, for the 7.5%  who are unemployed, for the 43,000 people that lost full time jobs last year? Then we have some 57,000 people who have part time jobs.  Where is the vision for creating jobs?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the security in this country for the environment?  Where is the environmental security?  Where is the commitment to Kyoto?  Where are the funds to clean up waste disposal sites?  Where is the money to look for alternative fuels and where is the money to retrofit buildings in this country?  It is not there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is that economic security?  This is  a budget of missed opportunities. I am surprised that the parliamentary secretary can sit there in the confidence that this is a good budget knowing his past record on some of these things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Liberal vision?    Do they have a vision?  They have a vision of a low wage, part time economy where there are jobs at Tim Hortons but not at IPSCO  in Regina in the steel mill or at General Motors in Oshawa.  That is the vision of the Liberal Party across the way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal vision is one where the income gap in our country is widening each and every day but bank profits are going up despite a slow economy,  with $9.3 billion in profits last year and $9.6 billion the year before. We see the constant vision of a deferral of investment in the human and physical infrastructure in this country which is in need of money now.  We see a vision of a loss of sovereignty in our country and of giving more and more control of Canada to people who live outside our borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see a vision of a smaller and smaller federal government. In the 1980s the government represented 16.4% of the GDP and now it is at 11.3%.  This is the smallest it has been since 1949.  It is a vision that is really an adoption of the Reform-Alliance agenda and the only thing that makes that budget look good across the way is the Alliance Party of Canada. Every morning when the Minister of Finance gets out of bed he gets up and says “Thank God for the Alliance, thank God for the Leader of the Opposition, thank God for the Reform Party and thank God for the former leader of the Reform Party of Canada,” because they are implementing their agenda.  This is exactly where they want to go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country needs a new vision.  We need a vision where there is once again a role for the government in leading the way in helping plan a mixed economy.  There is a role for the government and people realized that after September 11 and the problems with security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a role for the Bank of Canada to once again assume more of the national debt.  At one time about 20% of the national debt was held by the Bank of Canada.  The national debt is now down to 8% or 9%.  This role of the bank  would give the government more fiscal flexibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a vision in the country where jobs are the number one priority, where yesterday  we would have spent  1% of our GDP in terms of investment on infrastructure, housing, social programs and agriculture.  That has to be the priority of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a vision of creating wealth in Canada by investing in education, training and skills because knowledge is power and knowledge is wealth in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a vision where the role of small business is more important.  Small business today creates 80% of the new jobs, and 80% of small businesses, by the way, have revenues of less than $1 million per year.  That is where a lot of the action is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a vision that has a dream of an environmental society and a sustainable environment in our country where we have a  greener economy and a dream of social programs that are fully enhanced and fully funded to create more equality of conditions for all the people of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need a new international vision, where the IMF and the World Bank are democratically accountable to the people of the world and where the WTO is not the new world government and we worship at the altar of large corporations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a vision of more foreign aid, a  vision of a world economic development organization so that we could have a new Marshall Plan for places such as Europe and Afghanistan,  a vision where we have a tax like the Tobin tax on currency speculation  to fund international development and slow down the speculation in currency.  This is the kind of vision we need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we also need a vision of having the sovereignty and the independence of our country once again reclaimed, because we are losing our country. Chapter 11 of NAFTA, the national treatment clause of the trade deals, gives more rights to corporations than to people.  People working in other countries require a working visa, but corporations can come in without any visa and dictate the rules and buy up our country at will.  This has to be changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are selling out our country.  Even the boss of the Royal Bank, Gordon Nixon, for whom the member across the way used to work,   said in Regina that in the last two and half years 20% of our publicly traded companies on the TSE had been sold out and that 23 of 35 companies on the oil and gas index on the TSE have been sold to foreigners, mainly Americans.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1985 we have lost about 13,000 companies in this country.  They were sold to foreigners, mainly in the United States. That includes  these companies: MacMillan Bloedel, Tim Hortons, Shoppers Drug Mart, Gulf, Laura Secord chocolates, the CNR, and soon the CPR, and the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, sold to Gillette of the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to selling out our companies, we are privatizing. The government privatized the administration of Canada savings bonds to EDS of Texas last year on June 30, the day before Canada Day, the very symbol of our sovereignty. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  my last half minute, let me say that in the future we are in danger of losing our dollar, our loonie, our currency, as more and more people across the way, and the Reform and the Bloc, are talking about using a currency in common with the United States, the American dollar, which will be controlled by the Americans and the American federal reserve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by saying it was a budget of missed opportunities, but we have great potential to take control of our economy, to take control of our sovereignty and to make this country whole and great once again.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is complaining because we did not do his party's $10 billion stimulus when in fact the stimulus we provided was on the order of $26 billion. The point is that because of actions taken a year ago we have $17 billion in tax cuts in this year alone. That is the biggest tax cut this year of any G-7 country. We have an extra $3 billion in health care and we have a number of other items, adding up to $26 billion, which is much more relative to the size of our economy than the Americans are proposing and the Americans have not yet implemented those proposals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that contrary to what the hon. member  said we have in fact had a very large fiscal stimulus, to the point where we are proposing not to pay back any debt this year and possibly next year. If we wanted to go any further we would clearly have to go into deficit, because any further than not paying back any debt is a deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I  am asking is this:  the hon. member must be proposing a return to deficit. Otherwise I do not see how his  numbers add up.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I think the parliamentary secretary should go back to the Royal Bank the way he is starting to count nowadays. He could  take some lessons from the new president of the Royal Bank, Mr. Nixon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $26 billion that the parliamentary secretary is referring to, some $24 billion was committed in previous budgets. The extra stimulus, or the maximum in this budget, is $2 billion. We have  about $1 billion or less in terms of new programs. We have  a few other things that were thrown in there, but very little new stimulus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the infrastructure program that they are talking about, which   might have $2 billion, and I repeat might have,  is dependent on there being a surplus in the next fiscal year. It is not even a line item.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you cannot see this far, Mr. Speaker, but when we  come across the infrastructure program here in the budget there is nothing listed at all. There is no line item in the next fiscal year or the fiscal year after that. It is the same with the Africa fund of $500 million. The government members say in both cases that there will be money there if there is a surplus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the deficit, I just do not believe it. We could have spent an extra $10 billion in this budget. The government spent an extra $2 billion or $2.5 billion. It could have been $10 billion of new stimulus without going into deficit, because part of that stimulus would come back to the federal government in increased taxes. More important, the Minister of Finance has always overestimated the deficit and underestimated surpluses and he is doing the same thing here. In fact in the last seven years he has been out by $75 billion in terms of his mathematics. The minister across the way cannot count. Members opposite have no imagination. We have missed an opportunity in this budget to create jobs and to stand up for the Canadian people.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, indeed there is nothing at all in the finance minister's budget for Canadian farmers. Yet, farmers, that is  grain producers in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta are going through a deep crisis. Many of them have already left their farms because it was no more possible for them to continue without help. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nothing at all.  There is unfair competition  in the world with massive subsidies in Europe and the United States going to their  farmers.   It is no wonder our farmers cannot compete.  They receive very little help.  Our farmers are  efficient.  They produce grain and food in a very competitive way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give an example.  Grain farmers get  9 cents on the dollar from the federal government.  American grain farmers in Montana and North Dakota get 35 cents on the dollar   from their federal government in Washington.  In the European Union, farmers  in France or Italy get  55 cents on the dollar from their federal government in Brussels.  That is not fair.  That is why farmers are leaving the land. There was nothing in the budget last night for the farmers of Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, two events   since  summer have changed the course of our country.  The first was the terrorist attack in September.  The second was the gradual onset of what the Minister of Industry last week correctly called a recession in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget tabled yesterday, and a budget  widely and deliberately leaked before parliament saw it, should have dealt with both security and prosperity.  The budget is a disappointment on both counts.  It does precious little to address security and it does nothing at all to encourage the prosperity of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a half budget.  It is a short term limited response to security and terrorism.  It is not a full and honest budget which would set a course for the future.  The minister's own officials told the Ottawa <i>Citizen</i> that “There could be another budget in early summer”. This constitutes an utter abandonment of the kind of reliable budget cycle that Canadians could count on.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very least, the fact that another budget is already anticipated a few months down the road indicates the government's inability to develop a strong action plan to avoid recession. At worst, that is sowing fear and uncertainty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the finance minister have anything to hide from us? What bad news dos he have in store for us come next spring or next summer? We know the government has stopped paying back the debt. The minister has admitted that  debt repayment will be zero dollar in 2002, zero dollar in 2004 and zero dollar even in 2006.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deficit forecasts are highly suspect.  They are achieved by fancy accounting.  For example, the government claims to be giving a tax break to small and medium size corporations.  It is not a break; it is a deferral.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those corporations would pay their $2 billion in taxes six months later.  Why is that?  The only way the government could avoid showing a deficit next year was to shuffle that $2 billion of tax take into next year's revenues.  Otherwise the government would show a deficit next year.  This is hocus-pocus.  This is not fiscal planning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major purpose of a budget is to provide certainty to individuals, families and businesses that must plan their own finances.  Canadians can draw no certainty from a budget whose timeframe in the minister's own words is only “the year ahead”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister claims to be prudent.  Yet the budget shows reckless disregard for a budget's central purpose of providing context and direction for the decisions which individuals, families, workers, taxpayers and investors must  make.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister proposes a budget which truly speaks to the type of government this is. It contains no real action plan for the future, nor any true solution to the problems in areas such as health and agriculture or on the issue of taxation reform.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from repeating measures already announced in previous budgets, which is another trademark of this government, one would believe, by reading the minister's speech, that those problems do not deserve the attention of decision makers.  </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most ironic line in the budget is when the minister solemnly states:</p>


	<p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two events brought Canada the fiscal windfall of the last few years.  They had nothing at all to do with the Liberal government.  The first was the economic boom in the United States.  Economists and economic policy commentators agree that the second set of decisive factors was free trade and the GST which the government did everything it could to stop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has no economic plan.  It never had one.  It rode high in the good times and it stands forever accused of having wasted that period of growth when Canada had the fiscal room to take the initiatives that would have kept us among the economic leaders of the world.  However this emperor has no clothes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a government that takes no initiatives.  There has been no significant economic initiative taken by the government since NAFTA.  There is no plan to see us through the recession, which ministers admit exists but which the federal budget, the economic planning document for Canada, fails to mention.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are not the hallmarks of an honest budget.  This is either a con game or Liberal arrogance at its worst.  In either event it breaks trust with the people of Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the minister expect our fellow citizens to be able to plan their financial future and that of their businesses and families if he is unable to propose an action plan which has more than a few months span?</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is decisive proof of the arrogance of a government too long in office.  It is clear that the minister's leadership aspirations matter more to him and influenced the budget more than his responsibility as the economic leader of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister needed cash.  The auditor general  identified 16 different ministries with wasteful spending that cried out for attention.  The minister ignored the auditor general and the waste.  He refused to cut the spending of ministers whose votes he needs and wants in the Liberal leadership campaign.  To make matters worse, the minister buckled when the Prime Minister insisted that other leadership candidates be given tiny trophies from the treasury.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b>  A Tobin tidbit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Right Hon. Joe Clark: </b>The Minister of Industry, the Tobin tidbit, who wanted $4 billion, settled for $110 million in new money for high speed network technology, which is $110 million more than the desperate and basic agriculture industry received in the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Canadian Heritage and  the Minister of  Human Resources Development are allowed to keep on wasting millions of dollars in their grants and contributions programs despite the clear and repeated criticisms of  the auditor general. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a country in recession the Minister of Finance needs to impose discipline on his colleagues, but the minister is a candidate for his party's leadership and so he does not hold to account the cabinet colleagues whose leadership votes he needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a single cent of new money for  agriculture. Nor does the budget provide for a rollover of unused safety net funds from previous years as requested by farm organizations.  Farmers need a long term vision.  They need to move beyond year to year crisis management.  The budget provides neither for agriculture.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for  health care financing. The budget contains  no new initiative for this issue of such great concern to Canadians.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use a phrase from another time, the minister had options. He had a choice. He could have used the good economic times of the last few years to bring up funding for health care, defence and other priorities. He could have been a leader in tax reform in those good years when Ireland, Germany and the United States were pulling dramatically ahead of Canada. Instead he drifted through the good times and now has to deal with defence and security issues that should have been addressed long ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution to national defence is  pitiful.  It is  an insult to the men and women who serve Canada abroad in whatever theatre. As part of the much vaunted security package the budget gives the Department of National Defence $629 million over five years for the Canadian forces. However the department's own business plan states that it  is $1.3 billion short per year to fulfill the tasks  already assigned to it. The government adds more new tasks than money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the funds are stripped away, allocated to the current commitment to the war in Afghanistan and earmarked for JTF2, the military would only receive $300 million to deal with capital programs. That would only buy five search and rescue helicopters, or three Hercules planes, or one C-17A heavy transport. There would be no money to replace the CF-18 fleet, the Iroquois class destroyers and the Aurora maritime patrol aircraft fleet.  Yet they are all due to be retired by the end of the decade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government proposes to invest $1.2 billion itself in a security policy and  have taxpayers contribute another $2.2 billion in higher ticket fees.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards our border, Canada could have shown leadership by proposing a  typically Canadian  action plan. However, because of our silence, the silence of the Government of Canada, we have to settle for the American proposal, which provides, among other things, for the presence of American helicopters at the Canadian border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of foreign aid, the government has obviously completely wiped out any potential benefits from our contribution to humanitarian aid. By reducing aid levels, as they have done since 1993, they have severely reduced our capacity to act on the international level. The budget tabled yesterday damages but in no way rehabilitates our reputation around the world.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's record on foreign aid has been abysmal over the last seven years. We fall well below the OECD average on foreign aid spending. Currently we are at 0.25% of GNP, down from 0.46% in 1992 and far below the UN target, the Lester Pearson target of 0.7%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real challenge for Canada is to become internationally competitive again. We must pay down our national mortgage. There should be a scheduled debt reduction plan that would force the government to pay down our debt. The government could eliminate plenty of waste. It could start with the $125 million it is spending on advertising and polling. There is a good place to start.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget  would repeat last year's pre-election tax cuts. However, after taking into account bracket CPP premium increases and the child tax benefit, that would still keep current  levels of  taxation above those of 1993. The only major tax break would defer the taxes of smaller corporations, the fancy accounting whose only purpose would be to hide the deficit next year. It is notable that no similar relief is being offered the unincorporated small business owners, farmers or fishermen.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the  transparency and accountability fronts, the finance minister is sending troubling signals about the future direction of his government. Again, we are witnessing the establishment of a new foundation.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the auditor general criticized the government for establishing these foundations. This week the government sets up yet another one. The strategic infrastructure foundation would not answer to parliament. It would be run by a board of Liberal Party friends. It would be another step into the darkness where more and more of the activities of government would be conducted in secret and at great distance from parliament which exists to control the spending of the Government of Canada.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, the auditor general noted in her report, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>While the foundations will support worthy causes, I am...also concerned that Parliament has only limited means of holding the government to account for the public policy functions performed by these foundations. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continues:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There are many ways for the government to pursue its policy objectives.  It has not yet assessed the appropriateness, the cost, or the effectiveness of this particular vehicle.  I think it should.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she said last week, in saying stop this practice.  What did they do?  They turned around and they set up another corporation that parliament cannot get at, whose records will be secret, run by Liberal Party lackeys distorting the Canadian public interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic that this half budget, this guise pretends to be a response to the terrorist attacks because those terrorist attacks showed the Liberal government at its most inept. While Tony Blair played a leading role in responding to the terror, there was no one home at 24 Sussex Drive, just as there has been no one home,  no leadership on economic policy in a decade. We are paying a price for that now.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget yesterday was an opportunity for Canada to begin to face the possibilities of the future, to begin to turn around the growing recession.  This half budget is the latest proof that the government is letting Canada down and is costing us our future.  Canadians deserve better than this short term, shortsighted budget.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be speaking shortly about the budget, so I will limit myself to one question for the right hon. member.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand for the life of me how he can boast about his own government's record when it was the Conservatives who left this government in 1993 with a $42 billion deficit.  That was absolutely central to the first several years of this government. That was why the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> said Canada was about to become a third world country.That was why we had to cut foreign aid, among other things, to get us out of this Tory hole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we are finally out of the Tory hole, we are restoring foreign aid and health care and we are cutting taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he can claim that he left us a wonderful legacy of a $42 billion deficit, from which we emerged only several years ago, is quite beyond my capacity to understand.  </p>


	<A NAME="Int-107195"></A><a HREF="#Int-107197"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107193"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Right Hon. Joe Clark: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that is not what the Royal Bank used to say through the voice of its chief economist.  He had a much clearer view of reality at that time and was quite prepared to acknowledge two things. First is     that the Progressive Conservative government, when it came to office, came to office facing a $38 billion deficit that had been left by Liberal governments before. Second and far more important is the transforming impact upon the country and its prospects of the economic initiatives that were taken by the government during the 1980s and the early 1990s.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real tragedy here is not to debate the merits of free trade or the merits of the GST, all of which have been debated.  The real focus here is that it was a government that was prepared to act to make Canada a leader in the world.  It perhaps took too many initiatives.  It certainly paid a high political price for those initiatives but at least it acted.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen, sitting here in the most fortunate country in the world, a government now through three terms.  When I asked the Prime Minister in debate during the election campaign could he name one single major accomplishment of his time in office, he could not name one, nor could the Minister of Finance.  As I said in my remarks, there has not been a significant economic initiative taken by the government since NAFTA and NAFTA was closing up the business of the government that went before it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need if we are going to maintain our capacity as a leader among nations is a government that is as imaginative as its people are. We need a government that is prepared to take the kinds of long term risks to build for the future and make Canada an economic leader in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am immensely proud to have been part of a government which was prepared to bring in the free trade agreement, which was prepared to face the hard realities of the GST.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we accepted the advice then of the chief economist of the Royal Bank of Canada.  He had better advice then than he does now.  It was good advice.  It was good for the country.   It has given us great opportunities which the Liberal government year after year has wasted.  It has wasted and squandered them again in the budget that was brought down yesterday. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The   budget  could have followed the advice of the auditor general. It could have  taken her direction as to where the waste was rampant and eliminated that waste. That would have given us the room for targeted corporate tax cuts. It would have brought growth to the country and given us the room for investment. It would not have been an insult to the men and women who serve in the armed forces.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much that could have been done.  There has been so much that could have been done over this last wasted decade, but the Liberal government sat, drifted and let the world pass us by. Now Canadians are paying the price.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Canadians will have a choice.  When they have that choice they will say that they have had enough of a government that wastes the potential of Canada and let us get back to building this country again.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is always amazing as a New Democrat to sit here and watch the Tories and Liberals banter over who is responsible for the high debt and deficit of the country when both  are responsible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admired the speech of the hon. member for Calgary Centre.  I agree with many of the things that he has said, especially regarding the military.  The fact is that the budget was to end the terrorist threat in Canada as we would not allow terrorists in.  However, when we look at the miniscule budget that went to the coast guard and the armed forces, terrorists can still drift into this nation and do whatever harm they wish to do.  The budget will do nothing about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My great concern is that the previous budgets years ago used to have employment figures in them.  There were targets for unemployment rates.  Since 1996 those figures have disappeared.  They are gone.  There has been absolutely no commitment on the part of the government over the last eight years to tackle the unemployment situation or to even tell Canadians what the current rate of unemployment is, whether it is going up or down, and what the government is going to do about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the hon. member think those figures are missing from previous budgets and this budget as well?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question.  It is a perceptive one because it goes to the heart of the con game that the government has been trying to play for so long with budgets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance always exaggerates the figures that he puts in his budgets and he keeps away information that is germane.  Those unemployment targets should be in the budget of Canada.  They allow people to have some sense as to what our prospects are and what our path should be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen this again in the budget that was brought down by the minister yesterday.  He claims he is making a $2 billion tax cut for small and medium size businesses.  He says that it will be a great help to them.  It will let them defer their tax payments for six months.  Why is that?  Because he knows that if they pay those taxes this year and not next year, he will show a deficit next year.  What is pretending to be a tax deferral for some, not farmers, not fishermen, but some small businesses, is actually a means of cover. It is  a means by which the Minister of Finance can try again to fool more Canadians about the real state of the Canadian economy.  He does it by hiding unemployment figures.  He does it by playing hocus-pocus with tax changes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need is a budget whose honesty and figures   Canadians can count on.  We did not get it yesterday.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</b> My colleague reminds me that they do not farm or fish in Mississauga,  but they do farm and fish in parts of the country where the economy is in terrible shape and there is a real need for help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the hon. member that if he wants cash flow for small business, let him reduce the EI premium. If he wants cash flow for small business, let him change the capital gains tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> The EI cannot do it. They have to do it on the basis of payroll, not taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</b> No, Mr. Speaker, the member shouts from his seat that the EI cannot do it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say who cannot do it. The Minister of Finance cannot do it. The government cannot do it. It is not that the Liberals cannot do it; it is that they will not do it. They will not rise to their responsibilities or to the opportunities of the country. That is why the budget is such a travesty and why it could be such a tragedy for a country like Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, just one last word to the leader of the Tory Party on his comments. His first line of defence for his $42 billion deficit was that he inherited a $38 billion deficit from the Liberals in 1984. What an achievement. He turned a $38 billion deficit into a $42 billion deficit, whereas the Liberals inherited a $42 billion deficit and we turned it--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the  point I was making was  that their achievement was to turn a $38 billion deficit into a $42 billion deficit some nine years later, whereas we turned a $42 billion deficit into a sizable surplus.  I guess it has to do in part with the size of the  objectives and goals one sets for the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I neglected to mention that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Beauharnois--Salaberry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to  talk about two myths that  have been propagated by the opposition and some provincial premiers about this budget and then I will summarize with a very brief statement on why it is a good budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first myth is the idea that the budget  has provided no stimulus to the Canadian economy at this time of global economic slowdown. Contrary to what has been said on the other side of the House, it does not much matter when the decision was made. What matters is how much support is provided to the economy this year and next year when we are in the midst of a world economic slowdown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that because of wise decisions taken a year ago, Canadians  have $17 billion extra in their  pockets this year because of a tax cut, the largest among G-7 countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an extra $3 billion for health care this year because of the health accord  a year or so ago.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, because of infrastructure programs and  a number of other initiatives in research, we have a total fiscal stimulus this year of $26 billion, which in American terms would be $260 billion since it  is 10 times larger than Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact this year and next year the government is providing substantially more support to the Canadian economy through  lower taxes and investments in health care, research and innovation than the U.S. or other G-7 countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is partly for those reasons that economists in the IMF and the OECD unanimously  say  that Canada will do better than the U.S. this year and next year in terms of both jobs and growth.  Those are facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second myth is related to the first, which is an idea propagated by provincial premiers, notably Ontario and Quebec, to the effect that when the bill for health care has to be paid  the federal government goes to the washroom.  The fact is that because of the health accord and other actions, over the last five years the federal government's share of health care expenditures in Ontario has been rising and its share of total Ontario program spending has increased from 22% of the total five years ago to 27% this year.  In Quebec it is even higher.  The share is 30%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are the provincial governments saying different things? It is because they  choose  not to include our contributions in the form of tax points or tax rooms contributed some years ago.  Those are just as much contributions as the cash.  If they added up the sums correctly, using the a nice chart in the budget book, they would find a rising share of federal contributions to provincial coffers over the last five years.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the behaviour of the Ontario government  is reprehensible, the behaviour of the Parti Quebecois and their friends from the Bloc Quebecois is worse. Not only do they hide the real federal contribution, but after saying that they do not count tax points as part of the federal contribution,  they then ask the federal government to give nothing but tax points to the Quebec government. This  means that they want us to give more to the provincial government, but that this contribution will not be recognized at all. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, from a separatist point of view, if you are a separatist, which I am not, it is a fantastic idea. More money coming from the federal government and no acknowledgement  whatsoever of the role played by the federal government. It is therefore a separatist ploy. I can say that this government is not stupid enough to accept such a separatist idea. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement  that this budget gives no stimulus is a myth.  It is well over 2.5% of GDP.  It is in the form of lower taxes which puts  more money into people's pockets.  It gives more money to health care and   more money to the government's key priorities: the learning agenda, the environment and research and innovation.  We are simultaneously providing  economic stimulus to support the economy and investing in the key areas that matter most to Canadians,  health, research and so on.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget provides support to the Canadian economy at a time when the Canadian economy needs it most.  It also implements the government's long term vision.  It does  what is necessary with regard to safety and security, our number one  priority,  but it is not doing  more than is necessary on that front.  It also  addresses a matter of absolute importance to the Canadian economy, that is to say, the Canada--U.S. border in terms of both its security and the free passage of goods and people which is absolutely crucial to the long term health of our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all those scores, this is a good budget that   sustains the economy when it needs it most.  It is consistent with the government's long term vision of where this country is heading.  It does what is needed on security and safety and  addresses the critical question of maintaining a border that is both secure and free flowing.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance has dealt with something I am interested in, tax point  transfers. He said  that members of the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois do not talk about that. But he forgot to mention—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Separatists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</b> The hon. member used the word “séparatiste”. He can use any word he wants, but I would like to ask this member a question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax points—and I am not referring to  cash transfers—were introduced because, as far back as Duplessis, the provinces did not agree with the federal invasion of provincial jurisdictions, more specifically in health care, education and social assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces realized that the federal government was using its constitutional spending power to do it, and they demanded compensation in the form of tax  points and cash transfers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out a specific aspect to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance. Does he find it normal that, in 1961,  personal income tax generated  $2.130 billion in federal revenues, and  $89.580 billion in 2000? This is 40 times higher than  40 years ago. This was condemned by all the Canadian provinces,  not just by Quebec separatists, not only by the sovereignists, but also  all good federalists in Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, let us suppose that, tomorrow, the federal government were to convert all cash transfers to Quebec into tax points—it will not do so, but let us suppose for  a moment that it did—what would happen?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quebec government would say  that today  the federal contribution to health and education is nil. But the real contribution of these transferred tax points would be equal to what it is today. Thus, what separatists are asking us to do is to indicate that our contribution to the provinces is nil, according to them, even though, in terms of funds lost by the federal government, it would be the same thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I say that this is a separatist idea, one  that the federal government would be absolutely crazy to follow. And this is why I also say that we will not do so. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, when I look back at Canada in the 1990s and the early part of this century, it seems to me that there are two provinces that are largely responsible for the economic growth in the country, the provinces of Ontario and Alberta, especially Ontario in the last five years of the 1990s.  The first five years of the 1990s were rather dismal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the other provinces I see economic performance either going sideways or backwards.  When I see a city like Montreal losing its baseball team and the Montreal Canadiens losing their ownership to Americans,   I ask myself what is happening in  other areas of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask my learned colleague on the other side of the House, are the Liberal policies really designed to bring prosperity to Alberta and Ontario or is it perhaps the  Liberal government, the provincial governments and other governments in other provinces that are holding the provinces down so  they cannot perform like  Ontario and Alberta?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-107217"></A><a HREF="#Int-107219"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John McCallum: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear the suggestion  from our hon. colleague from the Canadian Alliance that the Liberal government has been biased all these years in the direction of favouring growth in Alberta rather than in other  parts of the country. I take that as a compliment.  I am not sure it is quite true but we certainly have not been against Alberta.  As he has suggested, possibly  the good policies of the federal government over the years, as well as a spot of oil, have helped Alberta make a certain progress.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it is also true that there has been some catch up, that over the last 20 years to 30 years, or indeed since the second world war, in terms of per capital income, GDP or living standards, the have not provinces of the maritimes have  caught up to a significant degree and are closer to the national average living standards than they were 20 years or 30 years ago.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to participate in this debate on the budget that was brought down yesterday by the Government of Canada. We are well aware that, when a government brings down a budget, it is analyzed and  criticized positively or negatively. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am analyzing the budget, wondering what more we are getting, compared to previous years. Does this budget cut services? Does it increase taxes, compared to last year? Given the present economic situation, there are numerous question that parliamentarians must focus on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, I find that, compared to last year, this budget is a marvellous plus, because the government is maintaining what it had announced for the next few years. In health, the government had announced $23 billion over five years. Given the economic situation, was the Government of Canada able to maintain his commitments to the provinces,  its commitment to hand over $23 billion to the provinces? This sector could have been affected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they are faced with a crisis, an emergency or a difficult situation, governments act like they did in the 1990s. To lower their deficits, the federal government as well as its provincial counterparts analyzed all their programs, dropped the least effective ones and cut services. But no, the amount of $23 billion is maintained, which is a plus. This means that in the next four years, $23 billion will be handed over to provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing applies to housing. We had announced $685 million for housing for the next five years. Is this program at risk or is the government trying to maintain it at the same level? All the funds already pledged for subsequent years have been maintained in this budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tax cut, it has been in effect only since January 1, 2001. Therefore, it is the first year of the five year $100 billion tax reduction program. Such a big tax cut had never been seen in the history of Canada. It too has been maintained.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now realize that all the commitments made last year by the Government of Canada have been maintained. It is staying on course. There is no coming back. On the contrary, almost all the commitments have been increased.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good thing is that tens of billions of dollars will be invested in the economy as such. When there is an economic downturn, the government must create a positive environment for businesses to be competitive and to generate  wealth, so that  services can be paid for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stronger the economy, the more  revenue the  government can collect, which allows for more and better services for the public, such as health care, social services and so on.  The government is involved in the  economic environment  precisely to allow businesses to be more competitive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed budget is extraordinary in this regard. We will invest in the security infrastructure for all Canadians, just as they requested. The people told us what they wanted. The psychosis of terrorism was making its way into  Canadians' lives. The public asked the Canadian government to  introduce new  security measures, at least  domestically. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures proposed in the budget reflect this clearly. Several billion dollars will be invested in infrastructures relating to security and border crossings. There are several border crossings  in my riding. We will act in this area. We responded to the public's requests. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A government is not there only to do what the opposition parties want. The government is there to represent all Canadians, to listen to them and to meet their needs.</p>


	<A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also fairly important, is that above and beyond all of the announcements made in last year's budget, beyond the new infrastructure programs between Canada and Quebec, or rather Canada and the provinces and municipalities, providing almost $2 billion over five years, now there are resources allocated to the environment, green  funds for the municipalities that will be doubled, and a new infrastructure project which introduces an obvious idea: that we can now also act in concert with the private sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk further about Quebec and about the greater Montreal area to demonstrate that the implementation of this strategic infrastructure foundation will indeed have an major  impact on Quebec, all of Canada too, obviously, but particularly on Quebec and the greater Montreal area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When referring to the deficits run up by greater Montreal area businesses due to delays shipping  to the U.S. market, it is important to recall that 85% of Canada's exports go to the United States, and that our market really is the U.S. We do more than $2 billion in trade every day with the United States, with Americans. Our market is in the U.S. Where are our competitors? They are in the United States and Mexico.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada's responsibility is therefore to help Canadian business be more competitive on the U.S. market and with our  other competitors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the greater Montreal area alone lost more than $500 million due to shipping delays. What can we do to help our businesses respond more quickly to the market? We can equip them with  infrastructure that will give them access to the market. We are therefore finalizing plans for a major project, highway 30, as part of a proposal made  by the firm Roche to the Federal Bridge Corporation. On January 19, 2000, Mr. Chevrette asked the Government of Canada  to build the bridges that span the seaway. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can say is that I am delighted the government is going to invest a minimum of $2 billion in a foundation that will enable Quebec and the other provinces to put forward projects and fund them, not just with the provinces and municipalities, but with the private sector as well.  This is a totally different approach, a brand new one, and I am delighted to hear it announced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $2 billion can be renewed annually.  At the end of each fiscal year, surpluses may be invested in this foundation.  It means that, in years of huge surpluses, there could be more and, in years where there are not any, well there will not be any.  We can say, though, that we at least have announced an immediate investment of $2 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all businesses and the mayors of Quebec—we got their reaction yesterday—are very pleased at this announcement.  This morning I was speaking with people from the Conseil du patronat, who were positive about a budget commitment of this size.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is  something else to take a country with an operating deficit of $42 billion and a very large debt and, in the space of barely eight years, totally eliminate the operating deficit, lower the debt by over $36 billion and save over $2.7 billion annually in interest that does not have to be paid and can be used for other purposes, such as job creation and support for the economy, do all that and return $23 billion to health care and invest $2 billion in infrastructures and housing. It took a government that had courage and vision.  Today, we have positive results and a positive budget for Canadians and Quebecers.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the member who just spoke.  I was unable to be here yesterday evening when the budget was brought down so I have not heard about the final provisions in it concerning the $2 billion held in trust.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a plan for working this out with the provinces? The member talks about his two bridges, but I think that the approaches to these bridges have to be built by the province.  Will provincial priorities be respected? Will their choices be considered by this trust, which is  apparently  a body with I am not sure just what legal form?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was talking about bridges. We cannot talk about highways as such because, under the Canadian constitution, construction of highways comes under provincial jurisdiction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the construction of bridges over the St. Lawrence Seaway is a federal responsibility.  We  cannot put money into the construction of a highway which does not belong to us, but we can, at the request of a province, put money into a sector over which the Canadian government has jurisdiction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about highway 30, but we could just as easily talk about the ice control structure, which is also a major public transit project. We could talk about other highway projects throughout Quebec, which have been put forward in recent years by government members and also by the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for how the foundation would work, I have no more information than the hon. member, because the announcement was made only  yesterday.  A foundation will be created, with a board of directors and a president. It is clear from the  budget that the emphasis is on projects with provincial and municipal governments. Obviously, no private concern can stick its neck out and say that it will build a road between two particular villages without the approval of Quebec or the province in question. This falls under provincial jurisdiction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that the primary purpose of this foundation was to guarantee annual amounts, as well as ensure that this fund would  grow. Its purpose is also to ensure the development of a greater sense of partnership, both with the provinces and with municipalities and private enterprise.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member and the previous government speaker as they crowed about the ability of the finance minister to have slain the deficit.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to throw into the mix the $38 billion that was inherited by the Conservative government of the day and the effort that was made, the political capital that was spent in bringing in a deficit reduction tax like the GST and, of course, free trade.  Those are constantly left out of the discussions when the government is in a self-congratulatory mode and bending over backward to pat itself on the back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to at least inject some intellectual honesty into the debate when we are talking about how the government accomplished these great things.  It was done on the backs of taxpayers.  It was done by taking the money from businesses, employers and employees to accumulate the surplus that now exists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the hon. member refers more to what has happened in the budget with the EI premiums.  What has happened is really nothing.  While we had one red nickel taken off the EI premiums last week, there is no mention of it in this particular budget. To the hon. member, I am concerned that what we see here is the EI premium staying the same, and  at the same time we are seeing CPP premiums increase by 40 cents per $100.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the government and the member defend this policy and this budget by not reducing EI premiums so that people in places like Mulgrave, Afton and River John, Nova Scotia will be able to make a go of it this winter?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, one thing must be said.  When a country is going through hard economic times, people are of course entitled to ask their government to examine its priorities.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this first decade of the 21st century has the potential to be a decade of destiny for Canada.  This decade Canada still has the opportunity  to be seen around the world as a most favoured nation and to live up to the words of our national anthem which stir us to be strong and free. For this to happen  we need a government that is truly for the people.  The Liberal government has shown that it is not. We need a government that is less concerned with perpetuating  its own power and more concerned with perpetuating a future and a hope for its citizens.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reluctantly agree with those economists who point out that the last decade of Liberal rule where perpetuation of political power was the main focus has resulted in the ship of state drifting aimlessly without direction  through a decade of drift.  We need a ship of state that is guided by a compass of integrity, charted by policies that are built on proven principles and steered by the hands of elected representatives who stand and speak and act on behalf of the citizens who sent them there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That type of government can truly lead this  nation into its decade of destiny. It can truly clear the way for its citizens, families and communities to become all that they hope and dream to be.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were growing up, we all  wondered what Canada and the world would be like in the year 2000.  As a matter of fact, Arthur C. Clarke with his visions of commercial space travel and intelligent talking computers gave us another date to ponder and it was the year 2001. Instead of a vision for the future, the government has given us  budget 2001,  a disappointment  that is mired in the tired old tax and spend Liberal ideas of the past.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget continues the waste and the mismanagement that have plagued the government for the last eight years.  In fact, someone said that if the budget were a movie,  it would be called, with apologies to  Arthur C. Clarke, “2001: A Waste Odyssey”.  It has been an odyssey of waste.  The budget shows no regrets after the unprecedented waste and mismanagement of taxpayers’ dollars that were exposed in the HRDC grant scandal and just last week in the latest and most damning auditor general's report that many of us have seen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget represents another wasted opportunity, a chance to get the fundamentals of our economy right rather than focusing on the pet schemes of Liberal leadership candidates.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waste and mismanagement have truly become the trademark of this government.  The latest auditor general report, has, in our opinion, shown the present Liberal government to be the worst manager of the public finances in this country's history.  That is why we all had hoped to see the government cut out waste and put its money into priority sectors.  Yesterday, the Liberals clearly refused to do so.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wasteful spending of the past few years has continued. More than that the floodgates have been opened once again for spending growth in non-priority areas, far above the rate of inflation and far above the rate of population growth.  In fact, year over year spending is up by a record and an astonishing 9.3% this year.  These are spending increases that we have not seen since the Prime Minister was the finance minister back in the late 1970s. </p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals are increasing their spending by 9.3% for this year alone, while the economy is growing at a mere 1.1%. They decided to increase spending and taxes, but they did not give one penny for health or to reduce the debt and  taxes.  </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a single dollar of spending cuts in the budget. New pet projects are being financed by spending new taxpayers’ dollars, not taking money from low and falling priorities. That is the way the Liberals should have done it. They missed a great opportunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key needs for new resources for defence and security simply have not been addressed adequately. Even the shocking events of September 11 could not spur the government to provide more than just token sums for national defence. In fact once we set aside the leverage and the funding provided for Operation Apollo and a small grab bag of special anti-terrorism measures, there is absolutely nothing left for the base budget of national defence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week the auditor general  reported that defence needs $1.3 billion per year just to keep replacing and servicing its current dilapidated equipment, let alone taking on the new roles that the ongoing war on terrorism may require. The bottom line is this: for every dollar that our military so badly needed and asked for, the Liberals coughed up a measly 15 cents. The Liberals have decided that Canada will simply be a passenger on the next NATO train, just along for the ride, not pulling any freight and not carrying its weight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has a message for our armed forces: They did not quit fighting for our freedoms in the last century. We will not quit fighting for them in this century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not enough tax relief in the budget. In fact there is an increase in job-killing payroll taxes at the very moment that the economy is going into a recession. The bottom line is that next year, hard-working Canadians will take home $150 less on their paycheques because of the mismanagement of the government. That is not acceptable.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll taxes are undoubtedly the most destructive for job creation. Yet, the Liberals chose to increase  these taxes by an average of over $150 per worker.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward into the new century, Canadians deserve a decade of destiny to build a competitive, knowledge based economy with sound economic fundamentals, capable of taking on the world and leading the world. We can do it, but it will take a different type of government to get us there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we have a lethargic Liberal government. We are on a course to another decade of drift, just like the 1990s when real income stagnated, our dollar declined to record lows and our competitiveness and  productivity lagged far behind that of the United States and other industrialized countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to address four areas separately: first, the continued waste and mismanagement of government spending and the misplaced spending priorities in this new, non-security spending undertaken in this budget; second, the completely inadequate response to defence and security needs, especially in the Department of National Defence, in this new budget; third, the failure to provide any tax relief, while in fact job killing payroll taxes will be going up in the teeth of the Liberal recession; and fourth, the broader failure to get the fundamentals right and lay the ground for a decade of economic destiny. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we are continuing the policies that led to this decade of drift and decline in the 1990s. I particularly want to discuss the failure of the government to define a vision for the future,  the future of our most important economic relationship, and that is our continental partnership with the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said at the outset, the overriding problem with this budget is out of control spending, out of control waste. The government has shown time and time again that it cannot manage the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars that it spends already. In fact, the auditor general's report last week exposed the government as possibly the worst money manager in Canadian history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister  stood up earlier and said that he was not a visionary, and we agree with that, but he said some time ago that he was a good manager. The auditor general disagrees with that. Why, then, should we believe that the government can manage the tens of billions more that it proposes to spend in this budget?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending in this fiscal year, at $130.5 billion, is up more than $11 billion from last year's budget. That is a 9.3% increase. The year before, without the factor of September 11, spending was $111.8 billion, so spending has increased in a mere two years by a staggering 16.7% at a time when inflation has been practically non-existent. That is unacceptable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not seen these types of year to year increases, as I have said, since the Prime Minister was finance minister. As recently as the November 1999 fiscal update just over two years ago, the government was calling for only $118 billion. In budget 2000 that was increased to $121.5 billion. In the 2000 so-called mini budget, the projection jumped again to $124 billion. Today the government believes that it will be able to hold the line at $130 billion and a 9.3% increase. It has never held the line yet. Our fear is that it will not hold the line on this budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably,  the media reports that the Prime Minister had taken over control of writing the budget himself seem to have been correct. The finance minister obviously rolled over and played dead and allowed the Prime Minister to write this budget, but just because the finance minister rolled over and played dead does not absolve him of responsibility. He is still an accomplice in this act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the October 2000 finance statement, up to and including the new spending yesterday, the government is promising $10.4 billion in new spending over the next three years. This budget was supposed to be a national security budget. I want to give the government half a point for spin, because it got some of that spin out there. The problem is, this  is only a token toward security: less than 40% of this huge budget and its increase goes toward national security. The government has learned a little trick. It takes its spending announcements,  expands them out over five years and puts that figure up there. It makes it look like a big dollar item. </p>


	<A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is misleading to the people of Canada.  Here we have less than 40% of the new money going toward defence and security measures, and no money, not one cent, going to increase Canada's ailing health care system. Even though it is still $400 million short of the 1994 levels when the Liberal government started ripping the funding away from provinces for health care, the government  could not in this budget find one extra dime for health care.  That is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty per cent of the new spending will go to the pet projects of an out of control Liberal cabinet.  The heritage minister has been given new money for the CBC and television producers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is  $185 million for new projects in Indian affairs.  We agree with special funding for fetal alcohol syndrome, but it defies imagination that out of that $7 billion in the Indian affairs department the government could not reallocate one dime of spending to put toward  fetal alcohol syndrome.  It had to be new money, in the government's view. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $500 million for foreign aid in Africa, but no new commitment to guidelines on how it will be spent or whether or not it will go to corrupt leaders or to starving children.  It is  a half a billion dollar commitment with virtually no guidelines on how the money will be fired out the window.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health minister got more money for his pet health care research foundation, but no new money to support the provinces for actually providing health care services to Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry minister did manage to get some money for his online initiatives, although thankfully his full-fledged, broadband boondoggle seems to have had its wings clipped.  It is incredible that the government could not find one dime for  an increase in health care to the provinces but eventually  will commit over $100 million for high speech chat lines for Canadians who already, on their own initiative, lead the world in personal computer use and in Internet use.  Already we lead the world without the help of the government.  Now there is  no money for health care but Canadians will be able to hit those chat lines faster and tell citizens around the world that they cannot get money for their hip replacements or for cancer research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These misplaced priorities give us great cause for concern and disappointment in terms of the priorities of the government.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, when we look back at this budget, we will see that the Liberals missed a unique opportunity to put their priorities in order. The Liberals decided to throw millions and even billions in non priority areas, while ignoring vital ones. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the CBC will receive $60 million. Then there is $500 million for Africa, more than half a billion dollars for Heritage Canada, but not one penny for health and hospitals, for taxpayers, or to reduce the debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse still, if any unforeseen event happens, Canada will again have a deficit, because the Liberals chose to eliminate their cushion. The $4 billion that are usually set aside for fiscal prudence have disappeared.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understandable that from time to time a government wants to take on new initiatives and highlight new priorities, but the government has failed abysmally and completely to follow the advice of many economic experts and the House of Commons finance committee to find new priorities from reductions in low and falling priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons finance committee recommended that the government fund its security measures and other spending priorities by reviewing existing spending and seeing where there was room for reductions.  The committee called on the government to use the same test it used in the 1994-95 program review exercise to determine whether existing spending was on track.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tests from the last program review exercise are worth mentioning.  Here are some tests of government spending which the government apparently looked at six or seven years ago. It has refused to look at   them since.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should ask these questions: Is the program a matter of genuine public interest? Is the program a legitimate and necessary role for government? Is it a federal responsibility?  Could the activity be transferred to the private or voluntary sector?  Can the objectives of the program be achieved more efficiently? Can we afford the program in the current fiscal framework?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in 1994-95 the government did not live up to any of those tests.  It went through the motions of asking the questions. This time it did not even go through the motions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program review criteria are good ones.  The government should continually reassess its program priorities to see if its spending is on the right track.  The government continues to ask us for suggestions.  There are some suggestions in terms of evaluating program spending. The finance committee recommended:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--that the government follow the Program Review process while maintaining a balanced budget in the face of new priority spending.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quoted from David Paterson of the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance.  He told the committee:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Increased spending on security is essential, but we believe it can be offset by reduced spending on less important programs. New initiatives can be postponed until a budget surplus has been restored to a more adequate level.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was sound advice.  It is unfortunate that  the government did not listen to its own committee.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially this year after the events of September 11, three months ago today, we need to show and demonstrate our support for men and women in uniform; our police forces, firefighters, military, customs and immigration officers, all those who will be on duty in Canada and around the world so we can enjoy time with our families and friends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a firefighter for 17 years in my other life.  I know the spirit and dedication that exists within the hearts of those who serve and protect.  I also know the horror of lives lost and injured, of families torn apart and of homes and businesses destroyed. I know the toll that this takes on the lives of those who choose to stand to protect their fellow citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This holiday season when we  are enjoying being with our friends and our families and we raise our glasses, let us remember to toast these brave men and women.</p>

Dr. Samar has contributed tremendously through her efforts to strengthen the human rights of women and girls in Afghanistan and in refugee camps along the northern border of Pakistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time the Taliban took over in 1996 Dr. Samar operated schools for girls and offered health services throughout Afghanistan that were otherwise unavailable, often risking her life by defying the ruling Taliban. Likewise Dr. Samar has been appointed deputy prime minister and minister responsible for women's affairs in the power sharing council that will run the transitional government in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of her Canadian tour Unifem welcomes Dr. Samar to Ottawa tomorrow where she is speaking at the Chateau Laurier at noon.  I encourage all members to attend this wonderful event to hear firsthand the plight of the women in Afghanistan and to establish what we as Canadians can do to help.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we became the government, we have put public finances on a healthy footing.  We have put an end to 28 years of deficit, and created a budget surplus four years in a row.  The resulting savings have enabled us to invest $2.5 billion in other initiatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 budget contains a $7.7 billion investment in national security in Canada, as well as measures to bolster our economy and maintain  tax cuts.  Additional tax credits for health were also included.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  this budget, the Government of Canada once again is showing that it can be trusted.  There is a safe and prosperous future in store for Canadians.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday's budget offers no new hope for Canada's farming community and is seriously out of balance.  The Liberals have repeated their failure to deliver meaningful programs for farm families and the Minister of Finance has once again ignored agriculture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday was an opportunity for the Liberals to outline the details of their vision for the future of farming.  Sadly the budget gives no details on how the government intends to move producers beyond crisis management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers across the country who continue to face disastrously low world commodity prices now have to contend with the impact of this year's national drought.  There is no question that these producers need adequate emergency assistance for short term survival.  Yet the Liberals offered no prospect that any new help is forthcoming.  Farm families deserve better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government's priorities must change.  Wasteful spending must stop and dollars be reallocated to critical areas like agriculture.  The Liberal government failed to adjust its misplaced priorities in the budget.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of public servants were honoured yesterday with certificates of recognition for their dedication and exemplary performance in the wake of terrorist attacks.  The ceremony was part of the annual head of the public service awards.  They were presented by Mel Cappe, the Clerk of the Privy Council.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipients came from all parts of the public service: customs guards, RCMP, diplomats, receptionists, policy makers and military personnel who shifted their attention to the priority of national security.  Their efforts became part of the largest mobilization of government departments and agencies in  the public service since the end of the second world war.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there is no limit on the ways the Liberal government has failed aboriginal people. One of its more creative ways is by failing to monitor prescription drug use among aboriginals, and the result has been drug addiction and death. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let no one say that this problem has taken us by surprise. We have known about it since 1997 when the auditor general explained it in detail. Let no one say that the solution is a mystery. Hard data prove that sharing information on drug use among doctors and pharmacists reduces the abuse of the system, but sadly let no one say that the Liberals are serious about fixing the problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They refuse to make the statutory changes necessary to allow information sharing on prescription drug use. Instead the Liberals expect addicts to volunteer their consent to have their drug information shared, but addicts who are double doctoring of course will not consent to getting caught.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the best that the Liberals offer to aboriginal people? Surely first nations individuals deserve much better. Lorraine Stonechild in the parliamentary committee said “We can't keep letting first nations people die over this carelessness of the government. All information should be shared so it doesn't continue. I'm asking,  please make these changes soon. I don't want to see any more people die”.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, one year ago Mike Harris and the other premiers signed the health accord with the federal government allocating $23 billion in new health care funding.  They said that it was a good deal then but now it is not enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Ontario has seen increases in federal transfers over the last five years from 22% of their total program spending to 27% today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provincial finance minister thinks we should use the deferred small business tax instalments to fund health care.  Tory logic, deferred money is new money.  This is an initiative to help small business with their cashflow, not to allow for an increase to the Harris Tories.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just do not get it.  In 2001-02, federal transfers are providing $1.1 billion of the $1.2 billion increase in Ontario health care spending.  The provincial health minister threatens to take drug money away from seniors, while at the same time giving tax cuts while in deficit and issuing $200 rebate cheques.  Then they cry poor.  Canadians know better.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. government will soon be charging U.S. travellers a $5 security charge for each round trip flight in the U.S. With the finance minister's new budget, the Canadian government will be charging a $24 security tax for round trip domestic travel. Why is the Canadian government charging air travellers three and a half times what the U.S. government is charging its travellers?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I can say about why we did this is that I signed it to ensure its viability.  I am completely in agreement, but the hon. member ought to ask his leader the same thing.  He signed the same agreement when he was the treasurer of Alberta.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is therefore a very simple one.  With an economy in  recession, why is this Minister of Finance adding $1.7 billion to this cancer on job creation?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada will consider anything that might help to reduce that.  These measures can probably only be done through international organizations such as the UN, the Commonwealth, or SADAC.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, every presenter that came before the defence committee this past year, all military experts, retired officers, the CDA, stated that our military has been financially neglected by the government.  They also stated, as did the auditor general, that $1 billion a year for the next five years is required just to stabilize the military.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked some of our men and women since September 11 to go in harm's way.  How can the Minister of Finance justify his paltry contribution to the military?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we would not send our troops into any theatre of operation without making sure that they have the support they need, the resources they need, the tools they need to do the job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be a lot of arguments about figures.  There is not a minister here who would not like to have more money.  The finance minister provided $1.2 billion yesterday, much needed money, much of that going to fight in the campaign against terrorism.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that health care is the number one priority for Canadians, yet yesterday in the budget address the finance minister spent only two minutes talking about health care and announced that health care would get a measly 2% of new spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the finance minister was too busy worrying about not giving his opponents any advantage in the Liberal leadership race, but it is Canadians that are hurting as a result of this kind of mentality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget, why did the government not make health care its most important priority?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as a result of the agreement reached between the Prime Minister and the premiers in September 2000, the increased transfer to the provinces this year for health is $2.8 billion, far more than any other similar announcement in yesterday's budget.  It is the single most important priority for the government. If members count the money we are transferring for equipment, for primary care changes, for telemedicine, it is well over $3 billion to the provinces this year alone.  It will be $4 billion next year and $5 billion the year thereafter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care is priority number one for the government.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the government;  of the amendment; and of the amendment to the amendment.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-107552"></A><a HREF="#Int-107588"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107549"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as I had indicated, unfortunately the government did not follow the advice of its own committee and in fact increased spending by over 9% this year.  That is on top of last year's 7%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as if the government did not have an opportunity to find a place in which it could have reduced spending.  The auditor general's report pointed to a pool of some $16.3 billion.  The report said  that we could go fishing in that pool and find waste, inefficiency and bad management.  The government refused to  go fishing in that pool.  It did not come up with one dime in the budget to reduce waste.  That is absolutely incredible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our limited research capabilities, which are nowhere near  the research capabilities of the government,   we  identified some $6 billion in savings that could have been found had the government had the will to do it.  It did not have the will to do it, only the will to spend.  Rather than cutting waste it protected every last dime of previous government spending and added new initiatives on top of it while still ignoring debt, the tax situation and health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Nancy Hughes Anthony of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> What we see is a lack of discipline in spending, which could lead the country back into deficit.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a stark warning.  Reckless spending increases of the government have eradicated the surplus so that there would be no debt payment.  We are one small economic shock away from being propelled back into a deficit.  As a former finance minister I know that when one produces a budget of $130 billion and one says magically we will end up on the zero line, especially with the record the government has of   exceeding every  spending, we are in a time of great concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major failing of the budget was a failure to adequately address defence and  security needs.  The government  talked about $7.7 billion in increased security measures.  We must remember this would be expanded over at least five years and $2.2 billion of that would be for air security, which would actually be a tax on all people using the airlines.  We must keep that in mind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $500 million for the ongoing costs of Operation Apollo.  However, in terms of  national defence itself, our armed forces, the auditor general  said last week that we needed $1.3 billion this year just  to maintain and update the current state of the dilapidated equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reflection of the ministerial statement that our armed forces are in a state of preparedness, the auditor general talked about    10 years of reduced funding for the armed forces.  What an indictment for the auditor general to say that  we should take the statement about military preparedness with a grain of salt. It is not an indictment of the troops, who are the most courageous and dedicated of any in the world, but an indictment of the government that refuses to fund them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has made a stealth decision to gut the Canadian forces and to leave them  incapable of  playing a significant  role on the international stage or in NATO.  There was a great opportunity to signal a rebuilding of our armed forces.  The  government failed our Canadian forces.  If it continues on that wholly inadequate level  we see a time coming when  it would have to announce further reductions and further limitations to our Canadian armed forces mandate.  We do not want to see that happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about money for the RCMP, CSIS and extra money for the coast guard but far short of what the needs are.  Our coastline and perimeter stand weakly protected, not from a lack of commitment by those  people in the coast guard but by a lack of funding and resources to do the job  they need to do.</p>


	<A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1520)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is  significant  the government could say that CSIS received more funding than the other areas of security, which it did, but its funding with the supposed  increase that it received  is back to 1994 levels.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that is disturbing is that  much of the funding for the armed forces and  security is given  grudgingly by the government.  It is only after  pressure from the Canadian Alliance, our citizens and the security forces.  What is with the government that it refuses to stand on guard with those who want to stand on guard?  It is time it stood up for the security forces of the nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an area  of security where the government listened.  It was    the issue of air marshals.  When we first raised this issue, the minister said that there was no way in the world  we would use air marshals.  He said that having air marshals on airplanes was not the Canadian way.  He said that we would have CF-18s flying around Toronto with missiles to shoot down planes that might be hijacked.  That apparently was the Canadian way. However he said  no to air marshals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has finally listened.  He  listened to the Canadian Alliance, the pilots, the people using airlines and our security forces.  He must have been listening to the Americans because they said no flights would be allowed into Reagan national airport unless there were air marshals aboard.  He finally realized that Canadian lives were  as important as American lives.  We are glad he  recognized that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has been dragged kicking and screaming on issues related to national security into standing up for Canadians and policies called for by  the Canadian Alliance. We appreciate some of  the slouching toward our policies by implementing some of the anti-terrorism legislation, partially creating a security perimeter with the United States, bringing in improved refugee screening  and signing a safe third country agreement with the United States.  We acknowledge that it made partial steps in that area.  We thank Canadians for working with us to impress upon our government the need to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third major failing of the budget was the absolute failure to reduce taxes and to increase the job killing payroll taxes as workers struggle through a recession.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know where the government get its guidance.  All the literature on this issue shows that we do not invigorate an economy by raising taxes.  Nobody has done it yet.  The government is trying to prove that maxim wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that on the eve of the last election the government, previously resistant to tax reduction, grabbed a Canadian Alliance platform related to tax reduction.  We proposed $150 billion in terms of reduced taxes.  It said that it would bring in a $100 billion tax reduction.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at it in its true light, when we count the forgone revenue and when we eliminate the smoke and mirrors from what it said, it was actually a $47 billion tax cut, not  a $100 billion tax cut.  We proposed a $150 billion tax cut and we still do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving into recessionary times according to all economists who are looking at it and measuring it, and we see no further tax relief.  There is a   $450 million tax on airline passengers, $440 million in new tobacco taxes and a one time windfall of $2 billion in deferred taxes which the government will collect  next year anyway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most insidious of all are the payroll taxes which would go up by $153 per worker on average this year.  That means  hardworking people would be going home with a paycheque  $153 smaller than it was before.  That is no way to treat a recession and that is no way to treat hardworking taxpayers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reduction at all in personal income taxes in 2002. Despite the October 2000 so-called mini budget we still  have the highest rate of personal income taxes in the G-7. It is absolutely unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nation where we have millions of square miles of hope and opportunity shared by only 30 million citizens, we should be the most prosperous people on the face of the earth, with much abundance left over to properly share with others.</p>


	<A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the overpowering, overregulating, overtaxing approach of the government, we are left diminished and we are left with the highest rate of personal income taxes in the G-7. It is absolutely inexcusable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the kinds of trade-offs that the government has made, funding its pet projects instead of looking at how it can lighten the load for the workers of our nation. By doing so it  makes sure that students who are trying to get a first job or single parents who are trying to make ends meet by working in a restaurant part time will not be able to find the employment that they look for. That is what these Liberal payroll tax increases mean for ordinary Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for that $450 million per year tax on airline travel and the money that will be taken in from that tax over the next five years, even the government  admits it will outstrip the requirements of spending on airline and airport security. Look at the boldness with which it taxes people. Not only does the government  say  the tax is to cover that security,  it wants to make a profit on the taxpayers, on the people travelling on the airlines. That is a shame in terms of how we treat an industry  looking to send out signals of confidence to a public  looking for ways to fly with confidence, both financially and with security. That tax may, like other Liberal taxes, become a cash cow that will bring in money to the government for who knows what spending project for who knows what leadership candidate hopeful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has imposed that tax on a travelling public at a time when airline travel is down and some of our airlines are struggling to survive. Is it not interesting that  it will be  the smaller,  more competitive airlines, the ones that operate on the tighter margins and offer the short hops of travel, that will have the most disproportionate ratio in terms of the $25 return tax put on those particular airlines? Once again, the government moves in a way that brings increased pressure to bear on the smaller airlines that are trying to be competitive and  provide a service for  Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government really had  a handle on its waste, there would have been fiscal room for real tax reductions that would have helped the economy and increased private sector job creation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would  have liked the EI premiums to come down enough to offset the CPP increases. The government could have done that. The EI fund continues, with a giant surplus approaching almost $40 billion, again funding the pet projects of Liberal hopefuls in a variety of fields and forgetting about the people who are trying to be hopeful about their own futures and trying to provide for their own families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital tax still stands at a much higher rate than its comparable tax in the United States. At a time when we are trying to encourage businesses to expand, to invest here in Canada, expansion that would hire more people, we have a capital tax in place that is a disincentive. Why is that? Economists are saying that for every one dollar this tax raises, it has a dampening effect of $7 on the GDP. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What on earth are the Liberals thinking? Are they so addicted to taxing and spending that they cannot see through the blur of their own addiction and see the needs of people, individuals and businesses that could be the most competitive in the world but cannot because they are hampered by these Liberal policies? The government, true to its Liberal ways, thinks that the only way out of a recession is to try to spend your way out. That is not the way to do it. That is a complete failure to address the need for tax reductions in the budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every walk of life would be affected if the Liberals would change their philosophy when it comes to taxes. I meet with farm families across the country. I sit at their kitchen tables as they tell me with tears in their eyes that their sons and daughters are leaving the farm because they do not see a future there. Think of what tax reduction in that sector alone would do, not just for the incomes of the farmers themselves. We  proposed tax reductions for the fuel  farmers that use to sow their seed and reap their harvests and the Liberals voted no. We  proposed tax reductions for small and medium sized businesses, value added businesses in the agriculture sector, which would put a greater demand on agricultural products, and again they refused. We  proposed reduced taxes on things like fertilizer and again they refused.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every facet of Canadian life in terms of productivity would be positively affected if these Liberals could get a  grip on how they approach citizens and could see that citizens, if left to their own positive devices, can make their way ahead and actually produce and have the type of innovation and production that would vitalize and invigorate the economy and would not have the stagnating effects that Liberal policies have. </p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth and perhaps the deepest failing in the budget is the wasted opportunity to get fundamentals right and lay the groundwork for a more productive and  competitive economy. There is no reduction this year or for the next three years in the still sky-high level of national debt. Every citizen who pays a mortgage   stands today in wonder at how the government could just suspend its mortgage payments, mortgage payments on the children of our citizens.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no measures   in the budget to increase the confidence of markets in the Canadian dollar. The markets need a sign that there will be in the long term some tax reduction which will mean business investment will be able to flourish, but when a government makes the decision to suspend its debt payment program it sends out a very alarming signal.  It sends out a signal that it will keep taxing people, that it will  take the taxes and not reduce debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When debt is paid down, interest payments are freed up.  Those interest payments could be used for things like important social programs.  The government just does not get it.  That is a wrong signal to send out to the economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the aftershocks of September 11 deepened our economic trouble, but the fact is that we were headed for a serious economic slowdown before September 11. The   Canadian Alliance critic for finance, economists and  others were pointing out months  before September 11 that the government was taking the country down the road to deficit.  We pointed that out months ago. Now the finance minister and the Prime Minister have the nerve to stand under the dark cloud of September 11 and make it sound like it is September 11 that now propels us toward a deficit.  No, it is their uncontrolled spending and their refusal to be prudent that is hurtling us toward a deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending was already well out of control before that.  Even during the last election economists were looking at what the Liberals were throwing out there and were predicting that the government was on course to a deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the finance minister, the Prime Minister and the Liberal government lead us back into deficit they will not have the international economy to blame.  They will not have international terrorism to blame.  They will have their own shortsighted, selfish policies to blame and that is all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial markets and citizens want to see spending come down and debt reduction  continue.  If they do not see these things it casts a negative judgment on the value of the Canadian dollar.  The Prime Minister thinks a low Canadian dollar is fine and it is a good policy.  Maybe he has separate pension provisions above and beyond what most Canadians have, because retiring Canadians and Canadians who are retired now need to know that the low Canadian dollar policy of the Prime Minister is sapping the buying power of their life savings. Their future purchasing power is being diminished daily and went down a bit when markets closed yesterday with the Canadian dollar dropping in response to the budget.  That is a wrong-headed policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national debt load stands at $547 billion.  That is an important point.  It is higher than in 1993 when the government took office. I know the Liberals blame the spending of the previous federal Tory government for increasing deficit and   debt.  I will not debate them on that point, but it needs to be pointed out that because of their weak approach to the debt over the last few years, and now because of their approach not to pay down debt at all,  we imperil our economic situation. Canadians need to be reminded of that every time the finance minister and  the Prime Minister stand up and talk  about how they have reduced the deficit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians need to be reminded of  how they did it. They ripped money away from provinces for health care and education under the CHST grant and they tore money away from our national defence,  the two greatest areas in which they reduced spending.  They took 36% away from those grants and transfer payments and in their own areas of spending maybe 6% to 7%.  It was an absolutely irresponsible approach.   </p>


	<A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government thinks it can avoid making these debt payments now, shortsightedly, hoping current interest rates will last for several years. There is no guarantee of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last election we  called for a legislated debt paydown plan because we had a sneaking hunch that if times got a little tough the Liberals would bail out on paying down debt and fall back into their addictive ways of spending. We sensed that over a year ago when we proposed that paying down  debt be legislated, but they laughed at us. They said “Just trust us. We are Liberals,  you can trust us. We'll continue to pay down the debt. We don't need a law to tell us to do that”. That is what they said. They said that they did not need a law.  They said that their promise was as good as a law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was raised by my parents, as I am sure my colleagues were, to indeed believe that one's promise is as good as a law, but when the spending got tough their promise broke. Now we see why they did not want it to be a law to have to pay down debt: right now they would all be in court for breaking that law. That is why they did not want it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be a written law, but it is a policy and it is a clear principle of the Canadian Alliance that debt is a serious item. It needs to be legislated and that is exactly what we would do. We would legislate its paydown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, voters forgot the Liberal legacy of broken promises and now we are paying the price. They received votes in the last election partially because they were promising to pay down debt. Now they have broken that promise. We need to remember the legacy of broken promises of the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a minister of finance. I know what it is to table a law that forces the paydown of a debt. I commit to taxpayers today that the Canadian Alliance will always treat debt seriously, will always see it as a deferred tax on our children and our grandchildren and will never put foolish political spending ahead of the hopes and the dreams of our children and our grandchildren.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has gone totally in the opposite direction on that. This kind of decision is typical of the lethargic Liberal policy of drift and decline that typified the 1990s. The 1990s was a decade of drift for Canada. It was their present member for Markham who, before he was elected and fell under the Liberal gag order,  called the last 10 years a “decadus horribilus”. Roughly speaking, that means a nasty 10 years. That is what he called it until he got elected and they gagged him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real income levels stagnated while countries like Ireland overtook us. Our dollar has lost 25% of its value against U.S. currency since 1993. There is now a 22% gap  between  Canadian and  U.S. standards of living. That amounts to a difference of $29,000 for an average family. This is unacceptable.  U.S. productivity has grown  50% faster  than  Canada's over the past decade. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said that the 1990s will stand out as the poorest decade relative to growth since the 1930s.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these figures point to Canada's greatest economic challenge:  to stop the slide in our standard of living and try to catch up. I believe we can not only catch up but  overtake the American competitive edge and other OECD economies. We do not have to lag behind. Canada can and should outpace other OECD countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am upset that the Mexican peso outpaced the Canadian dollar last year relative to the American dollar. I am upset about that, but I am glad for the Mexican people. I have met their president and he cares about the value of their purchasing power. However,  I am upset that the government's policies have caused the Canadian dollar to fall behind the Mexican peso in terms of growth relative to the U.S. dollar. I am upset when an Ireland or a New Zealand or a Singapore beats Canada in competitiveness. That is upsetting to me. It does not have to be that way. I am glad for those other countries, but I am sad for Canada and sad about the policies of the government that have put us there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada cannot afford to stand still. The flight southward of capital and of some of our best citizens continues. Ninety-eight thousand highly educated, highly motivated, highly skilled Canadians are moving south this year alone, 98,000 people who could produce, who could create wealth, who could create opportunities. They are moving south.</p>


	<A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to get our priorities straight. We need to continue on the track of debt reduction, tax reduction and spending reduction that the government has totally abandoned.  Rather than take the bold steps to strengthen our economy and to secure our future, the finance minister, along with the rest of the government, continues to be adrift.  The ship of state is adrift without a chart or a compass even as we enter the storms of a recession.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians deserve better than another decade of drift.  Canadians deserve and can have a decade of destiny where Canada takes charge of its future and shows that we can compete and outpace any country in the world with the right government and the right policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In difficult times, Canadians want and deserve a government that will make tough decisions and not offer familiar excuses about global economic trends or the effects of American policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the choice we face:  return to these tired old ways of simply protecting political power, increased government spending, high taxation and a massive debtload or chart a course for a more limited,  more effective government, lower and more competitive taxes and a debt that  can be eliminated in the lifetime of the members of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the choice before us:  another decade of drift or a decade of destiny.  Sadly, the government has chosen the easy and the lazy path of drift.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is what Michael Bliss, a distinguished historian, wrote this morning about the government's high spending status quo budget:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in these tough economic times, other jurisdictions are showing leadership and they are continuing to take bold initiatives to set the course for their provincial economies. The federal government could learn from this.  If the overall Canadian economy does recover next year, it will be in large measure to the actions taken outside of Ottawa, taken by provincial capitals across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has this air of superiority.  It  considers itself the major leagues and it considers the provinces the minor leagues.  It was the provinces that set the economic pace in the last decade and they continue to do so. It is he federal government that comes in on the hard work of provinces, scoops that surplus, spends it indiscriminately and does not learn the lessons of true economic reform and economic rigour. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbia is coming out of a home grown economic slump created by the free spending and high taxing policies of the NDP.  The new provincial Liberal government of B.C. is promising and has come forward with dramatic tax cuts to make B.C. competitive with Ontario and Alberta.  To make sure it can afford these tax cuts, it is implementing huge efficiencies to its own government bureaucracy and across the board spending cuts.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The B.C. government recognizes what the federal  government does not:  providing fiscal stimulus through fiscal discipline and through tax relief provides long term growth to the economy, while increasing government spending only provides a short term boost and  imposes a future tax, a deferred tax on the young people of our nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Alberta is continuing in its quest to become the first province to pay off its entire provincial debt.  That  is a goal worth pursuing.  Why does the federal government not get  hold of a vision like that?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the honour of working with the premier of  Alberta  and an elected team who put people first. I was  the minister of finance when  Alberta became the first province to pay off its net debt so that it owned more than it owed and to be the first province to have a single rate of tax, and it proved that we can do that through recessionary times, when commodity prices are down, when there is a worldwide crisis on like the Asian crisis.  If we still show fiscal discipline and  still be committed to keeping taxes low for our hardworking people, we can still move ahead even in tough times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes discipline to stay the course toward that type of objective.  We cannot be  spending addicts like  the federal Liberal government.    </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why could this federal government not have cut its spending at least enough to make a modest payment on that debt?  Our finance critic has already identified $6 billion of wasteful, inefficient spending that could have been applied toward paying down the debt and to other areas.  It would have taken pressure off other programs and it would have taken some of the burden off the shoulders of our children and grandchildren who now must carry, who knows how many more years, the result of the federal government backing off on any commitment to pay down debt. The federal Liberal government lacks the vision to chart a clear course for the country toward prosperity . </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario is continuing its course toward growth and prosperity.  The federal Liberals do not like to hear it, but Ontario is moving in the right direction in many areas.  In the midst of tougher economic times, Ontario remains committed to staying out of deficit and, in the same process, reducing taxes and putting money into health care, not taking money  out of health care like the federal government did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ontario government, like many other provinces, looks for bold new initiatives in terms of reducing taxes.  Take, for example, the Ontario government and its commitment to promote choice and competition in education by providing federal tax credits to parents of children attending independent schools.  That is a policy borrowed again from the Canadian Alliance platform and it helps fulfill  the national interest.  It recognizes a public good being performed by parents, something the federal government neglects to do in many areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada also has an obligation under international human rights law to prevent religious discrimination.  Ontario's new policy of providing choice to parents of all religions and all denominations helps Canada comply with these areas of recognizing and not discriminating against individuals in terms of their particular choices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in tough economic times, the provinces continue to lead.  The minor leagues lead the major.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see no bold, decisive action from the government.  We see no further progress toward debt and tax reduction that would strengthen our dollar and improve our international competitive position.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this post-September 11 environment, we have not  seen   a serious or profound consideration of our economic arrangements with our friend, our ally and our greatest trading partner, the United States. There is no new thinking in that area whatsoever.  Surely, after September 11, the one signal the government could have sent, without opening even wider its spending floodgates, is that we are serious about our continental partnership with our American neighbours. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was much talk yesterday about open borders and border security but there was no sense of a long term vision about where the continental partnership between the United States, Mexico and Canada could and should go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government does not like to admit this, but the prosperity it  enjoyed, ironically in its first years in office, was in large part due to measures taken before it came to power.  In 1993 the Macdonald royal commission urged Canadians to take a leap of faith toward free trade with the United States.  The Liberal government of the day did not want to embrace that destiny of free and fair trade.  The Mulroney Conservatives did embrace free trade.  It was also supported by the new and rising Reform Party of the day.  However free trade was bitterly opposed by the Liberals, including the now Minister of Finance.  It was this policy of free trade and NAFTA that helped create the very prosperity that the government then took to balance its federal budget, along with of course raiding health care and raiding our armed forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 11 has driven Canada and the United States more closely together than ever.  Now is the time for us to take another leap of faith to an even more robust economic relationship with our American allies.  The time is right.  It is not enough to improve border crossings, as important as that is,  just to maintain the status quo. We need to create an even closer union where the border can be truly invisible to consumers and businesses alike.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Pierre Trudeau had the foresight to appoint Donald Macdonald to think about the long term future of the Canadian economic union.  It was that thinking which finally lead to that leap of faith in free trade which  caused Canada to become more prosperous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had a government that truly understood human hopes,  human action and human nature, we would have policies in place that would cause us not to just catch up to but to leap ahead of the United States and to really discover the opportunities of being a truly favoured nation in this world.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the long term visionary thinking of today under this Prime Minister?  There is no vision, only half measures.  He said himself that he is not a visionary.  I say again that we agree with that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few hundred million dollars for border guards or special pass programs but no long term vision for our North American partnership, even though market, social forces and security concerns are forcing us into a new north-south relationship.  The universal forces at work are propelling us in that direction.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get a vision so  we can steer our path and not be forced into it so  we can take advantage and maximize opportunities rather than just being pulled along in the drift of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's lack of vision is perfectly described by F.R. Scott's meditation on another long-serving Liberal Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King.   F.R. Scott said:     </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<blockquote>
		
<p>He seemed to be in the centre<br>
		

	Because we had no centre,<br>
		

	No vision<br>
		

	To pierce the smoke-screen of his politics.<br>
		

	<br>
		

	Truly he will be remembered<br>
		

	Wherever men honor ingenuity,<br>
		

	Ambiguity, inactivity, and political longevity.<br>
		

	</p>


	</blockquote>
<blockquote>
		
<p>Let us raise up a temple<br>
		

	To the cult of mediocrity,<br>
		

	Do nothing by halves<br>
		

	Which can be done by quarters.<br>
		

	</p>


	</blockquote>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government,  with its half measures and  quarter measures on the border, is avoiding defining a vision of the Canada-United States relationship, one that would be positive for Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come for a new vision, fit for the post-September 11 era and  fit for a new millennium.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must put all  the options on the table.  We need to consider a truly common and free market, with common tariff and common customs policies in a formal customs union.  Where is the vision for this?  We need to talk about these things.  We need to imagine a Canada where the Canada-U.S. border is as transparent and as invisible as the French-Spanish border or the Dutch-German border.  The French, the Spanish, the Dutch and the Germans did not cower in fear of losing their national identity as they marched toward freer trade.  Canadians do not fear that either.  I have yet to run into a Canadian in my travels from coast to coast who has said, “Please send Sheila Copps to protect me and my identity”.  That has not happened yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I recognize--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have yet to run into a Canadian from coast to coast who has said “Please, quickly send out the minister of heritage to protect me, so I can save my Canadian identity”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians know who they are.  Canadians stand proud.  We do not stand in fear of moving ahead in prosperity and progress or of losing our identity.  We will always know what it is to be Canadian. Canadians do not have this fear. The only fear we see is the Liberal fear of losing power, if our citizens actually gain more power for their own future direction and prosperity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States and Canada need not fear such an open border.  We will both have confidence that the continent is protected, if we move ahead with the protections that we have suggested, with a security perimeter that keeps criminals and terrorists out of both countries and allows freedom of trade back and forth across an open border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to consider moving closer together on monetary policy.  Why is there no discussion on this?  Why is neither the Prime  Minister nor the Minister of Finance bringing forward the elements of this so we can look into this and discuss it?  Because the government waits for the winds to blow.  It holds its fingers in the air.  When it hears the winds blowing strong enough and feels them  strong enough, it reluctantly sails in that direction, sometimes in the direction of a freer economy and a freer nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seriously need to start  discussing dollarization or a common currency.  Why in this day and age are we not discussing these things?  Why do we continue to fall back on pet political projects for political friends rather than the true issues of propelling ourselves forward in prosperity and in hope.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to send a signal that we are thinking boldly about the future, that we still have the courage to dream great dreams, these are the kinds of issues we must discuss.  We must be discussing these now.  International events are forcing the discussion.  Why do we not lead them instead of being dragged into them?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These events will be thrust upon us as terms not advantageous to us in five or ten years if we do not move on these areas now, get the discussion going, talk to Canadians and look at our opportunities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, with this budget, with  their runaway spending, their failure to address the real defence and security needs of Canadians, their return to tax increases, their abandonment of debt paydown and of any attempt to restore economic fundamentals,  let alone to consider anything dramatic or new like transforming our continental relationship, the Liberals seem to have chosen the path of drift.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, tomorrow and the next day the Canadian Alliance  will be asking Canadians to help us chart a different course.  We will be asking them to help us have a discussion on these economic and security issues to force the government to come to terms with economic reality, to change its direction, and to take our economic destiny into our own hands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us eliminate the waste in government by starting with the cuts to the $16.3 billion of poorly managed programs that the auditor general has identified.  Let us give our brave Canadian forces the tools they need to do their job.  Let us continue with tax reductions especially, in this time of recession, to those job  killing payroll taxes. Let us continue to pay down the debt and restore confidence on the fundamentals of our economy.  Let us allow the provinces to be innovative in areas like health care, where they can allow market forces to help them deliver the services that their citizens need without being slapped and without being hobbled by a federal government that truly does not care about co-operation. Let us have the courage to consider another leap of faith to a stronger, closer economic union with our great friends and allies in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government wasted a tremendous opportunity to chart a new course for freedom and prosperity with this budget.  Canadians deserve better.  With their help we can make this country better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can make this a country where the government provides not a roadblock, but a sign post for prosperity, a sign post for hope.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask all Canadians to join with us and make Canada a most favoured nation, a nation of unlimited horizons and boundless frontiers.  Let this be a nation where the young still have vision and the old still dream dreams.  God keep our land and may this country remain the truth north, strong and free.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, three months ago today the world witnessed terrorist attacks on the United States of a magnitude unlike anything seen before. In the next few minutes I would like to talk about how the Government of Canada has responded to those attacks. I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Davenport as we enter the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of these attacks continues every day. There is no question that things have changed as a result of the 11th. To some degree we have lost our naivety as a society and we have lost our innocence, and that is to be lamented. However every challenge that comes forward in life has to be met with resilience. That is what the government has done since September 11th.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada reacted quickly and effectively on several fronts after the events of September 11  in order to deal with the serious threats stemming from these horrible crimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to provide details today on the $2.2 billion in air security initiatives that were announced in yesterday's federal budget. This is part of our response to the events of September 11.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows what the government did on the 11th in the closing of our skies and in working with our American friends to ensure that all  planes coming across the Atlantic and the Pacific were put to Canadian destinations.  The people on those planes were processed and received with great hospitality by the people of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hours afterward, as we grappled with that particular problem, my officials were working with those of the FAA in Washington to come up with new, tougher security measures to ensure  we did not have a repeat of the events of the 11th.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also announced that immediately cockpit doors were to be locked for the full duration of the flights. That was long overdue. As the House will remember, earlier this year I asked pilot organizations across the country to consider closing these doors. In fact, I issued an order that at the first sign of any trouble those cockpit doors were to be closed. We had to follow this with the complete closing of the cockpit. That is something again which will affect lots of travellers who interact with the crew, and young children, in particular, who on their first flights are allowed to see from the cockpit the icebergs off Greenland, or  the St. Lawrence river valley or the Rockies as they fly over them. These things meant a lot to the travelling public and to the pilots in terms of interacting with passengers but that is all gone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came forward immediately and said that we would bring in nearly $58 million worth of explosives detection equipment. We actually ordered that equipment. We also said we would  spend $1 million  to do a very quick study to ensure that new methods were put in place to look at technologies and practices for airport security operations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We immediately allocated $3 million for new inspectors at Transport Canada and the resources necessary to support their activities. In recent days we  introduced Bill C-42, the public safety act, which is designed to strengthen the government's ability to improve the safety of Canadians, to prevent terrorist attacks and to respond quickly if significant threats should arise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of that bill  comprised of Aeronautics Act amendments that were in the works, that had stakeholder consultation and that were brought forward in advance because there were some changes that absolutely were required  to deal with the events of the 11th. One, which was spun off from Bill C-42, was to make the manifest information from Canadian flights available to our friends in the United States, something to which they had full entitlement but something we could not provide under Canadian law.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada already has one of the best civil aviation systems in the world and an enviable safety and security record. Following the terrorist attacks, it was necessary to take immediate measures to increase the level of aviation security in Canada, and we reacted accordingly. However, as I have often repeated in recent weeks, we can and we must continue to do better.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, my colleague, the Minister of Finance, detailed in great measure some of the responses that we have made on the airline security front. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost is the Canadian air transport security authority.  This authority  will   be different from the status quo and will be different from the regime that the Americans have put in place.  We are combining the benefits of involving the private sector and of having some element of decentralization, but with centralized standards and certification.  We are not bringing all these people in as federal employees or as public servants.  We are making them federally regulated employees.  They can continue to work for security firms and airport authorities, but they will be regulated by the federal government. They will have to meet strict standards of performance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good compromise from the positions of airlines,  airport authorities and others.  It is a compromise in terms of organization but it does not compromise the values of safety in which we believe so much.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This organization will be responsible for all pre-boarding screening at airports.  It will improve the effectiveness and consistency of screening services across the country.  It will be responsible for the acquisition, maintenance and operating of screening equipment.  It will certify and test security officers responsible, and certification will be awarded on the basis of new security and training standards set by the authority in accordance with Transport Canada's enhanced regulatory requirements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority will set conditions for its employees under service contracts.  These conditions will include appropriate performance standards, minimum wage rates, maximum hours of work and conditions relating to retention, including ongoing training.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall continue to establish standards and regulations for the delivery of aviation security services and to monitor for compliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot had been made of accountability in this Chamber, as there rightly should be.  What we have announced will be accountable to those people sitting in the House of Commons and the Senate because this will be an agency that will report directly to me, as minister, and the Minister of Transport stands here as a member of the government, accountable to all members in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before the authority is in place, the government will be providing up to $10 million this fiscal year to implement immediate improvements to airport screening practices.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even prior to the authority being set up, the government will provide up to $10 million during the current financial year to make immediate improvements to security measures in airports.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also to help the authority  meet its objectives, the government is going to provide up to $128 million a year extra in pre-board screening services. That funding represents an increase of 78% over the airlines' expenditures last year for pre-board screening. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition we shall be spending $1 billion for explosive detection systems equipment right across the country. That will cover 99% of all airline passengers in the country. That is going to be incredible coverage and will give Canadians a real sense of security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning I held a news conference at the Ottawa International Airport.  My officials demonstrated the new equipment. New X-ray equipment will be brought forward. The incredible technological breakthroughs that have been made in screening equipment will now be available  here in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also we are going to be providing $35 million over the next two years to airlines to help cover the cost of security modifications to existing passenger aircraft resulting from new standards and regulations currently in development. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will make annual contributions for costs associated with aviation security related policing at major airports. The new authority will provide funding for aviation security related policing to airport authorities which will make appropriate arrangements with police forces. We will be making one time payments of $20 million this year for heightened policing and security at airports resulting from the terrorist attacks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been said about armed police force on aircraft. This is something we would rather not have done. In a civilized society we do not want to be in  a plane at 37,000 feet with any firearm available even if it is in the hands of the RCMP. That is fraught with danger. It is something the airline industry grappled with. In particular, the Air Canada pilots grappled with that. They changed their views over the course of the last few weeks. We were sensitive to the changing views of the aviation industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with reluctance that I recommended to my colleagues that we put armed personnel on planes because it will be a confidence building measure for airline travellers. Some weeks ago we already agreed to this particular measure for flights into Washington.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on at length but I want to assure all my colleagues that we had a very good airline security system before September 11, but it was not good enough. What was announced yesterday by the Minister of Finance and by the government will improve it. We will have the best airline, airport and aircraft security system in the world. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the minister about the new $24 round trip assessment on passengers. First, is it not already true that a very large share of passenger ticket costs are taxes imposed by government, the air transportation tax, the GST on top of it and that share of the aviation fuel tax which companies pass on to their consumers? Is it not true, for instance, that in short haul low cost fares  a very large percentage, upward of half of the price of a ticket, is already taxation? Perhaps he would comment on that. Does this not add an additional burden?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what assurances can he give us that the funds raised by this additional assessment, this levy, will be segregated and will  all go to the direct airline security costs and those costs alone and that the funds raised by this additional tax will not be shunted into general revenues and used for other general government purposes? This is a serious concern  we have when we look at way the EI surplus is managed. Perhaps the minister could address this.  How do we know this tax will not be  shunted off into general revenues?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes two very good points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, with respect to the air transport tax, that was eliminated some years ago when we commercialized NavCanada. NavCanada then charged back its fees through the airlines and the airlines did add that to the ticket price.  However that covers the air navigation system. The airlines themselves were responsible for the screening and other security costs.  We estimate that there will be savings of about $72 million for the airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point the hon. member makes, he is absolutely right.  We cannot have anyone, not just members of parliament but  members of the public, believe that this charge will be used for other purposes.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it will go to the consolidated revenue fund. Yes, it will pay for all of the related security measures that are being introduced.  However as the equipment is bought, and we are talking about $1 billion  for EDS equipment alone over the next few years, obviously that charge will be reviewed. In fact I talked to the Minister of Finance about this during question period, between questions if members can believe that given today's question period. He acknowledged the fact that there absolutely will be a review. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not be a revenue generating device for the federal government. This really is something to pay for all of the security measures.  It is  something  we felt--and I believe Canadians will support us on this--should be borne by the travelling public and not come out of general tax revenues.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to draw to the attention of the transport minister this fact.  These are not numbers pulled out of the sky;  these are actual numbers if one were to buy an airplane ticket today flying from Edmonton to Calgary,  or from Dallas to Houston.  Edmonton to Calgary is  154 miles and  Dallas to Houston  is 225 miles. These are one way tickets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base fare for the Edmonton-Calgary flight is $70.  The base fare for the Dallas-Houston flight is $95 adjusted to Canadian dollars.  After all the fees, taxes, GST,  security charges and airport improvement fees in both jurisdictions, adjusted to Canadian dollars, the Canadian ticket costs $108.30 and the American ticket costs $95 even  and that is after all the taxes.  That works out to taxes and fees on the Canadian ticket of 35.3% of the cost and  on the American ticket, 14.9%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are paying more than double the fees, taxes and surcharges that Americans are.  It is a huge disincentive obviously to Air Canada which is trying to increase its capacity to fly transborder.  Relative to what is happening in the United States this puts Canadian carriers at a huge--</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the hon. member advocating that this be paid for out of general tax revenues?  Is he advocating then that this be added to expenditures of the government?  How can the Alliance member advocate this when his leader a few minutes ago, and I sat through his leader's speech, wants the debt brought down and does not want us to go into deficit?  Is the hon. member  advocating that we go into deficit, or is he really advocating a position that is different from that of his leader?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks about Air Canada and says how this is going to affect it.  I remind him that Air Canada issued a release last night supporting the government's approach to finance the security measures in this way.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, after listening to the  debate today and  question periods over the last couple of months, and the requests made by the official opposition, particularly by the leader of the official opposition, one cannot help but conclude that there is a profound sense of contradiction in the position taken by the official opposition in its demands over time for greater expenditure on the part of the government, particularly with respect to  national defence, security, intelligence, transport, you name it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to have been  an amazing discovery by the   official opposition that there is a role for government to play, after having criticized, until very recently,  the presence of government in all walks of life.  We have seen   almost a conversion on the road to Damascus on the part of the official opposition. It finally has discovered that actually there is a role for government to  play, and not only that but that government should be spending more money.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard this trend since parliament  resumed sitting in the  fall.  This trend is so strong it almost leads us   to believe there may  even be an element bordering on hypocrisy. One cannot ask the government to do more and  demand greater expenditure, as the official opposition has done,  and then  criticize the government for spending too much, as we have heard in the last 24 hours. In the last 24 hours we  heard only complaints that the government is overspending.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half an hour ago in the Chamber we heard the leader of the official opposition reveal  his vision about Canada's economic future which is limited virtually to a vision of reducing the debt.  That seems to be the major overriding preoccupation  of the official opposition as represented by its leader.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to ask whether the opposition can have it both ways, whether it can  continue to blame government spending and at the same time request the government to do more in specific fields as chosen by the official opposition.  Obviously this kind of contradiction does not help the consistency of the position taken by the official opposition since being elected to that role.   It is no wonder  the official opposition will remain where it is at the rate it   proceeds to elaborate on the role of government. It expects  the government to spend when there is a crisis, but at  budget time  it criticizes the government for doing its duty, namely   protecting the public and the public interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main theme of the leader of the official opposition this afternoon has been a repeated desire, almost an obsession, with the elimination of the debt. I am very glad  the government has not dealt with the reduction of the debt in the budget. Anyone with a minimum  understanding of what the gross domestic product is all about would know that the gross domestic product, namely the economy of the country, keeps growing from year to year, sometimes at 3%, sometimes at 1%, sometimes in between, but the economic pie keeps growing.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead the debt remains at a certain amount.  In proportion to the gross domestic product or in relation to the economic pie of the country, it is becoming less and less.  This means that as the years go by and as the economy grows the weight of the debt over the entire economic pie will become smaller and smaller.  For that reason, therefore, I am glad that  in the budget no resources were devoted to the debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition I am also glad that there was no further reduction of taxes.  As a government we saw a decision  made in the last budget to reduce taxes to the tune of $100 billion over the next five years.  This is a considerable commitment and a considerable amount of revenue  lost for very good reason: to stimulate the economy.  It is there and will certainly serve the purpose, but it is $100 billion which  the government does not have to perform its tasks, duties and role.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is very strong on national security, and so it should be.  However one has to note at the same time that it is not strong on social, environmental or climate security. I would like to think  there are measures in the budget which could help the workers at Algoma steel, for instance, and those who are becoming unemployed because of globalization and other competitive economic measures that are mercilessly affecting a large number of Canadian workers. It is therefore a gap which I would consider to be a temporary one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions made it necessary for the Minister of Finance to produce a short term budget in anticipation of the fact that once it is clear the strength of the economy  will pick up, particularly south of the border, it will then be possible to produce a long term budget containing the dimensions that are missing in the budget today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular I  mention the fact that the predominant issue in the international scene when it comes to climate change, namely the ratification of the Kyoto agreement, requires a number of changes to our taxation system and, in particular, an appreciation of the fact that we need to encourage the development of alternatives to fossil fuels.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring to various products such as ethanol, hydrogen and other means of producing energy that require a shift in Canada's taxation system so as to prepare the country for the reduction of dependence on fossil fuels and the adoption of new forms of energy which will make it possible in the long term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to achieve  the targets  we intend to arrive at by the year 2010. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That task is not a minor one and does require, from the perspective of the Kyoto agreement and the climate change challenge, taxation measures to be taken very early to obtain the desired results.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the number of issues that the leader of the official opposition has raised deserves a lengthy rebuttal. For instance, he proclaimed the desire for capital gains tax to be further reduced.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member in his presentation referred to the Canadian Alliance and said that we have said the government should spend more money.  That in fact is absolutely not the case.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said that the government should spend more money in certain areas.  We have said that overall spending should be lower.  We have said that the government has to learn to prioritize spending.  That is what we said. Never, never have we said that the government should spend more.  We have said prioritize.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said let us do something about the wasted spending, grants and contributions.  The auditor general pointed to $16 billion in grants and contributions that should be looked at and scrutinized properly.  We have said let us end the wasted spending and regional economic development programs right across the country. We have said let us end the low priority spending, such as the spending that is going on now to help fund this leadership race.  The    industry minister,  the health minister and the finance minister are all trying to fund the leadership race through taxpayer money.  That is what we saw this time:  the Prime Minister allocating the money to leadership contenders, saying that he wants to do it as fairly as he can.  That is not a proper expenditure of taxpayer money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the member if he understands now that clearly never has the Canadian Alliance asked for more spending.  We have asked for prioritized spending. We have asked for more spending in health care,   in security and in education.  We have asked for a balanced budget. In no case should we start running deficits again.  That is what we--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Lakeland has a very poor memory and a faulty one on top of that, because every day since we resumed in September he and his colleagues have been up asking for more expenditures here and more expenditures there.  Not one day went by in question period when the official opposition members did not get up and ask the government to play a stronger role than it has so far and to spend more on specific things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course if one were to add up the total cost of the requests made by the various critics on the part of the official opposition, it would be a hefty amount of money.  The member for Lakeland has to realize that he cannot have it both ways.  In other words, the official opposition cannot ask for greater expenditures and at the same time for  reducing the budget, or it cannot ask to have more money invested in certain specific sectors and at the same time to proceed with tax reductions.  These are contradictions that are available to anyone who has taken economics 101.  Perhaps the member for Lakeland will one day take a course in economics and learn the basics of that fine art.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the budget presented yesterday by the Minister of Finance is very disappointing. We already knew that would be the case. Last October, when the finance ministers met, this government suggested that   there would be no new money for health and education. It did no more than  commit to protecting projected transfers. Quebec still believes that Ottawa has enough money in its  sock to  offer some help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, we think that the minister overestimated his spending and underestimated his revenues. He says that the surplus will amount to $11 billion for the two fiscal years covered by the budget but, according to our estimations, it will be $24 billion. We  can come back to this later because we have been pretty accurate these last five years. We were off by about $4 billion for the last five years, meaning for the last five budgets presented by the minister, whereas his projections were off by $60 billion. Who is right? We can discuss it at the end of this fiscal year.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not one measure in this budget to get the economy back on its feet.  As I said earlier, the Minister of Finance is hiding behind his inability to estimate his revenues and surplus to put this budget over on us.  Once again, he is providing us with proof that he has serious credibility problems.  Recently, once again, the federal surplus reached the level we had predicted, $13.6 billion.  Now, he tells us he has no room to manoeuvre.  Even the surplus in the EI fund was $3.7 billion, when the  chief actuary had said it was $7 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, a budget was appropriate, but it ought to have been far more proactive.  The real challenge to the Minister of Finance ought to have been to put together a body of measures that were more likely to bolster consumer confidence, and this he has not managed to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of September 11, an investment in border security constitutes a strategy decision that cannot be avoided.  This we admit.  Yet we hardly need point out that, even before September 11, when there was no problem with air security, we were already at risk of a recession.   In order to counteract the economic downturn, capital projects need to be accelerated, small and medium-size businesses in difficulty given assistance, and investment encouraged.  In all, with a margin of maneuverability that is far greater than that of Quebec and the other provinces, the federal government ought to be sending out a clear message, demonstrating  its leadership in reviving the economy so as to minimize job losses in the coming months. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise has missed its target, and the minister has settled for presenting a budget just for the sake of form.  As a number of analysts have been saying today, what we got yesterday were advertisements, rather than the budget we were entitled to.  It is as if the government had bowed to the pressure, and did not want to be accused of doing nothing to deal with the recession.  In fact, it was never convinced that budgetary intervention was needed.  The Minister of Finance is counting on the billions of dollars invested by the Americans to stimulate our economy. As for the rest, he hopes that the drop in interest rates and the tax reductions announced last year will have the desired effect. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lack of originality and courage can be seen in his decision to invest $2 billion in a new strategic infrastructure foundation, if, and only if, he records a surplus this year or next.  It was not even included in the tables he presented yesterday.  This foundation depends on there being a surplus.  Instead of providing for a measure in the event of a catastrophe, the Minister of Finance is going to take money, cut the amount in half and create a foundation.  We can see there is no point getting excited over this foundation just yet.</p>


	<A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipalities must not count on it right away, because legislation will have to be passed in the House, and we know how long the procedures are.  After a bill is tabled, it has to go to committee for study and then, after it has been examined in committee, it has to be passed by the Senate.  So we will not see this foundation tomorrow.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the Liberal government is pursuing its strategy to establish a centralizing government, acting contrary to  consensus.  The foundation is an intrusion, further interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction.  It is inconceivable that non elected officials could be given the task of negotiating directly with elected municipal officials. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is outrageous to think that the Quebec transport minister would have to negotiate with board members of a foundation instead of his federal counterpart.  Is it not the role of  government to decide which roads, congress centres or water purification plants get priority?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the public must understand is that the sole aim of these foundations is to give jobs to pals of the Prime Minister. A lovely parting gift.  The public also has to know that these foundations will be funded by budget surpluses, one way of getting hold of the money left over at the end of the  fiscal year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general is critical of these foundations because they alter the government's financial data.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, since the idea of  a ministry of state for urban affairs came up in the 1980s, the federal government has not been able to hide its intention to bypass the provinces and negotiate directly with the municipalities.  Therefore, the objective of the infrastructure foundation is twofold:  to exempt significant amounts of money from being monitored by parliamentarians, and to strengthen the federal government's authority to influence the Canadian economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it created these foundations, the Liberal government explained that they would attract capital money from the private sector. This is true in the case of the Canada Foundation for Innovation, while for the others, contributions from major companies are rather rare. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, we were told that these foundations were ad hoc measures, which would not be in place for more than 10 years. But the interest accumulated in these bank accounts suggests that these foundations are not going to run out of money anytime soon. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for international  humanitarian assistance, we expected Canada to show its intention to set a timeframe to reach the OECD's objective of spending  0.7% of the GDP on assistance to developing countries. We have already called for this in the House. As we all know, a $1 billion investment in international aid has a much greater impact than the same amount spent on defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already stated  in the House, in order to be effective, the fight against terrorism must involve not only  military operations, but also a fight against poverty, which is a  breeding ground for violence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lack of inspiration is also reflected in the unacceptable decision to not invest more in health services. How can the Minister of Finance tell the Canadian Press that health has without question been the number one priority of the federal government, when he is merely meeting his October 2000 commitments?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the government's priority? There is nothing in the budget. There is nothing for health care and education. There is nothing for the poor. Nothing. There are no measures to fight poverty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care funding  is a huge challenge for provincial governments. The federal government's withdrawal from health care is unacceptable. The federal contribution has  been shrinking steadily over the past 25 years. It is now only 13 cents on every dollar invested. This is what the government calls its number one priority. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet health care programs in Canada are not a federal but a provincial responsibility. Ottawa does not have to administer hospitals, pay nurses,  negotiate with physicians, develop payment schemes or decide which services need to be funded; the provinces look after  all that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of that, yesterday's budget did not contain any measure aimed at increasing health transfers to the provinces.</p>


	<A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993, this government did not put one penny of new money into the system. Even medical specialists in Quebec blame it for problems in that province's health care system. The Fédération des médecins spécialistes du Québec supports Canada's provinces in their request for an increase in federal health transfers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that there is a true  fiscal imbalance in that sector. The fluctuations in federal transfers from one year to the next do not allow players in the health care system to do proper planning. Moreover, these transfers should be indexed because of increased costs related to new technologies, the aging population and  escalating drug prices. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition and the Bloc Quebecois are not the only ones complaining that the government is not meeting these priorities, that is increasing transfers to provinces and indexing these transfers because of increased costs related to the aging population and new technologies. So are  Canadian nurses federations and the Canadian federation of physicians and health workers federations in Quebec. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By letting the provinces fend for themselves, the federal government is being very disgraceful. By refusing to pay its  fair share of health care costs,  the Liberal federal government becomes the greatest danger that threatens the universality of our health care system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the situation with the unemployed. Not one word about them in this budget, except for the fact that the unjustified and unexplained surplus from the employment insurance fund will be used to finance the government's current spending instead of helping those who need it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unthinkable that the unemployed are paying off the Government of Canada's debt. How does the government do this? By maintaining premiums at levels that are too high, by limiting access to benefits and the length of the benefits period and by thumbing its nose at the program's objectives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general stated in her report that the management of the fund's surplus did not respect the spirit of the Employment Insurance Act. The surplus has had a direct impact on the government's financial situation. Without it, the government would have had a surplus of $8 billion rather than $17 billion by the end of the fiscal year ending  in March, 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has not even come up with a program to help older workers who have been laid off. The re-evaluation of the federal government's position to  follow up on the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development on employment insurance can be summed up as tens of millions of dollars for education.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the only good news on this front is the shorter waiting period for apprentices, but this government continues to pilfer from  the fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance boasts that he has kept the tax cuts already announced. The Bloc Quebecois was expecting much more. This government has not come up with any significant measure to rebalance the tax cuts in favour of low and middle income households. Again, it will be the richer members of society who benefit from the cuts, the rich friends of the members opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is immoral when it says nothing about the use of tax havens.  Here again, the government is allowing large sums of money, which have a major impact on the Canadian tax base, to leave the country. Need we remind the government that fewer than 2% of non-residents of Canada filed a tax return last year.  In addition, under the Canada-Barbados agreement, it is apparently possible to transfer capital gains totalling more than $800 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, what has this government announced to alleviate the housing crisis? The budget confirms a $680 million grant. This is nothing new. It has been known since the federal-provincial conference on this topic. Is it enough? Apparently not. The housing crisis continues to worsen, according to the latest CMHC report. We are experiencing an unprecedented housing shortage. The vacancy rate in Canadian cities is 1.1%, the lowest since 1987. In the riding adjoining mine, in Sherbrooke, the rate has dropped from 4.7% to 2.3% in the last year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Bloc Quebecois colleague, the member for Sherbrooke, could say more about this. Certainly, the federal budget brought down yesterday provides for $680 million, including $162 million for Quebec. This money will cover only 6,500 new social housing starts in partnership with municipalities.</p>


	<A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Montreal alone, 11,000 more units are needed.  The federal government's  withdrawal  from  social housing funding in 1994 has deprived Quebec of some 50,000 units.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget announces the introduction  of the first new tax since the  GST.   This one should be called “the September 11 tax”, and it will enable the government to recover the $2.2 billion it has put into improving airport security. I should point out that any permanent resident wishing to obtain the secure identification card, which is to come into force in June, will have to pay $50 for  it.  On top of that, next April 1, travellers  will have to pay an additional $12  each way,  $24 for a round trip within Canada, to be collected when plane tickets are purchased.  This will help impoverish remote regions  still further.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the public needs to keep in mind is that the government is going to move ahead with new air security measures, but above all that airline passengers will be the  ones paying for them.  This new tax is likely to have a very damaging effect on an industry  already very hard hit by the terrorist attacks of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Canadian measures are   far  from matching  those announced by the U.S. government, which is giving a credit to everyone taking domestic flights.  We are far   from doing what representatives of ACTA, the association of Canadian travel agents,  called for when they presented their brief to the Standing Committee on Finance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tax will apply equally to a $800 Air Canada ticket and a $150 WestJet ticket.  It will be over and above all other charges travellers have to pay, such as fuel surcharges and airport improvement fees.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government would have done well to follow the proposals that we made in our economic stabilization plan. Quebec's ideas are good: when it comes to taxes, allowing businesses to defer their corporate tax installments for six months is a measure the Bloc Quebecois asked for two months ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We commend this measure, just as we commend the tax credit for apprentice mechanics that we proposed and defended here in this House. The only problem: these measures are clearly insufficient without other meaningful measures to support business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, allow me to briefly recap yesterday's sad spectacle here in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance generously helped himself to  the employment insurance fund surplus to finance newly announced measures  instead of giving workers  a real break on employment insurance premiums. This government could also have given employers a break on premiums. Everyone is tired of paying more than is needed to the employment insurance fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental groups felt abandoned; meanwhile, everyone is concerned about pollution related problems. The government seems to be ignoring  the fact that each year, 16,000 people die because of poor air quality. It is far from achieving what the Bloc Quebecois asked for in order to make good on the Kyoto agreement, with the exception of wind energy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with his practice of sprinkling investments over various areas, the Minister of Finance brought down a  budget as a matter of form and to please our American neighbours.   It is as if his intent was to reassure the Americans, who wanted increased security for the continent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister could have done a lot more for the provinces.  From taxes on tobacco alone, he will take in an additional $400 million in 2002.  He could have worked with the provinces to prevent their having deficits and support their initiatives to stimulate the economy quickly pending  the economic recovery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is his wont, the Minister of Finance is considerably underestimating the budget surplus and withdrawing $13 billion from public debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not giving even a cent to health care and education and is leaving the provinces to struggle with funding for these priorities, including those of Quebecers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the time allotted me is going quickly, I will conclude by saying that, apart from providing investment to strengthen security measures and defence, the Minister of Finance's budget is   timid.  It lacks vigour and vision.  It contains nothing of note for the economy.  It does not even offer a cent to the middle class.  It is a failure. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know if, in her opinion, yesterday's budget can help our economy get back on track immediately. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the measures proposed in the budget allow us to create jobs tomorrow, considering that, following the September 11 events, the economic slowdown and the number of jobs that were lost, concrete action is truly necessary to  revitalize employment?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-107610"></A><a HREF="#Int-107613"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107608"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Pauline Picard: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. I think  I have spent the past 20 minutes demonstrating just that. There is nothing  in this budget to boost the economy. I am not the only one saying that. Based on the articles I have had a chance to read today, analysts across the country  agree that the Minister of Finance missed the mark in terms of stimulating the economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing. The tax reductions were already planned. There is nothing new, no new money. What would have been really important is an increase in the Canada social transfer  to help the provinces  faced with serious problems in the health sector. The rate of funding for education has never been so low. Something should have been done in that sector as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investing  in services  stimulates the economy, because more people can be hired to provide these services, particularly in hospitals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing, apart from the instalment payments called for by the Bloc Quebecois. This was also a measure favoured by Mrs. Marois in her last budget. Apart from the deferral of installment payments for six months, there is absolutely nothing to help industries or companies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many companies in my riding. I think that all entrepreneurs are now starting to dip into their reserves because of the economic downturn. We must not mince words. We are now in a real recession. These people are worried. They expected the Minister of Finance to help them out until the economy rebounds. This is not what is being offered in the budget brought down by the Minister of Finance yesterday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, this budget does nothing but make announcements regarding security, defence and so forth. We have nothing against the federal government taking meaningful action to ensure the safety of Quebecers and Canadians.  But we were expecting more. The Minister of Finance is still keeping us in the dark  and fiddling with the books. In our opinion, he had another $6 billion available to reinvest and put the economy back on track.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to advise the House that I will be sharing my time with the member for Etobicoke--Lakeshore. I  congratulate the Minister of Finance on the budget tabled in the House yesterday.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  had the privilege of serving on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance as part of the budget process. The committee had in excess of 70 meetings and we heard from over 500 groups and organizations. I attended many other meetings leading up to yesterday's budget, including at least two caucus consultative meetings and one consultative meeting in my riding of Hillsborough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is the most important document that the government tables in the House in a given year. It sets out the policies, programs and priorities of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Monday I spoke to a Canadian Alliance motion on the budget. At that time I urged the Minister of Finance, first,   to   allocate sufficient resources to deal with the security of the nation. I am talking about security from an economic sense and from a physical sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I urged the Minister of Finance not to go back into a deficit under any circumstances. We had large deficits under previous Conservative governments. Canadians have been there. They have seen the destruction they cause to the economic and social fabric of our nation.  One message that resonated from the mouths of Canadians from coast to coast was that the government was to avoid a deficit. That  message came out loud and clear during all those hearings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I spoke about Canadians who told us it was imperative that the government maintain the $100 billion in tax cuts and the $23.4 billion in transfers to the provinces which would be used for health care and child care services. That was agreed to by our Minister of Finance in September 2000. These tax cuts, together with the many interest rate cuts announced by the Governor of the Bank of Canada over the past number of months, would continue to provide the necessary monetary stimulus to lead the country out of the downturn we are presently in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, I spoke of confidence. That is an important issue during this downturn. We must have the confidence of consumers, investors and  business people. We must have confidence in the financial future and that the minister knows how to deal with the economic downturn we are presently in, that he has a plan, that he is prepared to act and that he will act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased and proud that the budget tabled in the House yesterday addressed those four concerns. I am pleased  the government  would allocate the necessary resources to deal with the issues facing the nation's security. National security is a complex issue and an issue which cannot be solved immediately. The finance minister has dealt with security in all its facets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money would be allocated to increase funding for the RCMP, CSIS and other security related departments, as well as for general government emergency preparation. There would be funding for  air travel security. There would be $1.6 billion over the next five years for screening of immigrants and refugees. There would be a considerable amount of money, $646 million, allocated to enhance border operations. There would also be an additional sum of money for border infrastructure.</p>


	<A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am   pleased  our finance minister  chose not to lead us back into a deficit. That would have been the easy solution. That would have been the course followed by a weaker government and a weaker minister. However that was not the course followed yesterday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure of  the assets of future generations is a path that  Canadians  do not want to walk down.  It is a path that the government  will not  travel. I am  pleased that the Minister of Finance has not in any way altered the massive tax cuts initiative  he announced in September of last year. I am  pleased the $23.4 billion package  that was subject to the health care agreement made among the Government of Canada, the 10 provinces and the three territories last September was untouched by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, I am pleased that our finance minister has taken a balanced approach from a fiscal and monetary point of view.  It  conveys a strong message to all Canadians that the government has the finances of the country under control.  It is prepared to make  tough decisions  to govern the nation.  It understands the tough economic circumstances of not only this country but every country of the world.  It is prepared to act on the circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of confidence is  important  in all its facets. Confidence will be shown by  business and investors as we go forward from this day onward. That confidence, if seen, would be supported by tax cuts; by increased health care expenditures; by the absence of a deficit; by lower interest rates which are very important; by security spending which is needed; by border enforcement initiatives that would allow goods and services to flow freely across our borders, specifically between Canada and the United States; by support for the innovation agenda; and by a certain level of monetary stimulus into the economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are governing in  challenging economic times. Our GDP growth is down and will continue to be down for the short term anyway. The government's revenues are down and unemployment is up slightly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has two instruments at its disposal in dealing with such circumstances. It has the fiscal policy which  entails a massive investment of public funding, and some parties in the House want the government to embark upon a massive program of public spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tool is monetary policy. That is probably more important. We have a  good combination of monetary policy with the tax cuts and through the interest rate relief provided to us by the Governor of the Bank of Canada. Whether it was good luck or good management, the $100 billion tax cuts announced by our finance minister last September are coming into play right now.  That is the medicine that is needed for this downturn.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of monetary policy I want to address briefly the effect that the combination of tax reductions and lower interest rate policies would have on the average family. According to the calculations that were in the budget document there would be an approximate $2,200 reduction, assuming a family had a $100,000 mortgage.  That is about $1,100 of tax relief. This depends on the circumstances but it is over $3,000 and could be as high as $4,000 in tax relief for that family.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that our Minister of Finance has followed the course that he outlined  yesterday. He  listened to Canadians from coast to coast. He  listened to colleagues on both sides of the House. He has drawn up a very positive plan to secure the progress of the nation in a very uncertain world.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am surprised to learn that my hon. friend from Hillsborough, whom I respect and with whom I share a seat on the finance committee, found nothing to criticize in the budget insofar as he joined me in concurring in the recommendations of  the Standing Committee on Finance. Does  he still believe in the recommendations?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 27 of its report the committee recommended the government limit its program spending to inflation plus population at 3%, a level less than a third of the 9.3% included in the budget.   On   page 80 it recommended we immediately eliminate the capital tax.  This is not mentioned in the budget. On page 26 it recommended we reallocate spending from low priority areas to finance any new security spending. Not a dime of this is provided for in the budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 30 the committee recommended the government provide a five year planning horizon.  The budget provides a two year planning horizon.  On page 82 the committee calls for the government to consider a yearly basic exemption for EI premiums.  This is mentioned nowhere in the budget.  On page 113 the committee recommended the government sell its shares in Petro-Canada to pay down the debt, realizing $2 billion in liquidated assets.  This is mentioned nowhere in the budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 31 it recommended the government use its contingency to pay down the debt. The contingency disappears and is no longer directed toward the debt.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on page 33 the committee recommended  all new spending be subject to the program review criteria outlined by the committee.  This again is not mentioned in the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could the hon. member  have signed on to these substantive recommendations, of which not one iota  is reflected in the budget, and still endorse it?</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite correct.  There are a number of initiatives and suggestions in the report of the finance committee.  I supported it,  signed on to it and   agreed to it.  The suggestions include the YBE or yearly basic exemption and  the reduction or elimination of capital taxes.  These are good programs.  I will not stand here today and say I do not support them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we must take everything in context.  Everything cannot be done immediately.  There is a certain issue of affordability and balance.  The finance minister is dealing with challenging economic times.  He must take all Canadians into consideration.  He has done an excellent job.  The balance is there.  The initiatives are in the report.  I hope our finance minister and our government will see fit to implement them at some point in the future.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join in the debate on Budget 2001.  I congratulate the Minister of Finance for bringing down this balanced and timely budget. I also thank all Canadians, in particular my constituents in Etobicoke--Lakeshore, who participated in prebudget consultations and offered advice to the process.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is a good one.  We have heard comments about the recommendations of the finance committee.  I think we gleaned the best of the suggestions and recommendations from  the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2001 responds to the realities of the uncertain times in which we are living.  There is much concern in the public about economic uncertainty and personal security.  The horrific events of September 11 have touched our shared sense of security and put additional stress on the already ailing global economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, I have heard from many of my constituents through correspondence, e-mails and meetings all expressing their thoughts and feelings about the threat of terrorism, their personal security and the impact of the events on their jobs and the Canadian economy as a whole. They have told me they want the federal government to ensure the safety of  our communities and society.  They want the government to take steps to keep terrorists out of Canada and to stimulate the Canadian economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget the Liberal government identified national security as an area of high priority. It is committed to providing the financial resources necessary to protect Canadians. Though we are in a difficult economic period the measured and balanced approach taken in Budget 2001 will serve to restore confidence in our economy and the confidence of Canadians in their personal safety.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring the security of Canadians in the fight against terrorism cannot be done without making sound and solid investments where they are most needed. That is why the budget has committed a total of $7.7 billion over the next five years to enhance the security of Canadians.  This investment is based on a plan to increase resources to Canada's intelligence and policing agencies, to enhance screening of new entrants to Canada both at our borders and abroad, and to enhance faster and more thorough screening of refugee claimants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing better emergency preparedness and military deployment, Budget 2001 provides $1.6 billion to support Canadian military participation in the international war against terrorism, to fund military equipment purchases and to double the capacity of joint efforts to make air travel more secure by creating a new air security authority, providing armed undercover police officers on Canadian aircraft and providing better trained personnel to screen passengers and carry-on baggage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard today the Minister of Transport as well as the Minister of National Defence speak to the support they are giving to  the various programs.  The measures address pressing concerns and are  in line with Canada's international obligations in fighting terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newcomers to Canada choose this country as their home because we put a high premium on the values of tolerance, respect and diversity.  We are a nation that cherishes the values of freedom, equality and democracy. Like many of my constituents I was saddened  in the wake of September 11 to read about attacks made on individuals in various communities  who have been the target of intolerance owing to their country of origin, their ethnicity and their religion.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in times of crisis that we need to stand united as a country.  We do not need to make scapegoats of each other. We need to pull together and draw on the strength of our diversity. The $9 million in funding provided by the budget aims to foster, respect and promote values which demonstrate that the federal government is conscious that divided communities are not in the best interest of Canada's social development.  The new funding will be used to support the multiculturalism action plan put forward by the minister for Multiculturalism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core elements of the plan include: working in partnership with relevant federal departments to develop the intercultural training and tools to strengthen community relationship and trust; developing broad based educational tools, public awareness and Internet based information tools; working in partnership with community and voluntary organizations to build capacity, strengthen community cohesion and enhance intercultural and interfaith understanding; and  partnering with local police and municipalities to assist with the development of strategies and programs to enhance outreach and to develop social cohesion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the finance minister stated in the House yesterday, personal and economic security go hand in hand.  We cannot move forward as a country without sticking to sound fiscal management and making investments in Canada's human resources.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2001 is the government's fifth consecutive balanced budget in five years.  This is a record, the first in 50 years, making us the only G-7 country to balance its books this year.  This is something we as Canadians need to be proud of.  As a result of the government's strong and prudent fiscal management Canada's debt to GDP ratio will fall below 50% next year for the first time in 17 years.  I know our opposition is pleased about that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents and all Canadians can take pride in the fact that the sacrifices we have all made to put the country together are paying off and putting us on a strong financial footing.  With the budget the federal government reaffirmed its commitment to enhancing the quality of life of all Canadians. We live in an era where technical skills are driving the engines of economies.  Investing in Canadians will ensure they have the skills and tools to participate in a competitive and  technologically driven global economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada must have a highly skilled and educated labour force to lead the way. Our long term prosperity depends on these factors.  That is why the budget follows up on the Canada opportunities strategy, the Canada millennium scholarship and Canadian education grants  with $10 million over two years to improve supports for persons with disabilities to obtain higher education, $15 million a year to encourage the acquisition of trade skills by changing the provisions of the EI program so apprentices in approved programs are subject to only  one week waiting period before they start receiving EI benefits, and another $5 million a year to exempt from income tax any tuition assistance for adult based education provided under certain government programs including EI. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a generous nation.  We can take pride in knowing that when individuals are fleeing persecution in various regions of the world we will not abandon our humanitarian tradition.  The people of Afghanistan and those who receive our international assistance will know that what we have put in the envelope will be providing some support for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Prime Minister has restated his commitment that development in Africa will be the main theme of the G-8 summit, I am pleased that the trust fund to assist Africa to the tune of $500 million will create a partnership  so we can work with institutions in the international sphere  to promote sustainable development in Africa.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  even though I have great respect for the member who just spoke, I have to admit that only a Liberal could like this budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask her to turn to page 92 of the budget, table 5.1  expenditures.  When she said that $1.6 billion would go to the military, she made it sound as if the money would go right now.   The reality is that $400 million of that will go to emergency preparedness which has nothing to do with the military.  It will go  to other agencies. The fact is that  $510 million of the money has already been spent on Operation Apollo and on military purchases, that is, the refueling and  the sealift capability.  That leaves close to $700 million over five years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the arrogance of the Liberal government could give us a five year budget that is planned long after it assumes it might win the next election. The reality is that we can only take the budget for the term of this mandate. The Liberals gave us a budget that exceeds the mandate of  their government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only because of the Liberal government's  arrogance that it  can get away with this.  It is surprising because the Liberals  have a lot of very decent people on that side of the House. However to present a budget for Canada that extends the length of their mandate is unbelievable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  one thing the member completely forgets when it comes to the military is that there was not one red cent and not   one word about the Sea King replacements.  Where is the money?  Where is the deadline?  Where is the timeline for the replacement of those helicopters?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, one thing  about a debate in the House is that it gives the questioners  the opportunity  to put  their concerns on the record, regardless of the fact that my speech addressed some crucial issues and some crucial areas that I was hoping  the member may have focused on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to the fact that we as Liberals are looking to the long term, I think  the member would want us to be strategic and to look to the long term.  I think he would want us to live longer than today.  The budget addresses not only today but it looks at where we came from and where we are going with the hope that with good, strong fiscal management and with changes in the economic situation we will be able to meet all  the requirements that are asked  and demanded of us at this time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget responds to a whole series of issues that the member has overlooked. When the member talks about Liberal arrogance,   that  terminology  should be used in some other forum outside  the debate and outside  the remarks  I made around the budget  we presented, which is a reasonable sound  budget and one that meets the demands that have been placed on us as a result of September 11.  It also meets the requirements of the issues that face us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members asked us for a budget over and over again in the House.  I heard members ask when we would have a budget and why the finance minister was not bringing in a budget.   We have done what is possible to do at this point in time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the member will  settle down, reread, see the direction in which the budget is taking us and see  that we are not shortsighted but that we can look beyond today.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the generosity?  Where is the $40 billion surplus that will not go to help people in need across the country?

	Mr. Speaker, I was going to start by saying that I am very pleased to be speaking to the budget, but as you will see from my presentation, I am not quite as thrilled as I might be if it were a different budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are looking at a budget and analyzing the effectiveness of a finance minister and a government in a particular budget, we want to measure that against what has been asked for by Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From various polls that have been done over the past several months, I want to mention what Canadians in my constituency and across the country have been asking for.   The first thing the  polls say, and what my constituents certainly say, is  that Canadians want  increased spending in health care. The second thing Canadians want is the government's commitment to improve security measures. The third thing Canadians want  are reduced taxes. The fourth thing Canadians want is debt retirement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the  things Canadians wanted to see in the government's budget. They  also added some caveats to the whole thing. They said that under no circumstances was  there to be deficit funding on the part of government. They made that clear. They also  wanted the government to prioritize its spending so it could  meet  the needs and desires without running deficits. It was a matter of setting priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us  look at what the government has done in terms of the four main things Canadians wanted to see in the budget</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what did the government do in the area of   increased spending on health care?  There is not one dollar of new spending on health care. Canadians will certainly see that as a complete failure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area concerns reduced taxes. Not only is there no further reduction in taxes through the budget, but there are actually tax increases. For example, there is $2.2 billion over five years through the new airport tax to help pay for security. There is in fact an increase in tax, not only that, there are some others in the budget as well. I think Canadians will certainly judge that on the issue of tax reduction the government's budget has failed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to debt retirement, even if there were a surplus at the end of this year, the government has said that not a penny of it will go to debt retirement. It will go to other program spending. On the issue of debt retirement, the third issue to which Canadians  referred, the government has failed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go to the fourth area, which is the area of improved defence and security. On this issue I want to take a little more time. Being the official opposition defence critic, I particularly want to look at the defence aspect, but I also want to look at the whole security aspect to some extent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention right now that I will split my time with the hon. member for Crowfoot.  It is better to tell you now than not at all and take his time as well, although with the kind of presentation he gives, it could be kind of borderline anyway. He will have a lot of important things to say so I am looking forward to his comments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  heard a couple of  government members say that the Canadian Alliance members had  asked for a lot of increases in spending and  now they were being critical. That is true,  we did ask  for a lot of increases in spending, but we wanted it targeted to exactly the areas asked for by  Canadians.  We wanted it to go into health care  and into security, both of which are  important to Canadians. Security is important because  of the events of September 11, although the threat has been there for some time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to my questions today, a couple of members said  that we could not  have it both ways,  that we could not  ask for increased spending and then criticize the government when it spends too much. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well we can because what the government fails to understand is that we can target spending much better. For example, as the auditor general pointed out, the $16 billion  that  goes to grants and contributions is improperly scrutinized. Much of it goes to  friends of the Liberals. We have seen various demonstrations of this over the past couple of years. </p>


	<A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending  should be scrutinized and the money should be better spent. It has actually been proven that  regional economic development programs are harmful to the very regions they are there to serve. That could  be eliminated entirely.  We also have  low priority spending areas, such as   much of the spending the finance minister has allocated equally, as he puts it, between the various leadership candidates in the Liberal leadership race. The industry minister, the health minister, the finance minister--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> The defence minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Leon Benoit:</b> No, not the defence minister as far as I know, but  it certainly includes the foreign affairs minister.  Money has been allocated to all of them so they can all  go into the leadership race using  taxpayer money. The government fails to understand that much of the spending is low priority spending and that it needs to   set some proper priorities.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular budget has been billed as a defence and security budget  so one would expect  the government to show the very best it is going to offer for some time in the area of defence and security. Let us look at what in fact has happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has talked about, and this  a figure put out by the finance minister,   $7.7 billion for defence. I thought that was  in line with what the Canadian Alliance had asked for.  Well it is not because $2.2 billion of it will be  financed through a new tax at airports.  Then there is another $500 million, which brings it down to $5 billion, which is what the finance minister pointed to.  I looked at this figure and thought  it was  kind of in line with what the Canadian Alliance  had pointed out  was needed, but no, that was not the figure  because that $5 billion is not per year, it   is over a five year period.  The government is spending about $1 billion per year on security and defence, which   is less than the money  it gives to CBC.  That is unacceptable. That is in a budget that is designated as a defence and security budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we listen to what the government says, the defence portion of the budget  is about $1.2 billion. In fact a couple of government members threw out the figure of $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion, but $1.2 billion is the figure that most point to.  The fact is that amount is over five years.                          About $600 million of that   is not spent on the military at all.  It is spent on  OCIPEP, the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness, and on other civilian uses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is all sorted  out and the $200 million and some that goes to fund the war in Afghanistan is taken off and the incremental costs of war are taken off, we are down to the bottom line, which is that  the military portion of spending in this budget is less than $.1 billion per year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us  measure the budget against what   the auditor general has called for. Last week the auditor general said that to hold the military at its current level, to provide proper maintenance and operation and to replace the equipment that has to be replaced over the next five years, $2.2 billion has to be spent each year.   Instead, the government has allocated $.1 billion per year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conference of Defence Associations, which is a group of people who care about the military, broke it down to exactly what the military needed and said that it needed  $2.2 billion per year. The government  instead promised  less than 5% of what the auditor general and the Conference of Defence Associations  asked for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area the government has billed as its top priority in the budget,  the defence and security area,   the government has clearly failed. Am I saying that none of the spending is good? No, I am not.  Some of the spending is well targeted and will be extremely helpful but if this is the government's response to the serious concerns of Canadians when it comes to defence and security, but  in particular to the area of defence, then people should start asking themselves why.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may  say just one more thing, the auditor general had it tagged when she was questioning people in the defence department and they said that the government had told them they really did not have to sustain a combat capable military.  That is the bottom line.  The government had told them it did not really expect we would be in dangerous situations so it was cutting back on the combat capability.  That shows a clear failure on the part of the government.  It is not to be trusted with the Canadian military, a sad commentary indeed.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his speech.  He mentioned that his constituents are asking for health care, security, tax cuts and something to make sure we do not have a deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the hon. member missed the speech yesterday because obviously from his comments he did not understand that in this budget, as in   previous budgets  and in this fiscal year, the Government of Canada had to book all  those commitments we made last year for health care.  Therefore,   in fact, we are spending more dollars on health care, we are putting dollars toward security, we are giving Canadians tax cuts this year and we are dealing with the deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   agree with the hon. member that this is in fact what Canadians are saying, not only in his riding but also in my riding. In fact we are funding an extra $23.4 billion in health care.  I think that is important.  Those dollars go to, for instance,  my province of Ontario.  Is the hon. member not aware that this year alone  the Government of Canada gave $2.8 billion extra for health care?  A lot of that is going into my province.   Hopefully the other provinces and the other ministers of finance will match those sorts of increases that the Government of Canada--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the member asked those questions.  First, with regard to his questions on health care it is funny how members of the government keep bringing up again and again promises that were made in previous years.  The fact is that the government now is spending less on health care transfers to the provinces than the government was when the Liberals came into office in 1993.  That is a fact.  It is spending about 14% of the total cost of health care in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When medicare was put in place, the federal government promised to fund it 50% and leave the rest to the provinces and local government.  It now funds only 14%.  How can the member stand up and brag about that?  If it were not for the increases in spending in provinces like Ontario and Alberta, we would not have a health care system that was managing to hang on at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member ought to be ashamed standing up and quoting that as a success of his government when the fact is it is spending less than was  being spent back in 1993 when it came into office.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was not going to rise until   the hon. member kept giving us these factual errors. I think the best place to look is page 114 of the budget document, which shows a chart of the federal transfer payments to the provinces.  It is today at an all time high.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The error  the hon. member makes is that like provincial premiers he fails to include in his transfer numbers the transfer of tax points, which the government made to the provinces some time ago.  If he looks at the chart he will see them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that total federal  transfers to Ontario accounted for 22% of total Ontario expenditures five years ago and now it is 27%. In the case of the province of Quebec it is 30%.  In the case of the maritime provinces it might be 40%.  The fact of the matter,  if we calculate these things right, is that the federal contribution has been on the rise.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have heard the member make this point before.  I would just like him to explain that to Canadians because in fact  the premiers of none of these provinces agree with him.  Is he saying the premiers are all wrong?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members:</b> Yes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Leon Benoit:</b> What is he saying?  Is he saying the people of Canada cannot understand?   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are hollering yes across the way, Mr. Speaker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give the people of this country more credit than that.  They know what is happening with health care funding. I give the premiers of this country a lot more credit than that.  They know what is happening with health care funding in the country and they know that they have been made  to carry the burden more and more.  The federal government has reduced its burden to a point where it is paying less than the government was when the Liberals came into government in 1993 and that is unfair.</p>

As the critic for the solicitor general,  I  was listening particularly for a mention of CSIS, the RCMP and Corrections Canada in the budget.  However,  as a member representing an agricultural riding, I also listened intently to the speech that our finance minister brought forth  as to how it would impact agriculture.  I listened in order to hear to  how it would affect the farm family, how it would affect the agricultural sector.  I listened and I listened and I listened.  There was really no response. It is a sad commentary when the Liberal government has forgotten a very  important sector of our economy,  agriculture, because it affects so many in the west and the regions of Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,  it is a pleasure to be here today. I stood in the House over a month ago debating Bill C-36, the anti-terrorism legislation.  I began that deliberation with a quote from the Toronto <i>Star</i>.  Although I do not have time today to quote the whole article again, I would like to  quote one or two sentences by James Travers from that article:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Now the federal government is desperately trying to respond by bringing forward legislation and introducing security measures that for years have been relegated to the bottom of the agenda. It clearly hopes that the current flurry of activity will somehow mask years of inaction.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to say that this is the same response that we e see in this budget: years of inaction, years of forgetting to bring in a budget and now setting a  course to try to rectify it. What do we see?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses from the Canadian Police Association, representing some 30,000  frontline police personnel in Canada, including RCMP officers, recently appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights regarding Bill C-36. During that presentation the association  stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We have serious reservations...about the capability of Canada's police and law enforcement officials to meet the increased demands of anti-terrorism requirements and sustain important domestic policing and law enforcement responsibilities.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make this abundantly clear. The Canadian Police Association request for more resources, and that is what it was  asking for on that date, was not a knee-jerk reaction to the September 11 tragedy. It was the realization that there was a much larger problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nearly a decade the Canadian Police Association has been requesting more money so frontline officers can effectively do the job, all of the job, not a selective part, not just a small amount, but all of the job. It has repeatedly asked the federal government to move on repairing the gaping holes in Canada's security and enforcement capabilities. Until then, it had not had much luck.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our frontline officers were not successful in beefing up their numbers until the horrific events of September 11 highlighted the fact that Canada is viewed internationally as a point of entry. The events of September 11 made the government and  many people  recognize that Canada was an entry for access to the United States for criminals and terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although we welcome the increased dollars given to the RCMP, as announced in yesterday's budget, I would be remiss if I did not point out that it is perhaps too late and perhaps also too little. The bleeding within our security and intelligence agencies has been occurring for so long that the band-aid approach  we saw yesterday simply  will  not  stop the bleeding.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to RCMP commissioner Zaccardelli's own admission, 2,000 RCMP officers were withdrawn from other enforcement duties to respond to the terrorism crisis. The officers were taken from assignments previously considered to be priorities, such as fighting organized crime, providing frontline policing in their communities and waging the battle against drugs.  Many of those jobs were left unattended as the RCMP scurried to deal with the latest crisis within its current budget constraints. Officers previously assigned to organized crime priorities had to abandon their investigations for anti-terrorist assignments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the CPA, of the complement of approximately 15,000 RCMP  officers, 9,000 are assigned to municipal and provincial contract policing responsibilities.  Of the remaining 6,000, 2,000 of those or one-third, were reassigned to the terrorism file as confirmed by the commissioner of the RCMP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimally, 2,000 additional officers are needed to service the deficiencies that are being felt hardest at the community levels.  Taking the Canadian Police Association's estimates of $125,000 per officer, at minimum  the RCMP should be given $250 million for staff alone.  Yesterday's announcement falls much short of that mark.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the solicitor general's previous funding increases of $250 million, only $9 million was allocated to provide   for staffing in priority areas for the RCMP.  This, again based on the Canadian Police Association's estimates,  equated to only roughly 72 full time RCMP constable positions.  Obviously this was not sufficient to address in any meaningful way the new and existing national policing demands placed on the RCMP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Police Association, therefore, desperately looking for some salvation in this budget, failed.  The government failed and fell short of the CPA's needs and expectations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will turn to the other and equally important component of Canada's security force, that being the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, or CSIS.  Yesterday I had the pleasure, together with our Sub-committee on National Security, to go   to CSIS offices   to be briefed by the director, Mr. Ward Elcock.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the government announced funding for CSIS of $334 million over a six year period.  This amounts to $56 million per year.  The new funding does not, on average, bring CSIS funding to the  level it experienced in 1993. In 1993, funding for CSIS was $244 million.  Under the Liberal government, funding was cut to $197 million in 2001.  Funding cuts were occurring at a time when terrorism throughout the world was becoming more violent, more indiscriminate and more unpredictable.  CSIS, in its 2000 public report, brought that out.  It said:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the service dealing with our national security.</p>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</td>
<td><small>--must rely on risk management, concentrating resources selectively and precisely on the major issues, while assessing new and emerging threats.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the report was stating was that CSIS was seeing acts of terrorism increasing and its budget decreasing. I would like to highlight the fact that this report was released before September 11. Long before the attack on America, CSIS was experiencing staffing shortages and a serious lack of trained analysts.  Between 1992 and 1998 CSIS experienced a cut of 760 personnel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different individuals such as Wesley Wark of the University of Toronto and others brought forward the fact that money was needed but money was not enough. CSIS needed analysts and trained expertise.  This budget does not allow them the resources that they need to bring them back to the 1993 level.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes and enhancements as encouraged by many experts in the security field  will cost much more than what was offered by the government yesterday. We need a stronger financial commitment. We need our federal government to stand and say that it recognizes the fight against terrorism will be a sustained one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, the budget is a start but it is not the whole enchilada. It is not what is needed by  CSIS and the RCMP.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his remarks, particularly about CSIS.  I am one who certainly feels that we have to get behind our national security services, although I have to note that the secret services, the security services, are very much in the business of risk management. That is what one does when in the business of counterespionage and the control of terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member alluded several times to the fact that the provincial police, or the associations representing the provincial police, felt they were underfunded and there should be more funding. Does he not agree, given that the threat from terrorism is a national threat, that each level of government should undertake to support financially the areas under its jurisdiction? Just as there should be more spending or as much spending as possible or practical on CSIS and the RCMP, should we also expect the provinces to fund the municipal police who also have to carry the burden?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question raises a point  I should have brought forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in the last week the police chief from Toronto, Mr. Fantino, came forward and said that $1 million has been spent already, it is  projected that $6 million will be needed and there is no commitment from the federal government. We sat yesterday and listened as the budget came down. We heard things like a $60 million increase for the CBC, yet nothing to the degree of what is needed for some of the security services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that although it  has been deemed as a security budget, there have been seven years of cuts. I should say that incrementally in the last two or three years we have seen very minor increases in budgets, but when a huge amount is cut in the first three or four years and then tidbits are given back incrementally, it is not sufficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding for CSIS in 1993 was $244 million. It fell to $197 million in 2001, a loss of $50 million. There is no way that one budget can bring it all back. When we hear about an increase to CSIS and the RCMP, we applaud that, but the problem is that one budget cannot rectify 10 years of slashing and hacking and cuts to the security of the nation and to the safety and security of every citizen in the country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in the member's speech he expressed his concern about farming. I understand he is from a farming community. I am as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with great interest to the member's leader who spoke earlier today. He talked about going around to the farm kitchens  listening to people who, with tears in their eyes, talked about their financial futures. His answer and demand to the government was to reduce taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that taxes are calculated based upon a person's income. For people who have income, why would a reduction in taxes be an answer from the Leader of the Opposition? How is it possible to speak with two tongues? He is telling me that people are so desperate in the farming community that they have no income but that an answer to that problem would be a reduction in personal income taxes.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there is a disaster in the agricultural sector.  Last night I spent time on the phone with a young lady from north of Drumheller in the Morrin area.  I could feel her  sense of frustration and her emotions as she talked about the commodity prices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about taxes.  In a way the member is right. Tax cuts are right if people have the income.   They would be cuts in  income taxes but there are many other taxes, as the hon. member knows.  For years our party has asked that the four cents excise tax on diesel fuel,  the 10 cents on farm fuel, the taxes on the input costs be cut.  The taxes could be pulled back at a time when agriculture needs the help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no commitment in the budget to the western Canadian farmer.  There is no commitment to agriculture.  There is no commitment at a time when we hoped for one.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance has done a tremendous job analyzing what needs to be done  and moving that agenda forward. I compliment the Government of Canada. Every minister has looked at the budget very carefully   and have made sure that it  answers the questions which  need to be answered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly, we seriously negotiated and worked on an agreement with  people who required help, and I am referring to the provinces and the  health care agreement that was made.  There were very serious  discussions and work  in order to come up with a five year program. That five year program cost the federal government $23 billion more than what it would normally put out. The federal government's commitment to that program was not for one year. It was not a short term one but a long term one. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have heard from the opposition for many years is that we cannot just look at one year ahead, that we have to create stable funding. We hear that we have to  create an agenda which shows everyone the direction in which we are going and which gives them support to institute programs over a longer period of time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the health minister and the finance minister did last year. They put in a program in health care which very carefully put money in the hands of the provinces. This year alone that agreement delivers $2.8 billion more into the health care system. There is no question the federal government this year alone will spend the highest dollars in health care than it has in any previous year. Some $35 billion will be transferred in health care and CHST payments to the provinces  this year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is critical  when we look at a program or a problem that we have the  statistics and information to back that agenda.   Roy Romanow is looking at the health care system across the country. The federal government as well as the provinces know that alterations and changes are required to the health care system. To be responsible and move that agenda forward,  we funded a program for a five year period. We  sent a task force out to discover what further needed to be done in order to enhance health care in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is  no question that is a very responsible agenda to move on. It is one that will pay off for Canadians not only today but in the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a misrepresentation in my opinion if it is said that there are  no new dollars in health care. We are adding $2.8 billion this year alone to health care in the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes in the   debates and discussions, there are very different viewpoints of what is happening. Those have to be pointed out here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, when it is said there are no tax cuts, I recall the largest tax cut ever created over a five year period. It was not just for  last year, but for last year, this year and  the next three years. A five year period of time has been set for tax cuts.  Canadians will receive the benefit of those tax cuts over that five year period. To suggest that this year there are no tax cuts  is wrong. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to keep things in perspective. A year ago no one would have ever suggested that Canada needed a budget for terrorism, a budget for safety, or a budget for air transportation.  Those are new  because of  what happened on September 11.</p>


	<A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result the minister and the government  responded strongly.  They looked at police and military services and at the requirements at the border, realizing that we must have a seamless border allowing goods to flow back and forth between Canada and the United States in an appropriate and proper way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister and the government   looked at our immigration policy and responded by making certain that the safety of the nation was put  in place.  At the same time they took into account the perspective that we must not only  be safe but our neighbours must see that we are moving in the strongest way toward making this nation safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extremely important that  trade  from Canada flows to and from the United States in a seamless fashion and flows well.  If we do not appear to be in that state, which works hand in hand with our American counterparts and delivers goods and people safely,  then we will have major business problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States uses more products manufactured in Canada on a daily basis than Canadians  do.   We sell most of our resources to the United States. That partnership is extremely important to both countries. There is about $2 billion of goods flowing back and forth between Canada and the United States every day.  We know how significant that is to the Canadian economy.  We must reinforce that and make it  our chief priority.  The government has taken into account that as a secure nation we stand to lose what we have  in the commerce that goes on in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A House of Commons task force has gone across the country looking at the problems and has   presented  reports  to the government.  The  government has reacted to those reports in a  stern and careful way.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensions to agreements with the American government have been carried out. The American ambassador, trade representatives and the U.S. president  have all met with their respective counterparts   making certain that questions are answered.  This goes back to the whole idea of security and moving forward with the budget.  There is no question that has to be a chief priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to  talk about economics too.  We have low  interest rates.  Infrastructure programming would add $2 billion to the economy.  We would take steps to make sure that work programs  go forward. We know that on a financial basis workers would be given opportunities in this slower time and people would be able to buy goods and services they would otherwise not buy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  $100 billion tax cuts would help the average person put more dollars in his or her pocket. The initiatives  made in the budget and in the previous year would come together to ensure that Canada would be the safest nation in the world, not only physically and financially but also economically.  That is what this is all about.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in my view government is no more than  people and their resources.  I have seen signs in the last 10 years that are disturbing for our country. We must compare ourselves to the U.S.  Canada has had a huge decline in productivity and disposable income.  Regional disparity has become worse, not better. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is  suffering from a brain drain to the U.S. of our best and brightest in  frightening numbers.  The government subsidizes and regulates certain sectors of the economy.   Air Canada is one example of these sectors and the Liberal way of doing things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these productivity trends and the decline in our standard of living continue,   where are we heading? Are we heading toward a 45 cent or 48 cent dollar?  Are we heading toward a third rate economy?  What happens to government programs when the economy hits those sorts of levels?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's question.  It is important to realize that Canada stands very well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  talk to a lot of industry people.  I  talk to leaders at Ford, Chrysler and  General Motors.  They tell me  that the greatest opportunity they have is in Canada.  Our low interest rates provide good job opportunities.  Our health care system makes Canada an excellent place to be.  The productivity of our workers in their plants is excellent.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question when we look at what is happening in the workplace in Canada that our workers are the best.  I would argue that with anyone in the House. Our interest rates and  production quotas  from Canada to the United States make those companies want to exist here.  The only  major barrier is access to a seamless border.  We must ensure we maintain a seamless border.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in previous budgets there used to be employment figures and unemployment rate projections.  They have not appeared in any of the budgets since 1996.  Why have those figures been removed?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 9 of “The Budget Speech 2001” it says that the premise of the budget is to keep terrorists out.  I have been on the phone most of the day with coast guard officials on both coasts.  They said that the money allocated to the coast guard in the budget over a five year period would not stop  terrorists from floating into Canada on all three of our coasts and doing us harm.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need enhanced radar screens,  coastal surveillance and flight patrols to keep terrorists out. Why has the budget not addressed those needs?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment.  I do not know what terrorists are floating into Canada today.  I do not know that anyone in the House knows of terrorists floating into Canada. The budget would fund technological equipment to be used at our borders to secure and check passengers.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an opportunity to look at what was happening in the port of Vancouver.  Customs officials informed us  what kind of equipment they needed.  There were some positive vibes about the possibility of having radar equipment or other technology  they could use to identify containers coming into the country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague.  I have a short question for him with respect to agriculture and the rural areas in the budget. In my view the rural areas have benefited from the research  and  the communications portions of the budget.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of the minister of agriculture regarding sustainable agriculture is mentioned.  Would the member comment on the fact that a small business with a $250,000 bank loan, which would often be a farm,  would save $9,000 this year  because of the strong economy and reduced interest rates?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will have great difficulty following my colleague.  I  should have offered  him my 10 minutes as he was doing such a great job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the budget.  It is an important one as we all know.  I congratulate the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister for having the foresight and the vision to recognize some of the issues and concerns that we have all been talking about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have managed to get a balanced budget in spite of the pressures of September 11.  This is the fifth time in 50 years that we have been able to have a balanced budget. That is very significant and it is something that we should be proud of as Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is the only G-7 country that has managed to balance its books this year.  That is a  strong indication, contrary to what some of my colleagues across the Chamber may say.  The government is fiscally responsible and is doing a good job of managing its books.  We are constantly  looking for better ways to do everything. That is a compliment to the team we have over here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are delivering a proportionately larger economic stimulus package than the United States. We must always keep in perspective that we are not as big as the United States. We need to applaud and be  proud when we can put together a package that would stimulate the economy more than what the U.S.  is doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will concentrate on the urban regions as chair of the Prime Minister's task force on urban regions.  I will share what we have been hearing across the country.   First, I  congratulate my colleagues who sit on the caucus task force with me on the great job they have been doing over the last six months as we toured the country, listened to hundreds of people and met with a variety of organizations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  met  about 270 organizations  and talked with people in  large urban regions.  We  identified   issues,   problems  and   the role  of the federal government when it came to trying to find solutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things they wanted to see  was leadership from the federal government. They felt frustrated with the current system.  They expect the federal government to show leadership on many of these issues and to be the one to call the parties to the table to  negotiate a solution to any ongoing problem.  They did not want to be left alone out there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of public transportation continued to be raised. Should we be in public transit?  It was not a role the federal government  played previously.  It has  traditionally been a provincial responsibility.  It was one of the questions that needed to be answered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People were looking to  governments and their partners for solutions to  transportation  gridlock in our large cities.  Some people were taking an hour or an hour and a half to get home at night.  We need to look at air quality and the whole deterioration in the quality of life that people are feeling in some of these large urban regions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of keeping not only goods moving but keeping people moving in our cities,   across our highways and  our roads is very important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing was raised in every urban region we visited.  I congratulate the minister for being able to put together a package that was acceptable to most of the provinces.  I  hope Ontario will come to the table to help meet the  important need that we all recognize.  People have a need for housing so that their families  can be stable and their children can grow up in a safe, clean environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brownfields issue was  mentioned in the budget. I am  pleased with that because  there is an enormous problem in that regard. It gives us an opportunity to deal with the issue of urban sprawl by taking some of those lands and using them for everything from recreation to housing.  It would help to decrease some of the urban sprawl.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are issues in and around our aboriginal communities.  We are looking at  solutions  to help them up and not necessarily to  help them  stay where they are.They want empowerment and they are looking to us to assist them in the aboriginal communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air  and water quality are big issues that we  heard a lot about.  There was also the issue of keeping Canadians safe with a good quality of life in  cities  throughout our country.</p>


	<A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task force communicated all of these issues to the Minister of Finance. I must say I was very pleased, as were my colleagues on the task force, that these issues were touched on and addressed in the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also acknowledge the work that the FCM has been doing with us in making sure that the urban region agenda is on the federal highlights so that we can find answers to some of these problems. Certainly the budget recognized the important role of our urban regions and the economic and social fabric of the country. It is critical that it do well so that we will all do well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so doing, the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister have put together a brand new program with a $2 billion strategic infrastructure foundation. We will have an opportunity to work with private partners on large urban projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funding of subways and a variety of light rail transit systems and so on in our cities  are big ticket items. The cities cannot do it on their own. They need senior levels or other levels of government to assist them in achieving their goals. That is important. We all recognize the importance of having a solid infrastructure in our cities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was  talk about  highways,  overpasses, bridges and so on in Montreal. All of that is critical to the movement of goods and people. Again, this new $2 billion strategic infrastructure foundation will begin to answer some of those problems we have to deal with. Another $600 million was put into highway infrastructure which will help with the highway problems and  the pressures of moving people and goods.  People will not be wasting their time sitting in traffic jams not being able to move their goods and deciding that they will not stay in business here but  will go elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubling of the green municipal enabling fund and the green municipal investment fund are  initiatives of the government with the FCM. The FCM has   been extremely successful in coming up with innovative solutions to problems and assisting our large urban regions. We all recognize that the urban regions are the crucial drivers of our economy and are critical for our success in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus on security also speaks to this issue. If our borders are not secure and our trucks cannot get through in a timely way, our economy will be choked. The efficient movement of goods is crucial to the success of our regions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the   broadband  investment  to connect Canadians. We are connecting all Canadians. We were the first country to connect all of our schools and libraries through the Internet. Those are very important initiatives.  I am glad  more money is being put into it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is support for the police. There is a fair amount of money in the budget for CSIS and the RCMP so that they can have more integration and more co-ordination of all of the services  we are dealing with. That continues on and  we are continuing to put money into those areas. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are good investments. They will allow our country to grow. They will get us through the difficult times ahead. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well we are  looking at how we  control our budget with the pressures we will be facing and pay down the  debt.  We do not want to leave   our children with an enormous debt that they have to carry. We are building a nation that is prosperous for all of us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An investment of another $200 million has gone into universities, as well as the additional money for CIHR and research. The health committee  has been talking a lot about research, the need to do stem cell research and so on. All of the money that we are putting into research will hopefully find the solutions to some of the major diseases that  affect thousands of people in Canada today. Some $25  million  has gone toward the issue  of fetal alcohol syndrome, which affects a lot of our children, especially in the aboriginal community. That is another avenue we are looking at. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear lots of rhetoric from the other side. That is  the way  the game  goes on. We are supposed to be debating issues, but a lot of it is rhetoric. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good budget. It provides money for the future and money to grow.  It is good for our economy and good for Canada. I congratulate everyone involved. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would not call our debates here a game. I think they are very important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague across the way mentioned infrastructure quite extensively within her comments. We have a situation where the federal government imposes a fuel tax on individuals who drive. Very little of those fuel taxes go back into the infrastructure programs for which they could be used, particularly in my home province of British Columbia. Hundreds of millions of dollars are wrung out of individuals within that province. Less than 4% of that comes back to the province in any infrastructure program. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the hon. member a question about the distribution of the infrastructure programs. Does she agree that it is a good thing to take hundreds of millions of dollars out of one region and not put any of the money back into the region from which it has been taxed?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-107673"></A><a HREF="#Int-107675"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107671"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Judy Sgro: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the issue of fuel taxes is something we talked a lot about when doing our work with the urban regions.  People have been pointing out that issue. They think that  getting four cents of the fuel tax would be very helpful. If we transfer $100 million but  then decide to only transfer $60 million and give back four  cents on the fuel tax, at the end of the day I am not sure that the province is  that much farther ahead.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is to  keep the flexibility in government.  When we see the need,  the government can shift the money around as the need arises.  To recognize and deal with all the pressures needs government flexibility.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-107675"></A><a HREF="#Int-107677"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107673"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the problem with the infrastructure foundation is that it is not answerable to parliament.  A committee of people will be picked by the Liberals. Who will decide what area of the country gets that infrastructure funding? It is another display of the Liberals ignoring parliament.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general said that she had great concerns about these foundations and what did the Liberals do?  They brought in another one. I would like the hon. member's comments on that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to put on the record that the cat is out of the bag. The minister  has told us that the first Sea King replacements should arrive by the end of 2005.  The budget clearly indicates that is not going to happen. We have been saying all along that these replacements will be in 2007-08 and that is the fact of the matter, but that    is just for the record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the member, why is the government ignoring the aspects of parliament and building a foundation to allocate resources in terms of infrastructure?  Why should it not be from parliament?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the transport committee at one point in its deliberations had recommended that it  was a good idea to create the foundation.  The big advantage of creating the foundation is that it will lever other money. It is hoped that the  $2 billion  we are putting place  very quickly could end up being $4 billion, $6 billion or $8 billion that could be used to improve the infrastructure.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is correct that many groups  are pleading with the government for infrastructure, for sewage upgrading, water upgrading, public transit, housing.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw to the member's attention that there was  a previous Liberal task force on housing. It was chaired by the now finance minister when  in opposition in 1990.  In the report he pointed out the great need for housing. We have seen no action on that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, one thing which gave me great happiness yesterday was when I   turned to page 125 of the budget.  It talks about a brand new program of $2 billion as one example.  It talks about the issue of brown fields. These were recommendations that the task force   made to the Minister of Finance.  They were specifically in a budget far ahead of the time  I would have expected them to be there.  It is certainly clear to me that the government is listening and responding.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-107683"></A><a HREF="#Int-107685"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107681"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased  to speak on behalf of the New Democratic Party in response to the budget. I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Palliser.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget  is the most political tool the government has. There are a lot of myths about federal budgets mostly coming from a very right wing agenda.  One of the myths is that budgets are bound by economic rules,  that there are things we cannot do, that we have to pay down the deficit or the debt, or that it is about tax breaks. All these myths  revolve around a budget.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact a budget is the most political vehicle  any government has to make very real choices about who the winners are and who the losers are. That is the perspective with which we have to look at the budget  and respond to what we heard yesterday from the finance minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at the  budget there is no conclusion one can come to except that it is a massive security budget. While Canadians have very serious concerns around security issues, we have to ask  whether or not the $7.7 billion being directed toward security measures  is going to provide the kind of help, relief and support that ordinary Canadians and average families across the country need. I have some very serious questions about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member across the way said a few moments ago that the budget was about facilitating economic security, but  the question is, economic security for whom? Clearly the government's agenda is to continue along a path of providing economic security for huge corporations. Trade is important but we also have to place on the table the economic security of the most vulnerable in our society, poor Canadians who do not have jobs, or the two out of three unemployed workers who have paid into EI but are no longer eligible for EI. Their economic security issues are just as important as the economic security issues of trucking corporations or large trade organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the constituents whom I represent in my community of East Vancouver, the budget has created a greater number of people who feel that they are at the short end of the stick. Even the <i>Globe and Mail</i> in reporting on the budget reaction has characterized it as last year's pledges barely fulfilled. Even those pledges were so incredibly minimal in terms of grappling with the very real issues facing Canadians that it is really quite pathetic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be very critical about the budget that was put forward. We have to recognize the reality in the country that the gap between very wealthy people and very poor people  has surged to a 25 year high. In some of the European social democratic countries, the real measure of health and security is a decreasing gap between wealthy people and poor people. In our country that gap is widening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettable that just a few days ago the co-ordinator of Campaign 2000, Laurel Rothman, remarked “When we look at the latest figures on child poverty, the alarm bells should start ringing”. I would agree with her. She pointed out that governments had the option in the boom years of investing in a long term vision for children but instead, the government chose to cut taxes and dismantle social services. She said “The average family on welfare now receives 12% less than it would have several years ago”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went  on to point out, and this has been reinforced by the Canadian Labour Congress,   that currently two out of three unemployed workers who have paid premiums cannot qualify for benefits while the insurance program scores an $8 billion a year so-called surplus.</p>


	<A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  has to be considered one of the biggest rip-offs in the country.  Working people are  being robbed of their right to use the insurance they paid into when they face hard times or unemployment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than easing the eligibility rules, doing away with the waiting period and ensuring that benefits are increased so that people have  a decent income so they do not have to live below the poverty line, what did the government do? It made a few minor adjustments in terms of the apprenticeship program for people who go off the job and back into the classroom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of dealing with the fundamental inequities, inequalities and discrimination in this program, the government has again failed to hear what the labour movement, unions and working people have said. That is a real disgrace.  It is a real indictment on this budget.  On the one hand, the finance minister speaks quite handily about how this is a big security budget and it will help Canadians.  On the other hand, the federal government has met the absolute bare minimum in pledges that it has put forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday in the House I raised the issue of students who were struggling with increasing debt loads and finding it more and more difficult to pay tuition fees as fees continued to rise and their debt load continued to go up. I asked the minister responsible for the Canada student loan program how she could defend years of government policies that prompted Statistics Canada to produce a report which made it clear that students who came from affluent families were two and a half times more likely to go to university than a student from a low income family. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's reply to that was very typical of the kinds of responses we have heard from the government.  She said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Our record is clear.  We know that higher education is incredibly important to the future of all Canadians and we want to be there to help them in this regard.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the record of what the   government has done to help students in terms of financial accessibility, it  is quite appalling.  There was nothing in yesterday's budget that would improve the accessibility, particularly for low income students, so that kind of report from Statistics Canada would become  something of the past and a piece of history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to turn my comments to the situation facing people who are in great need of affordable housing.  In September I travelled across the country to seven different communities, mostly urban environments but I also went to Iqaluit.  I spoke with housing activists to find out whether they believed  the initiatives that the government had undertaken since 1998 had impacted on the increasing homelessness in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was told was  no surprise.  It is something that should be very evident to people in local communities.  They told me that not only was homelessness on the rise, but  we had a situation where over 800,000 Canadian households were paying more than 50% of their income on rent and  an estimated quarter of a million Canadians were homeless.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of housing and the need for a fully funded national housing program is something the government has absolutely ignored.  We heard the finance minister speak about the framework agreement.  I want to be very clear.  The agreement that the government has come to is only one-tenth of the 1% solution for which we have been fighting. We may see the provision of about 5,400 units per year. We  need closer to 20,000 or 30,000 units. The $136 million a year for five years, which was promised so many times and which was re-announced  in yesterday's budget, does not even come close to meeting the huge gap that exists for  people who are fighting for affordable housing.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget is about choices.  The finance minister has chosen to ignore the people who are most at risk; aboriginal people,  poor people,  kids who are living in poverty and  families who are looking for housing.  He has chosen to ignore the very real economic security issues facing those families. However I am proud to say that we in the New Democratic Party do not.  We choose to make that the priority.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, unless I am completely wrong, I always understood housing and social services to be constitutionally entirely a provincial responsibility.  In fact, the provinces have retreated on funding in these areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this budget, at a time of recession, we see $600 million committed by the federal government to low income housing.  Surely the member will agree that this is something that the federal government is not obligated to do.   It is something that is very fine that it is doing.  Surely her anger about social housing should be directed at the provinces, not at the federal government. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member says that he could be wrong, and indeed he is. Clearly, the record shows that the reason we have a retreat from the provinces in the provision of social housing, for example in Ontario which has a terrible record on housing, is because the federal government started the whole retreat back in 1993.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the finance minister, who was previously the chair of the Liberal task force on housing, issued a report to the Conservative government of the day  pointing out that it was reprehensible in a society as wealthy as Canada that we did not have an adequate national housing program.  So what did he do when he became the finance minister?  He axed the whole program.  That was his solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get the facts correct and realize that the reason that we have homelessness today is not because of some individual failing among Canadians. It is a failure of public policies that began in this place with a Liberal government.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague from British Columbia on her speech in the House.  She has pointed out yet another Olympian style backflip that was performed by members of the government on any number of issues, including the GST.  I note that this is the seventh consecutive budget where the government has failed to do good on a promise to repeal  the GST.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More to the point, her commentary dealt with the issue of education as well. The hon. member opposite who is chortling would point to that as a provincial jurisdiction, as well.   However surely there is ample evidence in the House of students, pages who are here struggling under student debt, who will leave their institution of higher learning with the equivalent of a mortgage and no house to go to. This again is an issue that has been drastically underfunded and ignored by successive budgets that we have seen in this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue with respect to the coast guard has also been pointed out by members of the House. The other issue is agriculture, which was also ignored.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to put a question to the member just so the record is clear with respect to her party and her leader's position with respect to military funding.  This is an issue where many  analysts,  members of the opposition and members of the government have commented that this budget does not come up to par.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general called for a $1.3 billion injection of cash to bring our military back to competitiveness and to procurement readiness.  We know the helicopter issue is still being kicked around like a political football to avoid buying the same helicopters that were cancelled.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it now the NDP's position that we should be following the advice of the auditor general and increasing military spending over the next number of years so that our armed forces can keep their NATO and UN commitments?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised some very good issues.  I would agree  that  reality is that most students graduate into poverty and end up going through life with a huge student debt that becomes more and more difficult to pay off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I will answer his question on military spending.  He has probably heard from members of the New Democratic Party that we believe very strongly that it is important to support our Canadian armed forces, particularly their equipment needs and the conditions under which they operate and live. I know  my colleague who is our critic in that area has been very clear about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize that while we support that, we are also very aware of the fact that there are millions of other Canadians who will go without because of the emphasis  the government has placed on law enforcement and law enforcement agencies, on funding to CSIS and on other security measures.  This is taking away from Canadians who are most at risk.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the 2001 budget debate.  I probably should be talking about the many deficiencies in the budget, but that has been amply demonstrated by a number of opposition members, especially the member for Halifax, the member for  Regina--Qu'Appelle and  my colleague from Vancouver East.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would  like to spend my  few minutes talking about something that has not been dealt with a lot in the debate and that is what I perceive to be the Americanization of not only the country but the budget.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Liberal members opposite have said that the budget has been reassuring to Canadians.  I submit that if that has been the case, it has   been only accidental.  This budget had one purpose and one purpose only and that was to satisfy the Bush administration in Washington.  It is sad and pathetic but I am not surprised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did surprise me a little was to read in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> today that the minister told reporters  he had briefed his U.S. counterpart, treasury secretary Paul O'Neill,  on the budget and had received a thumbs up.  Some of us thought that there was secrecy in budgets and that we did not release them before they were released here.   Apparently not because   Washington was called to ensure that everything was okay with Mr. O'Neill, Mr. Bush and the rest before the government went any further.  Does anyone believe that Tom Ridge, the home security minister in the United States, would have been here today if it had not been a very positive budget from Washington's viewpoint?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals said that they went coast to coast and listened clearly to what Canadians  said.  They may have listened to Canadians, but the only thing they were really listening to were the signals from Washington.  If this was not a budget that was written by the Bush administration, it was certainly a budget that was written for the Bush administration.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before yesterday we were told in the House repeatedly that the terrorists did not come through Canada to get to the United States three months ago today.  In fact John Ashcroft at one point was forced to reverse his remarks and say that.  I believe that,  but after the pathetic budget, which was delivered yesterday, and the pandering that has gone on here to the Americans, I am beginning to have second thoughts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard all fall from ministers like the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Transport that all was well and they could carry out their duties and responsibilities with the legislation and the resources available to them.  I would like to read into the record a couple of those references.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 30 the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, while  talking about Bill C-11, said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It gives us the ability to streamline our procedures, so that those who are in genuine need of our protection will be welcomed in Canada more quickly and those who are not in need of protection will be able to be removed more quickly.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 19 she  referred to Mr. Zaccardelli, the commissioner of the RCMP.  She said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Yesterday the commissioner said that he totally disagrees with the notion that we are a safe haven.  He said we should eliminate that word from our vocabulary...</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we have eliminated that word from our vocabulary or not and whether the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration felt she needed more resources, she got it yesterday.  She got $1 billion to ward off illegal immigrants, something she said was well in hand prior to yesterday's budget.  CSIS got $334 million dollars, the largest increase in the history of the intelligence security.  It is being described in the media as a huge Christmas present.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money was allocated for overseas immigration officers and $567 million was allocated for the RCMP.  What do we receive for this money?  When we go out on Parliament Hill  we have these ludicrous security checks, costing millions of dollars and benefiting this country not one drop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even worse when we look back at what the Minister of Transport had to say on the subject of air marshals.  I would like to go through this.  On the first day back in the House on September 17, the Minister of Transport said:</p>


	<A NAME="T1850"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1850"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1850)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>To deploy armed air marshals on flights is a radical suggestion. It poses severe logistical and financial implications and it is not the direction in which we are moving. We are committed to providing enhanced security on the ground, so we will not need air marshals.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gets better. Ten days later, on September 26, the Minister of Transport said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The United States is taking a certain measure of action.  Having armed personnel on planes, whether they are pilots or air marshals, is not a road we will go down.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on October 5, he said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We want to ensure that security measures are in place at airports to prevent the need for putting armed personnel on planes which in itself creates some degree of danger and is not endorsed, certainly not at this point, by the pilot unions in this country. In fact, Mr. Bush has not even agreed to the arming of cockpit personnel on planes.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Bush has now agreed to the arming of cockpit personnel on planes and so have we. Never mind what the Minister of Transport said on those three occasions. He is getting armed marshals whether or not he wants them. He is getting $2.2 billion over five years being paid for by the travelling public. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b>  He got his marching orders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor:</b> He got his marching orders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister was talking today about how cockpit doors are now locked. I hope he gets more respect from his departmental officials than he does from  pilots and air flight attendants.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as yesterday while I was travelling here the cockpit door was wide open for a considerable part of the flight. The crew was relaxed and chatting merrily. The passengers were not particularly nervous or upset. They were going about their daily business. The notion of  cockpit doors being locked and guarded is very much in his imagination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $7.7 billion  for security to placate the giant to the south. Canadians know the reason why. The government and its predecessor have plunged headlong into a free trade agreement with the Americans. We now have something in the neighbourhood of 85% of our exports heading south. If we do not play ball, it is very simple: there is a chill at the border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Chatham--Kent Essex did not say it that way but that is the essence of his message. We are now into just in time delivery. If we do not play ball, the perishable goods at the border will spoil.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were told when we were young people not to put all our eggs in one basket. We were cautioned against it by parents and others. The chickens have come to roost because that is where we are at today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government likes to pretend that it is standing up for Canada. In reality it has rolled over. It does not do anything that could possibly be construed as offending our dear friends to the south. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget marks a very sad time for a middle power that once upon a time had some intestinal fortitude and was able to stand on its own two feet. We have been reduced, sadly, to a whimpering, nervous Nellie whose only concern is whether or not  the Americans will like it and like us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $7.7 billion is a great waste of money. It will not be well spent. It is money that could and should go to help workers, to help farmers and to help people who live in abject poverty or people who live without shelter. There is no money, for instance, for things like the environment. Instead we get billions spent on very questionable, dubious expenditures that will not in the final analysis do anything at all to develop the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my colleagues have said that there is no money for health care in the budget. I say they are wrong. I say that yesterday's budget was a designer drug. It was a muscle relaxant for  Bush, Ashcroft and Ridge.  That is a shame on Canada and it is especially a shame for the government over there.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  I am concerned by the member's lack of  concern about the security of the country. Having said that, I wonder what he thinks about the fact that  if we fly into any airport in this country we have to go through severe scrutiny; if we drive, as he referred to, we have to line up at the border; but if we have anything from a dory to an ocean liner we can land practically anywhere in the country and nobody knows we are coming unless we call ahead for reservations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radar sites in many parts of our country are no longer serviced. The cutbacks to the coast guard have been so severe that they cannot service the sites unless the sites go down. As many radar sites are in remote areas, in the event of bad weather, high winds or whatever, it is sometimes days or weeks before the sites are serviced. How secure do these things make the member feel in relation to the remarks he has made?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I should observe that coming from a landlocked province I do not know the situation on the coast nearly as well as my colleague from Newfoundland and Labrador does. I believe what he is saying is that approximately 85% of our coastline is unprotected and, as he correctly points out, anybody travelling on a dory could get here.  We have said for many years that Canada needs to do a much better job of protecting our coastlines. There is no question about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a  concern I have with regard to airport security. Passengers want to make sure that they, their luggage and fellow passengers are being screened, but after that  I do not believe there is a great demand for  the armed marshals we are now getting, for example, whether we want them or not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the member's question  with regard to  the coast guard and security, I take his  point.  I certainly concur with him, and I think our party does as well, that more needs to be done in this area.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will afford some time for my Bluenose colleague from Nova Scotia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very encouraged to hear the position set out by my colleague from the NDP with respect to the lack of funding and the lack of attention given to coastal security.  We have the deployment of navy ships  to the gulf now and there is a lack of funding for traditional coast guard operations, including navigational equipment and person power, much of which has been privatized,  with many of those responsibilities being contracted out.  I know that in the county of Guysborough in particular more cuts are pending, even in light of and in the face of the existing increased security threat.  As my colleague from Newfoundland and Labrador suggested, our coastal borders and our security on the water are virtually undefended at this time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the hon. member is with regard to the growing surplus in the EI fund.  The NDP in particular has been very quick to point out that this money has been absconded with and used for a cause for which it was never intended.  It is not even available to many workers.  With pending layoffs at Trenton Steel fabrication in Pictou county, this is of great concern.  What sorts of parameters should be put on the use of that money in terms of how it is available to workers?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough.  On the matter of the employment insurance fund, I  take the position, and I think my party does as well, that this is not money that belongs to the treasury, that should go into general revenue.  After all, it is money that has been contributed by employers and employees and it should be there for their protection.  If times are good and unemployment levels are low, then payroll taxes should  be reduced.  When things are not so good, they  go up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the member said, what is happening at the moment is that the government has absconded with about $40 billion and counting from the employment insurance fund.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my question this evening follows my question on November 30 to the government asking it to commit to fighting the infestation of  mountain pine beetle that is devastating the pine forests in central British Columbia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This threat is of deep concern to all citizens of northern and central British Columbia and, as a result, representations on this have been made by the members for Prince George--Peace River and Prince George--Bulkley Valley as well as myself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This infestation may be the largest epidemic of its kind in Canadian history.  The pine beetle has infested 5.7 million hectares of working forest, which is about twice the size of Vancouver Island.  The pine beetle and U.S. softwood lumber duties are threatening to kill thousands of jobs and entire communities in B.C.'s interior. The government's lack of response to the provincial plan to eradicate the beetles indicates once again that the Liberals do not care about British Columbia.  This is not an Ontario ice storm and it is not a Quebec flood, but the government will care when billions of dollars of tax revenue from B.C. stop flowing to Ottawa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Columbia government needs about $60 million a year over 10 years to fight this enormous problem of the pine beetle.  Everyone in British Columbia is waiting with great impatience for the reply from the foot dragging Liberal Minister of Natural Resources and the senior Liberal cabinet minister for B.C., who have been thoroughly briefed on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his initial response to me on November 30, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources tried to have us believe that the only responsibility of the Government of Canada in fighting the mountain pine beetle infestation is to deliver the science. However, the government has a clear responsibility for infested federal lands, like the Riske Creek military reserve. From this federal land those beetles are spilling out into provincial forests and nothing is being done to control them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the government recognize its obligation to fight the infestation on its own lands?  I hope the response from the government this evening addresses that responsibility.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted in the auditor general's report that the Department of National Defence contributed $2 million to an urban park.  Why is there no money to be put into this military reserve where the federal government has a clear responsibility to an urgent need?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's response to other questions concerning the issue is  “Oh, well, we're working with the province”.  That is an obfuscation and an attempt to sidestep the matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The B.C. government has a plan to fight the beetle infestation.  It needs a commitment from this government, but there was nothing about it in last night's budget.  The $60 million of new money budgeted to the CBC would be all that is needed this year from the federal government to assist B.C.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worst of all, the most recent reply from the government of which I am aware is the reply to the hon. member for Prince George--Peace River who wrote to the Minister of Natural Resources on November 6. He received a response that again did not answer this question: What resources will the government commit to eradicate the pine beetle epidemic in B.C.'s pine forests? We are talking also about federal crown lands.  The government is not even prepared to deal with the problem on the land it controls.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago, ministers of the crown in British Columbia approached me to help get the government's attention on the issue.  This is not a new problem.   As I said earlier, years ago I pressed the government to deal with the fir bark beetle also spilling out of that same Riske Creek military reserve west of Williams Lake.  Nothing, but nothing, was done then either.You should see the devastation there now, Mr. Speaker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are forests in British Columbia for which  the government has a constitutional responsibility.  These forests are being faced with a devastating infestation that is increasing the amount of damaged wood, lost income and cleanup costs for the province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the commitment of the government to British Columbia to fight the mountain pine beetle infestation, first on its own federal lands and then in assisting the province of B.C. with this present economic and environmental crisis?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am subbing for my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources.  I am not privy to all the knowledge of my hon. friend across the aisle. However I will deliver the answer as I have it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forest management is under the jurisdiction of the province. In B.C., Natural Resources Canada collaborates with Parks Canada, the Department of National Defence and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on aerial surveys to monitor mountain pine beetle outbreaks on federal lands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has been working closely with the B.C. forest industry and with the B.C. government to address the issue of the mountain pine beetle.   In its strategic action plan British Columbia is determining how to manage the mountain pine beetle infestation.  The federal government will co-operate, where appropriate, on supportive research and collaborative remedial strategies for federal lands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his question of November 30 the hon. member made reference to Riske Creek. He also referred to it tonight.  It is located on the Chilcotin military reserve of the Department of National Defence.  I am sure he knows that because I would guess it is in his riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out that the Natural Resources Canada forestry centre in Victoria has a five year memorandum of understanding with DND to provide advice and services regarding forest management on all defence properties within British Columbia, with the exception of the Chilcotin military reserve. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DND specifically excluded this property from the memorandum of understanding because it has an agreement with the B.C. ministry of forests for forest protection and timber management which has been in place since June 1992.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1995 Natural Resources Canada scientists identified the beginning of the mountain pine beetle outbreak in the central part of the province and alerted the B.C. government.  Since then NRCan  conducted annual beetle surveys of the Chilcotin military reserve. These surveys were used to prepare reports on the status and trends of the infestation, copies of which were provided to DND and the B.C. ministry of forests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall 2000 NRCan scientists presented workshops on the mountain pine beetle in four communities in B.C., including one in Williams Lake which is adjacent to the military reserve.  Landowners and representatives from industry, the B.C. government and first nations were invited to attend.  Information was provided on the biology, research and management tools available to assist in dealing with the outbreak.  Options to address the infestation were discussed and made available to the participants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current outbreak of the mountain pine beetle did not originate from any one spot.  Forest health maps from 1990 to 1996 indicate that the beetle population was on the increase throughout central B.C. regardless of jurisdiction. The present outbreak is a result of these smaller populations increasing, coalescing and then spreading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also point out that a map made from aerial surveys clearly indicates the centre of the outbreak is located several hundred kilometres northwest of Riske Creek.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal support for the mountain pine beetle epidemic has provided the research on understanding and predicting beetle outbreaks, developing tools to incorporate predictive  capacity into higher level planning, understanding the impacts of a variable climate on the beetle and controlling the beetle through stand management activities.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the facts as I understand them do not entirely square with the comments of the hon. parliamentary secretary. For example, the Department of National Defence said that  it accepted responsibility for the fir bark beetle infestation when I made a representation to it shortly after I was elected in 1993. Whatever happened, I am not in a position to say,  the plans that it had to deal with that infestation never took place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strikes me is  the amazing similarities between what happened with the fir bark beetle and with the mountain pine beetle.  When I speak to DND it hardly knows what is going on and it does not seem to care to find out. I have great difficulty accepting the parliamentary secretary's response.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-107718"></A><a HREF="#Int-107720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-107716"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Finlay: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the department is committed to working with other landowners to help mitigate the problem. Any formal proposal by the B.C. government for federal assistance will be considered within the context of the federal mandate. Support and expertise are already being offered, as well as  the availability of funds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may surprise the hon. member to know that to date the department has not received any formal request for funding or for co-operative planning to solve the problem. It would be happy to hear from my hon. colleague or the B.C. ministry of forests.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, last September I asked the Minister of Natural Resources why provincial and federal energy and environment ministers had not at that time reached  an agreement on the ratification of the Kyoto protocol on climate change. I was told by the minister that the ministers were able to report on measures that would reach only about half of Canada's Kyoto targets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, however,  important international negotiations on climate change have taken place. In early November a landmark agreement was reached by representatives of nearly 180 countries at the seventh conference of the United Nations climate change convention in Marrakesh. The net result is that the rules for  implementation of the Kyoto protocol are now finalized and the protocol will come into force after 55 countries representing at least 55% of industrial countries' emissions have ratified it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Canada, the statements by the federal Minister of the Environment and Minister of Natural Resources still make ratification of the Kyoto protocol conditional on an agreement with the provinces. Federal and provincial energy and environment ministers plan to meet next year. Progress is slow given the fact that Canada signed the Kyoto agreement in December 1997. In addition, the uncertainty of the government's commitment to ratification is in contrast to recent developments in international negotiations on climate change. Secondly, in view of the high level of concern about the impacts of climate change shown  by the insurance industry, ski resort operators, shipping companies that rely on sufficiently high levels of water and other  Canadians, we therefore need domestic measures to achieve the Kyoto targets so that Canada is put in a position to ratify. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon the international community will  be able to closely scrutinize Canada's domestic plan on climate change at the Rio Plus 10 meeting in Johannesburg next September. The next world summit on sustainable development will allow participants to look at and measure progress made since the 1992 Rio summit when Agenda 21 was agreed upon. Members should know that the United Nations convention on climate change was adopted in May 1992 and opened at the Rio summit for signature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without ratification, what will Canada say in Johannesburg? With this question in mind, I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary to assure the House and Canadians that the necessary steps are being taken to guarantee ratification of the Kyoto protocol before the Johannesburg summit and to dispel any lingering uncertainty. The security of the globe and of millions of people depend on this ratification.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed colleague for his question.  It is a matter with which both of us are much concerned.  However I will  have to ask him  not to shoot the messenger  as I read the response I have from Natural Resources Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Svend Robinson:</b> Speak from the heart.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Finlay:</b> I may do that too, but probably not with my colleague from Davenport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is making substantive progress on the important issue of climate change.  Last month 28 projects worth $425 million were announced that would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 23.7 megatonnes.  We have put in place a series of emission reduction programs across a wide range of sectors aimed at achieving 65 megatonnes of annual greenhouse gas emission reductions or one-third of our Kyoto commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the September 24 meeting of energy and environment ministers in Winnipeg, all levels of government demonstrated their determination to addressing climate change and making substantive progress on the Kyoto protocol.  The momentum continued when ministers met again this past October in Toronto.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting in Winnipeg resulted in the release of a progress report on Canada's first national climate change business plan as well as a proposal to develop a second national climate change business plan.  With the impacts of climate change now being felt in Canada, particularly in the north, the 2002 business plan will be expanded to assess regional impacts and identify adaptation needs and mitigation programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to be successful in addressing climate change all levels of government need to work together.  This is why ministers at the Winnipeg meeting considered a possible federal-provincial-territorial framework agreement.  It was agreed that future discussions would be held to formalize our co-operative efforts.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we remain committed to working together closely on climate change through the national implementation strategy, a proven approach that emphasizes the interrelationship between national and international action within the confines of a co-ordinated strategy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting in Winnipeg also saw the renewal of our commitment to continue detailed analytical work on policy options for addressing climate change on issues such as a possible domestic emissions trading system, targeted measures, covenants with industry, impacts and adaptation, technology and competitiveness. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also agreed to discuss ways in which the Kyoto target might be allocated by sector or province. Discussions on all these specific matters will start no later than next May in order for Canada to consider ratification of the Kyoto protocol as early as 2002.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratification of the Kyoto protocol was  a key area of discussion during the meeting in Winnipeg.  The Minister of Natural Resources reiterated the government's commitment to a full consultation process involving  Canadian industry and environmental groups as well as the Canadian public in advance of a ratification decision. Provincial and territorial ministers indicated their interest in being involved in the decision process throughout.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the recently negotiated Bonn agreement, a framework for implementing the Kyoto protocol, the provinces and territories were generally supportive of the positions taken by the Government of Canada and appreciative of the consultative process put in place to keep them informed and seek their input.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I assure the parliamentary secretary, perish the thought that  I would ever shoot the messenger.  I thank him for his comprehensive reply and will only say that it is an issue on which too much talk is devoted to the costs of reducing emissions and too little energy and time are applied to the benefits.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits that can accrue to the economy from a more efficient and innovative use of energy are enormous. Tremendous benefits can also accrue in the long term by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and  shifting to renewable sources of energy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  conclusion, somehow, somewhere, the federal government must give stronger leadership than it has given so far if it wants to reach the plateau necessary to ratify it earlier.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, early one morning in November 1999 a 24 year old law student, Robbie Peterson, was brutally kicked and punched in the head and face. It happened at the corner of Regent and Brunswick streets in Fredericton, New Brunswick. He was attacked because he was gay. He was attacked from behind, thrown to the ground and kicked repeatedly. His attacker hurled anti-gay insults as he fled into the night.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after that attack I questioned the Minister of Justice in the House, asking her when she would be introducing legislation to include sexual orientation in the hate propaganda provisions of the criminal code. She replied at that time, which was December 1999, two years ago, that we would be making the necessary changes to the criminal code in the coming months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was two years ago. In fact it was a year and a couple of months before that in October 1998 that the provincial attorneys general, together with the federal attorney general, agreed at their annual meeting in Regina, Saskatchewan, that they would move ahead and deal with hate motivated activities in a manner consistent with the charter; in other words, to make those amendments. That was over three years ago. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, almost two years to the day after Robbie Peterson was brutally attacked in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Aaron Webster was murdered in Stanley Park. Aaron Webster was a gay man. He was bludgeoned to death and he was attacked because he was gay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, over three years after the Minister of Justice promised to amend the criminal code, I am appealing once again to the minister through the parliamentary secretary to do the right thing and  asking why it has taken so long since the promise was made,  first in October 1998 and then in December 1999. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the question I asked  the minister just a couple of weeks ago after Aaron Webster's death.  She responded that she would consult with the provincial and territorial attorneys general. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consult she did once again and they unanimously agreed again that there must be action. I spoke personally with the attorney general of Saskatchewan, Chris Axworthy, who agreed to this. The attorney general and  justice minister of Manitoba, Gord Macintosh,  said:</p>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to see another three years go by and another killing to move this issue along.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This affects both the violence and hatred directed at gay and lesbian people and those perceived to be gay and lesbian, but it also affects the ability of the police to stop hatemongers at the border, people like Fred Phelps. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ottawa police said recently that if this were done against a catholic, a jew or a black person charges could be laid. If we had that legislation in place we would not have to put up with the nonsense of Fred Phelps on Monday. We could have told him that if he shows up and starts spreading this hate we will arrest him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to call on the government to act and to act now to finally include sexual orientation in the hate propaganda sections of the criminal code. This is long overdue. No one else should be bashed or murdered simply because of the fact  they are gay or lesbian in a land in which our criminal code does not prohibit the spewing of that hatred and violence.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Burnaby--Douglas for raising again this immensely important point, I would hope for all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hate propaganda provisions of the criminal code were introduced prior to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  When the charter was introduced in 1982, almost immediately there were challenges to it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Keegstra case  made its way to the Supreme Court of Canada on the basis of an infringement  of section 2(b), the freedom of expression provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Supreme Court of Canada in a split decision of four to three found that although it did infringe the freedom of expression provisions under section 2(b), but that it was properly within the limits in a free and democratic society as a matter prescribed by law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some difficult defences that can be raised against these offences. One must be very careful when one knows that laws might be challenged under the charter that they be expanded with great care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Burnaby--Douglas has raised this issue on a number of occasions.  I heard him raise it again on November 21 with respect to the  very recent tragic events in Vancouver which he mentioned again this evening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister, as the member said, agreed to raise this with her territorial and provincial counterparts in the justice ministries on November 28 and as he said, she did raise it.  The minister was able to achieve consensus in that group as reported, that the identifiable groups which  the hate  propaganda provisions, and there are three offences under those sections,  apply to should be extended to include the factor of sexual orientation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think not a moment too soon, but given the years and some disagreement in the country about these issues and public ideas about this policy, I am very pleased to be able to say tonight that the minister will be putting forward amendments to the Criminal Code of Canada to add sexual orientation to the definition of an identifiable group under the hate crime provisions.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious question I have  for the member is when.  How much longer will we have to wait?  I remind my hon. friend that in fact the same commitment was made in the House in December 1999.  The minister herself said then that we would be moving ahead within months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tabled a private member's bill that would explicitly amend the code to include sexual orientation.  Is the parliamentary secretary prepared to consult with the minister as to the possibility that we may be able to move ahead with my bill, assuming that it meets the objectives that we agreed to in the House at the earliest possible occasion in the new year?</p>
