<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PEARSONINTERNATIONALAIRPORTAGREEMENTSACT">PEARSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AGREEMENTS 
ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 3 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning 
the redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester 
B. Pearson International Airport be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning I would like to begin by 
giving a short preamble to our viewers who are watching and 
wondering why we are working on this amendment. I think it is 
appropriate to read from <I>Hansard</I> the opposition amendment.
<P>
	The Bloc amendment effectively states that this House should 
decline to give second reading to Bill C-22, an act respecting 
certain agreements concerning the redevelopment and operation 
of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport, 
because the principle of the bill is flawed due to the fact that it 
contains no provisions aimed at making the work done by 
lobbyists more transparent.
<P>
	I will go right to clauses 9 and 10 of Bill C-22. Under the 
heading ``No Compensation'', clause 9 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No one is entitled to any compensation from Her Majesty in connection with 
the coming into force of this act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	Clause 10(2)(a) and (b) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No amount is payable under an agreement entered into under this section in 
relation to</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) any loss of profit, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) any fee paid for the purpose of lobbying a public office holder, within the 
meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Lobbyists Registration Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	I do not think it could have been stated any more clearly that 
any activity related to the lobbying on the Pearson airport 
contract will not have any remuneration at all.
<P>
	The Bloc motion also calls for an inquiry which is a delay 
tactic. It is not going to put this file to rest and will not allow us 
to deal with the real problems at the airport in Toronto.
<P>
	First, Canadians clearly know that we in the government, we 
in the Liberal Party did not support the Pearson development 
contract. It was cancelled immediately. However because we 
cancelled that contract, it does not mean we are opposed to 
redeveloping and reworking the Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	Going back over the last 10 years, we were dealing with a 
Conservative government that had this ideological thrust to 
dismantle everything around here. It offloaded to the provinces; 
it offloaded to the private sector. The last 10 years was like fire 
sale city. This was that government's last attempt to have a fire 
sale of the most profitable organization in the Government of 
Canada, the Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	Much of the good work the management of Pearson airport 
accomplished over the years was tainted by this whole exercise. 
We want to put this file to rest now so that we can come back at it 
from square one. Does that mean we are going to go out and do 
the same deal over again with a different set of lobbyists? No.
<P>
	In fact there are Bloc members over there who have suggested 
from time to time that there were Liberal lobbyists involved in 
this transaction. That is a fact.
<P>
	It is a well known fact that all the lobby firms in Ottawa do not 
have just Conservative lobbyists. They have Conservatives, 
Liberals and NDP. In fact they even have a couple of lobbyists 
who work on the Reform Party, but I do not know about the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No lobbyists for the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> No lobbyists for the 
Reform Party. Okay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As the hon. parliamentary secretary 
knows very well, we were supposed to avoid these kinds of 
across the floor sword waving. If the member would please put 
his remarks to the Chair, it will avoid getting blood on the rug, so 
to speak.

	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
humble apologies. It must be Friday morning. I think the House 
is getting to me this week, but I will be going home to my

<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	The problem in the Toronto area is that we have about 600,000 
people out of work. It is serious because Toronto has never 
before been on its economic knees the way it has been in the last 
two years.
<P>
	I am speaking on behalf of all members from Toronto at this 
moment. We talk among ourselves and we rack our brains on 
how we can get our city going again. Toronto has always been 
generous to every region in Canada and is happy to do it.
<P>
	Do not think for a second that a lot of us were not tempted to 
move ahead with this project because it created a lot of jobs. We 
knew however that the contract the Conservatives had was not in 
the best interests of all of Canada. A lot of the money that was 
made at the Pearson International Airport, unlike other airports 
in Canada, was used to subsidize the smaller regions of Canada 
where the little local airports could not stand on their own two 
feet.
<P>
	It is very important when we look at Toronto that we do not 
compare it to the local airport authority in Vancouver. This is a 
national airport. The profits and the cash flow from this airport 
service the country.
<P>
	There was a lot of temptation for us to say: ``Wow, this is 
about a job creation project for 2,000 people'', but in the 
interests of Canada we said no. The Prime Minister, the caucus 
and the cabinet said we are not striking this deal.
<P>
	What do we have to do now? We have to revitalize that airport. 
It invites tourists here, trade shows, people that want to invest 
not just in Toronto but in every region of our country and we 
must revitalize it. We have to get it going, but we have to get it 
going in the interests not just of a handful of developers, and not 
just in the interests of a few lobbyists.
<P>
	By the way, I have a lot of friends who are in the lobby 
business. Yes, I do. I can tell you there have been many times 
when we have had tough debates on this, but I have always been 
consistent. I believe in a strong national government.
<P>
	We have to put this piece of legislation to bed. We have to 
finish it off. Then we can put people who look at the macro 
picture of Canada in place to start revitalizing this airport.
<P>
	I appeal to all members. If you want a good discussion on 
lobbyists then stand by and wait for the lobbyists registration 
act. It is going to be coming before this House in the not too 
distant future. It will be in committee and we can have a good 
solid constructive debate.
<P>
	Do not think for a second that we on this side of the House do 
not share a lot of your views on the way the lobby industry went 
up by 10,000 per cent in the last 10 years. Many of us who were 
MPs in the last government felt that the lobbyists around this 
town had more influence and more power than even the cabinet. 
If you think for a second that all of a sudden we are going to look 
the other way, we are going to have a very transparent 
constructive piece of lobbyists registration legislation.
<P>
	Everyone knows I have always been emphatic about the fact 
that tourism is one of the greatest job creators in this country. 
Linked to tourism is the fact that our transportation instruments 
must be healthy and must represent the type of community and 
country we have. Nowhere is Pearson more important than in the 
tourism industry. Therefore I am asking members from all 
regions to put this bill through the next phases quickly so we can 
get on with the business of revitalizing the Toronto market.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me real pleasure today to speak to the issue of Bill C-22 on 
behalf of the Reform Party of Canada. I am pleased because it is 
always a pleasure to expose the facts about a bad deal, but also 
because it gives me an opportunity to show how the Reform 
Party presents a better option for Canadian voters than the old 
line parties, the Liberals and Conservatives.
<P>
	I want to describe something for my attentive audience in the 
Chamber today and those across the nation who are listening in. 
I want to tell my audience about one aspect of how a political 
party is organized and the major problems that this sometimes 
engenders.
<P>
	The old line parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, are 
nearly as old as Canada itself. Even before 1867 they were loose 
political alliances based on culture and other associations. 
When we look at the ideology of the two main parties they 
believe much the same things.
<P>
	Both parties believe in the great concepts of democracy, the 
rule of law, the parliamentary system and the general viability of 
the free enterprise system. Both parties, at least until a few 
months ago, were national parties. Both have elected English 
and French Canadian Prime Ministers. In fact there are so many 
likenesses that a person not acquainted with this country might 
ask what makes them different.
<P>
	There is one telling difference. I would describe a political 
party as a circle of friends committed to a common political 
purpose. People who are not friends will not be able to work 
together to achieve this purpose and a group of friends not 
committed to the political purpose will of course accomplish 
almost nothing. Both elements must exist in order for an 
effective political party to exist; a group of friends and a 
common political purpose.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3985"> 3985 </A></B>
<P>
	When we consider this definition the difference between the 
Liberals and Conservatives becomes crystal clear. They are 
simply different circles of friends. The Conservative Party is 
just such a circle of people bound together by common 
association, bearing allegiance to one another within the party 
because of generations of common involvement and 
association. I say generations because this is the case of the old 
line parties. The Conservatives have been around for over a 
century. Today's young Conservative might say: ``My father 
was a Conservative, and my grandfather. I am going to vote 
Conservative''.
<P>
	Imagine how deep party roots go; old friendships, old 
acquaintances, old loyalties, old trusts and yes, old favours and 
old debts. The bad goes with the good. Where there are common 
political commitments there are inevitable favours that go back 
a long time, and how are these favours repaid? Sometimes they 
are paid by patronage, sometimes by prestige, sometimes by 
simple influence and sometimes by money.
<P>
	When I began my talk today I noted that a political party must 
have two elements, a circle of friends and a common political 
purpose. Over generations of political life the purpose begins to 
waver. Because the political direction seems secure people lose 
sight of the great political purpose for which they were bound 
together in the first place and the circle of friends becomes ever 
more important.
<P>
	In time unfortunately the circle of friends can completely 
overshadow the political purpose and the friendships take over. 
The public interest becomes lost somewhere between the shuffle 
of favour after favour and the public interest begins to suffer.
<P>
	This is how political corruption develops. This is exactly how 
the Conservative Party of Canada has corrupted itself in this 
Pearson airport deal; a tight circle of friends, bound together no 
longer by common political purpose but by using their political 
associations to benefit financially from the public purse.
<P>
	This is why I believe Canada needs the Reform Party. Canada 
needs a new circle of friends, people who feel a deeper 
friendship for the people of Canada and their interests than with 
each other; a circle of reform minded friends who are joined in a 
passionate, idealistic political purpose, Canadians for whom 
that common political purposes stands far above any of these 
associations for personal gain.
<P>
	After developing the background in this way, let us now turn 
to the bill before us. The media did a fine job of exposing the 
corruption inherent in the Pearson airport contract, the 
Conservative circle of friends who were benefiting very 
handsomely from their political friendships in the dying days of 
the Tory administration.
<P>
	The Liberals did a fine thing, the right thing, when they 
promised during the election campaign to stop the deal on behalf 
of all Canadians. It is not unethical to scrap a contract that was 
corrupt in the very first place.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada does not oppose the broad 
outlines of this bill. We agree with its general concept and we 
agree especially on section 9 of the bill which reads: ``No one is 
entitled to any compensation from Her Majesty in connection 
with the coming into force of this act''.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	If the contract was a corruption on the bidding process in the 
first place so the parameters of the tender were written to suit 
just one bid then the entire process is rightly null and void. No 
compensation should be owed by the crown to these people.
<P>
	Unfortunately while the Liberals were making a political 
promise during the election there was a fly in the ointment.
<P>
	Amid the good things that are being done, toward the end of 
Bill C-22 in clause 10 there is a statement which causes us to 
stop short: ``If the minister considers it appropriate to do so, the 
minister may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, 
enter into agreements on behalf of Her Majesty to provide for 
the payment of such amounts as the Minister considers 
appropriate''.
<P>
	The intention of the act is to right a wrong. It is to stop 
corruption. It is to reverse a deal which benefited a circle of 
friends in an unethical way. The government declared rightly 
when it said that it owed no compensation to anyone.
<P>
	Why then does the act contain a clause which allows the 
minister to make any payment he chooses, only needing the 
approval of cabinet which makes its decisions behind closed 
doors?
<P>
	After trumpeting self-righteously about the evils of the deal, 
the minister now gives himself and the cabinet the authority to 
make a secret deal with the old Conservatives instead of being 
up front with the people of Canada. Why would that be? Instead 
of Conservative friends, it could be that there are Liberal friends 
who took part in this deal whom the minister has not forgotten.
<P>
	After publicly exposing and denouncing the corruption 
inherent in the Conservative deal are the Liberals now having 
the same thing to do with their Liberal circle of friends?
<P>
	I would note for the public record, and not particularly with 
glee but with sadness, that there are also many Liberals involved 
in the contract. Claridge Properties is a company heavily 
involved. It is controlled by a prominent Liberal Party supporter 
and fundraiser. There is a Liberal senator involved, a Liberal 
organizer and a lobbyist. And of course Liberal veteran Bob 
Nixon was coincidentally named to investigate all the factors in 
this organization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3986"> 3986 </A></B>
<P>
	Where there is smoke there is fire and the smokescreen that 
surrounds this thing is starting to get thicker and thicker. Might 
there be a possibility that there are prominent Liberals and 
others we do not even know about who are directly or indirectly 
involved in this and will be entitled to some compensation?
<P>
	In order to keep the public interest on centre stage and to take 
the political favours off the scene altogether the minister should 
not be making these decisions about compensation. The 
decisions should be made in public on a non-partisan basis by 
the Standing Committee on Transport in which all members of 
all political parties can have a say and invite witnesses to come 
before it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> This is where everything related to the deal will 
be made public. If real economic losses have been suffered by 
innocent parties the committee will make a joint decision in 
front of the television cameras, in front of the Canadian people 
to show that no political influence peddling has been involved.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not believe that it is cost effective to 
go to the length of having a royal commission on this. We do not 
think that is necessary. However, we would prefer to see the 
issue discussed openly before the standing committee with a 
good number of guest speakers and all willing witnesses coming 
forward to give their perspectives on the issues.
<P>
	This royal commission, despite all of the other Pearson flaws, 
would be like using a hammer to kill a fly and would 
undoubtedly become a prime example of yet more millions 
spent uselessly. Therefore, it is becoming more and more 
obvious that the old line parties are no longer focusing. They 
need to focus on the public interest rather than on the political 
interest or the line of friendship that I talked about earlier.
<P>
	Even when they try to address political corruption they are no 
longer able to act without making sure that their friends are 
being taken care of, or at least that impression may be given. 
Section 9 is claiming no compensation is owed but it is already 
mitigated and contradicted by section 10 which says that the 
minister, if he feels so inclined, may give any compensation he 
feels fit to give.
<P>
	This whole issue highlights the crying need for change in 
Canada's political system. It is time for a new political 
association to wipe the old ones off the map for a while, to erase 
the old blackboard covered thick with old IOUs. It is time to 
start with a clean political slate. I would suggest it is time to 
start with the Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker. I would also like to acknowledge all those taking 
part in this debate. I understand that we do not all share the same 
views. I would also like to remind those listening to us that it 
was two weeks ago that the Official Opposition undertook to 
shed some light on the now unfortunate tale of Pearson Airport.
<P>
	The more we debate this issue, the more this sad tale reminds 
us of how the traditional political parties equate politics with 
favouritism and lobbying. Indeed, lobbying, favouritism and 
politics are often viewed as one and the same thing. That is why 
the Official Opposition, being the responsible group that it is, 
wanted to shed some light on this transaction. Surely you have 
never doubted that we are a responsible party because we have 
never acted other than responsibly since being elected to sit as 
the Official Opposition.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, could you ask the hon. members to applaud my 
comments?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> We must not, however, lose sight of the fact that 
this is a serious issue. Since my hon. colleague is speaking about 
facts, it would be a good idea to remind him that as we speak, the 
Liberal government has yet to make the details of this deal 
public. Yet, we are discussing a transaction that has major 
financial implications. Our listeners should know that we are 
conducting this debate without the actual contract in hand, 
without knowing in detail the contractual obligations which 
bound the former government to the consortium in question.
<P>
	Perhaps it would be a good idea to review some of the events 
leading up to this transaction. They clearly show that in our 
political system, until such time as we have lobbying legislation 
with teeth, it will always be possible for a government to indulge 
in favouritism.
<P>
	The following question arises then. How is it that this 
government, when in opposition, stressed many times the need 
to review the lobbying legislation and even made this issue a 
priority? And how is it that six months after coming to power, it 
still has made no attempt to conduct such a review? We are 
critical of the government for its failure to act on this matter.
<P>
	While we may agree with its decision to cancel the 
Conservative deal, we can only wonder why it did not see things 
through to their logical conclusion. Since the two parties are in 
agreement, something that does not happen often during the life 
of a Parliament, why will the government not attack the root of 
the problem by urgently introducing legislation here in the 
House to deal with the explosive issue of lobbying? Both the 
Reform Party and the Official Opposition would be ready to 
move on this matter immediately and would make themselves 
available.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3987"> 3987 </A></B>
<P>
	There would have been no question of an agenda or of a 
timetable. We would have devoted all of our energies and 
efforts to studying this legislation as quickly as possible.
<P>
	It so happens that, like the Conservatives, the Liberals have 
their political friends. Therefore, they are duty bound to support 
them. When you have a national party like the Liberal Party and 
you are looking for financial backup like they do, it is 
understandable that you be bound by the election fund that 
allows you to be in politics.
<P>
	Of course, we, in Quebec, have freed ourselves from such a 
thing. This is part of René Levesque's legacy, this great political 
figure Félix Leclerc said was part of a much too short list of 
liberators of the people. The main thing we have inherited from 
the Levesque era was this piece of legislation he gave the 
National Assembly, one of the very first ones introduced in the 
Parti Quebecois government's mandate. Those were the days, 
the early days of the Parti Quebecois government, days that will 
come back though!
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	You are aware of the political situation. I will not elaborate on 
the subject, but some optimism is permitted on this side of the 
House. The reason we are in this predicament is because we do 
not have legislation ``that has teeth'' respecting lobbyists.
<P>
	So, in March 1992, the government called for tenders-also 
known as bids in government language-for the privatization of 
Terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson Airport.
<P>
	If you were the least bit concerned by the issue, you were 
already wondering: Why privatize Pearson Airport? In terms of 
public facilities, can you think of something more common, 
more public than an airport? Why privatize Pearson Airport 
then, if for one thing, it was the main airport in Canada and, for 
another, it was profitable? This was an airport that actually 
showed profits on its books, an airport that did not carry losses. 
Already, people were wondering: why privatize a piece of our 
national heritage which is crucial to the Ontario economy, as we 
know, when it showed profits?
<P>
	You will tell me this is typical of the silly way of thinking of a 
Conservative government in bed with-and almost incestuously 
so-the private sector. That is what the ideological motivation 
was.
<P>
	In the end, in June 1992, two bids were received. Strangely 
enough, the public tendering process on such a major public 
stake had produced only two bids, both bidders already having 
ties with the airport administration. And, let us not forget the 
time limit potential suppliers were given to submit tenders; the 
entire process lasted but 90 days. That was the first technical 
irregularity. Every member who knows anything about 
administrative law knows, for instance, that the labour 
standards committee gives 90 days to initiate whatever 
collective agreement grievance, even for  matters much less 
binding. That is the minimum time allotted in the notice of 
dispute.
<P>
	Yet, it was decided to apply this minimum time limit to 
something as major as a multimillion privatization process. So, 
that was the first irregularity, and observers did not fail to point 
it out. That is the crux of the controversy and this is where we 
really get the feeling of doing our job as the opposition, by 
raising these facts.
<P>
	Who were these bidders? Who are they? Paxport is a 
consortium controlled by Don Matthews group. Don Matthews 
was president of Brian Mulroney's leadership campaign in 
1983. My apologies to Joe Clark for saying this, but Don 
Matthews was president of Brian Mulroney's leadership 
campaign. This man is part of the Conservative Party 
machinery. He is so much a part of it that he was the mastermind 
behind four or five national fund-raising campaigns. And you 
know that Tory national fund-raising campaigns generally 
involve several zeros and that most of the money comes from 
private enterprise.
<P>
	So the first bidder is directly linked to this great Tory family, 
now a kind of nuclear family, we agree, but once a little more 
extended than it is now.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Almost a single-parent family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>Almost a single-parent family, I am told, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	The second bidder, Claridge Properties Inc., is a company 
owned by Charles Bronfman, who is not exactly the most 
destitute of Canadians or the closest to the Optimist Club or the 
Salvation Army. He is, however, quite close to the Liberal Prime 
Minister. And we saw during the campaign the tenuous 
cocktail-circuit links connecting Charles Bronfman to this 
Liberal family he is still a part of.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The two bidders are going to merge and, whether Tory or 
Liberal, it all amounts to the same thing. Our two bidders are 
going to merge into T1 T2 Limited Partnership, which will be 
the new company responsible for privatizing Terminals 1 and 2. 
It reeks of scandal, patronage, nepotism. That is why the 
Official Opposition thinks we must shed light on this issue. And 
to do it as expeditiously as the government wants-a 
government that has still not made public the legal text of this 
privatization deal-we say a commission of enquiry is needed to 
deal with this blot on, this breach of democracy.
<P>
	This case reminds us that the federal administration will be 
faced with this kind of situation until we have, as demanded by 
the Official Opposition and the Reform Party, a lobbyists law 
with teeth. The government must resolve the issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3988"> 3988 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would 
like to take part in the discussion on the cancellation of the 
contract to privatize terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson 
International Airport in Toronto, a very profitable airport. The 
former Conservative government concluded these agreements 
only two and a half weeks before the election of October 25, 
1993. They would have turned over to private sector interests 
for a 60-year period the development and operation of 
terminals 1 and 2 at the largest airport in Canada.
<P>
	In the last election campaign, the Liberals promised to cancel 
this outrageous contract that by all appearances was a case of 
patronage and end-of-mandate political manipulation. Clearly, 
this questionable transaction is contrary to the public interest 
and the Conservative government's only purpose was to enrich 
its fund-raisers.
<P>
	Some provisions of Bill C-22 are contradictory and 
controversial; for example, clause 9, which says that in principle 
the government will not have to compensate the parties 
concerned. However, further on, the bill gives the Minister of 
Transport full discretion to conclude agreements on payment of 
money, to pay these same parties the amount he deems 
appropriate under this law. I think that no compensation should 
be paid in this case. This latter provision is disturbing. It leaves 
the way open for lobbyists involved with the Liberal Party and 
the Conservative Party to obtain the compensation they want.
<P>
	Furthermore, I very strongly support the proposal of the 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean, the Leader of the Official 
Opposition, to create a royal commission of inquiry to get to the 
bottom of one of the biggest scandals I have seen in Canadian 
public life and politics since coming to this country in 1974.
<P>
	Obviously, there was no openness in this affair.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Even the investigator appointed by Mr. Chrétien, Mr. Nixon, 
says that: ``The public should have the right to know the full 
details of the agreement''. Besides examining this questionable 
transaction, this commission should also deal with the 
administration of all federal airports in Canada.
<P>
	This transaction that the Conservative Party wanted to put 
through was condemned at the time by the labour movement, 
especially by my old union, the National Automobile, 
Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers Union of 
Canada (CAW), by the Canadian Union of Public Employees 
(CUPE) and by the International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers. These unions also represent the employees 
of Pearson Airport.
<P>
	Consequently, I want to pay tribute to the union movement for 
its clear and firm position against the privatization of that 
airport, and in particular to CAW president, my former 
colleague Basil ``Buzz'' Hargrove, as well as to Cheryl 
Kryzaniwsky, president of local 2213 of the same union, which 
represents 8,000 workers from that industry. I spent the last two 
days in Banff, close to your riding. I met with over 100 delegates 
from this local chapter representing airline industry employees. 
These people passed excellent resolutions to face the current 
crisis in this industry.
<P>
	These unions opposed policies to privatize and regulate their 
sector of operation at any cost. For example, they opposed the 
privatization of Air Canada. Indeed, as a consequence of these 
policies, several Canadian and Quebec companies have gone 
bankrupt, thousands of jobs have been lost, and big American 
carriers are now exerting greater control over those companies 
which are still in operation.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to draw your attention to the 
fact that TAP-Air Portugal will stop flying to Canada, that is to 
Montreal and Toronto, after doing so for 25 years. I was 
informed of that decision in the last couple of days by the CAW 
union, which represents employees of that company in Canada, 
and also by the Portuguese community, which is one of the 
largest ethnic communities in Canada with close to 500,000 
members who reside mostly in Ontario and Quebec. Its leaders 
have formed a coalition and unanimously oppose that decision.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Canadian government to make 
representations to the Portuguese government and to the 
management of TAP-Air Portugal, to have that decision 
reversed, because it could have a very negative impact for the 
travel industry between the two countries, and it will result in 
the loss of numerous jobs.
<P>
	At Pearson Airport alone, 56,000 workers depend on direct 
and indirect airport activities. The annual total payroll for these 
workers is $1.9 billion, an amount which greatly contributes to 
the economy of the Greater Toronto Area, including the $630 
million in taxes paid to the three levels of government. This 
gives an idea of the impact of that industry on Canada's 
economy.
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I submit that any agreement of 
any nature must have, as one of its primary objectives, the 
protection of the rights and interests of workers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to review 
some of the red book promises this morning.
<P>
	The red book promised more integrity in government, it 
promised frugality, it promised to reduce perks and modify the 
MP pension plan, and change some of the Order in Council 
appointments. It talked about transparency in appointments. 
Appointments would be made to highly qualified people only. It 
talked about cleaning up patronage.

<P>
	The third issue was changing the way committees worked. 
There would be more consultation, earlier consultation and 
more power to make changes in the committee structure.
<P>
	I thought I would review how I think the government is doing 
on these issue. Polls say that the Prime Minister's popularity is 
excellent. Politicians have risen in public estimation. They are 
no longer lower than a rattlesnake's belly in some people's 
estimation. I hope that is true. I would have to say then that the 
mark for more integrity in government is quite acceptable on 
these issues.
<P>
	Integrity is somewhat fragile, however. There are watchful 
eyes looking for lapses in integrity: the watchful eyes of the 
media, the watchful eyes of the public and the watchful eyes of 
opposition parties. One thing we are ordered to do in opposition 
is to watch for breaches and lack of integrity.
<P>
	I thought I might mention some of the stumbles that the 
government may have made in these issues. NAFTA was 
promised in the election campaign a very specific review; it was 
signed pretty much as is. Cruise missile testing, something the 
Liberals had consistently talked against, has been passed.
<P>
	On the Ginn takeover, a tiny odour settles around that 
takeover. The issue of election boundary revision is an issue that 
has a slight odour to it. I picked up a couple of little items from 
recent news clips. One is entitled ``Pork barrel grows larger''. In 
his ongoing investigation of patronage in federal advertising 
contracts, Greg Weston reports that the ad industry in Toronto is 
abuzz with rumours that some cabinet ministers are hoping to 
influence contracting by crown corporations. Such agencies are 
supposed to be run as independent businesses on behalf of 
taxpayers, with no patronage.
<P>
	I refer to little item in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>. It reports that a junior 
cabinet minister has been using a chauffeur driven limousine, 
unauthorized by the Prime Minister. There is a tiny odour in 
those issues.
<P>
	I do not want to be overly critical. As I said before the marks 
on integrity given to the Liberal government at this stage of the 
game are quite acceptable, but if principles are solid integrity 
will follow meekly behind. If I could rephrase that, one does not 
have to work hard at maintaining integrity if one's principles are 
founded upon a granite base.
<P>
	Bill C-22 has also a very slight or faint odour about it. It is a 
faint odour but a definite odour. The cancellation was correct. 
The desire for fair compensation is correct. However the 
government needs to bring the bills for fair compensation to the 
transport committee, have them reviewed in public, and there 
would be no odour or taint about the cancellation at all. Those 
bills need scrutiny. They need open review and there would be 
no problem with cancelling the Pearson airport deal.
<P>
	There is no room for ministerial approval. There is no need for 
backroom deals. On this issue integrity is not difficult at all.
<P>
	For example, in my young life I did some mountaineering. We 
went on an expedition to Gondeau Traverse which was 
technically very difficult. We had fixed pitons in place. We 
hooked up our carabiners and were able to make this traverse 
with technical difficulties. We took our less talented friends 
along to show our prowess. When we got to the middle of 
Gondeau Traverse we had to rappel straight down an 
unclimbable cliff.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Without failure, when pulling our rope down from Gondeau 
Traverse it would hook on a large rock above. A friend of mine, a 
good chum, had done this traverse numerous times. I must say 
we were showing off when we did it. We thought we were 
excellent mountaineers. The last time we did Gondeau Traverse 
we pulled the rope and the huge rock above us came loose. A 
2,000-pound granite chunk fell. The two of us scattered and 
were very lucky to survive. The rock crashed on the ledge below 
us and ruined the climbing rope. We both looked upon that as a 
close miss.
<P>
	I believe the faint odour that relates to Bill C-22 may just 
simply be the rope hooking on the rock above the government. 
There is no need for this to happen. It is completely avoidable.
<P>
	Why would the Reform Party be so free with this advice to 
prevent the taint on this issue? I say very plainly that it is 
because the Reform Party frankly would like the Liberal 
government to be a success. That may be an issue that some 
would laugh at. I am particularly keen to see the government 
bring Canada back to its senses and not stumble on issues where 
there is no need to stumble. I give this advice freely and openly. 
There is no need to have the taint on Bill C-22.
<P>
	An example of how keen we are to see the government 
succeed as a party is when our leader during comments on ``The 
House'' was asked if he were disappointed there was no tax 
revolt after the finance minister made his budgetary statements. 
His answer was very revealing. He said to the interviewer: ``My 
desire is not to have a tax revolt. My desire is not to see the 
budget fail. My desire is to see Canada function at the highest 
level''.
<P>
	He was saying with those comments that his desire was to see 
the government succeed. We will stand as reminders to the 
government if it makes mistakes. In my view it is making a 
mistake with the bill by not having an open, transparent process 
as it promised. There is no need for a big review. There is no 
need for a fancy royal commission. There is a need for 
transparency.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-22 before the House today aims at cancelling 
the privatization of the Pearson Airport, and the government, by 
introducing this piece of legislation, wants to fulfil the 
commitment it made during the election campaign.
<P>
	This morning, my colleagues reviewed in detail all the 
process surrounding the negotiations of this privatization deal, 
and the Reform member who spoke first this morning mentioned 
that Conservative as well as Liberal lobbyists were involved in 
this deal since the very beginning.
<P>
	In his report, ordered by the government, Mr. Nixon 
concluded that this contract had to be cancelled, and I quote: 
``My review left me with but one conclusion. To leave in place 
an inadequate contract arrived at through such a flawed process 
and under the shadow of possible political manipulation in 
unacceptable. I recommend that the contract be cancelled''. Of 
course, in such circumstances, the Bloc also agrees that the 
contract must be cancelled.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	But today, we are addressing the issue of political 
manipulation, the transparency of these contracts and the 
involvement of lobbyists, people close to the government and 
the friends of the big political parties.
<P>
	Let me remind you that the Nixon report, as my colleague 
mentioned briefly, also made the following recommendation: 
``Failure to make public the full identity of the participants in 
this agreement and other salient terms of the contract inevitably 
raises public suspicion. Where the Government of Canada 
proposes to privatize a public asset, in my opinion, transparency 
should be the order of the day''. He adds what has already been 
quoted: ``The public should have the right to know the full 
details of this agreement''. That is why the Bloc Quebecois is 
requesting a public inquiry on this matter, on this contract which 
we never saw.
<P>
	With this bill, the government wants not only to cancel the 
privatization of the Pearson Airport, but also to leave it to the 
minister to settle all of the financial problems related to this 
agreement. All of these details will be up to the minister. We ask 
that the amounts and the names be made public and that there be 
real openness.
<P>
	We remember that, according to the red book, which the 
government delights in quoting more and more in this House, 
the Liberals were probably elected on the promise of 
wall-to-wall openness. We know quite well that people 
everywhere in Canada and in Quebec are starting-I dare 
say-to be fed up with politicians with a tight-lip policy.
<P>
	If the Liberals were lucky enough to be elected, it was 
especially on their promise of openness. But what is the reality? 
When we ask for an inquiry and for the documents on the issue 
of privatization of Pearson Airport to be tabled, we do not nor 
will we get anything. The answer is no.
<P>
	Ever since the beginning of this 35th Parliament, in January, 
we have been asking the government to open its books to the 
public and to examine one by one all items of public spending, 
including tax expenditures. The answer is no. The Prime 
Minister said recently in the House that if we wanted details on 
government spending, we only had to ask the committees, since 
their mandate is to study these expenditures. The Bloc 
Quebecois asked all committees that sit and the answer was no.
<P>
	In the case of the Hibernia Project, which is now losing 
billions of dollars, I for one asked the Committee on Natural 
Resources to let me see the Hibernia original contract. The 
answer was no.
<P>
	This afternoon, we will resume debate on a motion by the hon. 
member for Richelieu regarding the funding of political parties 
by individuals. When this motion was first moved, we could see 
right away that members of the Liberal government were against 
it. Again, they refuse to make things more transparent.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the situation is very bad in Canada. According to 
some figures reported last week, there are 790,000 welfare 
recipients and 400,000 unemployed in Quebec. We heard this 
morning that the number of unemployed in Canada grew by 
65,000 in the month of April, an increase of 1 per cent in some 
areas. These unemployed people are concentrated in three 
provinces: Newfoundland, Quebec and British Columbia.
<P>
	Faced with this situation, the government cannot find 
anything to say other than it is the unemployed who are the 
problem, they are a bunch of beer-drinking couch potatoes. That 
is why things are going bad in Canada. Also, and this is again 
related to the policy of transparency, when things are going bad, 
there has to be a reason. If the government cannot be 
transparent, it has to find a scapegoat. When things are going 
bad in Canada, we hear that it is because Quebec is too 
demanding. We all know that since the beginning of the 
Canadian Confederation, the whole history of this country could 
be described-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. He 
still has a fair amount of time left for his speech. When we 
resume debate around noon, he will have the floor.

debated our role there and even the possibility of air strikes. But 
the war continues and so does the suffering of innocent children.
<P>

the shutdown of this plant and the loss of hundreds of jobs. 
Westinghouse is a supplier of electrical equipment. From now

serious violent crimes and subsequently not be profoundly

<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Unemployment is up and the hardest hit are Canadian young 
people. This is before the job market is flooded with college and 
university students.
<P>
	In spite of the election promise of jobs, the reality is that the 
job future looks bleak as Canadians wait for the Liberal 
government to deliver on its job creation promises. The Prime 
Minister said that job prospects were improving. Everyone 
wanted to believe him and hoped he was right but unfortunately 
he was not.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the bright light in the job creating 
area of Canada is in the province of Ontario, where the 
government has created an economic atmosphere which saw 
49,000 jobs created in the past three months.
<P>
	I urge the Prime Minister to get beyond Peter Pan economics, 
get real and take action on jobs now.

approach Mother's Day it is appropriate that I stand in 
recognition of a member of my constituency, Jocelyne Fleurant, 
a proud mother of a Canadian peacekeeper in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Mrs. Fleurant began a nation-wide campaign of support for 
our men and women serving overseas after her son left CFB 
Chilliwack for his first tour of duty in Croatia during the spring 
of last year.
<P>
	Symbolizing this support for our Canadian peacekeepers 
abroad, Mrs. Fleurant has made and distributed thousands of 
hand-made UN beret blue ribbons secured by a small Canadian 
flag pin.
<P>
	I commend the tireless efforts of this mother to remind 
Canadians of the need to keep up the morale of our Canadian 
peacekeepers. Her commitment should be and is an inspiration 
to us all.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	This month, unemployment statistics were not deliberately 
leaked by the government because, unlike the March ones, they 
show that the unemployment rate went up by 0.5 per cent to 
reach 11 per cent. In Quebec alone, the situation is a lot worse 
with an unemployment rate which went from 11.7 per cent in 
March to 12.6 per cent in April.
<P>
	Is it not time for the Liberal government to implement 
concrete and structuring initiatives to deal with unemployment, 
instead of sitting tight on the record of its first six months in 
office?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we 
are not pleased with these numbers, not so much because of the 
numbers per se, but because they are a blow to the unemployed.
<P>
	However, it is interesting to note that if there are 65,000 more 
people looking for a job this month, it is because they believe 
that the economic indicators are favourable. For instance, house 
sales have gone up by 30 per cent, consumer confidence is up by 
13 per cent. People are regaining hope in increasing numbers 
and we are hoping that, as our economic recovery program is 
taking hold, the unemployed will keep on finding jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
taking into account the population growth, does the Deputy 
Prime Minister realize that to get back to pre-recession 
employment levels, I do not mean full employment, just 
pre-recession employment levels, more that 900,000 jobs would 
have to be created in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the month of February 
we have created 115,000 jobs. In the province of Quebec since 
last August there have been 74,000 jobs created.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3995"> 3995 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
That is 74,000 jobs in Quebec alone. We are not satisfied. We 
tried to do something in the first six months. We presented the 
Budget, we have the infrastructure program, and we are trying to 
do better than that.
<P>
	The good thing though, if you can look at these statistics in a 
positive light, is that Canadians and Quebecers are now starting 
to look for a job because they feel better about the economy as a 
whole. That is why 65,000 more people have joined the labour 
force this month when they realized that there was work to be 
had.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with rising unemployment rates and the arrival, in April, of 
66,000 new workers on the job market, does the Deputy Prime 
Minister not agree that the first six months of Liberal 
government are a failure, a deplorable and appalling failure 
when it comes to job creation?
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has not been a failure. In 
fact since the month of February, we have created 115,000 jobs. 
We do not think enough has been done but we do feel that with 
the signing of the infrastructure programs and with the budget of 
the Minister of Finance, we are on the right track.
<P>
	This month 65,000 Canadians thought that the job prospects 
were getting good enough that they decided to get back into the 
market. We see consumer confidence on the rise. We see the sale 
of houses up over 30 per cent.
<P>
	We are on the right track but we are not going to solve the 
problems in six short months. We need more time and we need 
continued consumer confidence, something that we see as the 
bright light at the end of a very long tunnel for a lot of 
unemployed people.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address my question to the Deputy 
Prime Minister. It is said in the Liberal Party's red book that a 
Liberal government will implement a conversion program to 
transform defence industries into civilian ones. However, the 
Minister of Industry quite surprisingly said yesterday that the 
government will not invest in such a conversion. In that sector, 
more than 10,000 high-technology jobs have disappeared since 
1988.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister, who would do me honour 
if she would listen to my question, how can she reconcile the 
commitment of her party and the amazing declaration of the 
Minister of Industry who said during debate yesterday that it is 
the responsibility of the management and shareholders of those 
companies to solve their own problems?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is only quoting part 
of what the Minister of Industry said yesterday in the debate.
<P>
	He did say that we would want to look to industry to make sure 
all of its strategic plans were being redesigned and reinvented in 
light of a very tough fiscal framework. He also said that in the 
budget we were redesigning DIPP so there would be less giving 
of cheques and grants but more of a situation where there would 
be loans for those industries that qualified and ones that were 
especially sensitive to conversion to peacetime activity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I address my supplementary to the Minister of 
Finance who, I can tell, is dying to participate in this debate, I 
would like to mention to my hon. colleague that one of the 
headlines in this morning's papers said: ``Ottawa will not 
finance the conversion of defence industries''.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order please! Members are not to show papers 
or documents of any kind during question period. The member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve will put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister of 
Finance how he can accept such a turnabout on the part of his 
colleague the Minister of Industry when he knows perfectly well 
that if nothing is done in a very near future, thousands of jobs 
will be lost in the defence industry. Does he accept the 
declaration, does he agree with the Minister of Industry's 
statement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does not seem to 
have understood the point I was making in my first answer.
<P>
	We are working very hard to assist corporations which are in 
the process of conversion. It is just that the approach and the 
design of DIPP is going to be different from what it was in the 
past. Part of that has to do with the fact that we have a very tough 
fiscal framework within which we are dealing.
<P>
	The hon. member should also know there are many examples 
of good solid success stories. People with their own expertise 
are using other resources like the Export Development 
Corporation and the banks which have been more progressive in 
the last little while as well as  enhanced marketing. These are all 
new approaches that help bridge this period of conversion.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The budget presented yesterday in the province of Ontario is 
evidence that the provinces and the federal government can no 
longer operate in budget isolation of each other.
<P>
	This government is initiating through the Minister of Human 
Resources Development a national strategy on social reform. 
The Prime Minister is chairing a national forum on health care. 
Is it not time for the federal government in consultation with the 
provinces to initiate a national strategy on deficit reduction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly the thrust of the hon. 
member's question is one we would agree with completely.
<P>
	As the member knows, at the first federal-provincial finance 
ministers meeting we discussed that very subject and at the 
second meeting in Halifax we put a great deal of meat on the 
bones. In fact we want to develop a common effort between us 
toward reducing the terrible burden of deficit and debt that the 
nation suffers from.
<P>
	We recognize very clearly that there really is only one 
taxpayer. There is one Canadian who shoulders the burden of 
federal, provincial and municipal debts. We intend to deal with 
it jointly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of the 
hon. minister's answer, I ask the minister the following:
<P>
	First of all, what are the targets and objectives that the 
minister is establishing for the federal government along with 
the provinces in terms of a deficit reduction strategy?
<P>
	Second, in co-ordination with that question, is the minister 
prepared to make this the number one item on the agenda of the 
finance ministers meeting in June? Out of that meeting will 
there come specific targets and objectives not only for the 
federal government but the provinces as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows the federal 
government's point of view is that we have explicit deficit 
reduction targets.
<P>
	We are certainly prepared, as we have done at the previous 
two meetings, to have that on the agenda. I can assure him it will 
be on the agenda for the meeting that will be held in June. 
Depending upon those discussions, if we are able to come up 
with national objectives, this is one Minister of Finance who 
would certainly support the concept.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
government's plan for deficit reduction one of the objects is to 
reduce the transfer payments to provinces. The minister knows 
the consequences of doing that.
<P>
	First of all, we offload part of the federal deficit problem on 
the provinces. Second, by removing funding from the provinces 
in terms of transfers without easing the obligation in terms of 
funding services, we create a problem for the provinces.
<P>
	Will the minister deal with that question in full co-operation 
and full discussion with the provinces so that the provinces 
know what the actions of the federal government will be? They 
could therefore plan on a longer term basis their deficit 
reduction programs in co-operation with the federal 
government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we did at the 
January meeting. It is precisely what we did in the budget.
<P>
	At the January meeting I notified the provinces that we would 
not be unilaterally shifting debt on to them as previous 
governments had done simply in advance of their budgets.
<P>
	We told them there would be a moratorium of two years under 
which we would attempt through the good auspices of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development to renegotiate the 
whole fabric of our social programs. Therefore what we would 
really end up with would be more efficient programs, more cost 
effective programs. These programs in the end would not only 
save the federal government money, but would save the 
provincial governments money because they would be far more 
efficient.
<P>
	In other words, our goal is not to shift the burden on to the 
provinces; it is to give Canadians better service at a better price.

the Minister of Transport.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3997"> 3997 </A></B>
<P>
	The General Investment Corporation, the main shareholder 
of MIL Davie, yesterday approved the firm's business plan, 
which was also forwarded to the federal government. The 
General Investment Corporation said it would be willing to add 
$135 million to help revive MIL Davie.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that by postponing his decision, the 
way he has done for the last six months, on the construction of a 
ferry for the Magdalen Islands and on the development of the 
smart ship, he is also postponing this shipyard's recovery and 
putting in jeopardy thousands of jobs in the Quebec City area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I find it rather strange that in the same question the hon. member 
can say that the business plan of MIL Davie was given to us 
yesterday and then accuse me of having delayed my decision six 
months. Please, let us be serious.
<P>
	The reason why the decision on the ferry has not been 
announced yet, and why the Minister of Transport is waiting, is 
that we want to act in the best interest of the Magdalen Islanders. 
We want to provide them with a ferry service between the 
islands and Prince Edward Island which would be adequate, 
effective and safe. To that end, we are trying to negotiate a 
solution with MIL Davie.
<P>
	You should learn to be fair and to react positively to 
government initiatives taken precisely with a view to help you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister should 
remember that the Prime Minister and his chief of staff saw the 
business plan before and during the election campaign. Now that 
he has everything in front of him, now that all the interested 
groups-the unions and the Conseil du patronat-in the Quebec 
City area are in agreement, what he is waiting for before 
deciding?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
since this matter is of great interest to the people who use the 
ferry, I will try to be as objective as possible.
<P>
	To suggest that the Prime Minister and his chief of staff had 
the business plan during the election campaign, after saying it 
was handed to us yesterday, this is assuming that we are damn 
stupid.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the minister to talk to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, the service between Prince Edward 
Island and the Magdalen Islands is absolutely essential and part 
of my responsibilities as Minister of Transport. We would have 
liked to have been able to answer months ago the legitimate 
request, made years ago, to replace the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I>.
<P>
	Now that a business plan has been made public, I am sure that 
with Minister Tremblay from Quebec, whom I met this week 
with my colleague the Minister of Industry, we will take all the 
necessary means to find a solution,  not only for the people who 
need a ferry, but also for the workers of MIL Davie. It would 
help if hon. members knew the case a little better.

question is for the government House leader. In spite of twice 
trying, the government House leader has been unable to 
persuade the Senate to pass Bill C-18 and stop electoral 
redistribution.
<P>
	Yesterday a Senate committee passed substantial amendments 
to the bill. Will the government give serious consideration to 
these amendments, or better yet, withdraw its support for Bill 
C-18 and stop the waste of Parliament's time and money on this 
legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, it is the government's intention with Bill C-18 not to 
stop redistribution but to give the House an opportunity to 
review and update the process which has not been reviewed fully 
since it came into effect in 1964.
<P>
	Second, I do not think it is appropriate for me to comment on a 
report of the other place. The other place as a whole has not yet 
dealt in a final way with Bill C-18. When it does we here will 
have to take into consideration the final decision of the Senate 
and I am sure we will do that very actively.

process has reached a point where, even if public hearings were

recommendations and allow the public hearings to go on in order 
that the commissions may submit their reports without 
undemocratic and unconstitutional intervention called for in 
Bill C-18?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

Freedoms.
<P>
	Furthermore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on 
the activities of a committee of the other place before the other 
place has even made a final decision.
<P>
	If the hon. member is concerned about this matter he should 
reflect on why, when this bill was before the House, he was

be very careful about characterizing the issue of employment or 
unemployment as a Quebec versus Canada issue.
<P>
	If he will review what I answered, what I said was that there 
were 115,000 new jobs created since February across the 
country and that in the province of Quebec since August of 1993 
there were 74,000 jobs created. Those numbers are not for the 
same period: 74,000 jobs in Quebec since August 1993; 115,000

February. That is what I said. That is what I stand by.

same problem. I would be ready to hold public hearings to look 
for ways and means to finance the transportation services that 
are needed. We did identify problems, we did listen to people, 
and we continue to do so. We have consultations with provinces 
and interest groups, but the big problem nobody has ever found a 
way to solve is the financial problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the minister admits there is a serious problem, how does he 
intend to solve it since the cost of regional transportation is 
rising at the expense of citizens? And how does he intend to 
solve this problem and help people find solutions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> It is a very 
good question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The need to find solutions and to prepare proposals that we 
can present to the House and to the people of Canada are what we 
are working on every day.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	We expect to come before the House to present what we 
consider to be alternatives to existing situations, but I want to 
point out that the fundamental problem does not change. It is 
how to finance an efficient national transportation system that 
includes road, rail, maritime and air.
<P>
	No one professes, and certainly not the Minister of Transport, 
to have the answer to all those problems. We have studied the 
problems to death. We know the solutions rest entirely on our 
ability to pay for that affordable integrated national 
transportation system. That is what we will try to present to the 
people of Canada and to the House as soon as we can.

	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question today is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	Given the frugal style of our current Prime Minister and 
members of Parliament, with no Cadillacs, no massive 
redecorating and no Gucci shoes, what plan does the minister 
have to review the printing budgets of various crown 
corporations and government agencies so that the publications 
reflect this image, particularly with respect to cutbacks in the 
costs of producing flashy annual reports?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for bringing the matter to the 
attention of the House both in the question today and in the 
member's statement a few days ago.
<P>
	Crown corporations operate independently. They make their 
own decisions about their annual reports. Indeed their annual 
reports are frequently used as sales tools in advertising and 
promotion of their products or services.
<P>
	I appreciate the point the hon. member makes. Frugality is a 
style of the government. I will bring that to the attention of 
crown corporations and ask that they look at the cost factor in 
what they are putting together and look at the recyclable aspect 
of the paper they are using.
<P>
	I invite the ministers to whom many of these crown 
corporations report to join me in bringing it to their attention 
and asking them to review it.

is for the minister of aboriginal affairs.
<P>
	On April 30, Phil Fontaine, Grand Chief for the Assembly of 
Manitoba Chiefs, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Aboriginal self-government includes gaining jurisdiction over everything 
governments now do for First Nations, including control of lands, health care, 
justice, education and other areas which now constitutionally belong under 
provincial jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does the minister agree with Mr. Fontaine's definition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, under the Tory regime, as the hon. 
member knows, gaming was transferred to the provinces. 
Several of the provinces are putting up gaming regimes and are 
dealing with aboriginal people.
<P>
	For instance, the best example I can give is in the province of 
Saskatchewan where an agreement was worked out with the 
FSIN for two casinos, one in Saskatoon and one in Regina, and 
there will be a split on income.
<P>
	If the provinces decide to proceed to move jurisdiction over to 
the aboriginal people, to share jurisdiction or to have 
co-management, I think it would be a favourable result. As far 
as whether it is part of the self-government negotiations, it is 
not as far as federal government is concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure 
my question was answered. My question was not on jurisdiction 
over gaming. My question was on jurisdiction over health care, 
justice, education and lands. Perhaps the minister could answer 
my question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize; I did not hear the 
subjects.
<P>
	In Manitoba right now there are four subject matters being 
negotiated. I think the hon. member is familiar with them. We 
will be negotiating health, education, fire and police protection, 
and aboriginal courts. At least 10 subject matters will be 
negotiated with aboriginal people that will eventually define 
self-government.

<P>
	Yesterday, the Government of Alberta appealed a decision 
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a person's sexual 
orientation and an Ontario court refused to recognize the rights 
of same-sex couples, invoking the definitions of marital and 
spousal status contained in the Ontario's Charter of Human 
Rights.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have the intention of 
bringing forward an amendment to the Human Rights Act to 
prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation this 
year, probably in the fall.
<P>

was repeated in the Throne Speech. It is a course to which we are 
committed.

question?
<P>

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> As I said, Mr. Speaker, our timetable 
contemplates introduction of the legislation probably in the fall.
<P>
	Speaking for myself, I do not think matters of public policy 
should be determined in the courts. It is expensive for the 
litigants, and one ends up with a patchwork of public policy that 
is not always in the interest of Canada.
<P>

approach that Canada has taken in ensuring that universal 
health care is a cornerstone of public policy in this country.
<P>
	As a result of that conversation we have agreed to share 
information. I have been in discussions with our Minister of 
Health. In fact I am receiving from Mrs. Clinton some good 
ideas about how their operations are going to work once they are 
able to break through the kinds of logjams of lobbies that have 
unfortunately stymied the American health system to date.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe some day the government will learn that Canadians are 
more impressed by and more desirous of an efficient, 
compassionate health care system than they are with a name 
dropping Deputy Prime Minister.

the procurement of heavy logistic vehicles ending in 1995 has 
been entered into with UTDC providing that this company 
guarantee economic spin-off estimated at 156,6 million dollars. 
However, when the last vehicle was delivered, in May 1992, 
only $16,7 million had accrued to the government.
<P>
	Since that contract is almost over, could the minister of 
National Defence tell us why that company has not met the 
federal government requirements with respect to the $156,6 
million economic spin-off that had been promised?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

somewhat amused the Bloc Quebecois, a party that campaigned 
in the federal election campaign for reduction of defence 
expenditures by 25 per cent, is so preoccupied with defence 
contract matters.
<P>
	With respect to the specific question the hon. member raises, I 
should tell him that about 50,000 contracts are let at national 
defence. There are about $2 billion to $3 billion worth of 
acquisitions on the go at any one time.

<P>

<P>
	Recently we learned that the overseas tax credit, a tax 
initiative for Canadians working abroad, is not applicable to 
Canadians who work for foreign based companies. This tax 
credit allowed foreign companies to hire qualified Canadians, 
thus providing us with jobs and foreign income that was spent 
in Canada.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why he did not grant an exemption 
to foreign companies already receiving the credit so that they 
could maintain foreign income, Canadian jobs, and that the 
revenue and jobs would not be lost?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I understand the law that would be beyond my 
powers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very hard 
answer or non-answer to take.
<P>
	While jobs have been lost, while investment has been lost and 
now because the department is going back to 1991, people are 
actually going to lose their homes. It is very difficult to 
understand why the minister cannot explain his policy. I would 
ask him to examine this again and come back to the House with 
an answer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will certainly accept the suggestion of the hon. 
member to re-examine the case. As I explained in my response 
to the first question, I understand this is in fact something that is 
beyond my powers because the law is written in a certain way.
<P>
	As members of the House know, the Minister of National 
Revenue is very circumscribed in what he can do by laws made 
by Parliament.
<P>
	I do feel, however, that it does show a substantive difference

<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before the break in the question period, like all of my 
colleagues present here today, including the Reform Party 
members, I mentioned the non-transparency of the government 
in the cancellation of the Pearson Airport privatization. 
Afterwards, I spoke of the general lack of transparency on the 
part of the government each time they are asked to open the 
books to the public whether in the House or in committee.
<P>
	Added to that is the fact that when there is no transparency, 
someone has to be blamed for the way things are going. So they 
talked about welfare recipients and the unemployed. I heard the 
Deputy Prime Minister say this morning, in reply to a Reform 
Party question, that the question was a vicious attack on the 
unemployed when in fact it was absolutely reasonable.
<P>
	I would like to remind the Deputy Prime Minister that the 
most vicious attack against the unemployed and welfare 
recipients was made by her own government and the Prime 
Minister himself when he accused all the unemployed of being 
beer-guzzling couch potatoes.
<P>
	Then they tried to blame the whole thing on Quebec's whims. 
If everything is going wrong in Canada, it is due to some passing 
fancy of that province. But it is a well-known fact that all of 
Canada's history can be reduced to Quebec's attempt to obtain 
real powers within Confederation. We only have to remember 
the various commissions that followed one after the other and 
that cost an enormous amount of money: Laurendeau-Dunton, 
Pépin-Robarts, Spicer, Beaudoin-Dobbie, Castonguay-Dobbie, 
Dobbie-Dobbie, and so on ad infinitum, up until the Meech 
Lake and Charlottetown Accord failures.
<P>
	Non-transparency also in the way the facts are presented. 
Another issue was raised this morning. Another 65,000 
Canadians have joined the ranks of the unemployed. When the 
Deputy Prime Minister was asked how she could explain this, 
she told us that these 65,000 people had regained hope at last. In 
reality, these 65,000  people have lost their jobs, so we have 
non-transparency in the way the facts are presented.
<P>
	They suggested that if things were not going well in the 
country, it was because of separatists, when we know full well 
that the Moody's credit-rating agency has just issued a warning 
to the government. If things are not going well in Canada, it is 
not because of separatists, it is because we owe $500 billion to 
our bankers, because we are unable to pay them and because we 
swear to them that in three years we will owe them $600 billion. 
That is serious.
<P>
	As far as separatists are concerned, I remind this hon. House 
that Senator Ted Kennedy, who has been around for a while, said 
that Quebec sovereignty would not be a problem, that they could 
live with it. If Quebec opted for sovereignty, Americans would 
not have a problem with that.
<P>
	And this too is part of the non-transparency. I remember the 
Prime Minister jokingly indicated to this House that 
construction of a high-speed train could not be seriously 
contemplated because there could be a border between Quebec 
and Ontario. In fact, there has been a statement on this subject 
today. In Europe, high-speed trains run across all the countries 
and nobody seems to have a problem with that. A high-speed 
train running through the recently opened Chunnel will link two 
countries and that does not seem to cause any problems.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Every day, hundreds of trains circulate freely between the 
United States and Canada, and that does not appear to create any 
problem. Yet, there seems to be difficulties when trains travel 
between Quebec and Ontario. Therefore, I think that the facts 
are totally misrepresented. The presentation of those facts lacks 
transparency.
<P>
	It is also suggested-again by the Prime Minister-that we 
are afraid of him coming to Quebec during the next election or 
referendum campaign. Indeed, I must recognize that we are 
afraid, but we are afraid that he might not come.
<P>
	There are many issues which require greater transparency, 
and there are many people in Quebec who have very specific 
questions to ask to the Prime Minister on these issues, including 
his role in the decision to impose the War Measures Act in 
Quebec, which resulted in hundreds of people being beaten up, 
imprisoned and deprived of their rights. In fact, all Quebecers 
were deprived of their rights. Yet, the facts clearly demonstrated 
later that there was no justification for such action.
<P>
	Quebecers also have questions to ask the Prime Minister 
regarding the unilateral patriation of the Canadian Constitution, 
a decision which was unanimously rejected by Quebec's 
Nation-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4005"> 4005 </A></B>
<P>
al Assembly. They have questions to ask him about the night 
those long knives were planted in Mr. René Lévesque's back.  
They also have questions regarding the kiss to Clyde Wells, 
when the Meech Lake Accord failed, and when, unfortunately, 
the Quebec Premier was on his knees, and even crawling, to get a 
<I>minimum minimorum</I> for our province.
<P>
	The major issue which will have to be debated in a few months 
with absolute transparency, although I am not sure that we can 
trust the government to do that, is this: Why should Quebec keep 
25 per cent of the voting shares of a country which is literally 
going bankrupt?
<P>
	To conclude, I believe that greater transparency is required on 
the government's part and we will monitor its actions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We are getting into bad habits. 
Members who wish to speak have to stand if they want to be 
recognized.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker. I thought we agreed 
this morning that there would only be 10-minute speeches, with 
no question or comment period.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think the Chair is partly to blame, but 
you have to remember that, in practice, members of all parties 
can rise if they want to carry on with the debate. That is why 
when I rise and see that no one wants to take the floor, I feel kind 
of compelled to ask the question. I will now recognize the hon. 
member for Brome-Missisquoi.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Péloquin:</B> We should follow the right order, Mr. Speaker, 
if you do not mind. According to the list, I think you should 
recognize the hon. member for Louis-Hébert.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry accused the official opposition of using stalling tactics 
to delay the passage of Bill C-22.
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member that he is absolutely right. By 
opposing this piece of legislation, we are delaying 
compensation payments the government cannot wait to pay to its 
friends, under section 11 of Bill C-22.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois put forward an amendment to Bill C-22 
respecting certain agreements concerning the redevelopment 
and operation of Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson 
International Airport, which gives me the opportunity to 
complete the picture I began to draw last week. In fact, I began 
to compare the situation at airports in various cities with the 
situation at the Jean-Lesage Airport, in my riding.
<P>
	I wanted to demonstrate how unfairly the Quebec airport was 
being treated, by raising a number of issues, including the areas 
occupied by airports in several provincial capitals. As you will 
remember, Mr. Speaker, except for the airports in St. John's, 
Newfoundland, and in Charlottetown, Regina, Yellowknife and 
Whitehorse, airports in every other capital city occupied larger 
areas than the airport in Quebec City. I also provided data on the 
terminal facilities themselves. You will remember that airports 
in Ottawa, Winnipeg, Halifax and Edmonton have no cause to 
envy the Jean-Lesage International Airport, quite the contrary 
since they all have a greater surface area, that is an additional 
6,000, 12,000 and 24,000 square metres respectively.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The demonstration I made last week also showed that, 
between 1988 and 1992, transborder and international flights 
have increased much more at the Quebec airport, at an average 
ratio of 10 to 1 compared to other airports.
<P>
	After that speech, instead of being outraged at such an 
injustice towards the people of the Quebec City area, a member 
opposite said my evidence was ``bordering on slander''. Let me 
remind this House that the data supporting my demonstration all 
come from Transport Canada reports. In these days when 
communication techniques have improved by leaps and bounds, 
such abysmal ignorance is totally inadmissible, even more so 
for a member of the House.
<P>
	Therefore, I wish all members of the government, instead of 
refusing to admit reality and resorting to insults, would examine 
quite objectively the motivations supporting Quebecers' desire 
to leave the Canadian federation; they are simply convinced that 
it is not beneficial for them and that it cannot be improved.
<P>
	Last October 25, Quebec elected 54 members from the Bloc 
Quebecois because voters were convinced that the defence of 
Quebec's interests could not be left to the two big national 
parties, both of which having centralizing tendencies. It is 
therefore in keeping with my mandate to defend Quebec's 
interests that I pursue in the same vein as last week.
<P>
	We see the same unfairness in the area of research and 
development applied to transport. According to the 
Transportation Research and Development Board, Quebec had 
45 per cent of the research capability in 1987 and 55 per cent in 
1989; however, it only got a few crumbs as far as investment is 
concerned: 19 per cent from 1983 to 1986; 16 per cent from 1986 
to 1991; and 12.3 per cent in 1991.
<P>
	Therefore, the more research and development capability we 
had in the transportation sector, the less money we were getting. 
It is like trying to square the circle. You probably have to be 
federalist to understand. When confidence is lost, the 
responsibility for restoring it does not rest with the one who lost 
it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4006"> 4006 </A></B>
<P>
	I will continue to accumulate proofs that Quebec City airport 
is being treated unfairly. In the summer of 1993, the federal 
government, to try and woo some voters, gave Quebec City 
airport international status. Considering how antiquated and 
small the terminal is, a promise of modernization should have 
been made at the same time. But it was not forthcoming, Mr. 
Speaker, on the contrary.
<P>
	Since then, Transport Canada is continuing its demolition 
derby at the Quebec City Airport. Despite all attempts by 
economists and politicians from the area, it is sticking with its 
plan of shutting down the radar air and traffic control room. On 
April 1st, the security services normally provided by the RCMP 
were withdrawn. It is important to note that out of the eight 
airports affected by this mean decision, Quebec City airport is 
by far the most important.
<P>
	To be convinced of this, suffice it to name the other airports 
affected by this decision: St. John's, Newfoundland, Moncton, 
Windsor, London, Regina, Saskatoon and Victoria.
<P>
	But the carelessness and lack of responsibility of Transport 
Canada did not stop there. Against its own safety rules, 
Transport Canada is poised to reduce the fire fighting service at 
Quebec City airport. According to Transport Canada this airport 
belongs to group 6. In an international airport of this category, 
the fire department must be operational 24 hours a day; 
however, at the Quebec City airport, there is no service between 
1 a.m. and 7 a.m.
<P>
	At the Quebec City airport, the category 6 rescue service is 
geared to handle planes measuring a maximum of 128 feet in 
length. However the Air Canada Boeing 767 which serves 
Quebec City three times a week is 160 feet long; the Air Transat 
and Royal Lockheed 1011s, which use Quebec City airport 
several times a week, are 180 feet long; the Air Transat Boeings, 
which land regularly in Quebec City, are 155 feet long.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Far be it from me to prevent these planes from coming to 
Quebec City; it is up to Transport Canada to make its fire 
department comply with its own regulations and not to air 
carriers to abandon a lucrative market.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport, who can only talk about safety 
when asked questions in this House, is poised to eliminate one 
fire truck and to lay-off one fireman. Because of this decision, 
Transport Canada will probably have to downgrade the status of 
the Jean-Lesage Airport. This is how it develops air 
transportation in Quebec, and prepares for Quebec 2002 and the 
increasing needs for efficient and modern means of 
transportation. If the federal government wanted to make sure 
that Quebecers would vote in favour of sovereignty at the next 
referendum, it could not do any better than this.
<P>
	Let us now compare Toronto airport with Montreal airports. 
When the government decided to privatize major Canadian 
airports, Transport Canada turned over the most profitable one, 
the Toronto airport, to the private sector, and Montreal airport to 
a non-profit corporation. This is much to the credit of 
stakeholders in Montreal, but the same cannot be said of those in 
Toronto.
<P>
	As if this picture of political power at work in Canada were 
not bleak enough already, in Transport Canada's newsletters for 
February and April, you can read about investments the 
department plans to make in construction projects in Canadian 
airports. In Thunder Bay, construction from January to October; 
in Toronto, from April to December; In Ottawa, from May to 
December; in Lac-du-Bonnet, Manitoba, from May to August; 
in Saskatoon, from June to August; in Vancouver, from June 
1994 to June 1995. And back in Ontario, from May to October, 
construction in the Hamilton, Oshawa, London, Muskoka, 
Sault-Ste. Marie, Timmins and Windsor airports. In Quebec, 
sweet nothing!
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to quote remarks from the Minister 
of Transport himself, as reported in a press release from 
Transport Canada dated February 10, 1994: ``The federal 
government will not patch up Lester B. Pearson International 
Airport. Decisions regarding development plans will be tied 
directly to those regarding the administrative structure of the 
airport. I am anxious to hear what all the federal members of 
Parliament from the greater Toronto area, members who are here 
to represent the interests of their constituents, will have to say 
on the subject. I am confident they will reflect faithfully the 
majority opinion of their communities. If they can achieve a 
consensus on the future of number one airport in Canada, the 
government will comply with their recommendations''.
<P>
	That is precisely the attitude the Quebec City region is asking 
from the Minister of Transport, because a consensus has existed 
for quite a while in our region to keep the terminal control unit, 
build a new control tower as well as expand and modernize the 
Jean-Lesage International Airport.
<P>
	As for the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry's agog over the delays caused by this debate on 
investments to be made at the Toronto airport, it leaves me cold 
as a January morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-22 is a perfect example of these ``scorpio'' bills to which 
the Liberal Party has accustomed us. Innocuous at first sight, it 
can become disastrous if one is not careful. Bill C-22 is only 
four pages long and contains only twelve short sections. But 
beware! The fatal sting is in clause 10, which provides that 
developers who lose a deal as a result of public pressure may be 
entitled to compensation. Liberals could  not really drop their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4007"> 4007 </A></B>
<P>
old friends. They found there a particularly deceptive way of 
giving them satisfaction.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	By introducing Bill C-22, the Liberal government gives even 
more strength to the Bloc Quebecois' campaign slogan which 
roughly translates as: ``Giving ourselves real power''. Indeed, 
last october 25, Quebecers gave themselves real power in 
Ottawa. Not the power to favour friends of the government, not 
the power to grant lucrative contracts to companies that gave 
money to the party or are able to hire the services of large 
lobbyists firms. No, Mr. Speaker, real power! The power to 
defend the interests of real people, the interests of all those who 
are indignant about questionable initiatives such as Bill C-22.
<P>
	It is no wonder that some members opposite question the 
legitimacy of the Bloc Quebecois. It is difficult for them to 
accept the presence, in this House, of members whose party did 
not get any financial support from large corporations. It is not 
necessarily because of ideological or political differences that 
the financial establishment did not support the Bloc Quebecois 
during the electoral campaign. In fact, several companies have 
clearly expressed their support to the Bloc and wanted to give it 
funds. Our party simply refused to play the games of the 
lobbyists. Our legitimacy rests on people, not on corporations.
<P>
	As you know, when a company or an association asks to meet 
a member of the Official Opposition, that member does not have 
to follow the same ritual than a Liberal member. It is not 
necessary to look on the electoral list to decide upon the length 
of the interview or the interest that must be given to it. The only 
criterion which is used to determine the political agenda of a 
member from the Bloc Quebecois is the defence of the interests 
of the people from Quebec. Do the Liberal members really think 
that people are stupid enough as to believe that a person who 
contributed five dollars to the Liberal Party fund is going to get 
the same attention as a multinational which contributed 
$100,000?
<P>
	I would like to clarify one thing just to make sure I am not 
going to be misunderstood here. I am not saying that the 
ministers and government members who received contributions 
from companies are all corrupt and ill-intentioned. Not at all! I 
rather look at those poor Liberal or Conservative members as 
victims. They are the victims of a legislative tradition that 
allowed the institutionalization of a patronage system in which 
only the rich can be heard. The only way to restore the system 
would be to eliminate the donations companies make to political 
parties by amending the legislation.
<P>
	The old parties reject such a measure. According to them, 
there is no need to amend the federal legislation on political 
financing which is so beneficial to them. If people want to be 
heard, they can turn to a lobbyist firm. This mentality is so 
deeply entrenched in Canadian political habits that the 
government members feel they  have to do things as usual in 
order to be true to tradition. I can understand that, but I do not 
understand why they refuse to amend the rules that force them to 
figure out all kinds of schemes to please their generous donors.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	As our dauntless Prime Minister often says, it is a question of 
dignity. I would even say it is a question of public morality. Not 
an obtuse and puritan kind of morality, but one that is based on 
honour and respect for the most fundamental principles of a 
democracy such as ours.
<P>
	By giving compensation to those who tried to swindle the 
country, Bill C-22 confirms the opinion of some who are 
increasingly convinced that the House of Commons is there to 
defend the interests of the rich like Power Corporation and 
Seagram's and not those of the ordinary people.
<P>
	If the original sale of Pearson International Airport was a 
flagrant mistake on the part of the Tory government, the 
compensations provided for in Bill C-22 are nothing short of 
criminal. As the member for York South-Weston rightly said in 
this House, it is a sting of the worst kind. I say to the government 
it should be careful because, as dangerous as it might be, a 
scorpion can always be crushed. As we have seen on last October 
25, Quebec's population knows very well where to stomp.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will 
remember that in the last election campaign, the Liberal Party 
and its leader kept on saying that if elected, they intended to lead 
this country with honesty, integrity and openness and that they 
wanted to consult the people and Parliament, either in this 
House or in various committees.
<P>
	However, I think that we can question this government's real 
desire to really consult and to be open. Yes, we have had some 
debates in this House that are rather unique in Canadian history, 
debates on fundamental issues like the presence of Canadian UN 
troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia, and on cruise 
missile testing on Canadian territory.
<P>
	But often we feel that we are involved in these debates in a 
very symbolic way, since we sense that the debates are being 
used to legitimize decisions that have already been made by the 
government. One reason that I think we can question the 
government's real desire to listen to what is going on in this 
House is Bill C-22. For two weeks, my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois and in the Reform Party have spoken in this House to 
explain why we think this bill is unfair and unacceptable, but the 
government seems to pay no attention to what we say in this 
House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4008"> 4008 </A></B>
<P>
	Liberal members rise one after another to defend this bill 
which we think is completely unacceptable. We think that the 
very principle of privatizing Pearson Airport is questionable.
<P>
	The unethical nature of this affair and the shady dealings 
surrounding the signing of the contract to privatize Pearson 
Airport have been brought to light. My colleague from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve this morning raised a very 
interesting question: why were they so keen on privatizing 
Pearson Airport?
<P>
	It was and still is the most profitable airport in Canada. In 
1993, it generated profits of about $23 million, according to 
what we were told. So why privatize it, especially since the 
approach proposed by the Conservative government at the time 
was to entrust airport administration to local authorities, to turn 
the administration of airports over to those people who were 
most aware of the needs of the region. Even so, and in spite of its 
own airport management policy, the government decided to go 
ahead and privatize Pearson Airport.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We saw how swiftly they proceeded with the privatization of 
Pearson Airport, and called for tenders within 90 days for the 
contracts to manage Terminals 1 and 2. As of 1992, only two 
bids had been received, one from Paxport and the other from 
Claridge, which already managed Terminal 3. The government 
awarded the contract to Paxport, without even bothering to 
check the financial stability of the company.
<P>
	What happened next? Paxport was forced to merge with 
Claridge. Yet, Paxport had been the preferred choice precisely 
so that Claridge would not have a monopoly over the 
management of the three terminals. Finally, the two companies 
merged under the name of Pearson Development Corporation, 
and a contract with the consortium was concluded within one 
day, at the very end of the election campaign. Up to then, the 
Liberal Party had kept relatively quiet about the deal.
<P>
	Considering the public's reaction, the Liberal Party promised 
to cancel the contract as soon as it took over the reins of 
government.
<P>
	There was then some consensus among the public, the media, 
the Liberal Party, the Ontario Government and the Bloc 
Quebecois that this deal, which was especially profitable for the 
parties concerned and especially harmful to passengers, had to 
be cancelled. It was said that the Pearson Development 
Corporation intended to raise passenger fees from $2 to $7, 
which would have generated additional revenues of $100 
million.
<P>
	The first logical thing for the government to do would 
naturally have been to cancel this deal without any 
compensation whatsoever and to undertake a serious, 
independent and open public inquiry into the circumstances of 
this deal and into the role played by lobbyists. Such an inquiry 
could have helped to distinguish stakeholders who acted in good 
faith from  those who did not. And it could have allowed us to 
eventually compensate, if need be, parties who are entitled to 
compensation and to do so according to a public and open 
process.
<P>
	The government might also have ensured that this never 
happens again by amending the Lobbyists Registration Act, thus 
allowing greater control of lobbyists. It might also, as the Bloc 
Quebecois keeps proposing in this House even if its proposition 
is never taken up by the government, have passed an act on the 
funding of political parties similar to the one in Quebec, which 
stipulates, first, that only voters have a right to contribute 
money to political parties, second, that there is a maximum 
contribution not to be exceeded and, also, that any donation in 
the amount of $100 or more must be made public.
<P>
	Of course, such an act would prevent any suspicious collusion 
between major corporations and old federal political parties. 
Any new attempt on the part of the government to interfere in the 
Pearson Airport situation should be based upon openness, 
integrity and co-operation between all three levels of 
government and the various local groups involved.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Instead, after the election, the government decided to proceed 
with an internal inquiry, led by a former treasurer of Ontario, 
Mr. Robert Nixon, a very respectable man, I agree, who came to 
some very harsh conclusions about this famous contract signed 
by the previous government. Despite all of this, the government 
introduced Bill C-22, which leads us to believe that it is payback 
time for its old political friends.
<P>
	Clause 9 of Bill C-22 states that there will be no 
compensation for any loss of profit or any fee paid for the 
purpose of lobbying. But in clause 10, the Minister of Transport 
is given the authority to provide, as he sees it, any compensation 
he considers appropriate to businesses he feels are entitled to be 
compensated.
<P>
	In conclusion, I just want to add that section 8.6.3 of the 
request for proposal clearly stated that the companies would not 
be compensated. It said that all costs and expenditures incurred 
by the bidders for the preparation of the proposals are payable 
by the bidders. The government will not be obliged to cover 
these costs and expenditures, or to reimburse or compensate 
promoters, under any circumstances, including the refusal of the 
proposal and the cancellation of the project.
<P>
	If those companies were aware, at the time of the tendering 
process, that they could not be compensated, why are they now 
expecting compensation from the government? This is 
unacceptable, and we will continue to oppose this measure and 
to use all our allotted time to stop this bill from being passed and 
get to the bottom of this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4009"> 4009 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the next speaker, 
I want to apologize to the hon. member for not warning him 
that his time was almost up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
discuss the privatization of Pearson Airport, in Toronto, from 
the perspective of a resident of Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean. 
What does a resident of Jonquière or Saint-Félicien see when he 
watches TV and hears about this project? He sees that the 
privatization of Pearson Airport was quickly and hastily decided 
during the last election campaign. Pearson Airport is not a lame 
duck; it is not a venture in deficit. It is profitable airport; in fact, 
it is one of the most profitable airports in Canada. Some civil 
servants in Ontario claimed that this privatization would cost 
somewhere between $140 million and $240 million annually.
<P>
	The resident of Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean who is watching 
sees hundreds of millions go by. However, behind the scenes he 
also sees lobbyists who are friends of the government. He sees 
Conservatives, Liberals, former deputy ministers and senior 
civil servants hired by lobbies, and businesspeople used to 
getting lucrative government contracts and attending 
Conservative and Liberal fund raising dinners at $1,000 a plate.
<P>
	The resident of Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean then compares 
this situation to the needs of his region, which are important 
needs. The history of our region goes back 150 years. It is a 
region with a glorious industrial past. Our region's development 
was based on natural resources: our forests provided paper, 
while lumber and hydro-electricity were used for primary 
aluminum.
<P>
	In my riding, Alcan's Arvida plant was at one time the world's 
largest aluminum plant. Back in 1943, the Shipshaw hydro 
station in my riding generated the most hydroelectric power in 
the world. That is what I mean when I refer to our glorious past.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	As for the present, the region is still fairing relatively well. It 
is home to seven pulp and paper plants and to four primary 
aluminium plants. However, it is also experiencing major 
economic problems. In the past few months, the official 
unemployment rate-not the unofficial, but the official rate-in 
the greater Chicoutimi-Jonquière region was the highest in 
Canada. The rate is unbelievably high. For a region that lived 
through the golden age of industry, this situation raises a number 
of questions.
<P>
	We all know the reasons for this situation and we have 
analyzed them on different occasions in the region. One reason 
cited is technological conversion, the fact that our major 
industries have modernized their operations. That is quite 
normal. Another reason is globalization. A company like Alcan 
is investing around the world. Finally, the region's economic 
woes can also be attributed to the fact that more money is 
flowing out of, instead of into, the region. The Health and Social 
Services Board produced a study which found that our  region 
experienced an annual shortfall of more than $100 million. 
Imagine what could be accomplished with an extra $100 million 
in a region such as the Saguenay-Lac-Saint Jean, considering 
its needs and its population of roughly 300,000 people.
<P>
	Regional development policies have also been ill-conceived. 
Both the federal and the provincial governments have resorted 
to the old trick of divide and conquer. Year after year, the region 
is given several million dollars and left to decide how to allocate 
the funds. It is somewhat like throwing a bone to a pack of dogs 
and watching them fight over it.
<P>
	Meanwhile, no new regional development policies 
specifically geared to a region such as ours have been 
formulated. This too raises some questions.
<P>
	Despite everything, the region's future still seems bright. I 
can say this because residents are resisting the exodus of young 
people, the loss of jobs in our major industries and the rise in 
unemployment. At the Abitibi-Price and Alcan plants, the 
unions have taken steps, in co-operation with the different 
companies, to increase production and performance levels. 
Their actions are supported by the politicians.
<P>
	At the Vaudreuil plant, in Arvida, a plant providing 
employment to about 1,200 people, the union asked Alcan to 
make investments in order to make that plant even more 
profitable than it is now. The 54 Bloc Quebecois even supported 
in a petition the Vaudreuil plant workers who are asking for 
investments.
<P>
	Politicians then, particularly in the sphere of influence of both 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois, are doing all they 
can to get new investments for the region.
<P>
	As people from the region, we are also asking for 
multinationals to re-invest locally some of the profits they 
derive from the development of our natural resources. Natural 
resources have been leased to big companies, whether it be 
Alcan or Price. Since these companies have been granted access 
to our resources, people ask that more substantial spin-offs 
benefit the region.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	This happened last year, when Alcan sold to Hydro-Quebec 
tens of millions of dollars in surplus electricity. This money was 
probably invested abroad or went to shareholders. If Alcan was 
allowed to develop our rivers, it is because it promoted job 
creation and not dividends to its shareholders.
<P>
	We ask that these funds be reinvested in the region. I would 
even go so far, Mr. Speaker, as to ask that an investment funds be 
set up with the money generated from these surpluses in order to 
promote the development of small and medium-sized business 
in that area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4010"> 4010 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, what we really need are the tools 
for our development: a radical decentralization and the powers 
required to make our decisions. In the same way that Quebec 
wants to acquire these powers by becoming a sovereign State, 
at the regional level, we want to have a say in the 
decision-making process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I have been hearing for several days now what 
members opposite are saying about this Bill C-22 and I note the 
interest that my speech seems to generate. Several members are 
getting ready to listen carefully to what I have to say. I can feel 
it, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	You see, members opposite are telling us, by way of an 
amendment, and I will read it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House declines to give second reading to Bill C-22, An Act respecting 
certain agreements concerning the redevelopment and operation of Terminals 1 
and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport-</BLOCKQUOTE>
and please take note of this,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-because the principle of the Bill is flawed due to the fact that it contains no 
provisions aimed at making the work done by lobbyists more transparent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, according to them, legislation to amend the 
Lobbyist Registration Act should be part of Bill C-22. I think 
that someone just said yes.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if the government had dared to amend public 
morality legislation, such as the acts on lobbyists or conflicts of 
interest, without the prior consent of the House, and had 
introduced it as a government bill, can you imagine what the 
members opposite would have said?
<P>
	I have worked on several occasions in the past on bills dealing 
with public morality. You will recall, I am sure, the bill of 1987, 
which came after the unanimous report of a parliamentary 
committee. I recall that members from all sides of the House 
were saying: ``Finally, we will have legislation on lobbyists 
because we worked together and not because the government 
dictated it, since a public morality matter must be part of a 
consensus''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All right. Then had we today introduced as a government 
without consultation with the opposition an amendment to the 
Lobbyist Registration Act inside a bill for the Toronto 
international airport, first of all we would have likely been out 
of order because that would have been an omnibus bill with no 
binding provisions in it to join the bill together. The Reform 
Party member across will know that is a prerequisite. In other 
words, there must be a mechanism to hold those two things 
together. If they were inside a bill there clearly would not have 
been then, and so it would have been out of order.
<P>
	Second, in the unlikely event that the bill would have been in 
order, those people across the way would have been the same 
ones to pooh-pooh-not to use any other words that would be 
unparliamentary-the efforts of the government because they 
would have said this is not the way to introduce a lobbyist 
registration bill.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is the way, says the member across the way. I 
think he had better make up his mind. I am looking forward to 
his speeches. How do they expect us to introduce those 
amendments to the LRA, the Lobbyist Registration Act?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It was an honour for me to work on two parliamentary 
committees dealing with lobbyist registration. Because of the 
defeat in the last election of certain members of other parties, I 
am the only member in this House left among those who worked 
on that issue.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We as a government have promised in the red book on page 94 
that we would amend the lobbyists-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Read the red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> My colleague challenges me to read the red 
book. I will read from the red book, page 94. All members must 
pay attention to this, it is very important-lobbying reform:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The lobbying industry has expanded enormously in Canada during the nine 
years of Conservative government. The integrity of government is put into 
question when there is a perception that the public agenda is set by lobbyists-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Serious concerns have been raised in the minds of Canadians-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to say that a Liberal government will move 
decisively to address these concerns. We will produce 
amendments to the Lobbyist Registration Act based on the 
report of the committee, the report that I have here. That is what 
we are going to do. That is what the opposition says it wants. 
Except that today it is asking us to put these amendments inside 
a bill for an airport. Is that a way to propose a bill involving 
public morality? I say no.
<P>
	My learned colleague from Moncton, learned in the law, says 
no. All my colleagues who know far better about these things 
say no. I am sure the members across say no.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I say to the hon. members, why do they not just 
withdraw this superfluous and trivial amendment? It has nothing 
to do with the subject that we are talking about. It is there to 
delay the passage of a bill, a bill that was promised as part of our 
commitment to the people of Canada that we would stop the 
nonsense that the Conservatives got into which was the giving 
away of one of our largest national assets, the Toronto 
international airport, more commonly known now as the 
Pearson airport.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have here the June 1993 Holtmann report to amend the 
Lobbyists Act. In its red book, the Liberal Party promises to 
enact the amendments proposed in this report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> When will Bill C-22 be passed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Soon, dear friends opposite.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I bet you that the day the bill is brought before 
this House, the members opposite will tell us that it should not 
be passed right away, that there must be a consensus, that it must 
be referred to a parliamentary committee, that hearings must be 
held. That is what they will tell us. And rightly so-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>-because it is a matter of public morality. That 
is the way it should be examined and not the opposite as 
proposed in today's motion.
<P>
	You see, they said yes to a bill with consensus, in-depth study 
and everything, but at the same time they tell us to hurry up and 
put it in an amendment to the bill before us. Make up your 
minds, ladies and gentlemen. You cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	It is one of our commitments to the Canadian people. We will 
honour this commitment despite the efforts of members 
opposite to prevent us from delivering on our promise to the 
people. We will do as we promised. We were elected on this 
commitment, and Liberals, as you know full well, always keep 
their promises.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-22 
proposed by the federal government is flawed since it contains 
no provisions aimed at making the work done by lobbyists more 
transparent.
<P>
	This bill just cancels one of the most important political 
scandals concocted by political friends and well-connected 
lobbyists. The government simply wants to put out the fire 
without anyone knowing how it was started in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, Liberals do not want to lift the veil on the whole 
issue of lobbying. If they are behaving in such a way, it is 
because they want to spare the people around them and not 
smear anyone, since they too are stuck with some powerful 
friends in the Pearson affair. And yet, the Prime Minister had 
promised to get right to the bottom of the circumstances 
surrounding the negotiation and agreement on the airport 
privatization.
<P>
	The results coming out of that promise are very small: a mere 
study done by a former Ontario Liberal minister behind closed 
doors and explaining to us that the political staff and lobbyists 
played an uncommon role in that affair. If the government wants 
to show that it is clean and transparent, it should order a public 
inquiry in the Pearson matter.
<P>
	I remind you that several Liberal members of the Toronto 
caucus were in favour of such an inquiry. But after realizing that 
the interests of some friends of the party were at stake, and not 
only of the Conservative Party, the government, or I should say 
the Prime Minister unenthusiastically fell back on a mere report 
produced behind closed doors, that is the Nixon report.
<P>
	When going through the list of people involved, one can 
easily make a close connection between these friends and 
lobbyists, and the previous Conservative administration and the 
present Liberal one.
<P>
	I would like to name a few actors that took part in the deal: Pat 
MacAdam, Conservative lobbyist and schoolmate of Brian 
Mulroney; Bill Fox, a crafty fox of lobbying and a Conservative, 
ex-media relations officer and personal friend of Brian 
Mulroney; Harry Near, lobbyist for the Conservatives and an old 
member of the party. Also, Hugh Riopelle, lobbyist and 
strong-man of the Mulroney cabinet; Fred Doucet, always 
closely or remotely tied to that party that was almost wiped out 
of this House. There is also John Llegate, a good friend of 
Michael Wilson. And finally Don Matthews who is the king of 
the ex: ex-president of the nomination campaign of Brian 
Mulroney in 1983, ex-president of the Conservative Party and 
ex-president of the fund-raising campaign for the same party.
<P>
	All those people gave a helping hand to cook the biggest Tory 
pie in the history of Canada. But with pies, it is the same as with 
puddings: the proof is in the eating. We did not swallow that. 
However all those Tory angels, who always considered public 
interest as a priority, were not alone in the kitchen of the Pearson 
Airport.
<P>
	There were also Liberal angels and that is probably where the 
shoe pinches. It is surely for that reason that the royal 
commission of inquiry suddenly became the Nixon study. 
Transparency went out of the door. There were a few actors, 
namely senator Leo Kolber who is the specialist of private 
dinners at $1,000 a plate. For that price you can shake hands 
with the present Prime Minister. There must have been more 
than bread and butter served to guests on that evening, among 
whom was Charles Bronfman, also part of the Pearson deal.
<P>
	Bread, butter, dignity, pride, openness-all words used to 
excess by the people opposite. Come on! Let us have a bit of 
decency and respect for the low-income people of our society. 
Those people have a clear eye and know pretty well what friends 
discuss about during picnics at $1,000 a plate.
<P>
	In the Liberal group there was also Herb Metcalfe, a lobbyist 
for Capital Hill, representative of Claridge Properties and 
former organizer of the present Prime Minister. Ramsay 
Whitters, a Liberal lobbyist closely related to the Prime 
Minister. A 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4012"> 4012 </A></B>
<P>
pretty nice bunch! A bunch of heavies exerting undue influence 
on the government decision-makers in an unspeakable manner.
<P>
	Their domination puts our institutions in danger. It produces 
harmful effects on decision-makers who see and rub shoulders 
only with one reality, the reality of rich people and large firms. 
That is very disturbing for ordinary people because 
decision-makers get disconnected from real social and 
economic problems that affect the poorest.
<P>
	The social and human issues are over-shadowed by financial 
and economic interest linked to profit. All those ex-friends and 
lobbyists wandering around government offices are looking for 
profits and they have exceptional tools and means to reach that 
goal. They can easily open all the doors that give access to 
ministers and senior officials, and it is not to discuss the 
weather. All the pressure and influence peddling often gives 
good results. Decision-makers yield to the requests of friends 
and lobbyists who are often working for firms that will not 
hesitate to contribute to the old parties' election funds.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	What becomes of ordinary citizens in that system? What 
becomes of those thousands of organizations without money 
that are working to improve the well-being of groups and 
individuals? Do ordinary citizens and those organizations have 
the same powers, the same access and the same opportunities as 
those who use their considerable means to influence 
decision-makers? I do not think so. Certain results are very 
revealing. The poor and people living in difficult conditions are 
increasingly forgotten. There are more unemployed workers and 
more people on social welfare. There are more people who are 
hungry, more children living in unacceptable conditions and 
more elderly living alone and receiving less treatment.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, there are more poor people. And the poor 
are getting poorer, and the rich are getting richer! Is that the kind 
of society that we want? Do we want a society increasingly 
divided into categories? That is what is happening on the field. 
Figures and statistics are clear. Decision-makers must 
absolutely come back to reality and try to ensure a better 
distribution of disposable income between social classes, and 
they must find a solution to all those excruciating problems. I do 
not believe that ex-friends and lobbyists can be trusted to see to 
that. As regards the airport and big profits, I agree they do an 
excellent job; but when it comes to social problems, we should 
look elsewhere.
<P>
	It is urgent that the government establish strict rules for 
lobbyists. The population has the right, and it is essential, to be 
informed of all activities pertaining to public administration. 
The population has that right because at the end of the day it is 
the one who pays.
<P>
	Those rules must allow us to know everything about 
lobbyists. Who are they? Who hires them? Who pays them? 
What are the goals and results of their activity? Whom do they 
meet? Actually they should be X-rayed and they should be 
followed around by a little bird so that we can know everything 
they do. If the government does not address that problem, the 
confidence of the population in its elected officials and in our 
institutions will continue to deteriorate even more rapidly.
<P>
	I ask the people opposite to wake up because the population is 
awakening and it is getting fed up with favouritism, bribing on 
the part of the friends of the party and lobbying of the rich at the 
expense of the ordinary citizens.
<P>
	You have denounced for years the absence of openness. I think 
time has come for you to act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pity that the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell decided to go to lunch right 
when I was going to tell him why the Bloc Quebecois had moved 
in this House the motion that we have been debating. I see that 
he is back. I would not want to paraphrase the minister of 
Transport who said in this House, this morning, about us, the 
members from the Bloc, that we thought he was stupid because 
we did not seem to understand his answers. I think that my 
colleague from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell has the same 
resentment towards us.
<P>
	I am going to read again the motion moved by the Bloc. It is 
important to understand the meaning of it. The motion asks that 
the motion be amended by striking all the words after the word 
``That'' and substituting the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-22, An Act respecting 
certain agreements concerning the redevelopment and operation of Terminals 1 
and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport, because the principle of the Bill 
is flawed due to the fact that it contains no provisions aimed at making the work 
done by lobbyists more transparent''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	It sounds clear to me. The member said that the Bloc would 
have wanted that bill to settle the case of lobbyists. I think that 
we might as well specify something for the member without 
necessarily writing it down. We are talking about the lobbyists 
who were involved in the Pearson deal, not about the lobbyists 
who, day after day, stick around the Liberal Party to get favours.
<P>
	It is crystal clear. Those who reject that motion must not 
understand its relevance. The motion says that the bill contains 
no provisions aimed at making the work done by lobbyists more 
transparent. We are talking about those numerous lobbyists that 
can be found sometimes on the side of the Liberal Party, 
sometimes on the side of the Conservative Party but, at all times, 
on the side of the government. We want to know about that, and 
that is why we are asking for a royal commission of inquiry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4013"> 4013 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course the Bloc would like the government to present a 
bill on lobbyists; we will support any measure that would 
determine the scope of their work. Contrary to what the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood said this morning about there 
being Bloc lobbyists one day, Quebecers elected 54 lobbyists 
and they are all here in the House defending the interests of 
Quebec, day after day, openly and publicly. That is 
transparency.
<P>
	Besides, several members from the other side tend to agree 
with Bloc Quebecois members on that point. I will even mention 
one, and I am sure the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell will appreciate that greatly; I am 
talking of course about the member for York South-Weston 
who said repeatedly in this House during this debate that, and I 
quote: ``There were a lot of backroom negotiations and much 
manipulation. There were a lot of payoffs''. It is in <I>Hansard</I>. I 
am sure my colleague will consult it the minute I finish my 
speech.
<P>
	He added: ``It takes a lot of audacity on the part of Mr. 
Bronfman and other principals in the Pearson Development 
Corporation to put forward a claim of close to $200 million for 
compensation after all of the shenanigans that took place''. 
Finally, he said: ``One could almost conclude that the activity 
bordered on the criminal. I have considerable respect for M. 
Nixon, but he conducted his investigation and prepared his 
report in private''. There you have it! That is why the Bloc has 
presented this amendment; its purpose is to shed light on the role 
played by lobbyists in this issue and not to settle the case of 
lobbying in Canada once and for all.
<P>
	Therefore, as I said last week, it is very disturbing to see not 
only that this bill does not clarify the lobbyists' role, but also 
that it hints that there is a deal somewhere. As colleagues in the 
Bloc Quebecois and Reform Party have said, there is an obvious 
contradiction between clauses 7 and 10. I repeat it for the 
information of my colleague who was not here last week when I 
made my remarks. Clause 7 states that no proceedings for 
damages can be instituted against the government or its 
representatives concerning Pearson airport. Clause 10 specifies 
that if the minister considers it appropriate to do so, the 
Governor in Council may enter into an agreement recommended 
by the Minister of Transport. Paragraph 10(3) specifies that such 
an agreement must be concluded within a month after passage of 
the bill.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	What I explained last week, and I will conclude with that, is 
that people involved in that scheme are told not to worry, that 
they will not have to litigate and pay legal costs because the bill 
prohibits legal proceedings. On the other hand, they are told 
they only have to go to the Minister of Transport right away, 
make a deal with him, and Cabinet will ratify the deal. But they 
have to move fast because everything must be done within a 
month.
<P>
	If the government took such care to include so many details in 
the bill, surely a deal has already been made. Otherwise, there 
would be no need to say it must be settled within a month. The 
evidence speaks for itself.
<P>
	If we want to go to the bottom of this issue, and know once and 
for all what happened with these dealings, we need a royal 
commission of inquiry. I will repeat for the information of 
members opposite, we need it in order to know about the work of 
lobbyists involved in this scheme. Of course, this will teach a 
lesson to the government, at least we hope so, but we will also 
get relevant information that will enable us, in the near future, to 
pass satisfactory legislation to restrict and control lobbying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, I was 
told that there was another speaker before me.
<P>
	We cannot support Bill C-22, an Act respecting certain 
agreements concerning the redevelopment and operation of 
Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	Even if the purpose of this bill is to cancel an inadequate 
contract which, as Mr. Robert Nixon noted in his report to Prime 
Minister Jean Chrétien, was ``arrived at with such a flawed 
process and under the shadow of possible political 
manipulation'', it sets cancellation conditions which, in our 
opinion, are just as irregular and make us think that they are the 
result of more political manipulation to protect friends of the 
party in power.
<P>
	We must first ask the following questions: Why did the 
government want to change the management framework of 
Lester B. Pearson Airport? Was the airport losing money? On 
the contrary, in 1993, this airport made a profit of $23 million, 
excluding revenues from renting Terminal 3. Did the 
government believe that the new consortium would offer 
customers better services at a lower cost? On the contrary, since 
the deal provides that, for air carriers, the costs would be raised 
from $2 per passenger now to $7 at the end of construction. And 
we know that carriers pass their costs on to passengers.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	There was only one acceptable reason, and it was the 
implementation of the new policy on the future framework for 
the management of airports in Canada that was published by the 
Conservative government in April 1987. But there again, the 
Conservative government at the time departed from its own 
policy by entrusting the modernization of Terminals 1 and 2 of 
Lester B. Pearson Airport to a private consortium.
<P>
	Indeed, the new policy on the future framework for the 
management of airports in Canada called for the implementation 
of the new approach chosen by Transport Canada; one of its two 
main thrusts was to emphasize the commercial orientation of 
airports, their possible contribution to economic development 
and their taking into account of local concerns and interests. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4014"> 4014 </A></B>
<P>
That approach called for private sector involvement, especially  
in traditional or innovative airport services as much as possible.
<P>
	Instead of delegating the management of Pearson Airport to a 
local public authority similar to the ones in place in Montreal, 
Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton, the government decided to 
favour a private consortium, thus going directly against its 
general policies.
<P>
	It has not been proven that the decision to change the 
management framework of Lester B. Pearson Airport was made 
according to generally recognized principles of good public 
management. One has to look elsewhere to find the real reasons 
that prompted the Conservative government to sign in a rush, in 
the middle of an election campaign, the October 7, 1993 
agreement.
<P>
	We would have more luck finding the real motives behind this 
transaction if the present Liberal government appointed a royal 
commission of inquiry. We would get answers to some troubling 
questions. On June 22, 1987, the Conservative government 
selected Airport Development Corporation to build and operate 
terminal 3 at Pearson. Airport Development Corporation and 
Claridge Properties Inc. are essentially the same corporate 
entity. What do we know about Claridge Properties Inc.? It is a 
real estate company owned by Charles Bronfman, who is 
associated with the Liberal Party of Canada. The key people in 
the company are: Peter Coughlin, the president; Senator Léo 
Kolber, the manager of Claridge Properties; Herb Metcalfe, a 
lobbyist representing Claridge Properties and a former 
organizer for Jean Chrétien; and Ray Hession, an influential 
former deputy minister who had recently been appointed to the 
board of Paxport.
<P>
	On December 7, 1992, Paxport's proposal for the 
privatization of terminals 1 and 2 was accepted. There were only 
two proposals, the other one being the one made by Claridge 
Properties. The companies had only 90 days to submit their bids.
<P>
	Paxport was then given two months to demonstrate the 
financial viability of its proposal. That condition was never met. 
What then do we know about Paxport Inc.? It is another 
consortium made up of six companies associated with the 
Conservative Party through some key people, and I will name a 
few: Don Matthews, president of Paxport Inc, the former 
chairman of Brian Mulroney's nomination campaign in 1983 
and former president of the Conservative Party; Otto Jelinek, a 
former Conservative minister, now a member of Paxport's board 
of directors; Fred Doucet, who was mentioned earlier, a lobbyist 
representing Paxport and long-time friend of Brian Mulroney; 
Bill Neville, another lobbyist representing Paxport, the former 
chief of staff of former Prime Minister Joe Clark and a member 
of the privileged transition team of former Prime Minister Kim 
Campbell.
<P>
	What happened next? On February 1, 1993, having been 
unable to demonstrate the financial viability of its proposal and 
experiencing some difficulties, Paxport merged with Claridge 
under the name T1 T2 Limited  Partnership. Again, T1 T2 is 
made up of the same companies: Claridge Properties, Paxport 
Inc. and the Allders Group.
<P>
	All of these people have ties to either the Liberal Party or the 
Conservative Party.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	In short, Mr. Speaker, during the whole process, the whole 
time these transactions were prepared, the present Prime 
Minister never complained and never said anything about what 
was going on in this matter.
<P>
	It was only a few days after the announcement of the general 
election that the Prime Minister opposed the way it was done. 
For these reasons, I ask the Liberal Party and some of its 
supporters why they are afraid of revealing the hidden aspects of 
this privatization?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry. You have three minutes left 
for next time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Colleagues, I have received written notice from the hon. 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway that he is unable to move his 
motion during private members' hour on Monday, May 9. The 
member's office, I am told, indicated yesterday that he would 
not be in Ottawa on Monday and could thus not proceed with his 
matter on that day.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since it was not possible to arrange for an exchange in the 
order of precedence, pursuant to Standing Order 94(2)(a), I ask 
the Clerk to drop the order to the bottom of the order of 
precedence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It seems proper to add in the interests of all private members 
in the House that this is unfortunately the fourth time this has 
happened since Private Members' Business began on March 
14th.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hour provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business will consequently be suspended. Pursuant to Standing 
Order 99(2), the House shall meet at 11.00 a.m. for the 
consideration of Government Orders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has the floor on a point of 
order, but very briefly, since it is now time for private members' 
business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member for 
Joliette could conclude his remarks. He is almost done, with two 
minutes left. I am sure he will get unanimous consent to finish 
his speech.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4015"> 4015 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to let the 
member finish?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Agreed. The member for Joliette has 
again the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I had reached August 
30, 1993, when the Minister of Transport in the Conservative 
government announced that a general agreement had been 
reached with the Pearson Development Corporation concerning 
the management of all three terminals at the Lester B. Pearson 
Airport. What is Pearson Development Corporation?
<P>
	It is a corporation specially created to manage the three 
terminals and that incorporated all the activities of T1 T2 
Limited Partnership. This new company was also controlled at 
about 17 per cent by the Matthews Group-Matthews being the 
chairman of Paxport-at 66 per cent by Claridge Properties, 
allied to Mr. Bronfman, and at 17 per cent by public companies 
which were to provide conventional airport services.
<P>
	You will agree with me, Mr. Speaker, that this structure 
closely resembles the one of T1 T2 Limited Partnership. On 
September 8, as we all know, a general election was called by the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	It is then, and only then, that Mr. Jean Chrétien, the Prime 
Minister to be, warned that he would not hesitate, once in office, 
to cancel that deal if completed. Following this statement, the 
chief negotiator requested written instruction to sign the 
contract and, on October 7, Prime Minister Campbell demanded 
that the legal privatization document be signed that very day.
<P>
	Three days after the general election, on October 28, the 
Prime Minister appointed Robert Nixon as special investigator 
to scrutinize the privatization of the Pearson terminals.
<P>
	At this point, we should note that Robert Nixon was Treasurer 
of Ontario in the Liberal government of Premier Peterson, and 
had been leader of the Ontario Liberal Party.
<P>
	On November 29, Mr. Nixon delivered the report on his 
findings, opinions and recommendations to the Prime Minister 
who decided to cancel the privatization deal on December 5.
<P>
	The government may want to show its good will by passing 
Bill C-22 which cancels the deal, but how is it that the Liberal 
Party never denounced the situation while they were in 
opposition, and while all these dubious dealings were unfolding 
before their eyes? Why did the Liberal Party not denounce its 
political friends and those of the Conservative Party who were 
gearing up for such favouritism?
<P>
	Why is the Liberal Party still seeking today to protect its 
political friends by closing this case in such a way that it will 
punish the bad Tories who were party to these transactions, but 
compensate its good Liberal friends who were involved to the 
same degree in this murky deal?
<P>
	Why are the Liberal Party and its financial supporters afraid 
of revealing the hidden side of this privatization?
<P>
	Why is the Prime Minister still refusing to order a royal 
commission, the only way to get to the bottom of things?
<P>
	If such an inquiry is not called, the Bloc Quebecois will not 
side with the Liberal government and will not support this bill 
which is as unacceptable as the airport privatization deal itself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is understood that the debates will be prolonged by four or 
five minutes.

	The House resumed from March 18 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the House today to support this motion which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should bring in legislation 
limiting solely to individuals the right to donate to a federal political party, and 
restricting such donations to a maximum of $5,000 a year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I wish to thank the hon. member for Richelieu for bringing 
such an important issue to the attention of the House.
<P>
	This is a two-part motion in which both parts play very 
important roles because of the significant changes each will 
bring to the existing system.
<P>
	The first part, as it eliminates donations to individuals only 
immediately eliminates any group of individuals from donating. 
I use the word group here in its broadest sense; that is, groups 
ranging from large corporations of individuals united under a 
common banner, be it a corporation, a union or an association, to 
the duo team of the Mr. and Mrs. group.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4016"> 4016 </A></B>
<P>
	On the second part of the motion, individual donations 
limited to a maximum $5,000 a year, I reflect for a moment on 
the figure of $5,000 and admit that the reasoning for this 
particular figure versus any other tends to allude me at this 
time. If it is representative of a certain percentage of the 
average Canadian income I think it is a little on the high side. 
On the other hand I am very pleased to see that it does not relate 
to the amount allowed for an income tax deduction because I 
anticipate, quite strongly actually, that the present income tax 
system will itself be remodelled during the next decade.
<P>
	The concept of identifying a maximum amount for an annual 
donation is a good one. It creates the need for a candidate and his 
or her team to go directly to the grassroots, to the individuals 
involved in the election process to raise the funds needed to 
facilitate their campaign in getting their message across to as 
many more voters as possible. It will also reduce any undue 
influence that wealthy individuals or groups of individuals such 
as corporations, unions, associations, et cetera may have on the 
political process.
<P>
	Some people may criticize this analysis, especially the second 
reason about the undue influence. They will possibly criticize 
this as being too cynical or for downplaying the role of public 
policy in an election. In fact this has already been done.
<P>
	When the motion was first debated in this House, my 
colleague, the hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin, was 
portrayed by the members opposite as believing that ``all those 
who contribute to a political system expect something in 
return''. That is from the March 18 <I>Hansard</I>, somewhere around 
page 2510.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	At the same time members opposite use the standard line of 
many politicians contending that people donate money to 
political parties based on altruistic principles. That is, people 
contribute toward a process because they want good 
government.
<P>
	I do indeed accept that many people donate for better 
government. It is certainly true and I wish to state unequivocally 
that individuals, corporations, unions, et cetera, do in fact 
donate to political parties and/or individual candidates for the 
purpose of good government and good representation.
<P>
	However, as my colleague tried to point out on March 18, it is 
also certainly true that some donations are made in the political 
process for the purpose of influence. How else does one explain 
the fact that many groups, corporations, et cetera, donate money 
to two different parties? Do they believe that both parties have 
equally good policies? Or is it more realistic to believe that they 
want to retain influence in both parties so that whichever one 
forms the government they can point out later their financial 
support?
<P>
	Another observation along this line would be the movement 
of some corporations, associations, et cetera, of their donations 
from probable losers to probable winners as the election 
campaign progresses. This does not mean we believe that every 
individual or group that contributes toward the political process 
is expecting something other than good government in return. 
However, it does point out there are other possible reasons for 
donating.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not have a problem with private 
citizens spending their hard earned money toward achieving 
good or better government. What the Reform Party does have a 
problem with is large corporations, unions, special interest 
groups, et cetera, donating large amounts of money. I am not 
talking about $100, $1,000 or $2,000 here, but donating large 
amounts of money to certain candidates or parties because they 
may see this as a way to control the political process and to 
influence or dominate a government's agenda.
<P>
	That is precisely what this motion is seeking to prevent. We 
are all aware it is a basic reality of politics that for an individual 
or a party to get elected it requires funding. As an American 
legislator once remarked, money is the mother's milk of 
politics.
<P>
	That is not to say those with the most money to spend on 
campaigns necessarily win. That was demonstrated in the 
results of this last election. However, we in the House must 
recognize that small donations made by individual citizens are 
the best way of funding of politics in Canada. It broadens the 
support needed by candidates to get elected. It also removes the 
opportunity for undue influence of wealthy individuals, groups, 
associations, et cetera, on the political process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, before delving 
into the substantive issues raised by this motion I would like to 
make a couple of general observations.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the hon. member for Richelieu chose in 
presenting his motion to make some disparaging remarks about 
the integrity of those who participate actively in the political 
process. For example, he made several references to greed, pay 
backs, conflict of interest, connections, access to the inner 
sanctum, smoke and mirrors, et cetera.
<P>
	He also claimed that Canadian chartered banks ``run political 
parties behind the scenes''. Judging from the record and 
observation of the Canadian banks in the last few years, they 
have had enough problems running their own affairs without 
trying to run the political parties of this country as well.
<P>
	Throwing aspersions on political parties, on members of 
Parliament and on those who make contributions to campaign 
funds does not advance the purpose of this debate. In fact such 
imprudent accusations reflect badly on the legitimacy and 
integrity of the House and its members, including the hon. 
member for Richelieu and the members of his party.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4017"> 4017 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the issues raised in the course of the previous 
debate, I note that in presenting his motion the hon. member 
claimed that the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and 
Party Financing, known as the Lortie commission, hardly 
touched on the question of party financing.
<P>
	It is important to set the record straight. The Lortie 
commission did look into all the issues raised in election 
financing. It looked into the question of financing registered 
political parties, limits on election expenses, public funding of 
election participants, disclosure of political contributions, 
political contributions and undue influence.
<P>
	Three in depth studies were commissioned and published 
entitled ``Money in Politics'', ``Provincial Party and Election 
Finance in Canada'' and ``Comparative Issues in Party and 
Election Finance''.
<P>
	The Lortie commission, therefore, was very well informed 
when it made the following recommendations: first, that there 
be no ban on political contributions from business, trade unions 
or other organizations except for political contributions from 
foreign sources.
<P>
	In arriving at this conclusion the commission paid particular 
attention to the historical significance and importance of 
organizations such as unions and business in Canadian politics 
and to the danger of diverting funds from political parties to 
third parties. We have seen in previous elections where vast 
expenses were made by non-political parties in the political 
process.
<P>
	Second, it pointed to the possible problem of charter 
challenges to such restrictions.
<P>
	Third, the Lortie commission recommended that there be no 
limits on the size of contributions to registered political parties. 
In deciding this the Lortie commission found that there was ``an 
absence of any compelling evidence that the number and value 
of large contributions to federal parties and candidates raise 
serious concerns about undue influence''.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the remarks of the member for 
Surrey North. I am sure she was inspired by a sincere desire and 
interest in the political system. However, I suggest that a 
thorough examination of this subject by an independent inquiry 
looked into the matter and found there was no suggestion of the 
influence that seemed to trouble the last speaker in the House. 
Further, the Lortie commission concluded that it would be very 
difficult to enforce such limits.
<P>
	We have seen other jurisdictions where such unenforceable or 
difficult to enforce limits run into problems and bring the whole 
of the political system into disrepute.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure that Bloc members are aware of the problem in 
France arising from the funding of policical parties. Limits were 
set, but no pertinent regulations were adopted. It is very 
important to analyse limits on contributions to ensure they are 
practical and applicable to individual cases.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the last Parliament a special committee on electoral 
reform was struck to consider the Lortie commission's 
proposals. In the end the committee did not recommend limits 
on who could make donations and the maximum amount of such 
donations. I agree with the final decisions of the Lortie 
commission and the special committee.
<P>
	The Canada Elections Act, as it stands, provides the necessary 
mechanisms to ensure that our electoral system is fair and 
equitable. Notably there are controls on election expenditures. 
The transparency of political donations is assured in that 
registered political parties must provide an annual report setting 
out the amount of money received and the name of each donor 
who contributed more than $100.
<P>
	I am of the view that these measures are more than sufficient 
to protect the integrity of the electoral system. We have a saying 
that it does no good to throw the baby out with the dirty bath 
water. There is no question there are problems with electoral 
financing as there are problems with every aspect of the 
electoral system of the country.
<P>
	These problems deserve careful, mature examination and 
reflection before coming to conclusions. I find that the 
conclusions in the Lortie commission respect those criteria. It is 
for that reason I cannot support the motion before the House.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to continue the debate in this House this afternoon on 
the motion of my hon. colleague from Richelieu concerning 
financial contributions to political parties.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we all know how important the financing of 
political parties is when elections come. Clearly, an election 
campaign takes money. But do we really have to let just anyone 
or anything finance our political parties? Canada's electoral 
system has serious shortcomings that allow multinationals, even 
American ones, to meddle in Canadian public affairs. If this 
electoral system does not soon acquire strict rules on the 
financing of political parties, it is in great danger of no longer 
being representative.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, which applied Quebec's rules on public 
financing during the last election campaign, is the only federal 
political party represented in this House which can boast that its 
election expenses were financed  solely by individuals and that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4018"> 4018 </A></B>
<P>
it is accountable only to these same people. Not to interest 
groups, not to corporations or multinational conglomerates, but 
only to the people whom it proudly represents. We are dealing 
with the very principle of democracy today. But what do the 
members opposite fear?
<P>
	When the Parti Quebecois introduced the legislation on 
political party financing in 1977, some feared that the Quebec 
Liberal Party would not recover. The party was cut off from 
most of its financing sources and had to make some adjustments. 
It had always depended on large corporations to fund its 
political activities. The party's financial position, although 
weakened at first, adapted to the change and is doing very well 
today, relying exclusively on private donations. Political parties 
in Quebec can survive without corporate financing, and it is 
much better this way.
<P>
	What did happen for individuals to start making small 
donations to their favourite political party? It is simply that, 
once private donations were accepted, individuals slowly 
regained confidence in their elected representatives. Voters 
realize now that their 10 $ or 20 $ donations can make a 
difference. Quebecers know that election results and 
government decisions no longer depend on the mood of large 
corporations. The average Canadian, such as the one that we 
should be representing as parliamentarians, knows that he has a 
say in the state's business.
<P>
	When in their ridings, members of the Bloc Quebecois are not 
afraid of being asked THE question so feared by members of 
other parties, which is the following: ``Whose interests are you 
promoting in the House of Commons?'' the Bloc Quebecois 
members simply answer: ``The only interests that we promote 
are those of Quebecers''. The least we can say is that the answer 
from Liberal Party members is likely much more complicated. If 
you look closely at who funded their election campaign, you 
soon realize that they are accountable not only to the people, but 
to others as well.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	To find out whom the Liberals are indebted to, one only has to 
look at Elections Canada's report, which reveals that in 
1991-92, nearly 50 per cent of contributions to the Liberal Party 
of Canada's election fund came from businesses and from 
various commercial and other organizations. How can Liberal 
Party members say they protect people's interests when half 
their funds come from companies? Let us not delude ourselves: 
these big corporations do not give tens and hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to that party just because of its great 
democratic values.
<P>
	French-Canadians used to say, ``No taxation without 
representation.'' The Liberals and the Tories have made a few 
changes to this famous sentence over the years. Today their 
slogan would be: ``No representation without contribution''. 
Those who want their voices to be heard in Parliament should 
realize that they must make  substantial contributions to the 
election fund or else their demands will disappear under the 
millions of dollars given to the national political parties by the 
big corporations. So much for the great democratic principles 
Canada is so proud of.
<P>
	Some companies do not take any chances, like CN, which 
gave tens of thousands of dollars to each of the two big parties 
last year. They expect something in return, such as favours, 
contracts or legislative amendments favouring them. We should 
not think that these companies, which are not used to spending 
their money needlessly, are motivated solely by noble 
intentions. If we let these corporations influence through their 
donations the results of elections in this country, the decisions 
our governments will make may be biased by their debts, moral 
or otherwise, to these very companies.
<P>
	The political parties taking office in Ottawa are supposed to 
represent the Canadian people, but until the federal government 
amends, as Quebec did over 15 years ago, its legislation on 
political party funding, people will always wonder whose 
interests the government in office is trying to protect. Quebecers 
have understood the meaning of the word ``democracy'' for a 
long time. Today, the federal government has an opportunity to 
show us it understands it too. It is up to it to seize this 
opportunity offered by the Official Opposition to restore the 
democratic reputation of Canada as a whole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to participate in the debate on this motion on party 
financing put forward by the hon. member for Richelieu.
<P>
	One of the speakers opposite referred to the Lortie 
Commission, a commission which has investigated extensively 
and heard the testimonies of numerous witnesses who wanted to 
voice their opinions on political financing. At the time, I had 
seized the opportunity to very humbly submit a brief on party 
financing because this is a subject I have been interested in for 
many years, even before I had the privilege of representing the 
people of the riding of Papineau at the National Assembly. All 
this to say that my main concern was with the way political 
parties were funded. I maintain, and I am not the only one, that 
the way political parties are funded leaves much to be desired. I 
have read extensively on the subject and I have come across a 
solution I consider very practical, yet revolutionary. It is from a 
professor at the University of New Brunswick who was 
completing a doctorate, and the subject of his thesis was party 
financing in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	In this thesis, it was demonstrated that indeed, the easiest and 
most democratic way of financing political parties would be to 
eliminate all contributions from companies, labour and other 
organizations and allow only individuals to make donations or 
contributions to political parties. No companies, no legal, 
architectural or  engineering firms. We all know the gamut of 
contributors to party funds. There is no need to elaborate. I do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4019"> 4019 </A></B>
<P>
not think that large contributions are made out of love for 
democracy. We must absolutely look at this issue.
<P>
	I say this as the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre. I have had 
many discussions on this with my fellow citizens and they fully 
support the opinion which I have always expressed, not only in 
this House, but also in Quebec's National Assembly and before 
the Lortie Commission, to the effect that changes must be made. 
If we believe that we are a democratic society, then we must 
make changes to the financing of political parties.
<P>
	I want to go back to the New Brunswick professor. I discussed 
this issue with him and, in fact, I had a question put on the <I>Order 
Paper</I> to get information to help him in his work. That person 
claims that only a citizen of Canada should make a donation and 
that the maximum allowed should be one dollar. One might say: 
How are we going to finance political parties? It is very simple. 
We are here to represent all Canadians; consequently, we should 
be elected only by individual Canadians and not by lobbies, law 
firms or engineering companies. Our fellow citizens should be 
the only ones allowed to financially help us get elected.
<P>
	So, that person suggests a one-dollar limit. How would that 
be done? It is very easy. For all intents and purposes, one dollar 
per Canadian amounts to $25 million. That $25 million would be 
divided each year between the political parties. I will not get 
into technicalities here, but it would not be complicated. 
According to the professor, the procedure would be very 
simple-it only takes two pages-and the distribution would be 
done very democratically, thus ensuring that political parties 
would have the necessary monies to conduct their activities.
<P>
	Subsequent to the conversations I had with this professor, I 
learned about the amount of tax refunds the governement of 
Canada grants to people who donated to a political party. You 
have all heard about tax credits and other such things. I do not 
have to get technical and go into details. Suffice it to say that 
such contributions entitle to tax credits. In 1990, in particular, 
these tax credits reached $20 million. And this does not take into 
account the management of the system, etc. In other words, it 
would almost amount to an economy for the state if people were 
contributing the funds needed to operate democratically the 
political parties of Canada.
<P>
	This idea is very attractive and deserves careful thought. I 
submitted it to the Lortie Commission, which found it very 
interesting, but the opinion is divided on this issue. The 
principle is very simple.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	If we believe in a democratic society and if we believe that 
one could represent people in this House without having to 
accept contributions from anyone, this would be the ideal 
situation. That is the goal aimed for in our society, because we 
know human nature. There is nothing illegal involved, but such 
is human nature. There are people making contributions who are 
very sincere in their contributions to a party or a candidate.
<P>
	However, we have to take into account that we always have to 
find means to keep it as democratic as possible. I personally felt 
that this professor from the University of New Brunswick had a 
magic solution to this problem.
<P>
	We do not have all the data, but we could have a closer look at 
it. I would have liked to speak longer, but the principle, the 
notion is very clear that only individuals, the people, our fellow 
citizens, should finance our election to this House.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to put forward the following 
amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by substituting to the figure of ``$5,000'' the 
figure of ``$1''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We have already dealt with the content 
of that amendment and it was considered in order. The clerk 
gave me that assurance. Is there an hon. member who wishes to 
second the motion? The hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth is seconding the motion.
<P>
	Debate on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I apologize for 
my lack of experience, but could you explain to us the 
implication of this amendment on the unfolding of the debate? I 
would also like to know whether the mover of the motion, the 
hon. member for Richelieu, has been informed of the intent of 
our hon. colleague.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Good question. In theory, the debate is 
on the amendment. Actually, it is on the motion and the 
amendment to the amendment. At the end of the proceedings 
today, that is at 2:30 p.m., we will still have one hour left when 
we resume debate next time. In theory, the amendment to the 
amendment can be adopted with unanimous consent, or 
members can vote it down. The decision is up to the hon. 
members. So, we will proceed with the debate on the matter 
before us. I hope I made myself clear.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead has 
the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am here to stay. I am very pleased to take part in 
this debate. I know that we are now debating the amendment of 
the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre, but I would also like to 
mention that I totally agree with the motion of the member for 
Richelieu in its present form. Consequently, even though I 
endorse most of the comments made by  the member for

<P>
Gatineau-La Lièvre, I am not in favour of the $1 limit. I will 
explain why later on.
<P>
	Before I do that, however, I would like to indicate why I 
wished to speak in this debate. There are three main reasons: the 
first is that, being a long time member and militant of the Parti 
Quebecois, it was an honour, naturally, for me to see that the 
first thing the Parti Quebecois, under the leadership of René 
Lévesque, did when it was elected in 1976, was to pass a law on 
political party financing. Mr. Lévesque and his government 
wanted to solve this thorny problem at the time because integrity 
was at stake. They enacted such legislation, and I believe it is a 
fundamental reason, to control the financing of political parties 
in order to ensure that the people would be able to believe in 
their elected representatives.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Everybody knows, and I will not elaborate further on this, 
how much the credibility of elected representatives is in 
question, for all sorts of reasons. They wanted to assure the 
people, in this regard at least, that elected representatives were 
democratically elected and that they did not have special ties 
with any group of society, be it business people, unions or 
professional corporations. That is the first reason why I wanted 
to speak in this debate.
<P>
	The second has to do with François Gérin, my predecessor in 
this House as member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
who proposed the idea of popular financing to the Conservative 
Party. Unfortunately, in spite of all its promises, the 
Conservative government never delivered the goods.
<P>
	I would, however, like to underscore the considerable efforts 
of the member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead at the time 
and recall the words spoken by Mr. Gérin when he appeared 
before the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party 
Financing, the Lortie Commission mentioned a few moments 
ago by the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre. Mr. Gérin stated 
the following: ``Limiting donations to individuals will restrict 
the number of bagmen, the real political parasites who wield a 
disproportionate amount of influence within their party''. He 
also had this to say: ``Canadians now demand more transparency 
from their government and morals standards that are beyond 
reproach''.
<P>
	``The lure of a reward is undoubtedly a very human reflect, 
but it is inconsistent with the political ideal of serving the 
common good''. Lastly, he stated: ``Companies do not vote. 
Neither do associations nor labour unions. There is no longer 
any reason for these groups to have a dominant role in our 
electoral or political system by virtue of the fact they fund more 
than half of the activities of Canadian political parties''. This is 
how the member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
appearing before the royal commission in 1990, justified  the 
need to move as quickly as possible to a system whereby 
political parties are funded by individuals.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, this funding method was adopted 
nearly twenty years ago in Quebec. It is well known and enjoys 
widespread support from all sides, not only from members of the 
public, the vast majority of whom support this approach, but 
also from businesses. Oddly enough, a survey conducted in 1988 
by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which had 
over 80,000 members at the time, showed that a majority of 
directors of companies and small and medium-sized businesses 
were also in favour of this type of reform. And, like all the 
members of this House and even people outside this place, the 
majority of editorial writers who comment on the political arena 
have spoken most highly and favourably of such reform.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	Just a word on the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Gatineau-La Lièvre. As I said earlier, I think his colleagues 
from the Liberal Party should read his remarks over carefully, 
draw inspiration from them and make them their motto, their 
theme with regard to party financing in the months to come.
<P>
	I have a small problem however with the $1 limit on 
contributions. I think it comes from the right place, but the 
bottom line for these democratic bodies known as political 
parties would be near-paralysis.
<P>
	Obviously, our electoral legislation-the hon. member for 
Rosedale referred to it earlier-both federally and in the various 
provinces, already provides for using public funds to refund in 
part the expenses incurred by candidates or political parties 
which have presented a number of candidates with a minimum 
of success. And that is perfectly all right.
<P>
	However, political parties must continue to function between 
elections. They must be able to operate, consult their 
membership to seek advice on the general business of 
government and, to do so, naturally, they need money. So if we 
put a $1 limit on individual financing, it would be very difficult, 
in my opinion, to support an organization efficiently.
<P>
	I think what the point of the motion tabled by the hon. member 
for Richelieu-and on this I agree with the hon. member for 
Gatineau-La Lièvre-is that political parties must be financed 
by individuals and not by corporate entities such as companies, 
unions and professional corporations of all kinds. We already 
allow a democratization of political party funding.
<P>
	I am proud to repeat this since I feel I was part of this effort, 
the example that the Parti Quebecois always gives, the fact that 
all political parties in Quebec are now financed by individuals in 
a popular and democratic fashion because of the law passed at 
the beginning of 1977 by the Lévesque government, speaks for 
itself.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4021"> 4021 </A></B>
<P>
	I heard a Conservative senator who used to be a Liberal, 
Senator Rivest, if I may give his name, Mr. Speaker, say in an 
interview on political party funding: ``It is quite remarkable 
that since this legislation was passed in Quebec, no significant 
case of patronage linked to corporate or other contributions has 
come to light either in the Parti Quebecois government or the 
Liberal government''.
<P>
	So the results speak for themselves and clearly demonstrate 
that individual financing of political parties has improved our 
political ethics. That is what we want to bring in at the federal 
level.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I will conclude because I am told that I have about a minute 
left. When the member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead 
waged this fierce battle for popular financing within his own 
party, he obtained an agreement from the leader of the 
government at that time, Prime Minister Mulroney, who made a 
formal commitment before the 1988 election to present a bill on 
the financing of political parties once the House returned, which 
he never did, as everyone knows. We know what happened to 
that government, which is represented here in this House by just 
a captain and one foot soldier.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, there is a message in that for the government 
opposite, an important message, and I say that without 
partisanship. We must start work now on passing a bill on the 
financing of political parties along the lines of the motion of the 
member for Richelieu.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I also say, and this is a point that was raised by 
the former member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, that 
such legislation must be completely non-partisan. It must have 
the unanimous agreement of members of this House. Through 
the motion of the member for Richelieu, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois reach out to the government and say to it that we are 
ready to proceed as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
briefly, I must say that I have great sympathy with this motion. 
However, it is a little disconcerting that the members opposite 
assume that someone like myself had large corporate donations 
to my campaign. I would like to set the record straight.
<P>
	My total personal election spending contributions totalled 
$17,000. The largest contribution I received was $1,000. I 
received absolutely no money from the Liberal Party, it was all 
obtained from individuals. Also all the money was obtained 
during the election campaign. They were donations from 
individuals. I held a barbecue and did the customary things.
<P>
	I find myself in sympathy because I feel it is right and proper 
that MPs who represent the people should be supported 
primarily by the people rather than by corporations. I want the 
members opposite to know that the Bloc and the Reform have no 
monopoly on receiving donations only from individuals rather 
than from large corporations. I did not enjoy that either.
<P>
	I support the amendment, however, because the total amount 
of donations that I received only amounted to $17,000. If I had 
received a donation of $5,000 it would have been significant, 
almost one-third of what I had available to spend. I would be 
afraid in such a situation that the person giving me the $5,000 
donation, whether an individual or corporation would expect 
some sort of favour in return. They certainly would have 
expected some sort of influence.
<P>
	I find that the original motion has a weakness in stipulating a 
sum as high as $5,000. By supporting the amendment I believe 
we offer the government an alternative. The motion is flawed 
not because of any lack of proper motive on the part of those who 
have moved the motion but because it is something that requires 
very careful consideration by the government.
<P>
	If I have a minute or two more, I would like to add to the 
debate an anecdote which may be of interest to members. When I 
was campaigning I had the pleasure of being accompanied at one 
point by an American television crew from the 
``MacNeil-Lehrer Show''. They had come up to my riding of 
Hamilton-Wentworth because it was seen as a bellwether 
riding in the election. It had been a Tory riding for 22 years and 
they were very interested to see what would happen. The camera 
crew followed me as I went from door to door, as I am sure all 
members of this House did during the election. I would knock on 
the door, shake hands and go on.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Driving back at the end of the day the producer of this crew 
asked me how much I expected to spend in total in the election. I 
said I thought it would be at best about $30,000. I was counting 
the amount of money I had raised by donations and the matching 
money that would come as a consequence. He said: ``That is just 
amazing because in the United States a congressman running for 
election would expect to spend at least $180,000''. When I asked 
why he said it was because they would have to spend money on 
radio and television advertising and that kind of thing.
<P>
	I hate to say this but he told me that is one of the reasons 
American politics has such difficulty with corruption and 
influence peddling. It is because the average individual cannot 
possibly run for Congress without substantial financial support 
from corporations and special interest groups.
<P>
	I asked why they needed all that money. He said: ``Because we 
as Americans cannot do what you as Canadians can do. We 
cannot go door to door as we saw you doing today. The simple 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4022"> 4022 </A></B>
<P>
reason is that in the United  States, in my Detroit, if we went 
door to door like that on a campaign, we would be shot and killed 
or attacked''.
<P>
	I leave that thought with you. No matter what we do as MPs, 
we do live in a democratic society and a political environment 
that is absolutely second to none.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess things are 
not going my way this afternoon. I think there is not enough time 
for me to make my 10-minute speech. First, I want to comment 
briefly the amendment to the motion, which was put forward by 
a member opposite a few minutes ago and which would limit the 
contribution to a political party to $1 per individual.
<P>
	At first glance, this may seem like a very interesting 
amendment. For example, there were 85,000 voters in my riding 
during the last election. With a budget of $1 per voter or 
$85,000, I would have had a lot more money than the law 
allowed me to spend. I would have had something like $20,000 
more money, without having to do anything, no door-to-door 
campaigning, no electoral committee, no solicitation for 
volunteers to work for me. In fact, without leaving my house, I 
would have been able to receive $85,000 from all Canadians for 
my election campaign, just like my opponent. And since I had 
four opponents, all five of us would have received $85,000, at $1 
per voter.
<P>
	This may seem interesting compared to the tax refunds the 
State has to grant to people who donated to a political party. I 
know that the tax refunds reached $20 million, at some point in 
the last few years, but if the federal government has to reimburse 
$20 million, that means that some voters decided, of their own 
free will, to donate about $6 million to $7 million. What is at the 
root of this action and very important for the preservation of our 
democracy is that, when, as an individual, I decide to donate 
even only $1 to a political party, I get at least the chance to pick 
the party I want to support.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	The effect of the proposed formula will be that I will give one 
dollar to my own party and one dollar to every other party. I will 
have no other choice but to finance all political parties, whether 
I like it or not, whether their philosophy is compatible with my 
own beliefs or not. It would not matter anymore, everybody 
would be entitled to some degree of financing.
<P>
	I do not believe that it is the way to build a democracy. 
Democracy is based first and foremost on a personal 
commitment, a personnel decision to support one ideology 
rather than another. I would hate to see legislation giving the 
government the authority to take my tax dollars to finance 
anyone who would feel like entering politics. Although 
appealing at first, this measure appears rather antidemocratic 
and would, in the short and medium term, cause people to lose 
interest in politics since they would be inclined to believe that it 
is no longer their business. They no longer would have to  get 
involved. All those who would want to enter politics would have 
the money to do it anyway and to say what they want, whenever 
they want and to whomever they want, and they could stay 
quietly at home.
<P>
	I am afraid that this is not the way to lay the foundation of a 
sound democracy, a democracy on the move.
<P>
	To have to raise money during an election campaign has its 
positive sides too. The objective of today's motion is not to 
prevent people from giving money to political parties. Not at all. 
On the contrary, it is to allow private individuals to contribute, 
but to a reasonable level. The objective is to make sure that when 
individuals join a political party they can, irrespective of their 
wealth, express their free opinion, exercise their choice and be 
recognized.
<P>
	We do not want any involvement of companies, unions and 
interest groups which exist for predetermined reasons. 
Companies, when they request a charter, state their objectives. 
Unions do the same, as well as professional associations. When 
they ask for a charter establishing their existence, they state 
their objectives, and what goals they aim for by forming an 
association. Most unions, most professional associations would 
say: to defend the interests or our members. It is not necessarily 
for the interests of the community, and not necessarily for the 
interests of Canadians in general, on the contrary. It is to protect 
the interests of their members. When they do, they do it well.
<P>
	We should not allow these organizations, these corporations, 
these special interest groups to have disproportionate influence 
because of their financial means, in relation to the private 
citizen who, without a fortune, cannot have his opinion 
expressed and recognized by his peers in a democratic assembly 
because he has less influence, not having had the means to 
contribute as much.
<P>
	Democracy is based primarily on respect of individuals. If we 
want to motivate people to work for our election, we should not 
do it only by asking them for money but also by giving them 
responsibilities.
<P>
	It is when people take the time to work for a good cause that 
they get together and get involved in the political aspect of every 
day life. In this way, they take an interest in the operations of the 
organization not only during an election but in between 
campaigns.
<P>
	This is a very good way for a political party to survive and to 
support itself, just as any good parent would find the money to 
support his or her family. Any political party should also have 
the decency and the ability to generate its own revenues so that it 
be truly democratic and allow its members to participate fully.
<P>

<P>

	Naturally, I will vote against the proposed amendment while 
supporting the main motion as is.
