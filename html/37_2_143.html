<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members:</b> Agreed.</p><A NAME="Int-735354"></A><a HREF="#Int-735390"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735329"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rey Pagtakhan </b>moved that the bill be read the third time and passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise once again on behalf of the Government of Canada to speak to Bill C-50. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we are debating final reading of the bill so soon after second reading and deliberations by the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs speaks volumes about the concern all members have for Canada's veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the standing committee for its thoughtful study and unanimous approval of the bill. Indeed, I thank all members for sharing my passion and determination to get the urgently needed measures contained in the bill passed in the House as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the bill is reported back to the House without amendments, I need not debate further the details of its three basic components, except that I would like to give some added, but brief, overview comments on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision that re-establishes the education assistance program for the dependent children of Canadian Forces members killed in the line of duty, or whose injuries would later lead to death, cannot be more timely. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that as Canada continues her peacekeeping and peacemaking role in the world, where there remain countries that cry out for peace, it is only right and just that we offer peace of mind to the servicemen and servicewomen who go into harm's way to achieve peace for others. Their children's access to post-secondary education is assured through the assistance of this program. The deaths in Afghanistan, earlier this month and before, of some of our finest in uniform as a direct consequence of duty to country bring to our consciousness the importance of re-establishing this program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other components of the urgent needs package, which I had announced earlier, and the other components of the bill will provide further assistance: to wartime  veterans with a pension disability of 48% or greater, without regard to whether their needs are related to the pension disability or not; to overseas veterans while they are on a wait list for a priority access bed; to allied veterans with 10 years post-war residence in Canada; and to former prisoners of war with shorter or longer periods of incarceration than now provided for in the regulations and in law. Bill C-50 also clarifies in law the definition of “member of the forces” for the purposes of the War Veterans Allowance Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the provisions in this bill will help us address some of the key urgent needs of veterans and their families. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one other urgent need, which has caught the most public attention, relates to the veterans independence program, more popularly known as VIP. I am pleased, as are all members of the House, that we have been able to already put in place soon after my announcement last May of the package of initiatives, a change in the regulations which now allows eligible spouses of deceased veterans a lifetime extension of certain VIP services, that is, those presently in receipt of the one year extension of benefits following the death of their veteran spouse, as was then the provision in the regulations prior to the change, would henceforth continue to receive the benefit for lifetime as needed, as well as for those whose spouses die after the change in regulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate a couple of points about this specific matter for greater clarity and precision. First, the net effect of this particular change to the regulations is not to remove anyone, and  I underscore “not”, from the VIP rolls. Unwittingly but regrettably, it has come to be portrayed in some quarters that some have been cut off. That simply is not true at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be very clear. What we have done with this particular change is allow more than 10,000 eligible survivors, at a cost of some $65 million over five years,  entry onto the VIP roll of veterans on the program, in addition to those still on the one year extension when the change in regulation occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must also be made very clear that there remains an unanswered challenge, namely, making the new regulation applicable to all surviving spouses whose one year extension of VIP benefits had already ended before the commencement of the new regulation.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been acknowledged by all.  As I have said on a number of occasions, both in the House and outside, this unanswered challenge remains in the heart of this minister, and I am sure in the hearts of all, and in the hearts of veterans and their families. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this was a matter that this minister and veterans groups alike struggled with before we decided that  I would announce, as I subsequently did announce last May, the package of initiatives that also addresses the other urgent needs of veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I raised this very issue with the leadership of the Royal Canadian Legion, the RCL, the largest organization for veterans in the country, and with the leadership of the Army, Navy and Air Force Veterans in Canada, Anavets, the oldest association of them all, as well as with the National Council of Veteran Associations, NCVA, during our meeting last May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were all in a dilemma. Should we wait until we had all the financial resources we needed or should we proceed with what we had?  We all understood--RCL, Anavets and NCVA--that  we did not have the resources to include the surviving spouses, those for whom the  VIP extension had earlier been ended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, we unanimously agreed, without any dissent, that the best course of action was to target existing resources immediately to help surviving spouses who were currently in receipt of VIP or who would be at some future date and pledge to continue to work for the others. Thus, we have been able to immediately provide, following my announcement, not only VIP benefits to some 10,000 eligible surviving spouses, but as well, we have been able to help advance in the House the other forthcoming benefits contained in the bill before us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I also respectfully and gratefully acknowledge in the House the special motion moved at the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, by the member for Nipissing, to the effect that, and I quote:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>...the Government should take all possible means to provide lifetime VIP benefits to all qualified surviving spouses, of Veterans receiving such benefits at the time of their death, not just to those now eligible for such benefits following the amendments made in June 2003 to the Veterans Health Care Regulations.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I share and take most seriously the more recently expressed sentiments of Jennifer Kish from London, Ontario, and Patricia White of Charlottetown, among many, many others who have to date reflected the same sentiments on this issue, not to mention the universal sentiments of those in the House.  This is a non-partisan issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, we enter public service from whatever career we had before in the hopes of serving the broader public good.  As a former pediatrician and lung specialist in practice, I had the privilege of caring for our youngest and, by definition, some of our neediest citizens, and now, as Minister of Veterans Affairs, I say that our very senior veterans are also among the neediest from a health care perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in part in this context that I stand before the House to ask that we once more summon our resolve and give swift passage to Bill C-50.  In addition, there is another context in which to frame our resolve and that is from the perspective of the veterans themselves, from their own lips.  I have come to know from veterans I personally have met one to one or in groups that health needs are one of their pressing priorities.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I once more convey my many thanks to the leadership of the Royal Canadian Legion, the association of Army, Navy and Air Force Veterans in Canada, and the National Council of Veteran Associations, for sharing with me and my departmental officials the insights of their fellow veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. members know, my department has a long-standing collaborative relationship with Canada's veterans groups.  Since I came on board nearly two years ago, I have been determined to make sure that this tradition of consultation and cooperation continues.  From my very first meeting with the leadership of the veterans associations to today, it has been very clear what their priorities are.  </p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude with the comments that have come from the largest and the oldest veterans organizations.  Said Dominion President Allan Parks of the Royal Canadian Legion, the largest group:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In catering to the needs of prisoners of war, surviving spouses, and the long term care of veterans, Canada remains at the forefront of support to its veterans.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Dominion President Robert Cassels of the Army, Navy and Air Force Veterans in Canada, the oldest group:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I am very pleased with the Minister of Veterans Affairs' announcement that he will be introducing proposed program changes to meet today's most urgent needs of Canada's war veterans...We were fully consulted at every step of the process.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I indulge in these commentaries to indicate the excellent working partnership we have had with them as we pursue our common goal, namely, to advance the well-being of veterans and their families, and as well, to convey to all three major veterans organizations our appreciation for their continuing input and insights, that we may have a better understanding of the needs of our veterans, and particularly to the RCL and Anavets for publicly conveying their unfailing support in our common search for a solution to our pressing challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest we forget, let us also convey our gratitude to the staff of Veterans Affairs Canada, whose dedication and service continue to make a positive difference in the lives of our veterans and their families. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colleagues, let us get Bill C-50 into the law books as quickly as possible so that the intended recipients, our heroes of war and peace, can benefit from its provisions as soon as possible.</p><A NAME="Int-735390"></A><a HREF="#Int-735393"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735354"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I have a question about which  I want to be perfectly clear.

The number that I may give the member today may change tomorrow, because we continue to work for the solution. So as to the number, I will not comment.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the substance of the question, whether we would provide benefits to those who at the time of the announcement were not included because they had ended their benefits under the program, let me assure the House this issue will continue to remain in the heart of this minister, as it remains in the hearts of all members of the House.  I will continue to work hard, as the government will continue to work hard, on this very issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill introduced by the minister will result in some 27,000 widowers and widows not benefiting from the veterans independence program.</p>

If it is not here, will the minister accept an amendment from the Senate that will include those people in this legislation?</p><A NAME="Int-735403"></A><a HREF="#Int-735405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735401"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is not in the legislation, with all respect. The issue has been addressed in the regulatory changes that have already happened. As we know, there is a bill, an act of Parliament, and that is the law. There is a set of regulations that equally has the force of law, but  the regulations are in another document of Parliament, of the government of the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we would accept an amendment or not, it is very difficult to answer a hypothetical question. However,  let me assure the member that the issue remains in the heart of this minister and we will continue to search for the right solution.</p><A NAME="Int-735405"></A><a HREF="#Int-735407"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735403"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear to us that the minister is waffling on answering this very direct question.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the minister has said is that perhaps it is the regulations that do not allow all widows to be covered under this program. My question to the minister is, will he see that the regulations are changed by order in council to include all widows, so that all widows, regardless of the timing of their husbands' deaths, will qualify for this program?</p><A NAME="Int-735407"></A><a HREF="#Int-735410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Let me assure the members of the House, let me assure the Canadian public, and let me assure veterans and their families that this minister will continue to work hard so that we achieve the proper goal, so that we achieve the objective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see nodding heads. They like to play the heroes. I will continue to work hard so that we can achieve the proper solution for this particular issue.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand there are regulatory frameworks that need to be worked out. We understand there are fiscal concerns to be worked out, but all we are really asking is, will the minister get his department together and change the regulations?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After what the minister said, I am overwhelmed on behalf of the widows across Canada who will not be receiving the same life benefits as other widows.  There is an overwhelming sense of betrayal.  The widows who will be without benefits have the same grief that the widows of Corporal Beerenfenger and Sargeant Short  feel today.  There is no difference, but because of a decision, which can be changed, those women will be left out in the cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was opposition to Bill C-50, even though by all accounts it appeared that the bill was going to further the cause of all veterans and widows.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cliff Chadderton, chairman of the National Council of Veterans Associations, had  concerns and wrote to the media. He talked about being scheduled for laser surgery on one eye  and being unavailable for comment.  Nevertheless, he stated that he was surprised to see comments in the <i>National Post</i> by  the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chadderton  had written to the minister on at least three occasions about the matter and never received a reply and now he knows why.  He   said that he would be bringing up the matter at the annual meeting of the NCVA but there was  no indication that the government would be doing anything.  At the last meeting they had  specifically asked that the top brackets of widows be covered even though the funds were scarce.  He   said that other veterans organizations made comments to the effect that they would like to see all types of widows covered.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Mr. Chadderton and his  researchers  are concerned, they stand by the comments in the  letter to the minister of October 23, 2003 and the  release of that date. He   feels that it is up to the minister to give him  specific replies.  He  certainly was not satisfied to hear the minister  say that he was disappointed that Mr. Chadderton  should ask for his resignation, bearing in mind that the minister has given no indication that anything will be done despite a promise from the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were hoping to be able to speak of a victory today.  Our critic for veterans affairs would have been so pleased to share the happiness with the thousands of military widows who have been patiently waiting for the changes that are part of this legislation.  Year after year the member for Souris—Moose Mountain has  pursued the goal of equality.  That is what it is about, equality.  It is about equality for military widows.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year my caucus colleague set November 11 as the special target date for achieving this goal. The Speaker knows  there is a great likelihood that the House will rise on November 7, prior to November 11.  This causes great concern for all of us in the House  that any changes will be made to ensure that the benefits go to all of the widows.</p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to wonder whether  the command from  the prime minister in waiting  that no more funds  be allocated is a stall until he rises to the throne.  Could it be that his  new caucus is trying to create the illusion that he will be  the great saviour of these widows, or is it      just simply that they are waiting for more widows to pass away  and never  be able to receive the benefits that are rightly theirs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  on this side of the House feel that these widows and dependants of deceased veterans have waited long enough for equality of treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these individuals, Remembrance Day will take on a new meaning.  They will not have a grateful nation recognizing their sacrifice and that of their families in the service of their country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition will continue to press for the changes outlined in respect of benefits for veterans and the children of deceased veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions to be taken  or that have been  taken since the minister's May 12 announcement include  the extension of health programs for  veterans on  a disability pension. This will provide veteran independence program recipients the health care benefits to overseas service veterans at home when they are waiting for a priority access bed in a long term care facility. However it provides nothing for the widows whose husbands passed away prior to May 12.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation would provide long term care and health care benefits to allied veterans with 10 years post-war residence in Canada but it provides nothing for the widows whose spouses died prior to May of this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill  would  extend, from one year to a lifetime, the period of VIP benefits that  cover  the costs of housekeeping and ground maintenance, and  would  be given to widows after the death of their spouses  or partners who were veterans and receiving such benefits.  However it provides  nothing for the other widows whose spouses died prior to May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with hesitation, particularly because of who the bill was intended to help, but  it is with a sense of urgency that I would like to be acting on these matters. The aging population of our veterans, their widows and dependants  means that they will  not benefit from the changes   being announced in  Bill C-50. Remembrance Day this year will be a  yearly reminder that not only have they lost a loved one  but   their government was not prepared to act in a timely fashion.  They will remember that the government  turned its back on them this November 11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know  our critic, the member for Souris—Moose Mountain, received over 1,000 letters from widows, including letters from constituents in  my riding, who wanted  to be able to  thank  the minister for going forward with those benefits.  Why has the federal government    not had a change of heart   in all these years?</p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After years  of lobbying for the changes outlined in Bill C-50, what gave the final push on this?  I have no hesitation whatsoever saying  that it was the hard work of the official opposition critic for Veterans Affairs, who brought this issue to the forefront in the first place.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never been one to believe in coincidences.  Canadians cannot help but wonder about the timing.  It just happens that passage of the bill would coincide with the deaths of Sergeant Short and Corporal Beerenfenger in an  Iltis jeep in Afghanistan.  If some good could have come from this tragic loss of life, it would have been to honour veterans' widows and make the announcement today that all widows will receive  the lifetime benefits. Corporal Beerenfenger and Sergeant Short would have been heroes a hundred times over, more than they already are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  the minister had announced that all widows would receive these benefits, perhaps I would have tempered my cynicism and that of many Canadians who have come to expect a government that can never be counted on to do the right thing  unless someone else, either the media or the official opposition, pushes  it in the right direction.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government does act  it is by some half measure, as we have heard today, that is more designed to silence its critics than to actually solve a problem.  This  brings me to the issue of the thousands of widows who are excluded from the VIP benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as yesterday, the chairman of the National Council of Veterans Associations called  for the resignation of the Minister of Veterans Affairs for not responding to  their specific concern  about the shortcomings in the  legislation.  Today  I too must call for the minister's resignation.  This is betrayal of the worst kind.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our desire that the issues raised by the National Council of Veterans Associations in Canada,  in a letter to the minister dated October 23, 2003, will be dealt with in a timely fashion and that in the future there will be no confusion on behalf of the 23,000, more or less, widows  whose spouses died prior to the May date.  I hope these points will be clarified in writing, not this wishy-washy doublespeak that we are getting here in the House today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, it is my pleasure to represent the women and men in the Canadian Forces who are based at CFB Petawawa. </p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many individuals who experience the lifestyle in the upper Ottawa valley,   choose to retire here. As a consequence, a significant number of retired military personnel now call Renfrew county home.  Many military widows and their dependants in my riding follow this issue of equality of treatment with individual interest. Today I   dearly  would have liked to have shared in the joy that should have been forthcoming. Sons, daughters, brothers  and sisters all write and phone in on behalf of the widows. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know  the opposition is united across the benches on this side of the House and will continue to force the issue on behalf of the widows until we all share in the joy and stand up and congratulate whoever the minister is at that time.</p><A NAME="Int-735433"></A><a HREF="#Int-735462"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735427"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rey Pagtakhan (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development), Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker,  the member quoted one leader of a veterans organization who, regrettably, and which caused me pain,   asked for my resignation, as did  the member when she echoed the same sentiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote  from the press release put out by the Royal Canadian Legion and the Army  Navy and Air Force Veterans in Canada Association with respect to this particular issue and took issue with a statement made in the media. I want to  put on the record the statement made by  the two oldest and  largest   organizations  for veterans and their families.  During the May 7, 2003 meeting, they stated:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>At that meeting it was made clear by [the] Veterans Affairs Minister..., and fully understood by all in attendance, that the extension of the VIP for widows beyond the one year period would not be retroactive.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read that statement because the  particular leader, who  the member quoted, was at that meeting and, in all modesty, I was the one who raised this particular issue.  However, everyone, with  great dilemma, decided to  proceed and immediately effect a change in the lives of surviving spouses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we could not do everything at that time. As  I have said in the House repeatedly, because I am a very forthright person, we did not have the fiscal resources.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,  unlike the member, who, until toward  the end of her debate, spoke only about    her party as though the other opposition members did not matter, I am trying to come up with the word. Is that selfishness on my part? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated, this is not a partisan issue. I want to  read again from the press release of those two major organizations.  They state:  </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>We respect the current Minister of Veterans Affairs for his honesty and forthright approach in dealing with veterans issues.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Cheryl Gallant:</b> They were double-crossed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rey Pagtakhan:</b> You wait. I waited for my time.  Mr. Speaker, I would like respect in this House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member in her debate was trying to create an illusion while alluding  to the Prime Minister. It is sad when  we have a pressing issue on which we cannot all work together. It is not one group trying to find credit. That is not the way I work. I work in a quiet way and when I get results it does not matter if my name is attached to it or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remind ourselves that the nobility of politics is best measured when we continue to do our best, to achieve   results, and when we go to the great beyond it does not matter that our name is remembered. It only matters what  we have achieved for the people of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member alluded to the fact that there is nothing for the widows. There are pensions for the widows. These are additional benefits and we are working for them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has   been no betrayal, and I can lay my record before the member. Who, with all due respect and in all modesty, has spoken harder and stronger for veterans and their families than I?.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-735462"></A><a HREF="#Int-735464"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735433"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: </b>Mr. Speaker, the government can purchase $100 million luxury jets for the Prime Minister and his cabinet to flit around in. It can do that in the link of an eye. However, we have deserving people who have earned the benefit being left out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning respect in the House, we in opposition want respect for the widows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talked  about who would get credit. I know the member for Souris—Moose Mountain has been pressing for this for years. If there is a singular issue, it is this.  However, this is not about who is taking credit.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had prepared a speech today praising what would have been the success of finally providing justice for these widows. We truly believed that the minister was going to do the right thing and announce that all widows of veterans would be treated equally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I stand by my request.  This is not only a betrayal of the widows.  It is a betrayal of the currently serving personnel and their spouses as well. For this reason, I will ask again for the minister to resign.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-735464"></A><a HREF="#Int-735480"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735462"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, with respect to the hon. member's request for the minister to resign, as upset as I am and as upset as people like Cliff Chadderton and many others are over the minister's stalling tactics on trying to get a change in the legislation, the member knows very well that if the minister resigned today, there would not be a new minister probably until April to get the problem solved because of the change of leadership within the Liberal party. That will delay the proceedings even longer which would delay our fight. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the member for her speech with regard to the widows.  I am just as upset as she is over this, but if the minister resigned today, that would delay the proceedings even longer.  As upset as the member is, and rightly so, would she not think that it would be just as good  for all of us, including those Liberals on the backbench who support the changes to this,  to keep pushing the minister as hard as we can on behalf of the widows to get this done?  Would she think that it could be a better approach to this ongoing discussion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the member's anger about this.  She is justified.  The fact is there is no reason this cannot be done.  There is absolutely no reason these widows cannot be looked after.</p><A NAME="Int-735480"></A><a HREF="#Int-735494"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735464"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: </b>Mr.  Speaker, I would like to thank the other opposition parties on this side of the House. The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, the New Democratic Party of Canada, the Bloc Quebecois, all of us have fought valiantly for these widows and for all veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it difficult to believe that if a minister were incapacitated that it would hold up an entire bill. Just do the right thing, do the paperwork and have these widows included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party of Canada says it stands for equality.  There is no equality on this issue. This would be a fine time to see whether the Liberals stand for anything.</p><A NAME="Int-735494"></A><a HREF="#Int-735497"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735480"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I want to summarize this matter. If I understand the minister correctly on this point, he has said that they are in agreement on the objective.  Therefore, I presume the objective is to provide justice for the widows and to overcome this problem. In question period I heard him say that the cupboards were bare and that the resources were not there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many problems with that. The Governor General's budget  went up dramatically in the last few years, by millions of dollars.   The trip to Russia alone would pay for a lot of widows' pensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of some of the cronies that we have heard of lately, like Mr. Radwanski. I did some calculations on his budget. We could probably cover 2,000 widows just with what he has squandered away through excessive overspending.  Then  something like $20 million went to the former  finance minister's Canada Steamship Lines.  That would probably fund this program for its duration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member accept the argument that there really is not any government resources to fund the pensions?</p><A NAME="Int-735497"></A><a HREF="#Int-735502"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735494"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for making such fine points. We need only take a look at government waste to see that the money really is there.  For example, $2 billion was lost in HRDC and $1 billion went out the window for the gun registry. I think an estimated $500 million is available to keep the registry going and to get it working, but it really will not save lives. It will serve only to generate artificial work and if anything, trample on the rights of Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also saw a waste of money in the issue involving Mr. Radwanski and lunches for the Minister of  Canadian Heritage to the tune of $28,000 a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really look at the spending habits of the government, individual ministers and the mandarins, we would find  enough money to take care of the women whose husbands fought so valiantly for the freedom we now enjoy.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-735502"></A><a HREF="#Int-735504"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735497"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am here today primarily because of Bill C-50.  Like many members of Parliament, I have been seized with the issue of widows' pensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, the bill was tabled at first reading on September 18 and it would amend a number of acts. Therefore, to find some continuity to it, we have to look at the existing acts.  In the current act the date at which widows become eligible for  pensions is in the regulations. The bill therefore would not amend the regulations; it would amend the acts.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure members, and I would ask the member if she would agree, that the effective date of widows' pensions is a matter which is incorporated in the regulations which can be changed by order in council at any time.  Therefore, it is still possible for cabinet to make the  announcement of an amendment to  the regulations without any further amendments to the current bill.   If the member is not sure of that, she may want to at least consider asking that formally of the minister in writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she agree that if it is by regulation, this can still happen by November 11?</p><A NAME="Int-735504"></A><a HREF="#Int-735508"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735502"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: </b>Mr. Speaker, there are many good things in Bill C-50 and we want it to pass as quickly as possible.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member himself said that this is a matter of changing regulations and this can be done by cabinet at any time. Why has that not been done?  What are we waiting for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All veterans and widows are concerned that if the bill goes forward, the government will forget about it after November 11.  These people will be forgotten again for another year.  That is why we want to ensure that the issue is addressed now, not after November 7, but now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the only Nobel laureate who has born, educated and completed his life's work, in Canada, he was able to do this because the research facilities exited at the Chalk River laboratories.  He will probably be the last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain and continue the international reputation that Canada has developed, thanks to the work of individuals such as Dr. Brockhouse in nuclear research, we must properly fund and build research facilities in Canada. Even non-nuclear countries such as Australia operate research reactors because of the enormous application to science and technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By relying on other countries for a modern neutron source, Canada will find itself falling behind other countries in this type of research where once we were world leaders. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Canadian neutron facility is essential if Canada is serious about developing a knowledge based economy. Let us keep Canadian research dollars in Canada.</p>

This organization has led many battles for housing rights, particularly the right to social housing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent press release by FRAPRU, the hon. member for LaSalle—Émard co-signed a Liberal report in 1990 that accused the Conservative government of having  slashed housing budgets and programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the former finance minister went even further by failing to provide a single penny for new social housing in Canada eight years in a row, which, in Quebec, deprived individuals living in inadequate housing and the homeless of 40,000 social housing units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois will continue to support FRAPRU's demands that the future prime minister reinvest substantially in social housing, once he emerges from behind the curtains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all my colleagues, I want to congratulate and thank FRAPRU and its coordinator, François Saillant, for many years devoted to defending the most vulnerable members of our society.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government has been unprepared for this problem and since the worst has occurred, the government has taken minimal and inadequate remedial action.</p>

For many of them, this is the most disastrous time of their lives and the most distressing time for their family members.  But the government has remained virtually silent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of a proposed merger between the Alliance and the PC Party will stop the Liberals from winning successive elections by default through vote splitting. There are too many parties in the House of Commons fragmenting the votes to the point that the Liberals formed the government in 1993 with only 37% of the votes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians need a real option to the Liberals in the next election capable of forming a government. That is why a merger of Canada's two conservative parties is good for both our country and democracy. With a reunited Conservative Party our votes will really count. We will have the potential to throw out an unwanted government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the leader of the official opposition have earned our thanks for putting the country and democracy first. They deserve the support of all Canadians.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, families residing within first nation communities have had equal opportunity to access these services, either through provincial funding off reserve or federal funding on reserve. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incredibly, as of next March, the on reserve access through the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs will be cut off. Why? Because federal bureaucrats have erroneously concluded that these services duplicate the aboriginal head start programs. They certainly do not, as the professionals who work in this specialized area have attested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of on reserve families in Saskatchewan alone will be negatively impacted as a result of this decision. New Democrats are pleading with Health Canada and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to relook at this program and the clientele it serves.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be readily apparent to them that there is no duplication  and that the continuation of these programs is both urgent and imperative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small business is the fastest growing business sector in Canada and in this sector women-owned businesses are the fastest growing segment.

According to the OECD, Canadian women have the highest participation rate in the world for owning their own businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To focus on this burgeoning increase in women who own businesses, I have been honoured to chair the Prime Minister's task force on women entrepreneurs and I am pleased to inform the House that our report will be released next Wednesday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I must address as Speaker is whether the rules or practices of the House have been infringed in any way.  The timing of this complaint is somewhat problematic for the Chair since it anticipates potential difficulties.  Thus, for example, the Auditor General has suggested that the House will be misled while the government House leader has assured the House that the item in question will be correctly set out in the public accounts.  Even the hon. member for St. Albert seemed satisfied that the interim privacy commissioner is taking the necessary steps to ensure that this will be so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 12, 2003, as part of its approval of the main estimates for 2003-04, the House granted the Office of the Privacy Commissioner $9.8 million as the appropriation for Vote 45.  Members will no doubt want to inquire as to whether the $234,000 has been charged against that appropriation, as required by the Financial Administration Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Chair can find no evidence of a direct attempt to mislead hon. members, I find it regrettable that once again members have found it difficult to obtain the information they require from the estimates documents. Although the overexpenditure will be set out in the Public Accounts for 2002-03, those Public Accounts are usually not available to hon. members when they consider the main estimates for the subsequent year. I know that many members would find it useful to be informed of cases such as this before they have completed their consideration of the main estimates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the hon. member for St. Albert for his continued vigilance in these matters, which is a credit both to him and to the House.  At the present time, however, I can find no grounds on which to find that any breach of our rules has occurred.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I let my colleague from Thunder Bay—Superior North finish his presentation earlier, under Presenting Reports from Committees. This colleague made comments about the presence of the minister at the Standing Committee on Transport yesterday, and is clearly showing discontent with the announcement made by the Minister of Transport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You allowed him that much leeway. What I would like to know is whether a member is allowed, under Presenting Reports from Committees, to voice    a position contrary to the majority of, if not all the members of the Standing Committee on Transport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate your input on that, Mr. Speaker, because the last remarks by the hon. member for Thunder Bay—Superior North should be withdrawn, because he was certainly not speaking  on behalf of the committee as a whole.  </p><A NAME="Int-735850"></A><a HREF="#Int-735852"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735846"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Our hon. colleague from Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans is raising an interesting point; it is in order though and, as such, calls for a short clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the substance of the member's point of order, I agree that it is unusual for a member to add comments about his opposition to a majority decision by the committee. This may raise a question for debate. However, it is not contrary to  our rules. No rule specifically permits or prohibits it. It is the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as our procedure is concerned, I indicated earlier that there is nothing to say it can or cannot be done. Therefore, I must say that this is more a matter for debate than one governed by our rules.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the section “presenting reports from committees” is called, it is my understanding that the point of view of the entire committee is presented. The member who has the opportunity to table a report on behalf of a committee represents the consensus reached by that committee and if comments are added that he disagrees with—</p><A NAME="Int-735853"></A><a HREF="#Int-735854"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735852"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Order. I respect everyone's opinion, but this is entirely a point of debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, with respect to this point, if members want to study the situation further, perhaps the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs could address this issue and provide clarifications as to what is accepted or not in our procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there is no set rule. I cannot put  the  Speaker in a position where he would have to rule one way or the other. As I said earlier, the committee chair usually presents the report, and the subject is closed for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand full well the point raised by the hon. member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. The Speaker addressed the issue to share his personal opinion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add, and I repeat, that this is perhaps an issue that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs would like to address to provide more specific clarifications.</p>

However for the time being  the Chair can only interpret what it has on the books, and there is nothing in our standing orders right now that says it can or cannot take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I leave that in the hands of the membership of all parties of the House to delve into this matter further.  I would submit the possibility might be the procedure and House affairs committee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, it will take some time, as you know, to  get the transcripts and, indeed, to ask the committee to consider the matter and determine whether a report should be made by the committee  to the chamber  in regard to an apparent contempt of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find   this to be  an important issue and   I raise it for the attention of the House. This matter does not come forward very often, in fact there is very little current precedence,  but I believe  some consideration should be given to it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise on a point of order because there is a requirement that the matter be raised at the earliest possible time and it  would appear that the earliest possible time will not be until after the committee can consider it.    I rise  simply to give notice that I  intend to bring a point of privilege as soon as all  the relevant information is available and the environment committee has an opportunity to consider a report to Parliament.</p><A NAME="Int-735872"></A><a HREF="#Int-735877"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735870"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>That certainly does not require the Chair to make a decision at this moment on this matter but certainly, as the member has already mentioned himself in his few remarks, with the appropriate notice the question of privilege will be raised in due time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-50, an act to amend the statute law in respect of benefits for veterans and the children of deceased veterans be read the third time and passed.</p><A NAME="Int-735877"></A><a HREF="#Int-735905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735872"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-50. This is a very important debate for the future of the support programs, including that for widows and widowers. Because there are more and more women in the Canadian Forces,  there will be an increasing number of veterans' widowers who will be entitled to certain benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of this bill was that it would make certain improvements to the existing program. That was the goal. Obviously, we all would have liked to see the improvements to the existing program made in the right order and with respect for all the people, all the women and men who become the widows and widowers of veterans. But this was not what happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, there is a very specific program that provides support to veterans to give them help with housekeeping and grounds maintenance. It has been a much appreciated program, so much so that many requests were made by widows and widowers, because it was a time-limited program. The veterans who qualified for this program could have help with household tasks and grounds maintenance, and it would continue for one year after the death of the veteran. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the majority of surviving spouses can receive this allowance under the veteran's independence program. The program goal is clear from the title. Its purpose was to provide veterans suffering from health problems due to war wounds, for example, with assistance so they could remain independent and continue to live at home and take care of their property. Those unable to do so were entitled to assistance under the veteran's independence program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program provided an allowance for housework. As a result, this  meant someone could be hired to do the housework or yard work. This program took care of that. Under the old rules, once a veteran died, the surviving spouse could continue to receive this allowance for one year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, if veterans were no longer able to do this work while still alive, it was quite logical to cut off this allowance one year after their death. The need was there, it was urgent while the veteran was alive and then, after one year, the need suddenly disappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were long discussions, great debates and the program was amended. Everyone in the House wanted this program to be provided on a permanent basis. Therefore, when a veteran receiving this allowance died, the surviving spouse would be entitled to it for life. That was the objective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, when the regulatory changes were made,  for purely budgetary reasons, one entire portion of the program for surviving spouses of veterans was shelved. A cut-off date was introduced. Surviving spouses of veterans who have died within a  certain period of time could benefit from this program for life, and those no longer receiving this allowance would not be entitled to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the complicated explanations from the minister or the Liberal members make no sense whatsoever.</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person either is or is not a veteran's widow. This bill and the regulations create two categories of widows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will be entitled to the program for life, while others will not be entitled to it at all. Here, I am talking about those who are no longer entitled to it. Those who were subject to the previous legislation and received benefits for a year and complained, the widows who received nothing or lost this assistance after a year. They are the ones who put pressure on the government, explaining that the reason their spouse received benefits from this program was that they were unable to take care of their home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program's objective is to help veterans live independently. It is only normal that in our society, our veterans, those who fought for us and defended us, at least have their independence. That was the objective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several widows and widowers felt that the program was completely unacceptable. They wondered why they were getting benefits for only one year. The government, in its wisdom, has decided to study and analyze the program and say yes to all those who complained about it ending one year after the veteran's death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says that, effective May 12, 2003, widows of veterans who were entitled to the program will receive benefits for life. However, people complained for 10 or 20 years, and said that the program was worthwhile and important. They used the program because they were unable to be independent at home. These are the people who managed to move this issue forward. Yet, because the government was short of funds, it decided to deny benefits to widows whose husbands had passed away before May 12, 2003. In fact it is May 12, 2002, because those who had been receiving benefits from the program since May 12, 2003 would continue to do so for life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the figures available to us, benefits are being eliminated for 23,000 surviving spouses, mostly widows.  Often these women are the ones who fought to obtain the program.  They are the ones who led the battle to let the government know it made no sense to provide assistance for a year and then do away with the program.  Loss of their husbands has meant the loss of their independence.   They are often compelled to sell their homes because they cannot carry out housework and yard work.  Yet the specific purpose of this program was to provide veterans and their spouses with peace of mind.  That was the reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with the new measure whereby, after the death of a veteran, his or her surviving spouse could go on living as before.  We support the measure, but what we do not support is the regulations setting a cutoff date.  It will, according to our estimate, make 23,000 widows ineligible for the program.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has criticized members for stating in the House that certain people would no longer be on the list.  He is the one who drew up this new list.  It encompasses the surviving spouses of veterans effective May 12, 2003 or 2002, depending on the technical calculations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the one who drew up the list, and some people will no longer have any entitlement.  What is even more serious, I repeat, is that these are the people who fought for this program to be maintained, the people who have been trying for decades to get the government to understand the objective of the VIP program.  Its purpose is precisely to allow veterans' families to remain in their homes in peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious matter.  We will be told that care must be taken because of the money involved.  I will spare hon. members a repeat of all the money the government has wasted.  There has been plenty of media  coverage, and plenty of reference in this House to all the scandals and overspending in all departments, not to mention the constant surplus, which they underestimate in order not to have any money left for the provinces.   We are told that the surplus will not be more than $3 billion, yet in the end the figure is said to be $7 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that there is no money. It is a matter of putting money in the right place. That is the reality. What the opposition wabts is simple. There is a good veterans independence program in place, and wives, widows and a number of widowers have been requesting for decades that it be maintained indefinitely so that veterans' widows and widowers can continue to enjoy the same quality of life they enjoyed when their spouse was with them.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat that not all veterans were eligible for this program, only those who  were unable to look after their housekeeping or groundkeeping for any number of reasons, be it health reasons, war injuries or what not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this is an indication that the Liberal government is not spending wisely. We could give a long list of examples of departmental expenditures. Departments could be told to start putting money in the right place. Compensation should be provided to these 23,000 widows and widowers. We in the Bloc Quebecois sincerely believe that this would be spending the taxpayers' money wisely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the simple rationale we are trying to get across to the government. The bill contains many other measures to improve the situation of veterans, former  POWs and others. In that respect, we agree. We are also pleased that there was broad consultation on this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that no one has ever held consultations saying that a cutoff date would be introduced for the veteran's independence program and that there would be two categories of surviving  spouses: those who lost their spouse prior to May 12, 2003, and those who lost their spouse after that date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong to say that it was discussed. The minister is saying that broad consultations were held. However, all the stakeholders challenge this. We cannot have two categories of surviving spouses. But that is what the government is doing today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister can insist all he wants that he is trying to find solutions, but there are none. The only solution is for all the surviving spouses of veterans to be entitled to the veteran's independence program. That is the only solution. No other solution is possible. The minister wants discussions, but about what? Does he want to move back the date from May 12, 2003, to May 12, 2000, or 1990?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no other solutions. The only solution is to put the money on the table to ensure that all the surviving spouses of veterans  are entitled to this assistance program. That is the only possible answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister would have us believe that he is not hesitating, but he is. There is no other alternative.   Thinking that an opposition member would rise in this place to set a new cutoff date or to exclude widows and widowers is wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is for the minister—that is what a responsible minister would do—to move an amendment to his own  bill. He would have to admit that he made a   glaring error in setting a cutoff date that creates two categories of widows and widowers of veterans, and to eliminate it. There is no way that this   date should be maintained and that two categories of widows and widowers of veterans should be created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all we are expecting from the Liberal government. At the end of the day, that is all we are expecting from all the Liberal members who will   rise in this House to speak to Bill C-50. Do not tell us that efforts are being made to find a solution. We want to hear that the bill is fair to all widows and widowers of veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the only outcome the opposition, and the Bloc Quebecois in particular, expects. Why? Because all widows and widowers of veterans are entitled to the same quality of life they enjoyed when their spouse was alive. It is as simple as that. It is a matter of quality of life and humanity, no more no less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the government side is not listening; it does not want to listen. Once again, the minister is trying to hide and to have us believe that he is not hesitating. He is boasting about being able to clearly communicate such a simple idea. The questions  opposition members put to him all boiled down to this: Will you make money available so that all widows and widowers of veterans have access to the same program? That is what they were asking him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister tried his best not to answer the question. The bottom line, as  we know, is a budget issue. We are told that there is no money for these 23,000 widows and widowers who lost their wife or husband before May 12, 2003. That is the reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the federal government surpluses, cost overruns, everything that happens in the public service, and the money the Liberal government has wasted, we do not believe there is no money for this. We believe it is simply a matter of  the minister not wanting to spend that money. He habe better not try to make us believe that veterans and groups have sent him letters of thanks.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that indeed, important provisions have been included in this bill. However, there is no reason for having two categories of spouses of deceased veterans. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be careful. We have to be able to talk about what is good in this bill, but also agree on what does not work in this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government must move calmly and gently. Moreover, all the Liberal members in this House should sit down with the Minister for Veterans Affairs and tell him that the money will have to be found and ask him to pressure the Minister of Finance to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this bill is passed, he will be able to tell us that it will be amended and that we will guarantee all the spouses of deceased veterans that the  veterans independence program will be maintained so that they can continue to enjoy the quality of life they had before their spouse's death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all the Bloc Quebecois is asking for.</p>

Unfortunately this debate has focused on the VIP   particularly with regard to whether or not a certain group of widows will be covered. This raises an interesting question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member just said that the minister should take appropriate action to correct the bill.  The bill is at third reading stage and there is no way at this point to make corrections to it unless the bill is recommitted to the committee for a specific purpose. I do not think that would be useful simply because it may kill the whole bill. I doubt that anybody would want to see that happen. The alternative would be to have assurances that the Senate would make the appropriate changes laid out by the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since members have known about the matter of extending benefits to all widows for some time,  why is it that the committee did not make an amendment deleting the existing regulation which set a date to which benefits would be paid and replacing it with a clause in the bill that would make a clear statement that benefits would be available to all widows?  That is where members want to see this going.  That is a statement of intent of the bill.  The real question is why is that statement of intent of the bill buried in the regulations instead of being in the legislation itself for all to see?  We cannot get out of this at this point in time. We need a compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member  agree that the compromise would be to seek assurance  from the minister through collaboration with members in the House to seek those changes in the Senate?  The bill would then reflect that which I believe the House would support.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we were asking the minister to do was to provide us with the assurance that funds were available and that he would do everything in his power to see that the bill included those widowers and widows excluded by the bill as he had introduced it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never got an answer.  The hon. member for Mississauga South is absolutely right.  It might have been good for the minister to give us an answer today.  It is not that the opposition members have not tried to get one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would advise him, since he is a Liberal MP, to go to see the Minister of Veterans Affairs and ask the question, to ensure that he gets an answer and that the minister will issue a public statetement of  his intention to immediately support a Senate motion to ensure inclusion of the widows and widowers who,unfortunately,  have been excluded by his very own bill.  </p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The option is for the minister to do the right thing in terms of widows' pensions by asking this place for unanimous consent.  That could have been done earlier. It was   done just now, but that was only for  the convenience of the government and not  for what is right for the widows.</p>

There are ways,  as the hon. member explained, for the government, if it wants to, to get its point across, if it wants to.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem right now it does not want to do this. I repeat what I said earlier. The real problem is that the real struggle that has gone on for this veterans independence program was fought by the widows—and the widowers—who will not be eligible for benefits under this program. They are the ones who were entitled to  these benefits for a year, and who complained that the quality of life they wanted was the same independence they had when their husband or wife was alive. That is what they were asking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government agreed to modify the program. The problem is that it has forgotten, deliberately decided not to help the women and men who were receiving the benefits before May 12, 2003. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a problem. The government has money coming out of its ears. That is the reality. The Liberal government has a lot of money and is throwing it around like there is no tomorrow and like the veterans have no tomorrow. That is what we are realizing today. Money is being wasted. Money is being invested in areas where administrative cuts should have been made, particularly when it comes to senior civil servants and    the upper echelons of the federal public service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a Liberal member said that the real problem is money. That is true, the problem is that the Liberal government is wasting money, investing every which way but where it should, and then fails to have enough to help the surviving spouses of veterans who only want one thing: to maintain the quality of life they had when their spouse was alive.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-735958"></A><a HREF="#Int-735999"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735955"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party and my caucus colleague the member  for Saint John who sits on the national defence and veterans affairs committee.  I will represent her but certainly not in the capacity that she could have spoken to the bill.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is anyone in the House who would disagree that she passionately supports and defends the rights of veterans as well as the military. She has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that if there is anyone in the House who  has the feel for what is happening in the veterans portfolio and certainly with the widows of those veterans, she is certainly the one who could put forward a very passionate plea to the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a poor stand-in but   I  will attempt to  put our position forward. I  hope to convince the government that it has  an obligation, a right and a responsibility to change  Bill C-50, if not in the legislation, then in the regulations as was explained by the minister this morning.  And if it is  not changed in the regulations and the legislation, then perhaps it should be fixed when the bill  comes back from the Senate. There is an opportunity to  sit down with the Senate and negotiate the necessary changes that could fix the injustice that has been articulated by previous speakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always good and there is always bad in any piece of legislation.  However,  the omission in this legislation is not only good or bad, it is repugnant.  It is targeting a portion of our society that we should  be assisting in their years of retirement.  We should be providing  those individuals with the VIP pension benefits.  We should be showing them  some respect  for the sacrifices they have made and the losses they have experienced  on our behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is good and there is bad.  There is no question that   Bill C-50 should go forward.  We know full well that we would not want to stand in opposition to the bill because there is an opportunity to correct some wrongs in it. However, when the minister stood today and recognized that there is this sad omission, I did not feel confident that the minister would be able to correct it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to explain the situation as  it has been done before.  However, for the purposes of those people who may be joining us just now, the problem is there is a large group of individuals who are excluded simply because of an arbitrary date that has been chosen in this legislation.  I said a large group of individuals  because I heard that the number is 23,000 but today the minister today said that he does not know.  He does not know what the number is.  He has to get confirmation of the number before he can actually mention what the number is. That is fair ball.  I am okay with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that the number  is 23,000 plus or minus a few.  The minister is not prepared to make that commitment to those 23,000 individuals because of an arbitrary date.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mirror image here by the way.  The mirror image is the hepatitis C compensation package that was put forward by the government.  Maybe there is a model that the Liberals follow. Maybe there is  a manual that is put  in front of ministers. Maybe they are told that  they have to follow this model which  makes some people second class citizens and treats others not as second class citizens.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That model is that there is an arbitrary date.  That date is May 12, 2003.  Before that date those 23,000 people would have obtained  these benefits but  one day after that date those people do not obtain  those benefits.  It is not fair.  It is not equitable.  It is not right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly,  we have to make sure that it is equitable, that it is made proper and that it is made right.  The way to do that, as has been suggested in a number of fashions,   is to change the regulations.  Now I hear that  maybe it is not just the regulations.  Maybe it is not just the legislation.  Maybe it is not just a change from the Senate coming forward.  Maybe it is a matter of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-three thousand people are being excluded from this. I am told that the dollar amounts may well be anywhere from $23 million to $40 million. It is a lot of money, make no mistake about that, but it is not a substantial amount  of money that the people excluded should not take advantage of it.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard that there is ample opportunity for the government to find $43 million or $23 million. As a matter of fact, as I understand it, if we take the lower number, the Governor General spends more than that on an annual budget. I believe that the Governor General, because of her position in our society, should certainly have the ability to have funding.  But I also agree that the widows of veterans or the widowers should have the ability to achieve a certain standard of living and a certain level of independence. To not allow that $23 million or $43 million to flow to those individuals in my estimation would be tragedy and a travesty for the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe would could look at some of the areas to save that $23 million to $43 million. I think it is there. We are told there is a budget surplus. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it may not be money. If it is not money, then the minister must tell us what it is because I did not get an answer to my question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a lot respect for the Minister of Veterans Affairs. He is a fellow Manitoban. I believe he is here for the right reasons and he does what he does for the right reasons. The problem, however, is that perhaps he does not have the influence to put proper legislation forward right now to correct a tragedy and a wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the minister should get cooperation from his backbenches because I know there are many backbenchers in the government right now who support making this equitable and right. Maybe he should get that support to go forward with the regulations and come to this House today, tomorrow or next week and say he has taken the recommendation and has found the necessary money and, in fact, those 23,000 people will be looked after the way they should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are others who agree with me. There are people who have sent letters to the minister and suggested he resign. Frankly, I do not subscribe to that. I believe that the minister should do what is right. He should fight for the veterans and their widows and widowers as one of his last duties in this House, as his last duty perhaps as a member of Parliament.  We do not know.   We may going into another election. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should do what he believes in his heart is right. I believe, in his heart, he is concerned about those people, but unfortunately, he has not delivered. Not to deliver is not doing a  job properly. Let us give him the opportunity to make that change and do it properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are approaching Remembrance Day in the not too distant future.  As a matter of fact, I have a poppy which is not a prop. I was told poppies can be worn only at a certain time. It is not true that we should not consider what the poppy really represents and what we as Canadians should consider when we consider our veterans and our military.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can speak from experience. I have a Canadian Forces base in my riding. I can  put faces to the people that are responsible for what we wish them to do in the military. We send them to Afghanistan and other areas throughout the globe on our behalf, and they do it willingly. Members of our military are the most professional individuals of any military anywhere in the world and they carry our  flag on their arms with pride. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I mention the poppy and the military is because sometimes, other than November 11, we have a tendency to forget exactly what it is that they provide Canadians. Unfortunately, that is what is being reflected in this legislation. We are forgetting a segment of that military dependency and it is not in the best interest of Canadians. </p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the legislation go forward because it is a good small step in the right direction. However,  within the next month or so--if it will be that long that we are in the House and because it involves  a small number of people--the minister should find out what that number is and the financial implication.  He should then return to the House and  tell us that either the change has been made in the regulations or that it will be fixed  in the Senate when it comes forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would make me very happy. It would make the Royal Canadian Legion and the widows of veterans very happy.  It would make Canadians in general extremely happy to have this terrible injustice fixed. When that happens, we would all congratulate the government and certainly the minister for a job well done.  All the calls for his resignation would be moot at that point, as well they should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of my colleague who sits on the committee, who fights as hard as she possibly can for the rights of military personnel and veterans, I would suggest that the sitting backbenchers of the current government let their voices be heard and that they cooperate with the minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, this should not be so difficult.  The Prime Minister is already on record saying that he will fix this problem. Well, he is leaving soon, we think, but I do not think anybody knows just when. I do not even think the backbenchers in the Liberal Party know when, but he has said he will leave and he has said that he will fix this problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his support and the support of backbenchers, and certainly with the Minister of Veterans Affairs having his heart in the right place, this should not even be an issue. This should simply be a slam dunk. The government should be able to come to the House next week and say that the problem is fixed and it is really happy to have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the government for going forward on that basis and I certainly wait with anticipation to hear that it has fixed this terrible injustice to the VIP benefits.  I wish  government members the best of luck in their deliberations in the not too distant future.</p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-735999"></A><a HREF="#Int-736006"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735958"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ivan Grose (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I will not prolong this, but I am going to defend my minister. The hon. member opposite said some nice words about the minister, but I do not think he said enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get this thing in perspective. We have been flogging this horse for so long now that I think it is down to a burrow. What happened was that we reassessed our budget. We had money assigned to programs that we figured we could get away with taking  because the programs were not using up all that money and we wanted to use the money to put it where we could best use it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had five or six things that were on our “we would love to do” list. We took that money and we managed to do five of the six things. There was enough money left in the VIP to look after the widows of those veterans who died before June 2002. There was a bit of misinformation there. If the widows were on the program on May 12 then they would continue on the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all the money we had within the budget. Inasmuch as I am not one of these proverbial spendthrift Liberals, I believe we should stay within a budget. It was a re-apportionment of money within a budget. I do not want to go outside that budget, neither does the minister and neither does anyone else on this side. That was all the money there was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That having been said, the veterans' organizations said, “That is too bad, but let us do what we can”. We might have been better off to say that we would not do anything with the VIP because, after all, there was not much fuss being raised about it so we could have left it alone, but we did not do that. We looked after who we could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the minister is lobbying hard outside the budget to look after those other widows. The Prime Minister has made a commitment to look at it and between the two of them I have hope that it may be done, but all we have at the moment is a hope.  There is no commitment, no guarantee, but we did what we could within the budget.</p><A NAME="Int-736006"></A><a HREF="#Int-736008"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-735999"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik: </b>Mr. Speaker,  I really appreciate those crocodile tears coming from the government side of the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary must know that with the support of this side of the House and all opposition parties there would be support  if the government were to come forward with an additional expenditure of $23 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that budgets are guidelines.  We all know that there are extraordinary budget expenses.  We all know this from a previous life.  We all know that there are things here called supplementary estimates.  We know there are ways of getting additional funds into additional budgets.  We see it every day in every department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the parliamentary secretary saying that the Minister of Veterans Affairs does not have the influence to get $23 million to correct what is seen as a terrible oversight, an injustice and a wrong?  Is he saying that the government cannot come up with $23 million from departments that have expenditures of some hundreds of billions of dollars?  Can the government not find $23 million to come forward and   get the support of all opposition parties in this House to help support widows and widowers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is probably one of the most insignificant arguments I have ever heard in this House, to say, “It is simply a matter of money.  We have done the best we can.  There is no way we can do it”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the amount of fight in the Minister of Veterans Affairs, then I may have to take back some of the nice things I said about him.  Frankly, if I were given 15 minutes on that side of the House, I could probably find $23 million to fix this injustice.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-736008"></A><a HREF="#Int-736012"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736006"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague from Brandon—Souris. To blame the budget is simply nonsense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love to ask the government, where did  the Prime Minister allocate  $100  million for two jets?  I would love to see the budget item on that one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems veterans and their families have is the fact that veterans affairs is a subcommittee.  Many veterans groups are saying it is almost like they are being treated differently than, say, a full committee.  What happens of course is that  members on this side of the House are rushing from committee to committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he consider the possibility, in the next Parliament, that veterans affairs become a full committee?  RCMP officers are now falling under  the veterans' benefits.  We  have  a tremendous number of people and their families   under the guise of veterans affairs and it definitely warrants the attention of a full committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he not agree, or at least agree to look into something of that nature for the very near future, so that veterans and their families could get the respect and attention that they deserve?</p><A NAME="Int-736012"></A><a HREF="#Int-736014"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736008"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik: </b>Mr. Speaker,  as I said earlier, I do not sit on   the defence committee or the subcommittee on veterans affairs, so I do not feel that I am qualified to comment on that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the workload is.  I do know that my member puts an awful lot of energy into protecting and supporting veterans. I would suggest that she would have a better understanding as to whether the member's proposal should come forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a caucus  member of the Progressive Conservative Party, I would  support her recommendation.  If it were to go forward with a full committee as opposed to a subcommittee, I would certainly give her my full cooperation.</p><A NAME="Int-736014"></A><a HREF="#Int-736020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736012"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I do not know of anybody in this place that is not supportive of Bill C-50.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problematic issue comes down to a matter which happens to be buried in the regulations.  I do not know how it  was allowed to stay there when, in fact, members of the House were seeking to bring the spirit and the intent of the act as it existed, and incorporate it into the act and not leave that information buried in regulations. It is really unfortunate that it is there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that even the Senate has the authority to make the amendments because it  has  to do with money matters.   I would have to inform myself a little bit more about the purview or the scope of the Senate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the best that we can do now, and I wonder if the member would agree, and not  risk losing the rest of the bill, is to collectively make the sincere representation to the minister and cabinet to amend the regulation to provide benefits to all widows.</p><A NAME="Int-736020"></A><a HREF="#Int-736023"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736014"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik: </b>Mr. Speaker, that is probably one of the easiest softball questions I have ever had.  It sounds like a Liberal asking a question to a minister during question period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the question is obvious.  Yes, of course, let us get the assurances from the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  Let us get the assurances from the finance minister.  Let us ensure that the regulations will be amended, rewritten properly and that they will incorporate these forgotten few.  That is all there is to it.  It is a no-brainer. I guess that is why Canadians maybe a little cynical about politics right now.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Mississauga South said that it was an oversight, that the legislation was meant to come forward to take care of these issues.  Maybe and maybe not.  Maybe it is a simple thing like money that the parliamentary secretary has put on the table at the present time.  Maybe it was not meant to be funded. Maybe with the pressure that is being applied currently by the veterans themselves, veterans organizations, the opposition, and for that matter, very conscientious members of the backbench of the government has forced the hand of the Minister of Veterans Affairs in a positive way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, let us ensure we have those assurances.  I have said at the onset that we will not be voting against Bill C-50.  There is too much good in the bill to stop it.  That is not the intention. The intention is to fix what is wrong in the bill and if that is the way we can do it, then by all means the member for Mississauga South will have our support in ensuring that takes place.</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-736023"></A><a HREF="#Int-736030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of the federal New Democratic Party in this very worthwhile debate.  Any time is a good time to speak about veterans and their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate the minister as well the parliamentary secretary and the government for moving ahead with Bill C-50.  We in the NDP support many aspects of the bill unequivocally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been heard during previous debate in the House, there is one very serious flaw with the legislation.  Is it money or is it the regulations in the legislation?  It is probably a combination of both.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the government can be so cruel that it would intentionally leave out some widows or widowers.  At the same time, it cannot hide behind budgetary remarks or legislative remarks.  If the government has the will, with the full support I would assume of many of its own members as well as those in the four opposition parties and the support of many veterans organizations and their families, then there should be a way of moving the issue forward so all of them are protected under the same umbrella.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister of Canada can, in record speed, allocate $100 million for two jets that even the defence department has said are not necessary, then surely he or the  future prime minister can easily make it happen.  I do not care what they have to do, but they have to make it happen so all widow and widowers are under the same umbrella. There is no reason in the world why it cannot be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House are encouraging the government to proceed with this legislation.  It has our full support.  Opposition's basic role is to oppose that which is worthy of opposition.  However, we will support legislation brought forward by the government that is proactive as is Bill C-50.  Many parts of this legislation are worthy of support and worthy of rapid approval to get this through the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is all of us in opposition and many members on the government side have noticed a serious flaw in Bill C-50.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Mr. Cliff Chadderton quite well and he is not easily prone to asking ministers to resign.  Out of pure frustration and out of what I would assume is anger, he has felt the need to do so.  I would not want to see the minister resign because he is a decent human being and his heart and his efforts are in the right place.  If he resigned, we would have to wait quite a while for the next veterans affairs minister.  Then we would have to go through this debate all over again. We cannot ask the minister to do something and then at the same time ask him to resign.  That is defeating our own argument. The minister should stay right where he is and a general election will clear up any problems in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present minister can do this if there is a will within Treasury Board or the finance department or if the Prime Minister says that is should happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Sackville--Musquodoboit Valley--Eastern Shore, approximately one-third of my constituents are either in the military, or have retired from the military or are associated with the military in a civilian capacity.  These people are constantly calling me on various issues with regard to the military.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that all of us would like to have more money to do all the things we would like to do.  I know the government has to work within fiscal frameworks, but there are certain times when the obvious slaps us on the head.  </p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious situation in this regard is those of the widowers. Many people who are not even in the military have called my office and asked what is going on. They have asked why the Prime Minister has said that he can correct this deficiency and we are still debating it today in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbolically, November 11 is coming down the pike.  It is what I would call almost a holy day in Canada when we  take the time  to seriously reflect upon those who have gone before us in terms of defence of freedom and democracy. It was not just the soldiers, airmen, merchant mariners and sailors who fought for our freedoms and victories. What about the people who stayed home, kept the home fires burning and kept the families going?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those men and women of the military, past, present and those yet to join, pay the ultimate price. They are willing to put their lives on the line to protect us. It does not just affect them, but their families as well. Many of us in Nova Scotia and the rest of Canada sometimes wear what we call the invisible ribbon. That is the invisible fourth arm of the military, the families. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary knows very well the great job our military family resource centres do across the country, looking after many of the situations that we are discussing right now, many situations that we hope Bill 50 will correct. However there is one glaring omission. The military family resource centres know very well what this will mean if it is not corrected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give credit to the previous admirals, generals and people who made the military family resource centres a very prominent aspect of our military life. I give credit to the previous defence minister who accepted many recommendations in the report of the Standing Committee on Defence and Veterans Affairs on the quality of life.   My previous colleague, Mr. Gordon Earle of Halifax West, worked on it with others. The government accepted many initiatives from that. Thus we are, albeit quite slowly in my opinion, improving the quality of life for  veterans and their families as well as current military personnel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot forget the ones who were here before us. When individuals in the military lay their lives on the line and those lives are unfortunately taken, then, as members of Parliament on all sides, we have to ensure that we respect and accept the ultimate responsibility to those individuals  and their families. That responsibility is to ensure that when members of the military go overseas or do their duties in the country, if they die because of their actions or their duty, their families will not have to fight with the government to get proper benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals in the military have  to worry about their own training and defensive capabilities in order to promote peace and security around the world. The last thing they need is the lingering thought in the back of their minds is if their families will be okay if they are not. That should not even be debatable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something we can correct. I know the parliamentary secretary, himself being a decent individual, would want this corrected. There is nothing stopping him and his colleagues from going to the Prime Minister when he gets back from his trip and telling him they need this corrected now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary and colleagues could explain it to the Prime Minister in their next Wednesday caucus meeting if they have to, but they should get it done. All we are asking is that it get done. Then we will stand up and sing the praises of  the government's in this regard. There are many other issues on which we would not. However it is extremely imperative that this be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I thank all the opposition members and those on the government side who have brought this issue forward. I  also thank  Mr. Cliff Chadderton and all the organizations that have brought this issue forward in defence of veterans and their families.</p><A NAME="Int-736030"></A><a HREF="#Int-736033"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736023"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, the member spoke very eloquently on this subject and  pretty much covered all the bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing continues to concern me. We have a very strong inkling that the minister will make a decision and that he will make an announcement. However, he will make it in his time, not in a time that is convenient for this legislation, not in a time that is convenient for the House of Commons and  not in a time that is convenient for widows and widowers, but in a time that is convenient to government members, their electioneering and spin doctoring. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that speaks volumes. I ask my friend and colleague if that would sit well with him, if that were the case.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-736033"></A><a HREF="#Int-736035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer: </b>Mr. Speaker,  it  appears that may   happen.

All members of Parliament from all sides of the House representing military families and veterans  widows  should be able to  share in the immediate information that is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To announce something  outside and wait for Parliament to rise, or to do something of that nature, would be cheap political theatre.  I think that would be beneath the current minister   from my understanding of the qualities that he displays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the hon. member for Vancouver Island North is incorrect.  I suspect he may be, but I hope he is incorrect and that the announcement will be made very soon right here in the House when we are sitting.</p><A NAME="Int-736035"></A><a HREF="#Int-736037"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736033"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, throughout this debate people have been speculating about numbers:  that 23,000 veterans are being left out; and that  costs  range, I assume, anywhere from about $200 million to some other number, but only about $20 million to $23 million a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if the member has any information on this, but it has come to my attention that part of the problem may very well be, and I intend to follow up on it because I do support the extension of benefits to all widows, that the total projected costs to widows and widowers would have to be booked in the year in which that decision was taken.  All of a sudden it is not so much about  finding $20 million this year and $20 million for next year. It is about finding  $400 million in one year. This is problematic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member may have  some ideas on how we can do this.  I will certainly pursue this  either with the Auditor General or with departmental officials  to determine how we,  as a Parliament, can get around the accounting obligation to book the entire amount so that we can get on with the objectives that I think we all share, which is to extend pension benefits to all the widows and widowers.</p><A NAME="Int-736037"></A><a HREF="#Int-736038"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer: </b>Mr. Speaker, that is the exact cooperation for which  we on the opposition side are looking.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that whatever it takes we should do it.  Whether it is the Prime Minister, the leader of our country,  or the Privy Council, we  should do whatever it takes to get it authorized, get it done and look after these people because it needs to be done.  Hopefully the requirements of it will be done right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand what he is saying and I understand the technicalities around it, but if the Prime Minister of the day really wants this to happen, it can be done.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker,I am  pleased to rise today to debate the private member's bill I have brought forward on behalf of the citizens of Surrey North.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill proposes to amend the Criminal Code with respect to the activity commonly referred to as street racing.  It was introduced because Canadians want the federal government to address the problem.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street racing  is killing or seriously injuring innocent people.  The carnage caused by this reckless behaviour is on the rise in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto and other cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-338 proposes to do something about it  and today I ask the government to take action to stop street racing by supporting its passage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-338 would amend the Criminal Code to provide that street racing is to be considered an aggravating circumstance for the purposes of sentencing a person convicted of an offence committed by means of a motor vehicle under section 220, criminal negligence causing death; or section 221, criminal negligence causing bodily harm; or subsection 249(3), dangerous operation causing bodily harm; or subsection 249(4) dangerous operation causing death. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also  provides for mandatory nationwide driving prohibitions to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a first offence,  a judge must suspend driving privileges for a period of one to three years;  for a second offence, two to five years; and for subsequent offences, three years to life.  Also, if death was caused on the first or second offence, a lifetime prohibition will be imposed on the second conviction.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want anyone who seriously injures or kills as a result of street racing to be prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for a significant period of time.  They do not want individuals convicted of this carnage to serve a sentence and then be allowed to immediately get behind the wheel of a car.  Neither do they want such individuals to simply move to another province to obtain a driver's licence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letters, phone calls and e-mails  to my office from across Canada have expressed outrage over the carnage caused by street racing and  lenient sentences being imposed, including conditional sentences.  The victims do not support using house arrest for anyone  convicted of being responsible for a street race crash that has either killed or seriously injured someone. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Columbia Automobile Association has advised me that its members are clearly in favour of swift and severe penalties for street racers.  In  its 2002 member opinion survey, its members expressed support for all penalties used to punish racers, including two year driver's licence suspensions, vehicle impoundment, fines and demerit points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last  February 6  I received an e-mail from Margaret-Ann Blaney, minister of justice for New Brunswick.  She has forwarded my bill and accompanying information to her officials in the justice department.  She said that the suspension of driving privileges was of particular interest to her officials. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 4, Gord Mackintosh, minister of justice and attorney general of Manitoba, wrote me an e-mail concerning Bill C-338. He said the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario responded to street racing by proposing legislation empowering police officers to immediately seize a vehicle and suspend a driver's licence for 48 hours.  It also proposed to prohibit the use of equipment and substances, such as nitrous oxide, used to boost the performance of engines for the purpose of racing.  Unfortunately, the legislation was not enacted  due to the recent election.  Hopefully  the new Ontario minister of transport will reintroduce this legislation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reminded me that Alberta has significantly increased the penalty for the provincial offence of street racing in the traffic safety act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alberta justice minister went on to suggest that Bill C-338 could be amended to include impaired driving cases.  I would have no problem considering amending Bill C-338 to apply to anyone convicted of impaired driving causing death or bodily harm where it can be established that street racing was a factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my home province of British Columbia, Surrey-Green Timbers MLA, Brenda Locke, called on the federal government to crack down on street racers in a motion she introduced in the B.C. legislature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of her motion on April 7 of this year, B.C. sent a strong message.  Locke's motion calls on Ottawa to remove conditional sentencing for street racers who kill or maim innocent victims.  An amendment was introduced to encompass all criminals convicted of a serious violent crime.  Both the amendment and the motion passed in the B.C. legislature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion was brought forward in honour of the lives of innocent victims of street racing: Jerry Kithithee, Constable Jimmy Ng and Irene Thorpe.  Those three individuals were brutally killed by young men whose reckless, selfish, irresponsible and deliberate actions stole their lives and broke many hearts.  There have been more since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion was an important step in urging the federal government to make the necessary changes to the Criminal Code to make our roads safer.  It was a de facto endorsement of Bill C-338, which I introduced in this place months earlier.  Bill C-338 proposes the Criminal Code changes that B.C. seeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street racing is the height of recklessness and a deliberate endangerment to communities.  British Columbians understand the magnitude and the consequences of this activity and question why the courts treat it so lightly and ineffectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbians seek justice for street racers and their victims.  There have been numerous incidents where victims simply do not see justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of support groups in British Columbia support a crackdown on street racing.  They include Family Survivors Against Street Racers, Our Angels in Heaven and Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.C.'s solicitor general and minister of public safety, Rich Coleman, confirms that 60 vehicles involved in street racing have been seized and 180 driver's licences were suspended since amendments were made to provincial legislation in 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Coleman stated the following:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geoff Plant, the attorney general of British Columbia, says that conditional sentences have no role to play in street racing offences.  He states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MLA Locke concluded her remarks on the passage of her motion by saying:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that the Nina referred to in this case is Nina Rivet who is a sister of Irene Thorpe, the woman who was run down by a street racer while out for a walk one evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the position of the Liberal government?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to a letter from me late last year, the Minister of Justice does not appear to be interested in helping to stop street racing.  He says that mandatory minimum criminal penalties “do not work from the point of view of general deterrence and recidivism”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no empirical evidence linking deterrence and recidivism as they relate to street racing.  In fact, in a recent B.C. case, the driver who was  eventually convicted for the street racing crash that caused the death of Irene Thorpe  was arrested for speeding while he was out on bail, even though his licence was suspended as a condition of that bail.  This counters the minister's contention because it shows clearly that there is a need for legal deterrence.  There is a recidivism problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister also says that driving prohibitions should remain discretionary.  He says that sometimes they may not be necessary because of long terms of punishment handed down to street racers who kill or seriously injure.  The problem with the minister's contention is that no one has ever received any of these long prison terms for convictions resulting from street racing. </p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House arrest is being used for street racers who kill or injure people.  This is inappropriate from the standpoint of the victims or their survivors and the protection and safety of communities that have a serious street racing problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also maintains that there are only a few minimum sentences provided for in the Criminal Code and that it is not willing to add more, such as the mandatory drivers' licence suspensions called for in this bill, but there are many areas in the Criminal Code that provide minimum sentences.  I counted 26 offences in the 2004 <i>Martin's Annual Criminal Code</i> that carry a minimum sentence upon conviction.  And many Canadians agree that there should be more minimum sentences for many more offences in the Criminal Code.  Our criminal justice system needs more teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also believes that taking account of aggravating circumstances for the purposes of sentencing is a very rare tool provided for in the Criminal Code.  The justice minister suggested that aggravating circumstances for sentencing are virtually limited to hate motivated crimes, abuse of position of trust and authority, spousal and child abuse, criminal organization and terrorism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are other examples.  Bill C-15A, passed in June 2002, made home invasion an aggravating factor in sentencing for certain offences. A judge sentencing a person for unlawful confinement, robbery, extortion or break and enter must consider it an aggravating circumstance if the offence was committed in an occupied dwelling where the offender was either aware that it was occupied or was reckless in this regard, and where he or she used violence or threats of violence against a person or property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point out that when I presented a motion to that effect at the justice committee a year or more earlier, government members called me silly, and yet they enacted it themselves a year later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-46, currently before the justice committee, in clause 3 sets out four aggravating factors for sentencing purposes with respect to fraudulent manipulation of the public markets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's lame excuses betray a lack of serious consideration being given to this issue by this government.  There is no requirement to equate street racing with other crimes in order to allow it to be considered as an aggravating circumstance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect that the government will hang its argument against my bill on its refusal to consider minimum sentences and the use of aggravating circumstances when sentencing.  Those are not good enough grounds for the government to fail to address the problem of street racing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanctions should reflect the fact that street racing is an activity that goes beyond the regular criminal activities involving motor vehicles that are covered by the Criminal Code.  Driving prohibitions must be nationwide to prevent anyone convicted of causing death or serious injury while street racing from simply moving to another province and continuing to drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As street racing incidents causing death and serious injury continue to occur in our major cities, passage of Bill C-338 would serve as a deterrent.  This is a proactive legislative measure that would provide one step in the fight to stop street racing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the government has the opportunity to support Bill C-338.  It has an opportunity to stand up for the victims and to hold the perpetrators properly accountable.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the bill introduced by the hon. member of the Canadian Alliance is intended to increase the gravity of offences if they were committed during street racing.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, and young people themselves,  are beginning to understand that youth often see cars as a means toward freedom, getting out, getting away.  WIth a car, a person can do just about anything he wants. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young men and women—for both sexes are now attracted by cars—see cars as a means of empowerment, but they need to understand that parliaments are enacting legislation to stop them from abusing that power.   If, for one reason or another, this member's bill is not passed by this House, one day another Parliament, whether the House of Commons or a provincial legislature, will pass far more stringent measures on street racing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for young people to understand that no matter how fine the car is—it can become a toy—it can also become a deadly weapon. The races that fascinate young people and raise their adrenalin are dangerous and can cause death. Politicians cannot allow this to happen. We cannot risk having people injured or killed because they happen to end up on the street where the race is being held.  We cannot allow this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament must send a clear message to those who indulge in these excesses. That is the message we must send our young people. The text of the bill before us, at first glance, seems once again to focus on criminalizing the situation. However, the role of Parliament is to try to get society to show self-respect. Young people have to understand that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true they have fabulous machines. Thousands of dollars are spent on these cars. That is great for shows. However, a person who owns such a vehicle wants to see it in action. Increasingly, companies are giving consumers the opportunity to test drive these vehicles on race tracks. I encourage people to use such tracks to see how well these cars perform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, young people must understand that they should never use their cars to race on the streets, roads or highways.</p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed limits must be respected. That is the message. It is more important than criminalizing certain activities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may think people are still out to get them. That is not the message. We simply want them to be able to live with the other people in our society, with those who do not choose speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society is making a choice when it puts speed limits on highways and streets. Everyone is expected to obey them, the young, the old, and those in the middle like me. It is important that we all be able to  respect each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, generally,  the message we are trying to send. It is important. If there had been no speeding, if there had not been street racing, if there had not been accidents, and often, accident victims, we would not be here today discussing a bill such as that introduced by the hon. member. We are doing so because there have been excesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, young people do not discourage each other. That is, they encourage each other, when they should be doing the opposite. If they respected themselves and respected their cars, they would tell their friends who speed, “Do not do that, because one day, they will stop us from doing it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is exactly what is happening. In fact, legislatures are discussing and banning the use of nitroglycerine and many other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, in some respects, the young people themselves must be able to help each other obey the laws. When the laws are not respected, we, as members of Parliament, must ensure that the majority of the public can lead a peaceful life. That is the purpose behind this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the method often used to discourage is the stick, not the carrot. An offence must be punished. So we have legislation setting out offences. The bill introduced by the hon. member from the Canadian Alliance proposes to toughen the penalties for street racing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, we must commend the bill. Obviously, if it is before us today, it is because there have been problems. However, aside from the fact that laws like this lean heavily on the stick, I hope that young people understand that they have to spread the word among themselves that existing laws must be obeyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obeying the law means going to places specifically designed to accommodate this kind of activity. I commend the business people who, increasingly, are developing facilities for car racing. Yes, they are doing that. There are such facilities. I therefore encourage young people to race in appropriate facilities. Elsewhere, on our streets, roads and highways, they must obey the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this would have the advantage of preventing similar bills from being introduced  and legislation passed because there has been abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the point I am trying  to make to the young men and women who see their cars as a means toward freedom. That is true  and that is good. It is true that you can do anything you want with them. These small cars have more powerful engines than the biggest cars we had in the days when I enjoyed speeding. I am not saying that we did it all the time, but occasionally we went over the speed limit. Still, offenders must be punished. That is how we end up with this kind of  bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, I urge all hon. members to support the member for Surrey North, but more importantly, I urge young people to obey existing laws to make sure that bills like this one are  never passed in our parliaments.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-736069"></A><a HREF="#Int-736072"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736062"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Harold Macklin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, Bill C-338 proposes to amend the Criminal Code to specify that street racing must be deemed to be an aggravating factor when a court is sentencing an offender in relation to four offences.  These offences are: criminal negligence causing death; criminal negligence causing bodily harm; dangerous driving causing death; and dangerous driving causing bodily harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently when performing the very difficult task of setting the appropriate and proper sentence, the courts must take into account the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the offender.  This is the law. Where the Crown or the defence or both believe that the sentence is not appropriate, each may appeal from the sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the many offences in the Criminal Code, there will be widely varying circumstances under which each offence might be committed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitigating and aggravating factual circumstances, including any street racing, are already placed before a sentencing judge. Unless there is some compelling reason to specify that certain circumstances are aggravating, it is better not to multiply the instances where the Criminal Code spells out that a particular way of committing the offence will be an aggravating factor. In my view, we are not seeing any such reason emerging from decisions of the trial courts and the appeal courts with regard to the four offences when street racing is a part of the circumstances of these offences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-338 is not proposing to alter the periods of imprisonment available to the courts for the four offences.  I am in agreement that the available periods of imprisonment for these offences are already very serious.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code makes it an offence to cause death by criminal negligence.  This is a very serious offence, which could be committed, for example, when driving a motor vehicle in a street race. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crown prosecutor is required to prove that the accused's behaviour showed a “wanton and careless disregard for the lives or safety of others”, and that this behaviour caused the death.  The maximum penalty for causing death is a period of life imprisonment. This is equal to the maximum penalty for manslaughter and the maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dangerous driving that causes death, the crown prosecutor is required to prove that the driving which caused the death was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle was being operated and the amount of traffic that at the time was or might have been expected to be at that place. It is easier for the crown prosecutor to prove the elements of the dangerous driving offence than the elements for the offence of criminal negligence causing death.  The maximum penalty for dangerous driving causing death is 14 years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum penalties for the offences of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and dangerous driving causing bodily harm are the same as the maximum penalty for impaired driving causing bodily harm.  All are set at 10 years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without going into detail, I would simply observe that Bill C-338 would replace the discretion a court now has to impose a driving prohibition order, which would start after any period of imprisonment had been served with a mandatory order of driving prohibition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is logic to the present law, which gives the court discretion on whether to impose a driving prohibition order.  If a court imposes a long period of imprisonment, the court may believe that there is no need to have the offender prohibited from driving at the point of release from imprisonment, which will be far in the future.  In such cases, the offender will have been off the streets and away from the wheel for a very long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I note that Bill C-338 proposes to put the street racing factor alongside the impaired driving provisions in section 255.1.  Even if the bill were advisable, which I do not believe it is, the provision would more logically be placed within a new section 221.1, criminal negligence, and within a new section 249(5), dangerous driving.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I will say that unless we have a strong indication that the courts are not treating street racing as an aggravating factor for these four offences, restraint ought to be exercised in specifying that street racing become an aggravating factor.</p><A NAME="Int-736072"></A><a HREF="#Int-736078"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736069"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, PC): </b>Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that street racing is injuring and killing innocent people, besides those in the vehicles. I am honoured to rise to speak on Bill C-338 on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation treats street racing as an aggravating circumstance when sentencing anyone convicted of killing or seriously injuring someone with a motor vehicle if it is established that street racing was a factor at the time of the incident. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislative change will provide tougher sentencing. Bill C-338 also proposes a nationwide mandatory driving prohibition to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many young thrill-seekers, street racing is a popular pastime that has taken its toll in lives lost. Statistics on street racing crashes vary by region. Some police forces and insurers keep track of numbers and some do not. Recently in Toronto, for example, 17 people have died in a one year period as a result of street racing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street racers put more than their own lives at risk. In many cases, passengers, pedestrians and other motorists are killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When things go wrong, the causes are common: driver inexperience, excessive speed,  and variables  such as traffic and road conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street races take a number of forms. Some are highly organized and can involve tens of thousands of people. Some are spur of the moment, based on two willing motorists in traffic. Penalties for street racers who kill range from a suspended sentence to life in prison. It is up to the judge, as we know. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each province has its own motor vehicle act which deals with non-criminal street racers, those who neither harm nor kill anyone but are caught in the act. It is hard for police to catch racers in the act, since they race in brief spurts and can outdistance squad cars quickly. Instead, drivers are usually caught on equipment violations such as the relocation of the car's gas tank to the trunk or the addition of tanks containing nitrous oxide, which helps achieve higher speeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer, the CBC spent a considerable amount of time covering street racing in the province of British Columbia. Vancouver and the surrounding areas had an active street racing scene, which has left a trail of death in its wake in recent years and certainly did this past summer. Police in Vancouver do not keep records on the number of street racing deaths, but a look at insurance records gives some indication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia says that from 2000 to late 2002, 86 people between the ages of 18 and 21 were killed in car crashes in that province. Most of the crashes involved high speeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid growing public outcry and a mounting death toll, the B.C. government responded by enacting the toughest laws in Canada against street racing. In 2002, the province introduced legislation that gave police the authority to immediately impound any vehicle used in a street race. A vehicle can be impounded for 48 hours for a first offence and for up to 30 days if the driver is caught again within two years. It also allows police to suspend street racers'  drivers' licences on the spot.  As well, it sets a maximum fine for street racing: $2,000 plus demerit points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario's hot spot, as we know, is Toronto. It also is the deadliest area in the province. Between May 24, 2001 and May 24, 2002, according to police, there were 17 deaths in that city attributable to street racing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own province of Manitoba, under section 189 of the province's motor vehicle act, no person shall race a motor vehicle. It carries a fine of up to $5,000 upon conviction, plus 8 demerit points, which also means that a driver's insurance goes up by $250 and a driver's licence can be suspended for 6 to 9 months. There are also prohibitions against inappropriate modifications to vehicles, although some exemptions are made for raising and lowering suspensions, mostly for heavy loads and mobility vehicles.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  know that the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom also have put in provisions to deter street racing, but as members know, a lot of youths do not understand at this point in their lives how dangerous street racing is. I think that every generation since the invention of the motor vehicle probably has had some kind of racing phenomenon or experience, but the problem is that the cars youths have today are not like the cars we used 40 or 50 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me say that this party certainly supports the bill.  We will certainly vote for Bill C-338 down the road.</p><A NAME="Int-736078"></A><a HREF="#Int-736084"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736072"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate my friend from Surrey North who lives in what I think is a very great part of the country as I used to live there myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who knows the hon. member for Surrey North, knows that he does not present private members' bills in a frivolous manner. We all know the hon. member for Surrey North does his homework and his research and for that he has to be commended.  I think he is quite an articulate individual in the justice committee, as well as in the House of Commons.  He stands up for what he believes in, and it comes from the heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he and his supporters are attempting to accomplish with this bill, and I rank myself as one of those supporters, is preventing more people from being killed.  He is trying to prevent the carnage on our highways and in our cities.  He is trying to save lives.  That is the entire essence of the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may digress for just a few minutes, the entire Bill C-68 gun legislation was sold on a bill of goods.  We were told that if this one billion dollar legislation, which is a one billion dollar boondoggle, saved one life, then it would be money well spent.  If that is the thinking of the government, then why would the government not support the enactment of this legislation because it will save lives and prevent people being killed or seriously injured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I am a member of the NDP Party in Nova Scotia.  People may ask why I am singing the praises of this member.  It is because I know this individual and he does not bring these things in frivolously.  He does his homework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that there will be cross-country support for this. We know Mothers Against Drunk Driving supports it. We know police associations, once they have had an opportunity to digest this information, will support it.  We know attorneys general  in various provinces support it.  Political members of Parliament from other parties support it because it will save lives. Why not give the justice system another tool in its tool box to  say to  anyone in this regard that thou shalt not street race?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to read the executive summary of the legislation.  It states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This enactment amends the Criminal Code to provide that “street racing” is to be considered an aggravating circumstance for the purpose of sentencing a person convicted of an offence committed by means of a motor vehicle under section 220 (causing death by criminal negligence) or  221 (causing bodily harm by criminal negligence) or subsection 249(3) (dangerous operation causing bodily harm) or 249(4) (dangerous operation causing death).</small></td>

</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In addition, it provides that any person convicted of an offence under any of these provisions by means of a motor vehicle that was involved in street racing at the time the offence was committed be subject to a mandatory driving prohibition, which shall be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed in respect of that offence.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just going through the summary of it should give qualified support, even if someone is hesitant at all.  The reality is drunk driving laws in Canada have increased in severity as we have gone along, not enough for some folks.  People like myself would like to see even harsher restrictions on drunk driving laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is very similar to that.  Why not use this tool to prevent street racing, to give these young people or anyone else who considers street racing something to think about by telling them that if they race and something goes wrong or they get caught, these will be the consequences.   I think it is a very rational bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the financial argument to this.  We all know the cost of health care when someone is injured in a motor vehicle accident. If that accident can be prevented,  right there we would save money.  What about insurance costs?  I am sure insurance companies would love to have this type of legislation knowing full well that if it reduces the number of incidents, it will reduce the number of claims they have to pay out.</p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this bill associates itself, rightly or wrongly, with a lot of young people who are involved in street racing.   I too watched the CBC special about that.  I think that the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation did a very good job in exposing what happens on our streets, especially late at night   in the vacant areas of our towns, as was mentioned by my colleague from Dauphin—Swan River.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that  we in Parliament are here to enact and bring forward this type of debate.  That is exactly what the member for Surrey North is trying to do.  He is trying to encourage debate and dialogue to see how we can fix the problems within the justice system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the concerns he has brought forward.  For that he should be congratulated, and  we should let him know that we fully support this. If it saves one life, it is a good bill.  I suspect that this  would  save many lives down the road.  It would prevent many people from being injured and it would bring more sanity to our streets than is there now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can honestly tell the member for Surrey North that he  has my full support.  I will continue to work with him, in the House or anywhere else, to promote this very fine initiative.</p><A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-736084"></A><a HREF="#Int-736090"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736078"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of Bill C-338 proposed by my colleague from Surrey North, which is an act to amend the Criminal Code with regard to street racing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the bill I am both saddened and concerned.  I am concerned about a problem that is a major killer of young Canadians right across the country and in my riding.  I am saddened that the government has done absolutely nothing about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-338 was first read in the House on December 11, 2002. One would normally have expected that in the intervening 10 months someone on the Liberal benches would have seen the obvious merit in the bill and would have proposed the necessary changes to the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Liberals had slept through the introduction of Bill C-338 on December 11, one might have expected them to wake up the very next day when the hon.  Norm Sterling, then Ontario's minister of transport, tabled in the Ontario legislature Bill 241, an act to enhance safety and mobility on Ontario's roads, 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill 241 proposed cracking down on street racing by removing aggressive and unsafe drivers from the road by adding vehicle impoundment and driver's licence suspension both for 48 hours to the current tools available to police.  The Ontario government could not go further because amending the Criminal Code is not something that a provincial government can do.  It requires someone in this House to act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to address the glacial pace of progress in the House under the Liberal government. Bill C-338 was written in reaction to a February 2002 decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court to sentence two street racers to two years less a day of virtual house arrest, three years probation and five year driving prohibitions despite the fact that they had been doing twice the legal speed limit and had killed  a pedestrian, Irene Thorpe, on November 13, 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier case another street racer had received a four year prison sentence when his car hit and killed pedestrian Jerry Kithithee in June 2000. The only real difference between the two cases was that the driver who killed Kithithee was going a little faster and had run a red light. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbians and Canadians do not make such distinctions.  If a person  is doing twice the legal limit and is involved in a race with another car on a street, an act in itself that ought to be illegal, and kills someone, the person  should face more than just house arrest. That  in essence is what Bill C-338 demands.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Liberal government had its finger on the pulse of British Columbia, it would have quickly reacted to the outrage that resulted from the lenient sentence given to Irene Thorpe's killers by changing the Criminal Code just as Bill C-338 suggests. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Liberal government was not deaf to the concerns of British Columbia, it would have changed the Criminal Code on September 15, 2002. That is the day after RCMP Constable Jimmy Ng, who was 31, was killed when a street racer hit his RCMP cruiser. The Liberals should have made the change, if only to make sure that such a tragedy would not happen again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Liberals had reacted  to the death of either Irene Thorpe or Constable Jimmy Ng, Bill C-338 might not have been necessary to table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gets worse.  Even when the bill got first reading in the House, the government decided to continue to sleep.  Instead of recognizing the important issue raised by the member for Surrey North and the official opposition and adopting his very reasonable solution, the government chose to do nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians are quickly learning, inaction by the government often has a cost.  In this case Liberal arrogance and inaction has an astonishingly high price: the lives of young Canadians, mostly between the ages of 18 and 21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In British Columbia alone in 2000-01, according to the Insurance Bureau of British Columbia, 86 young people between the ages of 18 and 21 were killed in car crashes, most involving high speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ontario in the past two years, more than 17 people have died in street racing related accidents. Police say that there are more than 20,000 street racers in the Toronto area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Saskatchewan four people have died since 1999 in street racing accidents.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Manitoba no one has died yet but convictions for street racing doubled from 1997 to 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Liberals have continued to ignore what is a growing problem, the provinces and municipalities of the country have acted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatoon the police operate a program called Street Legal using Saskatchewan International Raceway as its official race venue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Edmonton since September 9, 2002, the police have opened up Budweiser Motorsports Park to the public for racing. The public can even race the police. It is another effort to get racers off the street without using a tow truck and a heavy fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Montreal also allows street racers to race legally on designated tracks so that young drivers who really want to race can do so safely without risking their own lives or the lives of others.</p><A NAME="T1415"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1415"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1415)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In British Columbia  three weeks ago, on October 3, solicitor general, Rich Coleman, introduced tough new modifications to B.C.'s graduated licensing program, in part, to combat street racing. In August 2003, his department unveiled its driver improvement program policies and procedures. It defines a street racer as “an individual who has engaged in high speed or unsafe racing in competition or on public highways”, and states that the police will impound any vehicles used in a street race. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saskatchewan police have similar powers to impound vehicles under that province's highway traffic act. In Regina, during the weekend of August 15 to 17 this past summer, 12 vehicles were seized for street racing and 58 tickets were issued. In fact, a candidate in the Regina municipal election was recently quoted as saying that street racing was the number one issue in his ward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of street racing concerns Canadians from coast to coast and even though the provinces and municipalities are trying to address the problem, in many cases, through innovative new programs, the fact is that unless Ottawa acts  all provinces can do is suspend licences and impound cars.  Therefore it should come as no surprise that street racing continues to be a real problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Tuesday in Vancouver, two 2004 Subarus and a 1999 Mercedes SUV were racing neck and neck at speeds close to 140 kilometres an hour until one vehicle hit the guardrail at the Fir Street off-ramp. The drivers, two 18 year old Vancouver men,   and a 21 year old Richmond man, were issued speeding tickets, 15 day driving suspensions on the spot  and had their cars towed. Vancouver police have issued, this year, eight driving suspensions to street racers and speeders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Bill C-338 passes, races like the one we saw last Tuesday will continue because street racers are not seeing any action from the Liberal government. In fact, in the month of September the press reported three high profile cases of street racing, including two where people were killed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 29  a man convicted of driving one of the cars involved in a deadly road race that killed 17 year old Payam Yaghoobi in February 2001 was sentenced to eight months in a youth facility and four months supervision in the community. The driver of the second car involved in the street race was earlier sentenced to three years probation and nine months house arrest after he was convicted of dangerous driving causing death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 27 in Vernon, a 19 year old Kamloops man had his vehicle seized and his driver's licence suspended after a street racing incident in which speeds reached 120 kilometres an hour after two vehicles accelerated from a street light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 4, Ariel Lipovetzky was charged with two counts of dangerous driving causing death. Daniel Kordis and Michael Mizun, both 16, were killed in a July 11 crash in Mississauga. The car they were in lost control, crossed two lanes and hit a tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly, the way the Criminal Code works, unless Bill C-338 is passed, street racing is just a provincial traffic offence unless someone dies or is seriously injured. If we want to really address this problem  we will encourage cities, like Edmonton, Saskatoon and Montreal, to give young drivers a safe place to race, and we will pass Bill C-338.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-338 would define street racing and treat it as an aggravating circumstance for the purposes of sentencing persons convicted of criminal negligence causing bodily harm or death, or convicted of a dangerous operation of a vehicle causing bodily harm or death, as per sections 220 and  221, and subsections 249(3) and 249(4) of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also require mandatory nationwide driving prohibitions to be served consecutive to any other sentence imposed. First offenders would lose their licences for one to three years, second offenders for two to five years, and subsequent offenders for three years to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driving prohibitions in Bill C-338 are not always as tough as provincial standards but apply nationally, so that a street racer in one province cannot race again anywhere in Canada for the duration of the probation. Bill C-338 is balanced, well thought out and necessary to secure safety for Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not react to the lenient sentence given to Irene Thorpe's killers in February 2002. It ignored the September 14, 2002 death of RCMP Constable Jimmy Ng who was killed by a street racer. It slept through the introduction of this bill on December 11, 2002, and remained sleeping when the Government of Ontario tabled legislation dealing with street racing the very next day on December 12, 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government has slept, roughly 100 young Canadians aged 18 to 21 have killed themselves in street races in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario, terrorized Canadians and countless others have been injured as a result of these actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time  the government woke up to the need to work with the provinces and cities to deal with the problem of street racing, to pass Bill C-338  and make our streets safe again  for young drivers and for those who share the roads with them.</p><A NAME="Int-736090"></A><a HREF="#Int-736120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-736084"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted  to speak to the bill brought forward by  my colleague and neighbour, Bill C-338, on street racing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not duplicate what   others before me have said  but I will  talk about what street racing is. I do not think it is a new phenomenon. It is not something that is just here now. Movies like <i>Grease</i> and others show that it has been around. What is really different about street racing today is the cars and the attitudes. In today's world we have young people who perhaps have a little bit too much money, a little bit too much time on their hands and very little regard for the people outside their own circle of friends. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation calls for much more  than this legislation. However what I think my colleague is attempting to say is that where it is  happening and where the courts and police are able to convict the perpetrators, the courts must  deal with it in a more serious way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must  send a message to our  young people that if they want to race their cars  they should  go to an  area that has been  set aside for racing vehicles and which has safety measures in place in case something goes wrong. That would take them out of a situation where innocent people could be hurt or killed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vancouver has had more than its fair share of incidents where young people, usually in the evening, have prearranged locations  where  they  race   each other down city streets with regular traffic. Young people, generally, do not have the experience  to handle the  situations in which they find themselves and sometimes they  lose control of their cars. These situations are dangerous, not only for themselves and their passengers, but also for people who happen to be crossing the street, walking down the sidewalk or who are driving their own vehicles and just happen to get in the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a little concerned that in some situations, although the cars are being impounded and therefore there is a financial cost to street racing, what has not been said is that those impounded cars generally go back to the family, usually the parents because they own the car. Therefore the cars are not being taken away and  impounded for long periods of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual penalty these young people are  receiving   is having  to stay home for a couple of months or  receiving probation and   having  to talk to a probation officer. From incidents that have been recited  earlier, a lot of these young people, who have the attitude that causes the problem in the first place, totally disregard the fact that they do not have a driver's licence any more and      are on probation,    go out   and are caught speeding again without a licence. There have to be tougher penalties for those who have a reckless attitude and who think they can flaunt the law and the court orders given to them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stronger message  has to be sent to these young people but it  cannot be done through the police. The police are doing all they can.  They have increased the unmarked police vehicles which have video systems so that they can record the activity for evidence in court appearances. All the detachments in the area have new radar units, at least in British Columbia. They are getting more equipment like spiked belts so that speeding cars can be stopped. However unless the courts follow up on  activities in which the police are involved, how on earth are we to send a lasting message to these young people?</p><A NAME="T1420"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1420"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1425"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1420)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read articles where places are being created for these races in Ontario.   There is a place in Mission, B.C., where they  can race in a safe environment.  It is not that they cannot get it out of their system somewhere.  It is that they have a reckless disregard for the safety not only of themselves, but of other people by racing on city streets. It will take a lot more effort than what the government has seemingly been willing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Surrey North gave a very logical reason of why he is doing it.  He gave a dissertation of the support that he has received from all provinces across the country.  Yet the response from the government was that because it was not a government bill and because it did not come up with the idea, it will find some reason not to support it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, I am becoming tired with  that kind of attitude from the Liberals across the way.  Not all good ideas come from the Liberal Party and it is about time that it accepted that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Liberals deliberately take an issue such as this and find some small, irrelevant reason not to support the concept, then they should present a better form.  If there are problems with the fact that they do not like the minimum sentences and that they do not like this or that, then why do they not come up with some amendments or some way that it can be advanced in a better form?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians want minimum sentences.  Canadians are tired of seeing the courts disregarding the feelings that Canadians have toward their laws and where their laws should be going.  I do not think Canadians want to see young people who are caught racing convicted of reckless driving.  Causing bodily harm or death is another thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reckless driving,  Canadians do not want young people locked away and the key thrown away. However, Canadians want to have a serious enough penalty that young people are not going to be reoffending.  Canadians want them to see that this is not a fun and cool thing to be doing.  This is a criminal act and there is a criminal price to pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that the Liberals do not seem to think that Canadians have the right to care.  However, Canadians do care.  Canadians understand that the next time they are on a city street they may be the ones ending up in a wrecked vehicle with a loved one dead beside them at the side of a road caused by young people racing in cars  with a total disregard for other people on the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are concerned about this issue and the Liberal government should also be concerned.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Liberals have some concerns about the way this legislation is put together they should not just defeat it for the sake of defeating it because it is not their idea.  The government should help put it in a form that will be acceptable to all.  I think I am right in assuming that the government would find that most of the opposition parties would support the bill.  Instead of turning it down point blank, let us get it in a form that would be acceptable to the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ensure that the reason that we are doing this is to protect Canadians.  We are not only protecting Canadians but protecting the young people who are becoming involved in this reckless activity.  Let us ensure that the message that is given to them is a very strong message in order to discourage that kind of behaviour.</p><A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
