the offence of theft of motor vehicles.

business of stealing motor vehicles.  Organized crime and other 
gang related enterprises are becoming quite active in this type 
of criminal activity.

sentence of four years of imprisonment on anyone who is convicted 
of more than one theft of a motor vehicle.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-251, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (abduction). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, again I thank my colleague from Athabasca 
for seconding the bill.  I am reintroducing legislation to amend 
the criminal code, specifically the section concerning the 
offence of abduction of young persons.  Section 281 currently 
provides for the offence of abduction of persons under the age of 
14 years by a person other than the person's parents or guardian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proposing to change the offence so that it applies to the 
abduction of all persons under the age of 16.  My intent with 
this change is to provide law enforcement and the courts with 
another arrow in their quiver to combat the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of young people by those involved in the sex trade.

Corrections and Conditional Release Act (statutory release 
granted only when earned and subject to mandatory supervision). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I too thank my hon. colleague from 
Athabasca for seconding the bill.  The purpose of the amendment 
is to ensure that all inmates applying for statutory release 
establish that they are rehabilitated to the extent that public 
safety and the safety of individuals are not jeopardized by their 
being at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also requires that all those on statutory release to be 
subject to a mandatory supervision order.  Statutory release 
would not be granted if the offender has shown behaviour that 
raises reasonable doubt about public safety or complying with the 
supervision order.

consent from 14 years to 16 years for sexual activity between a 
young person and an adult.

of the same petition on behalf of Mrs. Diane Sowden in Coquitlam, 
British Columbia.

to combat sexual exploitation of our youth by those involved in 
the sex trade.  With the addition of the 1,200 names on this 
instalment, the total number of citizens who have signed this 
petition now stands at over 13,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am the 
spokesperson for some 50 people in my riding who are calling 
upon the government to pass legislation requiring the 
identification of genetically modified products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just heard it said out in the lobby that it was important 
for this to be done because people with allergies to certain 
products are at risk of a major reaction if they do not know the 
contents of what they are eating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently read an article that said there is a plan to cross 
tomatoes with spiders.  When the tomatoes start climbing the 
walls, it will be a bit too late to 
pass any legislation.  One may well wonder why such crosses 
would be done, unless it is to avoid shipping costs and have the 
tomatoes take themselves to consumers.

staggering skyrocketing fuel costs they are currently living

</I></B></P><P align=left>Their recommendation is that the government establish a national

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
As we are still in routine proceedings, I wonder if there would

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was part of the first red book in 1993.  It was part 
of the Liberal election platform.  Here is a description of the 
remarks of the Prime Minister during the 1993 election campaign. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign the Prime Minister said, and it was 
picked up by the Canadian Press, “It's time to elect 
politicians that serve the public rather than serve themselves.” 
We agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Liberal members will remember the months leading up to 
the 1993 election, but if not I hope to refresh their memories in 
about three or four years from now.  However, on February 17, 
1993, when the Liberals were in opposition, the present House 
Leader, the hon. member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, tabled 
the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for its continued failure 
to establish and to adhere to a clear and high standard of public 
sector ethics, for its incessant inability to function within the 
framework of existing legislation, guidelines and standards, and 
for its reluctance to bring forward strict new codes and 
legislation with regard to conflicts and other public ethic 
matters. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we hear a wonderful motion coming from the Liberals. 
Motions and words are one thing, but we are looking for action. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 election the present House leader went on to quote 
the promises of the then Prime Minister, Mr. Mulroney.  He 
denigrated the Conservatives as the “orgy of patronage”, as he 
called it, and demanded other things.  He demanded an independent 
commission to scrutinize the contracting process.  He demanded 
that a member of parliament be excluded from involvement in the 
awarding of contracts.  Today they are allowed to award grants. 
He also demanded a non-partisan process of review of cabinet 
appointments.  These were Liberal motions from seven years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight months later the Liberals actually ran their campaign on 
the image of being squeaky clean compared with the then Mulroney 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians at the time put their trust in today's Prime Minister 
thinking that the Liberals would “scrap, kill and abolish the 
GST”.  The Liberals were also opposed to free trade at the time. 
The historic reality is that before an election the Liberals 
will say one thing and after an election they will say almost 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another forgotten promise was the appointment of an ethics 
counsellor who would report to parliament.  We are reminding the 
Liberals of that promise with their own motion.  The Liberals 
refused to deliver the very legislation that they called for 
while they were in opposition.  The hypocrisy is astounding.  It 
has resulted in a situation where we have an ethics counsellor 
who actually has no powers of investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any comments that I am making today related to the present 
ethics counsellor are in no way a reflection on the integrity of 
that gentleman.  However, the straitjacket within which he 
operates keeps him from doing what the people of Canada would 
like him to do and what the Liberals at one time said they wanted 
him to do.  He is appointed by the Prime Minister, has no powers 
of investigation and, amazingly, reports directly to the Prime 
Minister not to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone hires me, gives me a job and a salary and then 
tells me to report to him and to let him know if I like him, 
human nature kicks in.  I am not questioning the ethics 
counsellor's abilities but he has been put in a straitjacket.  We 
are asking for that straitjacket to be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say that they have ethical guidelines for 
ministers.  We have never even seen them.  The Prime Minister can 
call the ethics counsellor any time to say hello and to remind 
him that he is the guy who hired him and who pays his salary.  He 
can ask him to read the secret list of guidelines, which nobody 
knows about, because he has been accused of some bad behaviour, 
and to let him know that everything he has done is okay.  That is 
presently how it works and it is just not acceptable.  We need a 
public servant who reports to the House, not one who defends the 
Prime Minister at every turn no matter how outrageous the 
incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election, there was an experience that demonstrated 
the restrictions that are placed on the ethics counsellor.  It 
was brought to our attention, through some very significant 
investigations, that there was in place a secret and parallel 
political process for the granting of HRDC grants.  It was 
brought out, accepted and realized by the Liberals.  They 
admitted it and did not challenge it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found out about that grant two years ago when we had asked 
the ethics counsellor for documents regarding Pierre Corbeil and 
his conviction for influence peddling related to the HRDC grants. 
In that particular process, the ethics counsellor had conducted 
an investigation but refused to give us the information.  We then 
had to appeal to the information commissioner.  We could not get 
the documents because the ethics counsellor was in a 
straitjacket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner had to fight the office of the 
ethics counsellor for two years in order to get the documents. 
The few pages that were finally released to us just before the 
election were the very pages that showed that there was a highly 
unethical parallel political process in the approving of these 
grants.  That is not acceptable and it must change.  We demand 
the Liberals live up to their word and make these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that, and a subject of much attention to Canadians, 
when it became public during the election that the Prime Minister 
had demanded loans from the president of the Business Development 
Bank and possibly even forced the president to resign when he 
wanted to call those loans, I wrote to the ethics counsellor and 
asked him eight very straight questions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He replied to me, and I appreciate the reply only took two days. 
Whether that was a reflection of the gravity of my letter or the 
straitjacket that the counsellor was in, I am not sure. However 
he did reply and I appreciated that.  He said that there was no 
rule preventing a minister, including the Prime Minister, from 
having direct contact on behalf of a constituent with a crown 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support that, he quoted as his authority the independent B.C. 
conflict of interest commissioner.  The ethics counsellor had 
replied in terms of protecting the Prime Minister from any 
wrongdoing, saying that there had been no wrongdoing.  The B.C. 
conflict of interest commissioner concluded that constituency 
assistance in a minister's office could give advocacy assistance 
to constituents, provided it was not before a commission, board, 
agency or other tribunal within the sphere of the minister's 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He quoted from that to say he thought the Prime Minister was 
okay.  However in quoting from the report he neglected to quote 
the preceding paragraph, and that was a very significant 
omission, which indicated that the B.C. conflict of interest 
commissioner had ruled that a minister must not make personal 
representation on behalf of a constituent in such a forum, 
commission, board, agency or other tribunal established by the 
government, regardless of the ministry under which the 
commission, board, agency or other tribunal operated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went on to say that a minister acting in such a way would 
always be seen as a minister of government, which is a position 
of responsibility that he or she cannot shed at will, and that it 
would be improper to appear in an advocacy role of this kind. 
Those were the words in the preceding paragraph.  If he is going 
to quote this citation, let us have the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Business Development Bank of Canada is a crown corporation 
as we know.  The BDC president is a cabinet appointee.  These 
things need to be dealt with.  He also did not refer to the 
Ontario integrity commissioner who said that parliamentary 
convention prohibits all ministers from personally appearing or 
advocating on behalf of a private party with an agency, board or 
commission. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since coming to the House, I have heard Liberal members say from 
time to time that they think provincial legislatures are the 
minor leagues and that this is the major league. That is not 
true.  In many provinces, the standards are higher than those of 
the federal government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is simply the case that has to be recognized.  We want to 
look at this issue.  We recognize that one of the most important 
ways of ensuring that politicians serve the public rather than 
themselves is by ensuring the integrity and independence of the 
ethics counsellor's office. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main ways of making sure that politicians serve 
public interest and not their own interest is by ensuring the 
integrity and the autonomy of the office of the counsellor, who 
is in charge of these standards. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is absolutely necessary.  I close by quoting the Prime 
Minister's own words, as we now give the Liberals the great 
opportunity to clear their name.  People are suggesting that they 
are being less than honest, less than straightforward.  I would 
like to help the Liberals clear their name by getting them to 
support their own motion.  In the 1993 campaign the Prime 
Minister said “It is time to elect politicians that serve the 
public rather than serve themselves”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the question on most people's mind is:  Will the 
Liberals vote in favour of a motion that is lifted verbatim out 
of the Liberal red book? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be other tangential questions that will be debated 
today.  They will be kind of interesting, but the essence of 
today's debate and the subsequent vote that will be held on 
Tuesday of next week is the agonizing political question that the 
Liberals must face head on.  Will the Liberals vote in favour of 
today's motion that will create an independent ethics counsellor 
answerable not to the Prime Minister but to parliament itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be an easy answer.  How could they say no? Surely they 
would want to support a motion which they in essence drafted 
themselves.  Let us hope that it is the case.  Let us hope they 
will follow through on an old promise and vote in favour of an 
independent ethics counsellor.  All MPs from all political 
parties should support the motion.  I suggest four reasons why we 
should do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should support it because it will rebuild our reputation as a 
people who ensure a fair process for all Canadians. 
That is one of our primary purposes as members of parliament.  We 
are to safeguard the sanctity of fair and equitable process for 
all Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this week the auditor general described the abysmal 
track record of the Liberal government, especially in the area of 
patronage appointments.  He said that the government's failure to 
appoint the best people to positions of authority, instead of the 
people with the best political connections, was weakening our 
institutions and tainting the political process.  He said that 
the Liberals had failed to protect the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody likes to see patronage misused in this way, including the 
government House leader, who actually called on the Mulroney 
government to create a committee to review and disallow obvious 
partisan political patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange that the government House leader rejected that 
idea when I proposed exactly the same thing just last month.  The 
reason he proposed that idea back in 1993, the reason the 
Liberals originally campaigned on the promise to put in place an 
independent ethics counsellor, and the reason we have the motion 
before us today is obvious.  Members of parliament have an 
obligation to make sure that the process is fair, not just for 
friends of the government, but fair and open and accessible for 
all Canadians.  We are the keepers of the process.  That process 
can be fixed today by supporting the creation of an independent 
ethics commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason for supporting the motion is that it will 
enhance the reputation of the House of Commons.  Public opinion 
polls suggest that Canadians simply do not hold members of 
parliament in very high esteem.  Members of parliament contribute 
to that image problem by the way we sometimes act during question 
period and the manner in which we treat one another, or by the 
very public airings of our foibles and weaknesses.  Heaven knows, 
we are not perfect and we have all made mistakes.  In some ways 
one can understand why people come up with jokes like the one 
about how many politicians it takes to grease a combine.  The 
answer is only one if you feed him in really, really slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just voters who are convinced that something is out of 
whack in the House of Commons.  A recent poll published in 
<I>Maclean's</I> magazine concluded that only 7% of business 
people believe that members of parliament have a significant 
impact on the actions of the government.  Only 7% think that we 
make a difference by our actions in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more often, businesses and special interest groups 
simply bypass parliamentarians and go directly to the real power 
brokers.  The real power brokers are those people who are close 
to the Prime Minister in his office, those who are close to the 
Prime Minister because they have been appointed by him to 
important positions, and those who have the ear of the Prime 
Minister because they are political friends and allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think of how an independent ethics commissioner, with 
powers to investigate the improprieties of lobbyists and public 
officials, would change the way Canadians view their members of 
parliament. Instead of viewing members of parliament as, in that 
famous quote of Mr. Trudeau, nobodies when they are 50 feet away 
from this place, they would proudly say that their members of 
parliament have a published code of ethics; that they are 
accountable for their actions in a fair, transparent and open 
process; and that people would no longer able to bypass the 
Parliament of Canada simply because they have access to a coterie 
of unelected yet incredibly powerful and influential friends of 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third compelling reason to support the motion to 
establish an independent ethics commissioner.  Establishing this 
commissioner would complete a circle of accountability that would 
have within the circle the following:  a financial watchdog 
called the auditor general; a privacy commissioner who reports 
regularly to all Canadians, sounding the alarm whenever the 
government intrudes improperly into their private lives; an 
access to information commissioner, who has done so much to open 
up the closed door mentality of big businesses and big 
bureaucracies; and the long promised but yet to be delivered 
ethics commissioner, a watchdog who would report regularly to 
parliament on the ethics of those who have the honour and 
privilege to serve in high office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This circle of independent, professional and skilled advocates, 
reporting regularly to parliament, with their advice, admonitions 
and observations available to all Canadians, would finally 
establish a complete system of checks and balances on the 
absolute powers of a majority government.  In this respect the 
creation of an independent ethics commissioner would raise 
accountability to a new level.  It would raise the accountability 
of the House of Commons to a high level among all parliamentary 
democracies.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth and final reason for members of parliament to vote in 
favour of an independent ethics counsellor who reports to 
parliament is this:  an independent ethics counsellor would 
expose the inappropriate behaviour of public officials and 
lobbyists but would also offer the best protection an honest, 
hardworking, ethical member of parliament, cabinet minister or 
prime minister could ever have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine the powerful, positive impact that this 
counsellor would have upon the reputation of those in public 
life.  Let us imagine the leader cleared of wrongdoing by an 
independent ethics counsellor who could stand proudly in his or 
her place and deliver the leadership that Canadians applaud, 
deserve and admire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine the condemnation of frivolous, politically 
motivated witch hunts, which would be ruled on as out of order 
and inappropriate by the ethics counsellor.  Just as the other 
watchdogs in this circle can laud the government when it does its 
job well, an ethics counsellor could preserve the reputation and 
enhance the effectiveness of ethical leaders who have given 
themselves to public life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four reasons to vote yes to this motion:  to ensure 
that the process of government is fair and open, to enhance the 
effectiveness of parliament itself, to complete the circle of 
government accountability, and to protect ethical members of 
parliament from wrongful or politically motivated attacks while 
exposing improper behaviour for all to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that an independent ethics counsellor 
would from time to time ferret out improper actions committed by 
some in public life.  Hopefully that would happen only rarely, 
but by voting in favour of the motion before us today members of 
the House would send a signal that would be received with joyous 
hearts from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be a standard by which we will be judged.  It would 
be fair, open and transparent.  It would transcend political 
parties because it would be based on principles that Canadians 
believe to be proper and self-evident. It would be a cornerstone 
in our collective efforts to build trust and confidence between 
elected officials and the voters who sent them to this place to 
represent all Canadians.  I therefore move the following 
amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK36">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting before the word 
“implementation” the word “immediate”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with pleasure and pride that I support this motion.  I 
urge all members of parliament to do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Debate is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if the official opposition House leader read the speech 
of the House leader who sits across the way today, he would 
probably be able to read to us most of the things that he has 
just finished saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In opposition it is pretty easy to say these things, and I 
imagine the House leader will stand and say something like that. 
What possible assurance would the Canadian public have that we in 
opposition would not just say these things but would actually 
carry them out when we form a government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not only something 
we campaigned on.  We have put forward details in regard to how 
this would be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These details include the creation of a committee that would 
receive reports from the privacy commissioner, the access to 
information commissioner and the new ethics counsellor himself or 
herself.  Not only do we have the theory.  We have some of the 
flesh on the framework, the bones, as it were, of the process. 
Not only do we have all party consent on this side of the House 
for it.  We also have the approval of the governing party.  In 
other words, I think this is a unanimously approved concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government House leader was in opposition he asked for 
basically this sort of accountability.  In fact he went further. 
He asked for a committee that would review government patronage 
appointments and would have the power to disallow those 
appointments if it thought they were too politically motivated. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the ideas I put forward earlier this year in a 
document called “Building Trust”.  Sadly the government House 
leader said that it was unworkable and that we could not do it. 
He called my ideas half-baked, but it is interesting to note that 
the idea of having an ethics counsellor is not mine.  It 
originally came from the Liberals.  These were their exact words. 
The idea of accountability for patronage appointments is not my 
idea.  It came from the government House leader.  We are just 
putting it forward again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the idea of having secret ballot elections for 
committees, on which we will be voting in the procedure and House 
affairs committee on Monday, for those who are interested in 
seeing if the government follows through.  That also is a Liberal 
Party idea which I hope the Liberals will support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, as we go through the list of things we can do to 
build trust in this place and in parliamentarians, the ideas have 
support from all political parties.  It should not be hard for 
any political party to follow through on a promise that has 
unanimous support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this step today, something that Canadians have long 
looked forward to, is a step that will help to build trust not 
only between this party and the electorate but between the House 
and the electorate.  Heaven knows we need to rebuild that trust 
as quickly as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the House leader of the 
official opposition who put forward a document called “Building 
Trust” a few weeks ago.  It is about bringing back ethics, 
transparency and accountability to this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader for the government responded, at least in the 
media, that we would actually need constitutional change.  I am 
wondering if he will come up with the same kind of argument now. 
I admit that I studied constitutional law at law school.  I 
cannot see, for the life of me, how he could possibly see that 
any of those things would require constitutional change.  It is 
absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the House leader to comment on this point, in the 
anticipation that the government House leader could stand and say 
that he actually loves this idea but we would have to change the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, none of the proposals that 
have come from our document “Building Trust” are constitutional 
in nature.  I am not sure exactly what message the government 
House leader is trying to send, other than one that he just does 
not like the idea of that much transparency.  There certainly is 
nothing constitutional in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason we are asking for the particular motion today 
on the ethics counsellor.  I will quote Lawrence Martin, who 
talked about the ruling that the ethics counsellor made during 
the election campaign.  He said that the ethics counsellor made a 
ruling without having made an investigation.  Howard Wilson 
exonerated the Prime Minister in the hotel loan affair without 
interviewing those involved, without responding to the specific 
questions posed by our opposition leader, without delving into 
the suggestion of political interference raised by the principals 
in the affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point he made is that he did not substantially research the 
matter before him, therefore the ethics counsellor had brought in 
a verdict that was both timely and, in terms of merit, worthless. 
He added that it was of great political benefit to the man who 
appointed him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, although I have a lot of respect for Mr. Wilson, 
he has been put in an intolerable position.  He has been hired by 
someone and reports to that same someone.  He is not allowed to 
release any reports publicly without that same someone's okay. If 
the ruling does not look good the first time, he can go back and 
rewrite it.  He does not have to investigate.  He does not have to 
interview.  He does not have to report to parliament.  It is a 
political sham.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am more than pleased to speak on this motion because as a 
government we know the importance of ethical behaviour.  We have 
a Prime Minister who is personally accountable for the 
government's outstanding ethical behaviour.  We have a record of 
taking action which I point to with pride.  We have made sure 
that ethics reach all levels of government and are part of 
the everyday ongoing work.  Gone are the days before 1993 when we 
had a government that had little if no concern for ethics at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After we were first elected in 1993 we introduced a tough ethics 
package with a fundamentally different approach to politics than 
the previous Conservative government.  We restored public 
confidence in the decision making process and returned integrity 
to public life as we had promised in the 1993 election and the 
red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind all colleagues of the excellent record of this 
government on integrity.  We know the importance of ethical 
behaviour.  We have a good understanding on this side of the 
House that the most important asset a government can claim is the 
confidence it enjoys of the citizens to whom it is accountable. 
We know that if our government is to play a positive role in 
society, as it must, honesty and integrity must be maintained in 
our political institution.  Public service is a trust.  Canadians 
expect their government to serve the public interest with fairness 
and to manage public resources properly on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government took office in November 1993, it was evident 
that Canadians had been losing faith in government.  We know 
honesty, integrity and trust are important, not just for winning 
elections but because we have a responsibility to maintain the 
trust of Canadians in their political institutions and in the 
greatest institution that we have in the country, the House and 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister told the House in 1994 that “trust in the 
institution of government is not a partisan issue.”  I would 
like to remind my colleagues who just made their speeches of that 
point.  I quote further “—but something all of us elected to 
public office had an obligation to restore.”  The Prime Minister 
added that trust in institutions is as vital to a democracy as 
the air we breathe.  For this trust we owe a duty of conduct to 
all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We promised Canadians that they could count on an honest, 
transparent and responsible government. We truly want them to 
regain confidence in government institutions and we clearly 
stated that our actions and decisions, taken individually and 
collectively as members of the government, would be marked by 
integrity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the government we are accountable to a Prime 
Minister who is personally accountable to the House and to 
Canadians generally.  The Prime Minister understands the 
importance of ethical behaviour and has himself said “setting 
high standards for the holders of public office is essential in 
renewing and maintaining the faith of Canadians in their public 
institution.  In particular, ministers must remain above 
reproach.”  That is a message that our Prime Minister gives to 
all of us in cabinet all the time.  He reminds us constantly 
that is the guiding principle under which we operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is responsible before Canadians and to the 
House for the conduct of ministers.  That is the burden of his 
office.  As ministers we all undergo daily scrutiny in the House. 
We are not exempted from that.  Yet the burden to remain above 
all reproach at all times in all of our activities is one that we 
gladly accept because we want to be accountable and behave 
ethically, and we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Prime Minister's prerogative to establish standards of 
conduct for ministers and to ensure that these standards are met. 
It is his prerogative and his personal responsibility both in a 
constitutional sense and to the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As signs of his commitment to this responsibility, in 1994 the 
Prime Minister announced the appointment of the first ethics 
counsellor we have had in the history of Canada.  The role of the 
ethics counsellor with regard to ministers is clear.  He is the 
Prime Minister's adviser on matters relating to conflict of 
interest and the ethical conduct of government officials, 
including ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor also has another job.  He provides reports 
to parliament on his duties and investigations under the 
Lobbyists Registration Act.  In that regard he already reports to 
the House of Commons.  The Prime Minister bears responsibility 
for the conduct of ministers.  He recommends the appointment of 
ministers to Her Excellency.  He sets the standards of conduct 
which ministers follow, considers possible breaches of those 
standards should they occur and, should the need ever arise, 
would take the appropriate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's responsibility for the ethics counsellor 
reflects his personal responsibility for establishing the 
standards of conduct for ministers.  It is quite clear that the 
Prime Minister cannot answer members of the House, or anyone else 
for that matter, and say “I have an ethics counsellor, therefore 
nothing is my fault and nothing is my responsibility”. None of 
us would ever accept that kind of answer.  He is personally 
accountable and, as he said, he will never abdicate that 
responsibility.  He will never pass the buck, to use his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor provides reports to parliament on his own 
duties regarding the Lobbyists Registration Act.  To establish a 
similar reporting on his duties in advising the Prime Minister 
would undermine the Prime Minister's responsibility for 
ministerial conduct.  The Prime Minister, and he alone, is 
responsible to parliament for the conduct of ministers, and he 
will not shirk this duty.  The ethics counsellor advises the 
Prime Minister of course on the overall policies and in 
particular cases but in the end it is the Prime Minister who is 
accountable to the House, and I would not want it otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is accountable for the public.  The 
opposition may imagine that it carries out that responsibility 
but of course it does not.  It is the responsibility of the House 
and all its members to question the government on its action, 
including ethics, if that is what it wants to do.  We are pleased 
to answer these questions when they occur.  That is the way 
parliament works. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an excellent track record, thanks to our Prime Minister. 
I give him full credit and I am very proud of that performance. 
The appointment of an ethics counsellor is but one of the 
measures that have been taken by our government and I am proud 
of it. I am proud to be part of a government that takes measures 
to ensure that public affairs in Canada are conducted with 
integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some examples. In 1994, the Prime Minister reviewed 
and strengthened the code governing conflicts of interest. 
Since then, it is prohibited to grant preferential treatment to 
individuals or groups simply because go-betweens were hired to 
promote their interests. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister appointed the ethics counsellor to administer 
the code.  He also provides reports to parliament under the 
Lobbyists Registration Act.  That is a promise we made and a 
promise we kept.  We gave the job real teeth.  The job has strong 
investigative powers with the amendments to the Lobbyists 
Registration Act.  When we amended the act we even incorporated 
amendments that I think were proposed by the hon. member for Elk 
Island who is sitting across the way.  The government brought 
forward amendments strengthening that act, increasing 
transparency for lobbyists and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took measures to reform the pension plan for 
members of parliament and senators to put an end to double 
dipping, for instance.  In 1999 the government established 
guidelines on donations made by crown corporations to political 
parties.  We have done that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendments to the Canada Elections Act also put very strict 
controls on third parties that were outside forces influencing 
the political process and who had no rules guiding them. 
We have put them on a level playing field with candidates.  We 
have made sure that ethics are anchored in all levels of 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the leadership and direction of the Prime Minister, 
departments and agencies have taken greater steps on values and 
ethics than under any previous government.  In 1996 a report was 
produced on public sector values and ethics.  It has helped forge 
a consensus on such issues.  Fair and reliable public services 
inspire public trust and create favourable environment for 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition likes to quote the auditor general.  Just last 
fall, the auditor general told the House that there was a strong 
foundation of values and ethics in the federal public sector.  We 
have put in place those rules governing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also said that the government is taking 
steps to maintain some values and ethics.  I wonder why the 
opposition is not quoting that part of the auditor general's 
statement.  He also pointed out at the time that a prerequisite 
for the success of ongoing measures is the leadership of 
parliamentarians, ministers and senior officials.  It is thanks 
to that leadership that we have that high set of ethics not only 
for ministers, indeed I hope for all of us in the House, but also 
for our public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I cannot speak for the leaders of other parties, I can 
guarantee that under the leadership of our Prime Minister, 
Canadians will be able to go on depending on the federal public 
service to provide fair and reliable services to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the Government of Canada established the office of 
values and ethics to promote values and ethics in the public 
service.  The head of the public service has been a driving force 
behind value initiatives across the government.  Public servants 
have access to training and publications to promote awareness on 
ethical issues and to assist employees in developing skills for 
handling ethical situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious that the government believes that ensuring 
sound values and ethics is a vital part of good government which 
supports and respects fundamental democratic values.  We also 
believe that understanding ethics involves not only knowing the 
difference between right and wrong but also making a commitment 
to do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 16, 1994, the Prime Minister stood here and pledged to 
the House and to all Canadians that the government would guard 
its good name with all that it can.  That is what it has been 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public's political expectations and values have undergone 
enormous changes over the years.  On this side of the House, we 
have taken the steps to help raise those standards and 
expectations.  Through the standards we have met and kept, we 
have retained the trust of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition day motion suggests that the government is not 
accountable to parliament for its ethical policies.  Our 
government is accountable to parliament.  Our Prime Minister is 
in the House all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has considered and passed the Lobbyists Registration 
Act.  The auditor general can now report to parliament up to four 
times a year.  A strengthened conduct code has been tabled in 
parliament.  The ethics counsellor reports to parliament on his 
duties on the Lobbyists Registration Act.  The Prime Minister and 
ministers continue to be accountable to parliament for their 
policies and ethical behaviour.  In other words, we have not only 
met our red book commitments, we have exceeded those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent ethics counsellor has been established to advise 
the Prime Minister on ministerial ethics issues.  The ethics 
counsellor is independent and reports to the Prime Minister.  The 
Prime Minister reports to parliament.  The opposition members 
were consulted and agreed with the selection of the ethics 
counsellor.  They even spoke glowingly about the individual 
earlier this day.  The ethics counsellor can be asked to appear 
before parliamentary committees.  He has done so in the context 
of estimates and otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not apologize for our record on integrity.  We will not 
apologize for meeting or exceeding our red book commitment.   We 
will not apologize for having an independent ethics counsellor, 
whose selection was done after consultation with the opposition, 
who reports to parliament directly for the Lobbyist Registration 
Act and who reports to the Prime Minister who, in turn, is 
accountable to parliament regarding the issue of ministerial 
ethics.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's record on ethics is clear to all members of 
the House, and it is second to none.  It is part of a record of 
achievement, of improving the quality of life for Canadians, of 
creating jobs, of putting the fiscal house in order, of 
strengthening Canada's health care system and of making our 
communities safe and governing with integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things are all part of the record of this government. That 
is why, last November 27, the people of Canada chose to re-elect 
our Prime Minister and our government with a third successive 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's opposition motion is simply an attempt to distract 
members of parliament and Canadians from this government's 
excellent record, and perhaps to distract Canadians from the 
terrible situation that the Leader of the Opposition finds 
himself in.  Therefore I would move the following amendment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by deleting the word “immediate” 
and by substituting therefore the word “continued”. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I think all people can 
appreciate what the government House leader is attempting to do 
here, which is to not only amend the supply day motion but to 
actually amend the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the amendment is completely out of order in 
that it changes, and not in a small way, but completely changes 
the intent of the amendment to the supply day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an immediate implementation of a certain 
course of action.  To try to amend it in this manner would 
completely change the intent of the motion.  I would ask you, Mr. 
Speaker, to rule it out of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on the same point of order.  I would say to the Chair that 
accepting this amendment would certainly be in contravention of 
what has come to be the established practice with respect to the 
acceptance of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we have developed the habit whereby the 
same party that moves the motion immediately moves to amend it. 
However that practice developed, as you know, because without it 
the government had a tendency to amend the motion into something 
it could support.  In doing so it could vitiate the purpose of 
motions moved by opposition parties and render opposition days 
useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of opposition days is to allow opposition parties to 
put forward a motion, have it debated and have the House decide 
on it or divide on it if necessary, and most likely, or it may 
even pass.   However to permit this kind of practice would 
eviscerate the politics from opposition day and give the 
government the hammer, so to speak, to use its majority to amend 
motions.  In theory, all opposition day motions would pass but 
they would, ultimately, all be motions designed by the government 
and not by the opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of 
order.  The opposition is arguing that it has a right to amend 
the motion but that the rest of the House does not have a similar 
right.  I suggest that is not at all how motions are supposed to 
be dealt with in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the Speaker that for a political party to move a 
motion and amend it itself is a rather recent innovation of the 
House that is only two or three old.  Prior to that motions were 
routinely amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, in the amendment of the hon. member across the way he 
is arguing that the program in question, the subject of the 
debate, is the immediate implementation of a particular 
initiative as opposed to the implementation of the same subject. 
I am arguing that if he can amend the main motion by referring to 
it as immediate, I can also propose an amendment to the amendment 
by substituting the word and making it a continued 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not changing the sense of the original motion at all.  We 
are arguing the implementation.  The matter of whether the issue 
is continued or is immediate or started or otherwise is a matter 
of debate, not a matter of whether the amendment should be in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the amendment to the amendment is in order because 
it in no way damages the intent of the proposition that is on the 
order paper today, which is the implementation that the 
opposition is calling for.  Therefore the amendment to the 
amendment is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the Chair to Erskine May and to the 
practices in effect in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom 
and say that the amendment to the amendment is perfectly in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pity that we are 
taking up valuable time in this regard.  If the amendment to the 
amendment were allowed to stand in the government's name, it 
would be unprecedented in my time as House leader and in my 
memory here in eight years, in that the government is trying to 
eviscerate an opposition day motion by so doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you allow this to take place, Mr. Speaker, opposition day 
motions will become a lark.  For example, if we put forward a 
motion that condemns the government for its lack of action on 
paying out aid to farmers in crisis, it could be changed by the 
government to congratulate itself for its fine work in the farm 
crisis area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You cannot allow the government to do this.  If you allow it, 
the government House leader will never again allow a motion to 
reach the floor of the House of Commons because he will just 
amend it to one that is favourable to the government.  He will 
simply change the motion to one which congratulates the 
government for its implementation of an ongoing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would completely eviscerate opposition day motions.  To allow 
a subamendment like this one is contrary to the letter of the 
standing orders, as I mentioned earlier, because it completely 
changes the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government House leader to reconsider.  This is the 
first time in the eight years I have been here that he has ever 
tried a stunt like this one, and I consider it a stunt.  I ask 
him to withdraw it in the spirit of co-operation we had when 
working on other issues and to understand what he is doing by 
putting this subamendment forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he continues with it, he is throwing down the gauntlet, 
saying that he will run the House with an iron hand and will not 
allow opposition members of parliament to bring forward anything 
that contradicts the government agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with some amusement that I join the 
discussion.  The newfound friendliness and fondness that the 
opposition House leader had for the government House leader just 
a few short days ago seem to be crumbling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that aside, I find that what is taking place here is 
obviously an attempt by the government to hijack an opposition 
motion that is very legitimate in its intent and has opened up a 
discussion which is very fruitful and favourable to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader, as has been stated by the previous 
speaker, is very much trying to change the entire intent and 
spirit of what is being discussed in the motion.

Mr. Speaker, you will know that is not supposed to take place on 
a supply day amendment.  We are not to change the entire 
spirit and intent of the motion as the government is doing in the 
self-congratulatory way to which we are accustomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very serious.  It once again raises the ire of the 
government because of its sensitivity of the particular subject 
matter.  This day we have embarked upon will be very important 
and very interesting as we delve into discussions of the Prime 
Minister's activities in the Auberge Grand-Mère situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a broader scale it is a discussion of the credibility of 
offices like the ethics counsellor, and the importance of what we 
say prior to elections and what we do after elections, which is a 
lesson for all of us.  It is a lesson that Canadians are waiting 
for us to listen to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge you, Mr. Speaker, in your discretion not to 
allow the subamendment.  I urge you to accept the submissions 
that other members have put forward in opposition to what the 
government House leader has suggested, which is obviously an 
attempt to hijack and reverse the intent of the motion before the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to join my opposition colleagues in condemning this 
outrageous attempt by the government to denature—for that is 
exactly what it is, and I emphasize this for the benefit of the 
government House leader—the very idea of opposition 
days and the very essence of the Canadian Alliance motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government House leader attempts to play down the 
introduction of this practice in the House by saying that 
opposition motions have only been amended, or amendments brought 
to these amendments, for the past two or three years, I would 
remind him that this practice has been around much longer than 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It first began when the Bloc Quebecois was the official 
opposition in this House, in other words just after the 1993 
election.  This has been an established practice in the House 
for almost seven years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I would agree with those who say that we have never 
seen or gone along with the government introducing amendments to 
amendments introduced by the opposition parties on allotted days 
since, if memory services, we first came to this House, in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this practice of the opposition parties amending their 
own motion has become established practice in the House.  Why? 
The simple answer, as the leader of the New Democratic Party 
points out, is that the government has taken to amending the 
opposition motion in order to vitiate its very purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully submit to you that what is going on right 
now has no other purpose than to vitiate the Canadian Alliance 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the government's outrageous attempt contrary to 
established practice in this House but, if you read the 
government's motion to amend the amendment, it vitiates, or 
denatures the very essence of, the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you strongly, Mr. Speaker,  to reject this government 
motion to amend the amendment and to rule it out of order.

will briefly speak to the procedural issue.  I hope I can be 
helpful to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of an amendment is to make an item under 
consideration more acceptable to the House.  I submit that is 
what is intended by the subamendment.  I would not view it as a 
wrecking amendment, and I hope the Chair would not view it as 
such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has suggested that some political stuntery is 
involved in the subamendment.  The opposition has proposed its 
own amendment by inserting an adverb or putting a new definition 
into the motion.  The subamendment proposed by the government 
House leader merely changes the adverbial definer that was 
inserted in the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 85 specifically authorizes and speaks to the 
issue of an amendment and subamendment to supply day motions.  It 
is specifically authorized in Standing Order 85. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of whether or not the government has done this before I 
regret I do not have a specific citation, but I am advised that 
the government has been offering amendments to supply day motions 
since the days of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent back in the 
fifties.  I am advised as well that it has occurred since 1993. 
In the next few moments a citation may find its way to the Chair. 
If I am wrong in that regard I apologize and stand corrected, but 
this is what I am informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the subamendment is certainly in order.  It does not 
reverse, undermine, negate or denature the opposition motion 
dealing with a particular subject matter.  I submit that it is in 
order.  Some members in the House may find the subamendment 
refreshingly appropriate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments which have the effect of providing the basis for an 
entirely different debate are not in order.  When a party has

taken away by way of an amendment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that when the government changes the words to 
“continuing to implement”, it is deliberately misleading the 
House.  It is changing the entire context of the motion, as we 
are asking for immediate implementation.  It is 180 degree 
diametrically different from the motion we have put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you follow what was written by the very astute former clerk 
of the House, Mr. Speaker, I would argue that there is no way you 
could possibly accept this subamendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, obviously the government House leader and the 
government are setting the tone right off the bat.  We saw that 
in the response to the Speech from the Throne when the new member 
poked the Bloc in the eye.  We are now seeing this procedural 
wrangling.  We know the government House leader is an expert at 
this because he has had many years of practice in opposition. 
Perhaps he is time warping to those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subamendment proposed by the government House leader is 
inconsistent with the main motion.  I would direct you, Mr. 
Speaker, to Beauchesne's citation 580(2) which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A subamendment must attempt to explain the substance of the 
amendment and may not substitute an entirely new proposal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment by logical thought processes would indicate that 
the motion we are bringing forward is not currently in place and 
is not happening.  That is why we are asking for it to be 
immediately put into place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader's subamendment, by logical 
processes, would infer that this process is in place and should 
just keep going.  The two are logically inconsistent with each 
other.  It is a substantive change to the motion and should be 
ruled directly out of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 
clarification, for your consideration and for members opposite, I 
do not understand what would be more immediate than continued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, let us talk about the political stuntery that went 
on here.  It is common knowledge that the opposition wants to put 
forward a motion in the House of Commons for consideration and 
for all to vote.  In a procedural vote on an issue that may have 
been of interest to constituents watching, it is about now that 
constituents will change over to their favourite game show on the 
television set.  This is the kind of thing that bores them to 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition refers to political stuntery and who brought it 
up.  If the constituents are still watching, they might want to 
take this into consideration.  The opposition leader made his 
speech. Then, for the benefit of the folks at home, members of 
the opposition decided to split their leader's time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did they do that?  They did that because the second 
opposition speaker, and this is directly related to this issue, 
will move an amendment to the motion.  What that does is kill the 
opportunity for any other party in the House to move an amendment 
to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the political stuntery in that?  The opposition is 
claiming that we are politically— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  With great respect, I know the hon. member 
for Hamilton West is trying to be helpful, but the Chair is 
looking for assistance on the admissibility, and only the 
question of the admissibility of the subamendment, not on what 
may have happened in the House for the benefit of the folks at 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking up time from the debate and I am concerned that it 
is going on a little long.  Unless members have something that is 
directly relevant to the admissibility of the subamendment, I 
would prefer to bring this to a conclusion very quickly.  If the 
hon. member for Hamilton West has something else on that point I 
will hear him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, having given 
that brief explanation, I think the subamendment is in order 
because it seeks to clarify the amendment that had been put 
forward in somewhat of a stunt fashion by the opposition.  It 
clarifies for yourself and for the House that we want a 
continuation of exactly what the motion addresses. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to this debate for a while and I want to warn the 
Chair that the proposal by the party currently in power will 
literally change the nature of opposition days in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What  we call an opposition day, unfortunately for the 
government, is not generally a day of praise.  What the House 
leader of the party in office has said will turn opposition days 
to the advantage of the party in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To remedy that there will be a vote this evening, or a deferred 
vote, if the party in power does not agree with the proposal and 
the amendment by the opposition parties. 
It can always catch up, with its parliamentary majority, in the 
vote at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask that the Chair pay careful attention to avoid 
creating a dangerous precedent for the opposition, which is in 
the minority in the House, as we all know.

Mr. Speaker, as a scholar of the affairs of the House, I am sure 
you of all people would be aware of the reason for the amendment 
in the first place.  It became a practice of the House back in 
1993 and has been a standing practice of the House since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe you would agree with me that in addition to Erskine 
May, Beauchesne's and the rulings of the Speaker, the House over 
a period of time does come to certain practices.  This has been 
an accepted practice from the time I became a member of 
parliament in 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you permit the subamendment as stated, which basically 
eviscerates or guts the opposition motion, you will have created 
a situation where the opposition parties will no longer be able 
to bring to the attention of the House motions that are contrary 
to what the government would prefer to have in the House.  That 
is the purpose of opposition day.  You would be setting a 
precedent, Mr. Speaker, and I suggest that it would not be a good 
precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it might be helpful to the Chair in deciding this issue so that 
we can get on with the debate, to refer to Marleau and 
Montpetit's <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>.  On 
page 453 in chapter 12 it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment should be framed so that, if agreed to, it will 
leave the main motion intelligible and consistent with itself. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In elaborating on this point, it goes on to say that an 
amendment should be out of order if it would produce the same 
result as the defeat of the main motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would contend that the government subamendment in this case is 
designed to do exactly what subamendments should not be designed to 
do.  This subamendment, if adopted, would make the original motion 
as amended inconsistent with itself.  It would be inconsistent 
with the claim of the opposition that a particular policy has not 
been implemented and must now be implemented and, as amended, 
immediately implemented.  The insertion of the words continue to 
implement is inconsistent with the main motion insofar as the 
word continue implies that this policy is being implemented when 
the contention of the motion is that it is not being implemented. 
Therefore, the passage of that particular subamendment would in 
effect produce the same result as the defeat of the main motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On those grounds it would seem to me, Mr. Speaker, that you 
would have ample room to not only rule technically that this 
subamendment is out of order, but also to save supply days for the 
purpose for which they were created, which is for the opposition 
to lay down a motion that must be debated on the opposition's 
terms.  If you do not, I submit that you will be creating a 
problem that will grow in proportion.  As supply days continue 
the government will have secured a loophole if you rule 
differently than the opposition is advising on this and it will 
not be healthy for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggest that it would not be healthy for the government 
House leader's relationships with the opposition.  I say to him 
that this is inconsistent with the relationship that I think he 
has tried to establish with the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think the Chair has heard enough on this 
point. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion I have already heard a lot of members.  The quote 
from this book has already been cited in the House.  I give the 
floor to the hon. Bloc Quebecois whip, and this will be 
absolutely the last intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize that several 
quotes from Marleau-Montpetit were submitted to the Chair on the 
admissibility of motions in amendment and, in this particular 
case, regarding the very nature of the main motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote an excerpt from Marleau-Montpetit dealing 
with your responsibilities vis-à-vis the minority in the House, 
namely opposition parties which unanimously share the same view 
on this issue. On pages 260 and 261, it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duties of the Speaker of the House of Commons require 
balancing the rights and interests of the majority and minority 
in the House to ensure that the public business is efficiently 
transacted and that the interests of all parts of the House are 
advocated and protected against the use of arbitrary authority. 
It is in this spirit that the Speaker, as chief servant of the 
House, applies the rules. The Speaker is the servant, not of any 
part of the House or any majority in the House, but of the 
entire institution and the best interests of the House as 
distilled over many generations in its practices.

input on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair will take the matter under advisement.  I propose to 
come back to the House with a decision at 3 o'clock, following 
question period, on the question of the admissibility of the 
subamendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members have expressed a certain outrage.  As a past 
participant in the discussions relating to these amendments and 
motions on supply days, both as an opposition member and as a 
government member involved in these kinds of arguments, I 
sympathize with the views expressed on both sides of the issue. I 
am well aware of them.  I will take under advisement the matters 
that have been referred to Chair and the submissions.   I will 
look at the authorities and come back to the House shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Can one assume that in debate we are debating the amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The question before the House is on the 
amendment.  The subamendment has not been put to the House and 
will not be until I make a ruling that it is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  As I said earlier, it is very unfortunate that we have 
been on this point of order for the last half hour.  I wonder if 
there would be consent of the House to extend the orders of the 
day for a half an hour at the end of the day to make up for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend orders 
of the day by half an hour today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, without again getting into what I think is just a 
detestable move on behalf of the government House leader, I will 
wait for your ruling.  I cannot believe he has actually done 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of his speech is that everything is glowing, 
everything is wonderful on the government side, democracy is 
going on without a hitch and life is grand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring the attention of the House to two or three different 
quotes from independent watchdogs of parliament who say 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The access to information commissioner's report begins with 
“Mayday-Mayday, democracy is at risk”.  The commissioner goes 
on to say that he has never in his 17 years on the job seen a 
government that has been so intransigent as the current Liberal 
government. In fact he said that the government routinely 
intimidates those who put forward legitimate requests for 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report that was released yesterday states 
that the process of political patronage appointments is tainting 
the institutions where those appointments take place and tainting 
the political process.  That is not a glowing report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner has routinely chastized the government 
for the intrusive actions of this government into the private 
lives of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that the government House leader is trying to 
eviscerate this motion today by pretending that all is well.  He 
apparently does not want a watchdog with some teeth, he wants a 
lapdog to do his bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent ethics counsellor who would report to the House 
through a standing committee instead of reporting to the Prime 
Minister, the guy who signs his paycheque, is the difference 
between night and day.  By approving this motion today, not only 
could the Prime Minister keep his promise from the Liberal red 
book, but for once he could reassure Canadians that we will have 
a complete set of guidelines for members of parliaments and prime 
ministers, which we could have access to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday members from the Progressive Conservative Party asked 
if they could see the ethical guidelines and could they be tabled 
in the House.  What was the response?   The Prime Minister said 
no.  We cannot see or have access to the guidelines.  In fact we 
are not allowed to even know to which standards we are being 
held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not giving the motion the chance to go ahead and by perhaps 
denying the House even a chance to vote on it, which I think is 
almost unspeakable, he is basically saying that the guidelines 
they are going to hold themselves to are their own guidelines. 
They make them up.  Not only that, after they make them up, they 
keep them secret.  Then they give them to somebody who judges 
them without calling in witnesses or doing investigations. 
Further, the person reports only to the person who is signing his 
paycheque, and finally, he releases only what he wants to release 
to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he said that this ethics counsellor has come before 
committees, he just had to throw in there that the current ethics 
counsellor comes before committees to talk about his estimates, 
about how much he spends.  We cannot ask him about a ruling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know and I think the Canadian people know what is going on. 
The Liberals made a promise.  The motion today was lifted 
verbatim out of the Liberal red book.  The Prime Minister made a 
promise.  All he has to do is follow through on the promise that 
was made in writing to the Canadian people.  We did not change a 
single word.  All he has to do is say that it is a good motion. 
In fact, they drafted it.  All we want is to have a go at it and 
to have a vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. House 
leader for his question.  I believe, though, that there is a 
certain misunderstanding or perhaps an inaccuracy in what the 
House leader for the official opposition has just stated.  I 
believe he said that the guidelines for public officeholders are 
not public.  That is not accurate.  The guidelines for public 
officeholders are public, both category A and category B.  They 
have been in place for a very long time and they are public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also said that the ethics counsellor does not 
report directly to parliament, but he does.  Let me elaborate on 
this a little.  The ethics counsellor reports directly to 
parliament for the registration of lobbyists and reports to the 
Prime Minister for that additional threshold of accountability 
that the Prime Minister asks of his own ministers in addition to 
the regular guidelines for public officeholders that are the 
exigencies of everyone else.  With respect, I believe that is 
what the hon. member does not correctly understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is obviously in a system known as responsible 
government, with a capital <I>r</I>.  We could argue that the 
government is also very responsible in the regular lower case 
<I>r</I> for that matter.  In the system of responsible government 
it is the Prime Minister who appoints cabinet and it is the Prime 
Minister who has the ultimate responsibility for recommending to 
Her Excellency to of course remove someone who is behaving in a 
way that is inappropriate.  Therefore that responsibility is upon 
him and not upon anyone else, and it cannot be.  I am sure none 
of us would want it to be otherwise.  How could we ever tolerate 
a situation in the House where someone, a prime minister some 
day, could say “It is not my fault.  I have nothing to do with 
this.  Ask the ethics counsellor”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way in which the Prime Minister does his 
job.  This Prime Minister is accountable to parliament, does not 
try to pass the buck to someone else and takes full 
responsibility for his ministers.  That is the way I believe it 
should be, both in terms of accountability in the House and in 
terms of the constitutional requirement of how it should be done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in an odd sort of way, what we see here today reinforces 
the point that I think the opposition has been trying to make 
over the last little while with respect to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this motion impinges on the Prime Minister's behaviour, 
and because it causes distress to the Prime Minister, when it 
comes to the Prime Minister there are no rules, or what rules 
there are have to be bent, twisted, ignored or reinvented, 
whatever the case may be when it comes to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just seems to me that in a strange sort of way the 
government, by its behaviour today with respect to this motion, 
is reinforcing the very point that many of us on this side are 
trying to make:  that when it comes to the Prime Minister the 
ordinary rules of behaviour, particularly in terms of appearance 
but also with respect to how certain things are handled, do not 
apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government House leader, given that this was a red 
book promise and that he had 20 minutes to speak, why he at least 
did not explain why the Liberals did not keep their promise.  It 
was their promise, not our promise.  They promised that this 
person would be an officer of the House.  It was not something 
invented by the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me that at the very least the government House 
leader could have taken some time, in the time that he had on his 
feet, to explain why the Liberals changed their minds.  People 
change their minds.  They obviously changed their minds.  If they 
did change their minds, why did they?  Or is this simply a case 
of a broken promise and something they did not mean to do in the 
first place?  Could we please have an explanation?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. House leader for 
the New Democrats raises two propositions, one in which he 
alleges that the ordinary rules of behaviour have somehow been 
modified for the purpose of this debate.  That is factually 
incorrect.  The hon. member has been around here so long that he 
has been here even longer than I and that is a long time.  Of 
course there is another hon. member near him who has been here 
even longer.  They will both remember, of course, that an 
opposition motion being amended is not something new.  It is 
something that has been done for 50 years.  To say that it has 
been suspended is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the opposition, cleverly or otherwise, discovered a few 
years ago was to find a way of making a minor amendment to its 
motion to prevent someone else from offering one later.  I have 
offered a subamendment today which I believe is acceptable.  If 
the Speaker decides that it is not, I will certainly accept that. 
I hope the hon. member does the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insofar as the ethics counsellor being, as I believe the hon. 
member said, an officer of the House, I do not believe that 
particular feature was ever in the red book.  There was a 
reference to reporting directly to parliament, which he does in 
relation to one part of his work.  He reports to the Prime 
Minister on the part dealing with ministers.  For the part 
dealing with backbench MPs, all of us collectively have not yet 
put in place a system regarding the code of conduct for other 
MPs, so it does not apply there.

Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the Bloc Quebecois 
whip, the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since last November 27 I have heard members of the House, either 
within these walls or elsewhere, including in the media, asking 
why there was such a poor turnout at the last federal 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely one of the reasons is that the public so often feels 
betrayed and misled by people who do not keep their promises. 
When there are more people believing Elvis is still with us than 
people believing that politicians are to be trusted, that should 
send some pretty strong alarm signals to all members of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For once the Canadian Alliance had a good idea: to bring before 
the House an issue that would normally be totally non-partisan. 
The proof of its non-partisan nature is that they actually 
repeated, word for word, a promise made in the 1993 Liberal red 
book, and are merely asking that it be adopted by all members of 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the members of the four opposition parties are the 
only ones who want to honour this promise originally made by the 
Liberals, which is ironic to say the least.  Moreover, the Bloc 
Quebecois election platform for the year 2000 stated as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois proposes that the ethics counsellor report to 
the House of Commons rather than to the Prime Minister's Office. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore fully involved in this movement, which seems to 
be unanimous on this side of the House, to have the ethics 
counsellor not be answerable to a single person, the person who 
signs his paycheque, in other words the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this proposal in 1993—I remember the debates on it 
then, and nothing has changed—was to restore at least a little of 
the public confidence in politicians.  Unfortunately the 
government has failed miserably at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perhaps worthwhile reminding hon. members that, since the 
quiet revolution, no hint of scandal has involved any Quebec 
political party in power, regardless of political stripe.

fortunately, this has been a lesson that Quebecers have learned 
the hard way.  We went through the terrible excesses of the

problem began before that.  The government of Quebec was 
wallowing in patronage and was helping itself to public monies.

sorts of scandals do not exist in Quebec.

read about them in history books, but they have not been seen in 
Quebec for the past 40 years.  When someone oversteps the 
limits, which are very strict, they are dealt with by the courts 
and no more is heard about them.  They are dealt with 
effectively and efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather sad for young people to see that Duplessis-style 
politics have now sprung up on the federal scene. 
This increases young people's disillusionment with politicians 
in this country.  It is all the sadder since the Prime Minister, 
who comes from an old red family, having fought the Duplessis 
system, has come himself to the point of setting up much the 
same system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of Placeteco comes to mind. In it $1.2 million in 
public funds were squandered without an invoice to account for 
the spending.  There is the Auberge Grand-Mère, a subject of much 
discussion these days.  There is also the business in the riding 
of my colleague from Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, which—we will recall 
it having been brought up—magically ended up in the riding of 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of attitude on the part of the federal government 
leads it to consider the money of Quebec and Canadian taxpayers 
its own, so it can spend it as it likes.  One of the most 
effective ways of stopping that is to have a man or a woman 
outside the parliamentary system and not accountable to the 
Prime Minister, who usually makes the decisions that often 
benefit his friends, his riding, under a very vague set of 
rules, but accountable instead to parliament, a bit like the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the position of the Bloc Quebecois is very clear. 
We support this motion.  I hope the Liberal government will 
honour its promise in 1993, when it made this proposal we all 
fully support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude therefore by saying that Quebecers learned the 
lessons of the Duplessis system the hard way. 
We have built a just and fair society, which has created strict 
and clear rules for itself thereby ensuring there will be no 
scandals in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am truly and firmly convinced that this 
attitude of Quebecers in general to scandals and the need for 
their MNAs to be honest, augurs very well for the political 
system we will soon be setting up in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the comments of the Bloc Quebecois 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the public had lost confidence in the government. 
Looking back at the results of the last election, it looks as 
though Quebecers lost confidence in the Bloc Quebecois, which 
lost six seats, while we made gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, in his speech, the hon. member often referred 
to the standards of the Quebec government. He contends that 
there were no scandals. I find this strange, because over the 
past three years, the media have reported on people being 
prosecuted, on scandals relating to several issues, on 
suspicious discretionary budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Bloc Quebecois explain then that, in 1994, it voted 
against a bill to increase transparency in the Canadian 
government, when in Quebec the act governing the National 
Assembly includes provisions such as the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The jurisconsult is appointed under section 74 of the Act 
respecting the National Assembly, on the motion of the Premier 
and with the approval of two-thirds of the Members, for a 
renewable term not exceeding five years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the act respecting the national assembly creates the 
office of jurisconsult, a position currently held by Quebec's 
former chief justice Claude Bisson. The jurisconsult's advisory 
role only extends to members of the national assembly. 
Several Quebec premiers have added directives that apply to 
cabinet members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These rules are similar to those established at the federal 
level and in the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that the responsibility of the current 
premier of Quebec is made even clearer in the final paragraph of 
the letter Mr. Bouchard wrote his ministers on January 29, 1996: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contentious cases, the Premier (of Quebec) is responsible for 
the interpretation of these directives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it true or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it scandalous that a 
Quebec MP can rise in this House and refer to the fact that the 
Quebec scene has been filled with scandals, but not be able to 
name a single one of them.  That is scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Not a one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> We can certainly list some on the federal 
level: Auberge Grand-Mère, Placeteco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the government's ethics, Tremblay—Guittet 
Communications received more than $2 million from the Canada 
Information Office and Public Works Canada.  Mrs. Michelle 
Tremblay of that company has been involved in all Liberal 
election campaigns since 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communication & Stratégie also obtained more than $2 million 
from the CIO in order to organize federal ministerial visits to 
Bloc Quebecois ridings.  The head of that company is Serge 
Paquette, who ran for the federal Liberals in the Laurentides 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another buddy of the Liberal Party of Canada, Richard Mongeau, 
was legal counsel for the CIO, as well as its head of 
communications at the same time.  He has since been appointed to 
a judgeship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groupe Everest and Lafleur Communications both received 
contracts of several million dollars, either from the CIO or from 
Public Works and Government Services Canada through its 
“initiatives sponsorships” program, and all these companies 
have contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the Liberal 
Party of Canada's campaign chest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> I could go on.  This is the kind of 
attitude the Canadian Alliance motion is aimed at avoiding. This 
is the kind of feeding from the public trough that the Liberal 
Party has demonstrated, this is the kind of proprietary feeling 
about public funds that the Alliance motion is aimed at doing 
away with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am calling upon the Liberal Party, and this member 
in particular, to vote and to respect the Liberal campaign 
promise of 1993.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil (Beauharnois—Salaberry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is really something to see how self-righteous they are in the

going on in Quebec City with appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the husband of Pauline Marois was appointed 
president of the Société générale de financement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the Bloc Quebecois explain to the public how they indirectly

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, in politics, there are certain 
debates we have been dreaming about, and this is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, who has just put a question 
to me, went through three election campaigns promising the same 
bridge and not once did he ever deliver on this promise.  We 
will soon see a picture of the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry 
beside the definition of broken promise in the dictionary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to take part in this very important debate on the 
question of parliament's need to be able to count on the 
services of an ethics counsellor, whose role it will be to 
examine the probity and the actions of members of cabinet and to 
report to the House on his findings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the questions and comments we have just heard from the two 
Liberal members, I find it particularly interesting that they 
mention that the public has lost confidence.  However the public 
gave the Liberal Party a greater majority than in the last 
election.  That is the trouble with this government, which still 
only wants to see part of the picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik has taken great care 
to conceal the fact that the turnout rate for this election was 
one of the lowest in federal election history.  That must 
indicate something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of loss of confidence, we mean a loss of 
confidence in political institutions and parliamentary 
institutions.  Why was there such poor voter turnout?  Perhaps 
because our fellow citizens did not find it was worth while.  It 
makes no difference who gets elected, they feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that gives them such a negative attitude or 
impression of the public and the political scene? 
It is the sort of things we saw during the election campaign, 
when the Prime Minister was suspected of involvement in some 
rather dubious undertakings.  The ethics counsellor was 
consulted and his response in the midst of the election campaign 
was “I do not think the Prime Minister can be faulted in any 
way”.  I shall return to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also found of particular interest that the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik raises the code of ethics of the 
National Assembly.  Really now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Ottawa we have a nearly secret code of ethics, one 
established by the Prime Minister, enforcement of which is 
entrusted to a man who was appointed by the Prime Minister, who 
administers rules set by the Prime Minister, and who is 
answerable for his actions to that very Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik told us “It is no 
better in the National Assembly”.  To that, I will say that 
there is one major difference, though. 
In the National Assembly, the code of ethics is a law.  There is 
a statutory basis for ministerial integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of the function of jurisconsult, saying the appointment 
is made by the premier after a vote in the National Assembly. 
That is a lot better than here, where the Prime Minister alone 
makes the appointment without consulting anyone.  The members of 
the National Assembly have the opportunity to comment on the 
appointment of the jurisconsult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik starts denigrating 
the Quebecers' National Assembly again, I would advise him to 
find credible and relevant examples under the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is also interesting to note that our friends in the 
government are just as vigorously resisting the idea of having 
to agree to the motion presented by the Canadian Alliance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, we are simply asking them to honour an election promise 
they made in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw earlier—and the Speaker will be coming back to it later 
on, so I would not want to elaborate further—how twisted the 
government House leader got in his efforts to have the motion of 
the Canadian Alliance say what it does not, to avoid voting 
against their own red book this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way around it.  The motion by the Canadian Alliance 
reiterates verbatim the promise in the Liberal Party's red book 
in 1993.  It would be embarrassing, to say the least, for the 
government to have to vote against one of its own election 
promises. However, this would not come as a surprise, since we 
have seen the government, on a number of occasions, not fulfil 
its commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are in effect rising in this House, this symbol 
of Canadian democracy, and saying “Dear fellow citizens, we lied 
to you in that we did not intend to fulfil the promise we made in 
1993”. I will admit that it could be embarrassing to say the 
least for the government to have to rise and vote against its own 
promise. This is why the Liberals tried their best to have us 
believe that this motion says something that, in fact, it does 
not really say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I alluded to the broken promises of the Liberals. What about the 
infamous promise to scrap, to abolish the GST? What about the 
infamous promise to tear up the free trade agreement? What about 
this other Liberal promise the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry mentioned in responding to the speech by 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier? What about the 
promise made during the last election campaign to build two 
bridges and 14 kilometres of highway? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government now seems less anxious to provide an answer and 
to fulfil that promise. This is common practice among Liberals. 
It is no wonder that the participation rate at the last general 
election was one of the lowest in Canadian history. It is no 
wonder that, after such a display of cynicism and arrogance on 
the part of the Liberal government, people are much less inclined 
to take part in the electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor answered one question and I will get back 
to it in a few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me say that our comments here today are not in any 
way aimed at the ethics counsellor himself. Given his 
professional background, I presume that Mr. Wilson is a person 
whose probity cannot be questioned and that he has very high 
professional qualifications. This is not what is at issue here 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at issue is the relevance of an ethics counsellor 
position, if the incumbent does not report to parliament.  What 
is at issue is a broken Liberal promise from 1993 to create an 
ethics counsellor position, and fill it with someone who would be 
appointed by the various political parties in the House and who 
would report to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to what I was saying earlier.  The ethics counsellor 
gave his interpretation of the reasons why he does not report to 
this parliament.  He said that the first reason is that the Prime 
Minister is responsible to parliament for the conduct of his 
ministers.  He invoked ministerial responsibility.  He said that 
since he reports to the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister 
reports to the House, the necessary transparency is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, if I may, mention something very much in the news right 
now which makes me question the validity of the ethics 
counsellor's response. We have only to look at the CINAR affair 
and the somewhat special role played in it by the Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we question the Minister of National Revenue, he tells us 
that he cannot answer because of the confidential nature of tax 
files.  What about ministerial responsibility?  Is he not 
responsible to this parliament for the actions of his department?

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His answer is: “I cannot answer.  I do not know what is going 
on.  My people are professionals.  They are doing their job and I 
cannot interfere”.  What is the point of having a minister who 
reports to the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would close by urging all members to vote in favour of this 
motion, first of all because it is important for Canadian 
democracy and the Canadian parliamentary process, and also 
because it will allow the members opposite to finally deliver on 
one of their election promises made seven years ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Alain 
Dubuc, from <I>La Presse</I>, was right to say that the Bloc is out of 
touch with reality. The former member for Beauharnois—Salaberry 
has been replaced by my hon. colleague. Someone has reviewed all 
the speeches made by the member for that riding. That member 
never had any concern for the issues his riding and his region 
were faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member this: the real scandal, is 
it not the fact that the Bloc and the PQ let the regions die off 
while they keep talking about the Constitution, at a time when 
8% of Quebecers are still willing to hear about the Constitution 
and 92% of Quebecers and people in the regions prefer to hear 
about the economy and health? Meanwhile, they are still 
discussing very nebulous items of parliamentary procedure, 
whereas we are focusing our initiatives on research and 
development, the infrastructure program and the upgrading of our 
small and medium size businesses to make them even more 
efficient. They are always out of touch with reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the hon. member for Jonquière who once wrote to President 
Clinton. I am sure the president did not find the time to answer 
her letter before leaving office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague for Verchères—Les-Patriotes 
if, to his mind, the real scandal is not seeing the PQ and the 
Bloc Quebecois let the regions decline and fall at a time when 
our policies as a government are focused on structural 
initiatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my 
colleague, the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, for his question, 
which is at the very least twisted and warped. I thank him, 
nevertheless, because it will allow me to set the record 
straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use the words twisted and warped because we are discussing 
government integrity and the necessity for the government to 
justify its actions before the House. All the member for 
Chicoutimi—Le Fjord has done is to bring us back to the 
constitutional debate, while accusing us of always bringing up 
that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will answer his question, first to say this. I find it at the 
very least outrageous that the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord 
should undermine the work of the former member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, Daniel Turp, by saying that he never cared 
about his riding. That takes some gall. 
I challenge the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord to go to 
Beauharnois—Salaberry to see what is going on in that riding and 
what was going on, these last years, when my colleague, Daniel 
Turp, was its representative in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some say that the constitutional issue is not among the 
priorities of Quebecers. I would like to say something about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the priorities of Quebecers? Like most other people, 
their priorities are employment, health and education. Not 
foreign affairs, not national defence or the coast guard. The 
federal government has understood that well. 
This government invests as little as possible in areas which are 
under its responsibility. It cuts payments to the provinces and 
uses this money stolen from the provinces to invest in health, 
education and employment. These are all jurisdictions which do 
not belong to the federal government, under the Constitution. No 
wonder we want to talk about the Constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add some comments to the debate and 
perhaps bring some focus back to what we are here to discuss, 
that is, the ethics counsellor, the integrity of government and 
the ability of the government to portray itself with confidence 
to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It troubles me greatly when I hear the government House Leader 
get up and speak of the pristine ethics of the government and, in 
particular, of the Prime Minister.  I know the hon. member who 
just spoke will recall what occurred in his province with respect 
to a Liberal fundraiser who, armed with lists of persons from 
HRDC and ACOA who had applied for grants, went far afield with 
that information and attempted to raise funds for the Liberal 
Party of Canada.  I also know the member from Chicoutimi would 
recall that incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the government reconciles that with its position of 
pliable ethics that it is so proudly clinging to today.  I wonder 
if the hon. member would comment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate your 
indulgence and your concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply like to thank the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for his question. He is bringing the 
debate back to its real purpose, that is to the issue of the 
ethics counsellor and the government's accountability to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I believe he raised a very clear case where, if 
the ethics counsellor were appointed by the House and reported 
to the House, dubious actions on the part of the government 
could have been prevented or corrected.

<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
I still think of the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle as the member 
for Yorkton—Melville.  I have not quite adjusted to the fact 
that he is not known by the riding that he was known by for 25 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of things to say about the motion.  We are 
talking about two things in the motion.  We are talking about 
broken promises and we are talking about the substance of 
promises made, and whether or not those promises should now be 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with respect to the question of broken promises, clearly 
this is a broken promise.  It was very clearly promised in red 
book one that there would be an ethics counsellor created and 
that the counsellor would be responsible to the House of Commons. 
That has not happened and the government has given us no 
indication today as to why that has not happened.  It has been 
very self-congratulating in terms of its record.  It looks good 
only because it compares itself to the previous Conservative 
administration which was rife with controversy and scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I think that the only difference between the Liberals 
and the Conservatives, when it comes to that sort of thing, is 
that the Conservatives never really got out of their amateur 
status when it came to patronage, scandal and other things.  The 
Liberals are the real professionals when it comes to that sort of 
thing.  They are better at not being caught.  They are better at 
hiding what they do.  They are better at covering things up.  The 
Tories were just a bunch of rank amateurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when the Tories were in government, I remember some 
Liberals in opposition saying to me off the record that the 
Tories were a bunch of rank amateurs, that they were really the 
people who knew how to do that.  The Liberals have been back 
since 1993 and they are still doing it, in part because they have 
not kept the promises they made with respect to those kinds of 
issues.  One of those promises was the creation of an ethics 
counsellor, an ethics counsellor that would be responsible to the 
House not to the Prime Minister.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader made the argument that the Prime 
Minister was ultimately responsible and therefore we could not 
have the ethics counsellor reporting to the House.  The Prime 
Minister is ultimately responsible for the official languages 
policy, for the privacy law and for the freedom of information 
law, but that does not prevent us from having privacy 
commissioners, official language commissioners and freedom of 
information commissioners.  It also should not prevent us from 
having an ethics commissioner, if that is what that person would 
come to be called whenever that position would be created, who 
would be responsible to the House of Commons.  On the face of it, 
the Liberals have broken this promise and offered no explanation 
as to why they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has given rise to the debate?  It is of course all the 
controversy surrounding the things that have happened in the 
Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the Prime Minister carefully over the last 18 
months to two years.  It is not a question of whether the Prime 
Minister did anything wrong in the criminal sense.  I am 
certainly not making that charge and some people who have made 
that charge have withdrawn it.  What the Prime Minister does not 
seem to get is that he is not just an ordinary member of 
parliament.  I just do not think there is any substance to that 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the Prime Minister can do the same things as an ordinary 
member of parliament can do, but to suggest that it is ordinary 
behaviour for the Prime Minister to have people over to 24 Sussex 
to talk to them about loans to hotels in his riding, not to 
mention hotels that the Prime Minister has had something to do 
with in the past, and that it is the sort of thing that I get to 
do every day as a member of parliament, is just ridiculous and 
the Canadian people know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the election results, the Canadian people seem resigned to 
accept this.  They seem resigned to accept a certain level of 
that kind of behaviour.  Unfortunately, they just seem to think 
that goes with the Liberals.  They seem prepared to tolerate that 
behaviour with the hope that the Liberals have other virtues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we as members of parliament do not have to tolerate it. 
We do not have to tolerate it as opposition parties.  As members 
of this place We have a responsibility not to tolerate and that 
is why we are up on our feet today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Prime Minister and to the government, not just for 
their own sake but for the sake of the political process in 
general, that they should behave differently.  They should see 
that there is a distinction to be made between the kinds of 
opportunities that the Prime Minister has, the clout that the 
Prime Minister has, the question of how that clout should be used 
and whether there are times when the Prime Minister should resist 
the temptation to use that clout, even if it is for the benefit 
of his own constituency, because it puts the whole political 
process in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question, from some of the figures I have seen, that 
the Prime Minister's riding has done very well indeed by virtue 
of having the Prime Minister as its member of parliament.  When 
it gets so out of whack, when there is so much more money going 
into the Prime Minister's riding over what goes into other 
ridings, and when we see that there are secret opportunities for 
transitional funds going into Liberal ridings that people in 
other ridings do not even know about, all these kinds of things 
do not exactly bring a healthy smell to the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge my Liberal colleagues to see if they can find a way 
to act more appropriately when it comes to this sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often talk about governments breaking their promises.  I want 
to say with respect to the party that moved the motion today that 
it is one of the rare political animals in our political system. 
It has managed to accumulate a whole number of broken promises 
while it is still in opposition.  It is not something that 
everybody can do.  One has to have a special talent to do it. 
Members of that party made promises as to how they would behave 
in opposition. 
They did not say how they would behave in government because they 
have not had a chance to govern, and God help us if they ever do, 
although if they ever do become government I hope they do break 
some of their promises. I hope they never bring them into being.

into Stornoway.  They promised their leader would not take a

not become members of the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all that, I think they have done some growing up 
while they have been here.  They have appreciated some of the 
policies that were in place, that they made a political career 
out of criticizing, and have changed their mind.  However, when 
they changed their mind, they broke another promise.  They were 
the ones who said that when members of parliament change their 
mind or make a decision contrary to what their constituents 
thought they were voting for, then they should put themselves at 
the mercy of their voters once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the members of the Canadian Alliance who 
indicated that they would opt into the pension plan before the 
last election and the people voted them in, fair enough.  What 
about the people who indicated after November 27, 2000 that they 
would opt into the pension plan?  Do those members not have an 
obligation, given the things that they have said in the past, to 
submit themselves to the mercy of their constituents in a form of 
self-imposed recall?  Do we see any of that?  There is another 
broken promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes us as a bit odd, without prejudice to the well 
deserved criticism that the Liberals deserve when it comes to 
breaking promises, that the official opposition should be on its 
high horse when it comes to broken promises because they are the 
one political party in the country that has managed to accumulate 
a record of broken promises without ever having been in 
government.

that if the Prime Minister thought there could be or might be 
some challenge to a particular project in his riding that he 
should probably not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost like reverse discrimination.  If the Prime Minister 
cannot use his position to influence a half a dozen projects for 
the cumulative total of not more than $5 million or $6 million, I 
just cannot figure that reasoning out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, a week before the election was announced, we 
talked about a $500 million project.  Everybody was happy about 
it.  We are making a big fuss here about a $200,000 fountain and 
a $500,000 loan in a tourism industry that is going through a 
very difficult time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Canadians are putting it in perspective.  I never 
had any problem when the former Prime Minister of Canada, Mr.

the way it goes.

the Prime Minister should discriminate against his own

balance to be struck between not discriminating against one's own 
constituents and being seen to discriminate a bit too much in 
favour of one's own constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all a matter of perception and judgment, but the Prime 
Minister has an obligation for the sake of the whole political 
process not to leave himself open to those kinds of perceptions. 
He should not be wrong on the facts, as he apparently was when he 
was very absolute about the fact that the hotel in question did 
not receive any money from the immigrant investor program, and 
then we find out that it did.  Why was he so assertive about 
that?  Why did he not check the facts?  This does not help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the Prime Minister to behave differently because that 
would benefit the whole country.  I am not saying that people in 
the Prime Minister's riding should never get anything.  I do not 
know about the $500 million project in the member's riding, but 
it sounds to me like something that is going on in the whole of 
Toronto, not just in the member's riding.  Or, perhaps we should 
be looking more closely at the member's riding as $500 million is 
a lot more than most of us put together would get in terms of 
special grants and projects for our ridings.

plated pensions.  He was here when we had to serve six 
consecutive years.  Conceivably a member could be elected at 19

conscience bother him in that he sat in the House and supported 
that pension? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, here is the line that we 
all had to live with in the early nineties, that somehow we 
received a gold plated pension if we were in this place for six 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, after six years a member received six-fifteenths of a 
pension.  All of the ads by the National Citizen's Coalition and 
the Reform Party implied that if a member were here for six years 
and retired or was defeated, he or she received a cheque for $1 
million or something like that amount, instead of six-fifteenths 
or 75% of the average of their best five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, I am not embarrassed because hen that so-called gold plated 
pension was brought in, in 1981, I voted against it.  I did not

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I hope my friend from Souris—Moose Mountain does not 
leave the Chamber.  The motion today provides us with an 
opportunity to talk about our vision of democracy: electoral 
democracy, parliamentary democracy and economic democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Leader of the Opposition moving a motion to 
make the ethics counsellor responsible for reporting to the House 
and not to the Prime Minister himself.  It only makes sense. 
People cannot report to someone they are responsible to and then 
investigate the same person.  There is an apparent conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It struck me rather strange this morning when I heard the 
opposition House leader talk about the importance of 
accountability and things being built on trust.  I think 11 
members of the Canadian Alliance Party campaigned against the MP 
pension plan.  In many cases, after the election on November 27, 
these members decided to pay back into the pension plan.  They 
broke a fundamental trust and a fundamental promise that they 
made to the voters in their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to build a parliamentary system on trust, on 
confidence and accountability, it seems to me that the deputy 
leader of the Reform Party from Edmonton and others should do one 
of two things.  They have now bought back into the pension plan 
after criticizing us strenuously and comparing us to hogs 
slopping at a trough. They should either submit themselves to a 
recall of their voters or resign their seats like the member from 
Hamilton, the Minister of Heritage, did when she campaigned 
against the GST and then was part of a government that supported 
it.  If they have changed their minds the members should resign 
their seats and face the voters in a byelection to receive a new 
mandate.  That is accountability.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If some of the Alliance members had said before the November 
election that they had changed their minds on the pension and 
would opt in and buy back past service, that would have been a 
different story.  However, those who did not do it broke a 
fundamental promise and a fundamental part of what that party is 
all about in terms of accountability and respect for the House. 
They should resign their seats and submit to a byelection if 
indeed they mean what they say.  That is an important part of 
what we are debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the words again of the Leader of the Opposition and 
the House leader of that party who talked about the importance of 
building on trust and the importance of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the ethics counsellor being responsible to 
the House of Commons, we do this in a broader vision of our 
democracy.  I believe our country is in a democratic crisis.  Our 
parliamentary system gives the Prime Minister far too much power. 
The Prime Minister appoints all the senators, all the supreme 
court justices, the head of the army, the head of the RCMP, all 
the important heads of agencies, and makes thousands of patronage 
appointments to all kinds of organizations, agencies and crown 
corporations.  He does this without any parliamentary 
accountability whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Industry had any zeal for democratic reform 
he would lead a crusade to make sure that some of the powers of 
the Prime Minister's office went to the House of Commons and 
parliamentary committees in terms of important appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have too many confidence votes in the House.  If we had 
fewer confidence votes parliament would work in a more congenial 
and democratic way in trying to solve the problems that face the 
Canadian people.  Those are just some of the issues we should be 
dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary committees should have a lot more power and 
independence to initiate and timetable legislation.  However the 
government will not even take the minor step of allowing the 
committees to secretly elect their own chairs.  Such a step would 
simply follow the precedence of secretly electing a Speaker of 
the House.  The government is in the dark ages in terms of basic 
democratic reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the electoral and democratic side, no wonder the Minister of 
Industry hides his head in shame.  Only 5% of Canadians polled 
support the unelected Senate.  The minister, however, sits across 
the way and says aye, aye and cheers on the Prime Minister to 
make more and more Senate appointments to that house of hacks, 
flacks and political has-beens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for genuine reform to abolish the unelected, 
undemocratic and unaccountable Senate.  Canada should also take a 
serious look, as has almost every other country in the world, at 
some kind of proportional representation in our electoral system 
so that every voter could have equality and not cast a wasted 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal majority government, elected constitutionally for 
another five years, received 40% of the vote on a turnout of less 
than 60% in the last election.  That means fewer than a quarter 
of Canadians voted for the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is one of only three countries in the world with a 
population of more than eight million that does not have some 
form of proportional representation in its electoral system. 
Only Canada, India and the United States do not have some kind of 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a PR system every voter would be equal.  No vote would be 
wasted.  People would be included and involved in creating a 
parliament that would actually reflect how people vote.  That is 
the kind of democratic reform we should be looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also get rid of the kind of enumeration mess we had in 
the last campaign.  Over a million people were denied democracy 
because there was no house to house enumeration of voters.  Most 
of those missed were younger or poorer people living in inner 
cities or younger people who had moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the things we must change to make Canada more 
democratic and inclusive.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also look at the question of economic democracy and the 
fact that Canada is now governed more and more by trade deals, 
the WTO, NAFTA and huge transnational corporations that have more 
and more power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of trade per se.  There will be trade. 
There will be more and more international trade and more 
globalization because of technology.  It is a question of losing 
democratic control over issues that affect our lives because of 
the power of transnational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These huge corporations are not really run by entrepreneurs. 
Many are run by bureaucrats and technocrats who are responsible 
and beholden to no one.  They are like big icebergs at sea, 
bumping up against countries, distorting economies and denying 
local control and decision making over social programs, health 
programs, cultural programs, labour standards and farm programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should change.  Canada should lead the way in trying to 
build labour, social and environmental standards into trade 
agreements.  Such agreements should protect the cultural 
identities of nation states and allow them to make important 
decisions over the lives of their citizens in health care, 
shelter, employment and other important areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of the democratic vision people should hope for and 
espouse from the Parliament of Canada.  The country is 
sleepwalking toward a crisis in democracy.  Barely 60% of the 
people voted in the year 2000.  In 1997, 67% of the people voted. 
Thirty or forty years ago it was routine to have 80% or more of 
the people voting in federal and provincial campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are disengaging from the process because they feel 
politicians do not listen.  In so many ways the people are right. 
We elect a government that has a mandate for five years and there 
is no power sharing.  About 60% of the people voted for the 
opposition parties and 40% for the government party, and yet the 
Prime Minister has the unilateral power to make most important 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister wants to leave a legacy he should begin 
the process of democratizing the political institutions, the 
economic and electoral systems of Canada, so that the ordinary 
people, through their representatives, will have a real say over 
the common good and the direction of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is but a small step in that direction.  It 
would make the ethics counsellor responsible not to the Prime 
Minister but to the House of Commons.  The person would report to 
the House of Commons as does the chief electoral officer, the 
privacy commissioner, the official language commissioner and many 
others who operate in a way that is just and proper and in a way 
that governments past said would never work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be afraid to take at least that one step toward 
democratic reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I agree with a lot of what the member said about trade.  I have 
been racking my brain on the issue of unelected and unaccountable 
bureaucrats in multinational corporations, and the way they move 
around like icebergs.  We are responsible as members of 
parliament to maintain jobs in our communities and in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What idea does the member have for handling multinational 
organizations in such a way that they will not hold us to ransom 
for all the jobs they control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member from Toronto 
made a very good comment.  He talked about the multinational or 
transnational corporations that can hold us to ransom for the 
jobs in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem with the trade deals today is that they are 
like charters of rights for transnational corporations.  We must 
somehow augment that with an international people's charter of 
rights which builds into these agreements minimum standards in 
terms of labour and labour mobility and in terms of environmental 
and social standards.  Such a charter might even look at radical 
ideas such as a minimum global tax on transnational corporations 
so they cannot play off one country against the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, I think many powers once enjoyed by the nation 
state must now be transferred to the international forum.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have transferred the powers of capital to huge transnational 
corporations, but we have not counterbalanced that with a 
counterweight, which is the democratic control of people through 
their governments as institutions, and transferred other powers 
such as people's rights, labour rights, agricultural rights, 
environmental rights and environmental standards.  One of them 
might be a minimum tax on transnational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another idea endorsed by parliament in a 2:1 vote was contained 
in a private member's motion which I put before the House two 
years ago endorsing the idea of what was called a Tobin tax on 
currency speculation to help curb speculation in currency.  About 
a trillion dollars are traded every day.  There is no control of 
this or of the international casino of currency which distorts a 
lot of economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We became the first parliament in the world to endorse the idea 
of a small currency tax, which is called a Tobin tax, in concert 
with the world community.  Our government should be aggressively 
selling the position of the Parliament of Canada at international 
fora like the World Bank and the IMF.  These are some of the 
things we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point is that democracy has been denied, thwarted and 
abrogated because of trade deals and because of transnational 
corporations.  We have lost that democracy.  These people report 
to no one.  We as a nation have to take a leading role in trying 
to get that power back for ordinary people.

Mr. Speaker, it is enlightening to see you in the chair.  I know 
the impartiality you bring to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pose a question to the hon. member with respect to his 
comments about the credibility and importance of an ethics 
counsellor.  Reference has been made throughout this debate to 
various parties and to which party did what first.  The hon. 
member's own party is not devoid of indiscretion or 
discrepancies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him of the former premier of British Columbia, Mr. 
Vander Zalm, who found himself in some difficulty. It resulted in 
a report published by Ted Hughes, a former deputy attorney 
general and superior court judge in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report dealt with public land transactions and money that 
was then returned for a promise of a speculator acquiring 
adjacent properties.  Federally owned oil companies were 
involved.  All of this resulted in another premier from British 
Columbia resigning, Premier Harcourt.  Although he was not 
personally implicated in the wrongdoing, he resigned after a 
forensic audit by an auditor he had appointed who found that 
party officials during the eighties had concocted a scheme to 
divert funds legally designed for charity into NDP coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This demonstrates that the independent counsellors, the 
independent auditors, and in this case a former judge, were able 
to flesh out a situation that obviously was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the office of the ethics counsellor tainted by what has 
occurred in this situation?  Should we be looking at a separate 
judge or special prosecutor to be assigned to cases like this 
one?  He would be at arm's length from government.  Perhaps he 
would be appointed by government but would not have that 
connection and therefore could credibly come before the Canadian 
people and lay out the facts so that there would be a credibility 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should like to clarify 
what might be a misunderstanding.  Mr. Vander Zalm was not an NDP 
premier but a Social Credit premier.  Mr. Harcourt was a New 
Democrat and he did resign.  Mr. Vander Zalm is now the leader of 
the Reform Party of British Columbia.  His cousins sit over to my 
extreme right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor should be an independent person.  Perhaps 
he should have the power to appoint an independent prosecutor to 
investigate certain things.  A committee of the House could look 
at what additional powers the counsellor should have.  He should 
certainly have the power to launch independent investigations.

would like to indicate that I will be sharing my time with the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by making a few brief comments. Following the 
government House leader's procedural stunt, the debate seemed to 
cool down, except perhaps that our colleague from the New 
Democratic Party managed to heat it up a bit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we can talk about the promise broken by the Liberals 
in 1993. We are used to that. However, the real reason we have 
this motion before us today is because of the Auberge Grand-Mère 
issue. Nor must we must dismiss the Canadian Alliance's desire to 
bring forward a motion about the ethics counsellor, because the 
Auberge Grand-Mère affair is a case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real debate must be centred on the Prime Minister, the 
ethics counsellor and a specific affair or affairs that have led 
to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the facts, we are told “You know, the Prime 
Minister did his job as an MP”. There is a big difference 
between the prerogatives of a Prime Minister and those of an 
ordinary MP. It is not the same thing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, what we want today is to know exactly what happened. We 
only get snippets of information about what the Prime Minister 
did in this affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister called the president of the Business 
Development Bank and told him “Drop by 24 Sussex; we have to 
talk”, it was clearly not to congratulate him. Then he told the 
president “Look here, there is a loan application. You have to 
see to it. Understood?” Suddenly the loan is approved. Soon 
after there is a default of payment. Something is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the bank says “Listen, we must call in the 
loan”.  He gets a phone call from the Prime Minister who asks 
“What is going on?” He replies “They are not making any 
payments, so I have to call in the loan”.  It is a Business 
Development Bank policy, but this is not how it worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little while later, Mr. Beaudoin was moved out of the Business 
Development Bank.  He got pushed out and the loan was not called 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Prime Minister does take care of his riding. However, 
at one point, the prerogative of a Prime Minister should 
implicitly and explicitly require a certain amount of reserve, 
beyond what would be required of an ordinary member.  I am not 
the Prime Minister, but he acted wrongly in this case, he acted 
very wrongly. That is what we say when we blame the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the ethics counsellor is concerned, we would like to 
know what data, what discussion, what evidence brought him to 
absolve the Prime Minister.  Whom did he speak to?  Over a two 
day period, he did not have time to meet with too many people. 
What evidence was his decision based on?  Is he well informed 
about the whole issue?  Did he speak with the representatives of 
the Business Development Bank?  The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After two days, he replied: “Everything is fine.  I am reacting 
rapidly because this is an urgent matter.  The urgency justifies 
a thorough analysis of the issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for the truth, the whole truth.  Did the ethics 
counsellor do his job properly in this case?  This is an 
important case, because the office of Prime Minister deserves 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we are to respect the person who holds that office, 
we must have reasons to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that we keep accusing the Prime Minister. Give us 
good reasons not to do so, and we will stop. Let the Prime 
Minister have the ethics counsellor meet with members of 
parliament. Let him have a good talk with the elected 
representatives of the Canadians. That is not too much to ask. 
Does he need the permission of the big boss? Let the big boss 
tell him to meet members on both sides of the House. We will ask 
him with whom he had discussions on this issue. Will his answer 
be “The Prime Minister? I had coffee with him”. That is not 
good enough. We must go deeper than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the reason we are having this debate today is the 
questionable conduct of the Prime Minister, who, among other 
things, approached directly the president of a bank. 
It is cloudy, and this had nothing to do with the storm that is 
coming tomorrow.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is getting quite cloudy on the government's side, concerning 
the role of the Prime Minister. The best way out of these 
problems, the best way to bring sunshine back in the Prime 
Minister's Office and his function is to free from political 
limitations the person whose role it is to check the conduct of 
elected officials, Prime Minister included, and let the ethics 
counsellor be more open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor is a good guy, but François Beaudoin, of 
the Business Development Bank, is a good guy too. Unfortunately 
he did not do exactly as told by the Prime Minister's Office, so 
he is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor must like his work, and I can understand. 
He probably does not want to frustrate his big boss. That is why 
we are asking that the counsellor's code of ethics be improved. 
He should be made independent. The only way for him to be totally 
independent is to report to parliament as a whole, and not to a 
group, a party or an individual. That is the way things should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auberge Grand-Mère issue will no go away as long as the 
Prime Minister refuses to be more open. It will not go away until 
the Prime Minister allows the ethics counsellor to meet with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not delude ourselves. Something fishy has prompted 
today's opposition day motion. Parliament should take all action 
necessary to ensure that the positions of Prime Minister and 
ethics counsellor are respectable and respected ones. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the comments by the member for Arthabaska, 
and I have a question for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read all the editorials, especially in Quebec. Members 
will forgive me for reading the French ones in particular, but I 
assume the English language newspapers are saying pretty 
much the same thing. Throughout this whole business of 
handing out contracts and favours, the Prime Minister has been 
saying that he is an ordinary MP and that he is doing his job as 
an MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The editorial writers are saying that this is not true; he is 
not an ordinary MP.  Democracy imposes him on us every three 
years and four months, or thereabouts, but once elected our 
Prime Minister is a dictator.  He has the discretionary, 
decisional power to hand out money without being accountable to 
anyone. Can he claim to be an ordinary MP like I and all the 
other MPs on this side of the House?  Is he not something 
more?  That is the first part of my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part is this.  In a divorce proceeding would it be 
considered normal for the mother of one of the parties seeking 
divorce to also serve as the judge and award child support, 
assign fault, and determine access?  It seems to me that one 
could say that this is not transparent, even if the mother-in-law 
in question were mine—she is very fair—and if she perhaps had a 
tendency to favour me, which I am not in any doubt about.  One 
might wonder whether her ruling was an impartial one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign did the ethics counsellor not come 
up with his decision a bit too quickly, before he had all the 
facts?  Does this not leave him open to criticism for the simple 
reason that he was appointed by his friend, that he is acting for 
his friend, and that his decisions favour his friend?  I would 
like to hear what the member for Arthabaska has to say about 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
and congratulate him for having a nice mother-in-law. That being 
said, I want to point out that the Prime Minister is not just 
another member of parliament, and nor should he be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I cannot designate my chief of 
operations as the new vice-president of the Business Development 
Bank of Canada. I cannot call Jean Carle, who has worked in my 
office for some time and tell him that I have made him the new 
vice-president of the Business Development Bank of Canada. I 
cannot do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with all the credibility a Conservative member has, I 
cannot call the president of the BDC and tell him “I want to see 
you at my place, at 206 Brault Street, in Asbestos”. I do not 
think he would show up. It is not the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is quite an honour to have a premier or a Prime 
Minister as the member of parliament for one's riding. Does it 
come with some perks? The Prime Minister should be clear on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A certain amount of reserve should be exercised. If we look at 
the way the Prime Minister has been acting since 1993, we see 
that he has appointed a number of his friends to key positions. 
He has acted on his own. He will then be able to tell them what 
to do. That is what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is so important to have an independent ethics 
counsellor. There is a cloud hovering over the Prime Minister 
Office because of his involvement in crown corporations, federal 
programs, and so on, which is why we need an independent person 
to investigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that an opposition member may not be fair enough 
to pass judgment on a prime minister, and they may be right. 
However an ethics counsellor appointed by the House and 
accountable to the House will be independent enough to clarify 
the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is not just another member of parliament. 
Unfortunately our current Prime Minister is nothing like the 
prime ministers we had before him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his speech, my colleague pointed 
to the unhealthy situation that currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example. During the election campaign people 
must decide which party will be elected, which one will form the 
government and how it will operate. During the last campaign a 
few days before election day, a person appointed by the Prime 
Minister had to give his view on a very important issue, the 
Prime Minister's integrity. The next day the headlines read 
“Prime Minister Exonerated”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we not make a comparison? If the auditor general were to 
report to the Prime Minister rather than to the House of Commons, 
would we have received this week a public report, like the one 
tabled, showing the good and the bad sides of the government, 
instead of something giving no sense of justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand: </B>Mr. Speaker, it is essential that the 
person appointed be independent from the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot bet on that, but unfortunately I am sure that, having 
acted like he did since 1993, the Prime Minister will not put his 
head on the log by appointing an independent ethics counsellor 
not reporting to his office.

<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am always honoured to rise in the Chamber to take 
part in a debate such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in this instance is that a cloud has descended 
over the Prime Minister and over his behaviour.  This debate is 
very much focused on the ethical behaviour of the Prime Minister. 
As a result it broadens to how parliament operates and how we 
should hold elected officials and their conduct to a certain 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only through an independent and impartial examination of 
circumstances that we can arrive at the truth.  This should be a 
truth seeking exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy in all of this is that the government and the Prime 
Minister are hiding behind this office they have created.  They 
are holding it up to Canadians and saying that they have been 
cleared by this individual, this individual who is appointed by 
the Prime Minister and reports to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are telling Canadians that the Prime Minister makes the 
rules, is the judge and appoints the referee.  However the 
referee only reports to him.  How can Canadians have any faith in 
what that referee might say, let alone know the standard or the 
guidelines that the referee is operating by?

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked the Prime Minister to, at the very least, put 
forward the guidelines and the framework within which the 
counsellor is to work.  This is not a reflection on the 
counsellor himself but the office.  Sadly, what may emerge from 
this is that the office itself has been so denigrated by the 
process that Canadians will never have faith in that particular 
form of office.  That is why we should explore other avenues, 
such as the one in British Columbia.  Perhaps we do need an 
independent special prosecutor who can be arm's length and can 
help to gather evidence in order to shed light on these types of 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many, particularly the supporters of the Prime 
Minister, who want him to be exonerated and want him to clear the 
air on what has taken place in these circumstances.  That can 
only happen with a credible examination of all the facts, not the 
blurred facts, the fuzzy facts, the special words, the nuances 
and the treatment that we might tend to put in this Chamber, but 
done by an impartial examiner.  It can only happen if, and only 
if, there is an office created that will allow an individual or 
group of individuals with staff to examine facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole substance of the motion before the House was 
originated by the Prime Minister and his government.  This is not 
the creation of the opposition.  This is not something that came 
out of thin blue air.  This motion came directly from that now 
infamous fairy tale called the red book.  This was an example of 
a promise that the Liberals put before the Canadian electorate on 
the eve of an election because they new the electorate wanted it. 
However, as we have seen time and time again from the government, 
it was pulled back and put on a shelf when the election was over. 
When the votes were counted those words no longer rang true. They 
had no validity whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we hope to do in the brief time that we have as members of 
the opposition is to pose the important questions that come from 
this particular circumstance.  This standard of behaviour coming 
from the Prime Minister should be something that is particularly 
troubling to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to a member of the current government's 
own backbench, the newly elected member for Vancouver Quadra in 
British Columbia, who has quite a storied past with respect to 
the justice system and to examinations of these types of 
questions.  He is a former land use commissioner and deputy 
attorney general, positions that would give a unique perspective 
on ethical performance of government.  He said that one of the 
things we needed was a conflict of interest commissioner who 
would be a legislature officer rather than a part of the 
executive of government and therefore independent of the 
executive.  There is a lot of wisdom in those words.  He went on 
to say that the more senior the politician, the greater the need 
to be explicit about what the rules are and what the 
communication is about.  This is in the context of a 
communication between a senior member of government, in this case 
the head of the country, and an appointed official, and what the 
communication between those individuals is meant to bring about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we now know is that the Prime Minister of Canada, acting in 
his capacity, so he says, of a simple and humble member of the 
House, called the head of the Business Development Bank and said 
that there was an individual, a constituent who was in need of a 
loan, and that he would like the bank to look favourably upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not stop there.  There was another phone call.  It was an 
invitation to come to 24 Sussex, which again, I dare say, no 
member of the House, short of the Prime Minister, has unfettered 
access to.  We cannot say what took place during that 
conversation in the cozy confines of the living room of the Prime 
Minister, but lo and behold we do know the result.  The loan was 
approved against previous recommendations by individuals in the 
Business Development Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where it again became very blurred was the personal connection 
of the Prime Minister to the particular deal.  He was the former 
owner of the hotel and owned lands adjacent to the particular 
hotel that was partitioned some time previous.  This element of 
personal connection to the property for which the loan was 
secured is troubling because it was the personal benefit that 
might flow by having a loan approved that would improve and 
enhance the value of the hotel and therefore vicariously enhance 
the value of the adjoining lands.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much speculation as to when the Prime Minister actually 
disavowed himself, when he actually sold that property.  That is 
very unclear.  All of that examination, were it actually done by 
the ethics counsellor, is not available to the general public or 
to members of the House.  It is exempt from public examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are parts of the factual background of the situation which 
highlight the need for independence from counsellors if, most 
important, they are to have any credibility in the eye of the 
public or any credibility in the way members of the House conduct 
themselves and conduct their personal business affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister made many promises to Canadians during his 
tenures as official opposition leader and Prime Minister, and 
during his ongoing attempt to build a legacy for himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As reported in a 1994 edition of the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> the 
Prime Minister said that there could be no substitute for 
responsibility at the top.  He indicated that he set the moral 
tone for the government and must make the ultimate decisions when 
issues of integrity and trust are raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those words ring hollow today.  When simple questions are posed 
to the Prime Minister in the Chamber he will not even dignify 
them with a response.  He is completely backing away from his 
previous words, as we have seen him do on many occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By appointing an ethics counsellor and then having that 
counsellor report only to him, the Prime Minister is so shallow 
and denigrates so much the entire idea of having an ethics 
counsellor that it further undermines public confidence.  It 
drives even further underground the ability of the public to 
respect and have faith in public officials.  That is perhaps what 
is most troubling of all about the subject matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a unique opportunity here for the Prime Minister not 
only to fulfil an electoral promise but to signal to Canadians 
that the Chamber can create a change and the public can once 
again have confidence in elected members.  These are basic 
principles that should and could guide the Chamber in our future 
attempts to govern the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics code and the ethics counsellor have lost credibility 
for reasons now very apparent to the Canadian public.  The 
counsellor has lost the ability to report directly to the House 
and to report to the public on how the Prime Minister and 
ministers of the government conduct themselves.  A higher 
standard has to be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument of the Prime Minister and the government House 
leader that ultimately the Prime Minister reports directly to the 
House falls short.  They left out important detail.  The Prime 
Minister has to be responsible to the House.  We have seen an 
utter and complete failure of the Prime Minister to be 
accountable and to be respectful of the House in the way he has 
conducted himself in these affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened to the comments of the member from the Conservative 
Party.  It was a character assassination or a witch hunt.  He can 
confirm what I say by going back to <I>Hansard</I>.  He went on 
and on with allegations that supposedly the Prime Minister said 
in a meeting to the representative from the bank, that he would 
like him to look favourably on the issue.  Further the member 
said that he could not say what was said in that meeting.  If 
they stand to state their position, let them state it firmly as 
they did during the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Conservative Party sent a letter; the leader 
of the Canadian Alliance Party sent a letter; and the ethics 
counsellor responded to them. 
They did not let it go during the election, as they state here. 
They did not leave a cloud hanging over it.  After the election 
they pulled it back.  It continued.  We can read in today's 
<I>Quorum</I> about the inquiry.

thing one moment and contradicting it in the next moment.  It is 
total hogwash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me deal with the 
facts.  Someone in the Prime Minister's Office denied that he in 
fact spoke to Mr. Beaudoin, president of the Business Development 
Bank.  We know that happened.  I may have characterized what took 
place, but we know that conversation happened.  Only two people 
know what happened between those individuals, what transpired in 
that conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister should come forward and tell us.  He should 
be completely frank and open with Canadians.  He has an 
opportunity to do that.  There is nothing stopping the Prime 
Minister from telling us what transpired in his living room.  If 
he has nothing to hide, if there is nothing that he is ashamed of 
as he so vehemently states outside the House, let him come 
forward and table what took place in his living room.  Then we 
will have trust and we might have faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Excuse me if I am not completely enamoured with the argument 
that we should trust the Liberals.  We have heard time and time 
again about the GST, about free trade and about what they would 
not do if they were elected to office.  They have swallowed 
themselves whole on their promises time and time again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I compliment the hon. member on his speech contrary 
to the position across the way and have a question for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we in the House find or sense an ethical problem with a 
minister, in what way would the member propose that we get an 
investigation underway?  In order to do so we seemingly have to 
make a nuisance of ourselves in the House of Commons and raise 
the issue to such an extent that we force the government or use 
some other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question relates to the fact that the ethics counsellor 
reports to the Prime Minister.  How is it possible that anybody 
else other than the Prime Minister can get an investigation 
underway on the ethics of ministers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the thrust of the entire 
debate is how Canadians can have faith in an individual appointed 
by and reporting only to the same person who is the subject of 
the inquiry in terms of conduct.  There is absolutely no 
credibility whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a quote from Gordon Robertson, a widely respected 
retired clerk of the Privy Council, the head of the Public 
Service of Canada who served under Prime Ministers King, St. 
Laurent, Pearson and Trudeau.  This is what he had to say about 
the ethical standards of the Prime Minister, as reported in the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> of January 6: “What happened in Shawinigan 
never would have met the standard set in Pearson's code of 
ethics.  I should know.  I drafted it.  This Prime Minister has 
lowered the bar”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the lasting legacy of the Prime Minister that he lowered the 
ethical standards and lowered the bar on how a prime minister 
conducts himself in office?  If that is the legacy he wants, he 
has it right now.

thank God for the privilege of being here.  I thank my wife and 
family for their unending support over the last seven years of

a former land use commissioner and a former deputy attorney 
general.  I consider this person to be an expert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently the Prime Minister also considered this person to be 
an expert because he selected this man over the incumbent Ted 
McWhinney who was the sitting member for Vancouver Quadra.  Ted 
McWhinney was a constitutional expert and a foreign affairs 
consultant with a broad range of contacts.  He served two terms 
very honourably in the Chamber.  He was well respected and just 
an all around decent guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister is going dump a person like that, clearly 
he must have in mind the calibre of the individual that he is 
bringing in.  The member who came in, as I say, is a former 
ombudsman, a former deputy attorney general and a former land use 
commissioner for the province of British Columbia.  If the Prime 
Minister needs to know much more about the things that we have 
been discussing today, and how these things should be handled, 
all he needs to do is consult one of his newest MPs, the new 
member for Vancouver Quadra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give credit to Vaughn Palmer who is a reporter and who asked a 
number of questions of the new member for Vancouver Quadra.  As 
he pointed out, the member needs little introduction to B.C.  The 
positions he has held give him a unique perspective on the 
importance of independence and openness where elected office 
holders are accused of wrongdoing, as has been the issue with the 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reporter said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I interviewed (this person) recently on Voice of B.C. on the Shaw 
Cable.  To his credit, he didn't shirk at the comparison between 
the way things are handled here in B.C. and the way things should 
be handled in the case involving the Prime Minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver Quadra stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. is often looked at as the neanderthal of politics but B.C. 
on a number of fronts is a leader in new government...We've led 
the country in conflict-of-interest legislation...Our special 
prosecutor legislation is unique in Canada and in the 
Commonwealth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When questioned on what specifically could Ottawa learn from 
B.C., the new member for Vancouver Quadra answered: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them is a conflict-of-interest commissioner who is a 
legislative officer rather than part of the executive of the 
government and therefore independent of the executive.  We've 
gained good experience, proud experience and the federal 
government may want to look at that. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most difficult things for politicians to understand 
and senior bureaucrats to understand is that there is a line 
between the political and the administrative.  When a politician 
speaks across that line to a senior bureaucrat, there is a danger 
of miscommunication and what may, perhaps, look like urging on 
behalf of a constituent might be taken as political direction to 
deviate from the duty of administrative fairness. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more senior the politician, the greater the need to be 
explicit about what the rules are and what the communication is 
about. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most senior politician in Canada is the incumbent Prime 
Minister who hand-picked the member for Vancouver Quadra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reporter asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case you are talking about where a senior person calls a 
public official on behalf of a constituent sounds an awful lot 
like the Prime Minister three times lobbying the federal business 
development bank on behalf of a constituent who wanted a loan. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reply from the member for Vancouver Quadra in January of 
this year was “Yeah, I don't think any of us should be 
comfortable with the confusion and the public unease that it 
caused”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a quotation and I want to underline this.  He further 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we've learned earlier in B.C., that you need to 
make the rules very explicit, that you need to make the review 
processes very transparent and independent.  I think this is 
something I can take with experience to Ottawa. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, and with there being a number of speaking 
slots open for the balance of the afternoon, I would naturally 
assume that the federal Liberals would be happy to have this 
member in the speaking rotation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he would be able to bring a lot of light to this issue 
and speak directly to the Liberal members across so that they 
could understand what the issue is about.  Clearly to this point 
they have not understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I asked the industry minister the following question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, Justice Ted Hughes, the B.C. conflict of interest 
commissioner, has established this rule for the ministers of 
B.C.:  “A minister must not make personal representations on 
behalf of a constituent to—a commissioner, board, agency, or 
other tribunal established by the government.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister obviously violated this principle in lobbying 
the president of the Business Development Bank on behalf of Yvon 
Duhaime. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than answering the question directly, the industry 
minister attempted to deflect it.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the ethics counsellor has written recently to the 
Leader of the Opposition and has responded to the most recent 
correspondence from the Leader of the Opposition.  He has made 
crystal clear that all these matters, all the allegations being 
raised today, have been addressed.  There were no private benefit 
by the Prime Minister whatsoever and no conflict of interest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is who does that ethics counsellor answer to.  If the 
ethics counsellor answered to the House there is no possible way 
the House would ever permit the ethics counsellor to say “We 
don't have any rules about someone actually trying to take direct 
influence on a member of a crown corporation so, therefore, I am 
exonerating him”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not questioning the ethics or the competence of the ethics 
counsellor.  What I am questioning are the rules under which the 
federal ethics counsellor has been set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the British Columbia conflict of interest act, clause 
14(1) says “There must be appointed a commissioner who is an 
officer of the Legislative Assembly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the most important part but it goes further in paragraph 
two.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the motion of the Premier in the Legislative Assembly and on 
the recommendation of 2/3 of the members present, the Lieutenant 
Governor in Council must appoint the person so recommended to the 
office of commissioner. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that in the province of B.C., he not only answers 
to the legislature in terms of his reporting, but clearly 
two-thirds of the legislature, the majority, would also be 
involved in setting the terms and conditions under which he is 
actually operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are ever going to re-establish the whole concept of trust, 
we cannot allow this situation to continue where we have the 
ethics commissioner reporting to his boss.  If the standards are 
established by the Prime Minister, we end up with the kind of 
answer we got from the industry minister that I just quoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament is not supreme, then the prime minister is king, 
autocrat, dictator and supreme ruler.  The issue here is 
accountability.  It would be my hope that the member for 
Vancouver Quadra can get these people to wake up, smell the 
coffee and realize that it is an issue of accountability. 
Furthermore, it is an issue of the government keeping its word 
that it put down in black and white in the 1993 campaign.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the member opposite for bringing the debate around 
to something a bit less over the top and more rational.  I am 
very pleased to have a chance to comment on his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made reference to the framework under which the ethics 
counsellor operates.  Other speakers have questioned whether or 
not such a framework exists and suggested they could not find it. 
I have a copy obtained from the Internet this morning.  The 
document is public and the rules under which the ethics 
counsellor operates are quite public and available.  One could 
argue that those rules should be expanded, but in any event what 
is there is there and available for all to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite, and other members have also done this, 
moved from referring to an ethics counsellor to an ethics 
commissioner. There is a difference between the two.  It is 
important to realize the distinction.  The Liberal Party's 
commitment in 1993 was for an ethics counsellor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to members that this is not necessarily an ethics 
enforcer or an ethics policeman, but rather a counsellor who will 
counsel officeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member opposite not think there is at least room for 
disagreement here or misunderstanding?   Office holders rely on a 
counsellor.  We would not be as forthcoming to a policeman as we 
would a counsellor.  The counselling function is very important. 
We may need a policeman, but a counsellor we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not take the member's 
comments as splitting hairs.  Clearly there is a difference 
between a counsellor and a commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the words in the motion were lifted directly out of the 
promise that the Liberals made in 1993.  However, the promise was 
not only about an independent ethics counsellor.  Therefore, I 
agree that there is a difference.  However, I give him the last 
five words “will report directly to parliament”.  Clearly they 
have not done that and as a result, unfortunately the Prime 
Minister is under a cloud because he is the highest politician in 
the land. Unfortunately, if he is under a cloud, every other 
politician is also under a cloud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would work to his benefit is to simply follow through on 
the promises that he authored and he spoke about.  He stood in 
front of the television cameras with his red book and said that 
people could go to the red book, however many days after he was 
elected, and see what he had done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying fine, we are going to the red book and we want 
this put in place.  If the ethics counsellor was answerable to 
parliament, we and perhaps the people of Canada would have some 
confidence would have some confidence in the Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my people back home for having elected me for the last 
27 years, not only here, but at home also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening with this debate on the ethics counsellor is 
reflecting on every member of parliament on both sides of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1993 red book it was stated:  “The erosion of competence 
seems to have many causes.  Some have to do with the behaviour of 
certain elected politicians, others with an arrogant style of 
political leadership”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the selection of any officer presiding over the ethics of 
the House should that person be selected by this House?  Should 
that person be selected by an independent committee of credible 
people on both sides of the House?  Should the person not be 
reporting back to this House, not just to one person, so we can 
bring some credibility back to the House of Commons on both sides 
of the House?  Could the member comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I completely agree with the 
respected member of this chamber.  The province of Alberta act 
says: “There shall be appointed as an officer of the legislature 
by the lieutenant governor in council, on the recommendation of 
the legislative assembly, an ethics commissioner to carry out 
those duties and functions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario's act says “There shall be an Integrity 
Commissioner who is an officer of the Assembly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the difference between counsellor and commissioner. 
However, when we look at the standards of these ethics 
commissioners, we see that there should never be a situation 
where we have the highest ranking politician in Canada twisting 
the arm of the president of the federal Business Development 
Bank, who he appoints, who he can fire, and indeed we suspect did 
fire.  It casts aspersions on all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, if the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and 
Ontario can get their acts together, what is holding up the 
federal government from simply getting its act together and 
getting all of us out from under the cloud which the Prime 
Minister has put us under? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to this issue.  I 
too would like to thank the 39,000 people who voted for me in the 
last election.  I would also like to thank them for the 70% plus 
vote we received.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it is due to the common sense of the common people in 
British Columbia who look for a relatively conservative type 
vote, and I do thank them for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank one of the individuals who has been a 
big part of my life in politics and a good person to bounce 
issues off and that is my mother, who is watching in Chester, 
Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the ethics counsellor and how individuals 
in the country or in the House of Commons initiates an 
investigation by this individual, because therein I think lies 
part of the problem that we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor is supposed to be, in my mind, independent 
of the executive, which he is not.  He reports to the Prime 
Minister.  This individual should be looking at the ethics, the 
morality and the issues facing members of parliament, but he is 
not.  He reports on ministers of the government who report to the 
Prime Minister.  This individual should be interviewed by a 
committee of the House, short listed and selected by members of a 
committee of the House.  He is not.  He is basically selected by 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says that he has drawn counsel from the 
official opposition leader on the appointment, but basically that 
is not the case.  It is “Hi, how are you doing, thank you, 
good-bye”.  What is presented on one side is not reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The necessity of having an individual who is independent of the 
executive and who will report on even more than ministers is 
obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the issue I first introduced, which is, how is 
it possible for an individual, like myself for instance, to 
initiate an investigation when I feel something has happened that 
is unethical.  For example, during the election the current 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration basically said that 
members of the Canadian Alliance were Holocaust deniers, racists 
and bigots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, not only is that a slanderous comment from a 
minister of the government, but it is a comment that should have 
been challenged by an individual.  The Prime Minister should have 
dealt with it but he did not.  Instead, he has taken it upon 
himself to leave that minister in that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from thousands if not tens of thousands of people 
on the issue.  They are all concerned about the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration and her ethical standards of saying 
such a thing about so many Canadians.  The idea of Holocaust 
denier offended so many people that there was a great call for 
her resignation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  But she was re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  A member across the way said that she 
was re-elected.  Well there were tens of thousands of people who 
were concerned about the comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do people or members of parliament go when such a 
slanderous, demeaning comment is made? They can come into the 
House and complain about it as much as they want, but with a 
majority government it will basically laughed at them.  They can 
go to the Prime Minister but he will only say that if he gives it 
to the ethics counsellor that person might come back and say that 
something is wrong and then he would be embarrassed.  He will not 
do that.  Why should he embarrass himself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The control and the jurisdiction that the Prime Minister has 
over the ethics counsellor is totally inappropriate.  It would 
never exist in any normal organization.   We have a minister who, 
in my opinion, has a lack of ethics that should be challenged, 
and people want it challenged, but there is no avenue to do so 
because the Prime Minister would see it as a problem for himself, 
a problem for his cabinet.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein lies the problem.  If that individual did not report to 
the executive but reported to the House of Commons in general, I 
would bet my bottom dollar that minister would be up for 
investigation now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the whole ethics problem in the House of Commons is 
handled is totally inappropriate.  It should be a matter of 
ethics for all members of parliament on this side and that side, 
not just ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot about the Prime Minister and his flirtation 
with money for the last few years.  People are speaking about 
that today but I guess the same problem exists.  Why would the 
Prime Minister appoint the ethics counsellor to investigate the 
Prime Minister?  How naive would anybody be to think that the 
Prime Minister would even permit that?  That will not happen. 
That is why the whole situation has to be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members on the opposite side said there was a 
difference in that he is an ethics counsellor and not an ethics 
commissioner.  An ethics counsellor counsels.  He is not an 
enforcer yet he should be.  If the problem is that they cannot 
understand the difference between names and roles then we should 
do away with the ethics counsellor and bring in an ethics 
commissioner who does not report to the executive but reports to 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simple.  To suggest for a moment that the real problem is 
the difference in a name between counsellor and commissioner is 
assuming that we on this side of the House and the rest of 
Canadians are just plain stupid.  The real problem is that there 
is no chance on earth that the Prime Minister will allow an 
investigation of ethics of his ministers, members or himself, 
because he would bear the political outfall from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position is a plain waste of time.  As much as we would like 
to talk about having a person do one thing or another, we are 
really wasting our time.  If we cared about ethics in the country 
and in the House on the part of all members, we would concentrate 
first on an ethics commissioner, shortlisted, hired by a 
committee of the House of Commons and reporting to the House on 
any issue not passed on a motion of the majority.  Then again the 
majority government would get to pooh-pooh all investigations of 
the majority government and allow them or even push them all on 
the opposition.  There has to be some other mechanism to kick in 
an investigation by this new position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to summarize two things.  First, the current Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration undertook a particular and 
devastating ethical error and still sits in her job unaccountable 
for it.  Second, we cannot make ministers or anybody else in the 
House accountable to a position that reports to the Prime 
Minister.  That has to change.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask a question of the former House leader of the

parliamentary pensions and pigs going to a trough and then after

follow the precedent of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and 
resign her seat, in other words be voluntarily recalled, go back 
to her riding and consult her voters through a byelection.  It 
seems to me that would be the proper way in terms of ethics and 
in terms of accountability.  Otherwise, how can an opposition 
party criticize the government for the lack of ethics when its 
own ethical standards in terms of accountability are also 
tarnished? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a good question 
because I think it involves everybody in the House of Commons, 
which was the basis of my thesis in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are questions about whether or not something is 
ethical, they deserve to be answered regardless of the particular 
situation.  The House of Commons should have a mechanism to 
challenge ethics, not just for ministers but for all members, 
including myself, on things we have done or failed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the problem here is that there is no mechanism to 
undertake these kinds of things.  We could not possibly leave 
these kinds of questions to an ethics commissioner for those 
folks across the way.  For goodness sake, they have a majority 
government and we all know what happens in that situation.  They 
out vote everybody else.  They could charge, for political 
reasons, everybody over on this side and win all of those 
charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a question that has to be worked out.  I think all members 
should be under the watchful eye of an ethics commissioner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to agree with what I heard in 
the hon. member's speech.  I also heard complaints about the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration with regard to some of 
her comments during the campaign.  The ethics counsellor could be 
an avenue where that could be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also understood the member to say that an ethics commissioner 
is already in place in British Columbia.  Did this position come 
into place after the NDP were caught raiding the charities, 
filtering the money out of that and using it during its 
campaigns?  If so, it is a good example of why we do need that 
here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding of the way it is set up now is that it is 
almost like asking Frank James to look after Jesse James or 
Bonnie to look after Clyde. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know when the 
ethics commissioner was appointed in British Columbia.  However, 
no matter when he was appointed, I have not seen many ethics in 
the government of British Columbia for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be throwing out the NDP very shortly.  That is one of 
the good blessings of elections.  Perhaps then, once again 
British Columbia will lead the country in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if an ethics commissioner is in place, as we have in 
British Columbia, it does not guarantee an ethical government. 
However, at least an ethics commissioner will bring issues to the 
public and then the decision will be made at the polls as to 
whether or not justice is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect and with 
deference, I wonder if the member would answer the question I 
asked.  I asked him whether the ethical thing for the deputy 
leader of the Canadian Alliance Party to do, because of her 
decision after the election to buy back into her pension plan 
after promising not to, a fundamental commitment that she made, 
would be to voluntarily resign and face her electorate in a 
byelection like the member for Hamilton East did on the GST 
issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the 
NDP is trying to degrade the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about ethics, I only need to look to my left 
down here at the NDP and I can really spend all day talking about 
ethics or the lack thereof.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am the former House leader, not the former Speaker.  I came 
this close to Speaker— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  So noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will refer to him as 
the person who just finished speaking.  Is that any better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never mind Jesse James or whatever that was.  It is like Homer 
looking after Bart Simpson over there.  We are seeing that on an 
ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the issue that the person who just finished 
speaking brought up.  It is the issue of comments made during the 
election by one of my colleagues, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not interesting to note that when comments are made 
outside of this place there is no legal protection for any 
member?  If the party opposite was so incensed in its rather 
thin skinned approach to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, who was at the time a candidate for re-election for 
the Liberal Party, why did it not simply do something about it? 
The comment was not made under the protection of the House of 
Commons.  That party has access and recourse to the legal system 
if its members feel they have been slandered in some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comment that was made was based on the fact that over the 
years enough things have been said by people purporting to 
represent that party and its predecessor such that an image has 
been created within the broader public in Canada that it attracts 
people with some unusual, perhaps to be kind, fringe ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall during the election campaign having a very fine 
gentleman representing the Alliance Party running against me in 
my riding of Mississauga West.  He was a member of the Chinese 
community, in fact, the president of the Chinese Association of 
Mississauga.  I remember how upset he was at an all candidates 
meeting about the comment that came from one Betty Granger, a 
candidate for that party, who talked about the Asian invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can imagine how my opponent, being of Asian extraction, 
reacted and how he felt in regard to that kind of insensitive 
comment.  That is the problem and that is what the minister, the 
candidate at the time in Thornhill, was referring to.  So if 
those members opposite want to say that she did not have a right 
to make those comments, I beg to differ, and they have a right to 
take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share another example of what is, in my view, unethical 
behaviour, a statement that I am quite prepared to make either in 
this place or outside this place.  I am referring to the current 
Leader of the Opposition who, when a member of the Alberta 
legislature, wrote a letter—he did not say this in the Alberta 
legislature—to the editor slandering a lawyer who was 
representing a person who had been charged, not yet convicted, 
with pedophilia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implication in the letter written by the Leader of the 
Opposition, the implication that people took, was that somehow 
this defence attorney was in support of pedophiles because he had 
the gall to represent someone who had been charged with a 
criminal act.  Do members see the fundamental problem with that? 
He did not say it exactly.  It was implied.  The court seemed to 
agree that the implication was there because it forced the Leader 
of the Opposition into a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Leader of the Opposition was not afraid of having his day 
in court, why did he settle?  I presume he received advice from 
his lawyers who told him he was in deep trouble and that he had 
better cut a deal, settle and get out.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental principle in our justice system is that whether 
we like the charge or not, whether or not in our opinion the 
person is as guilty as we can imagine, it is not up to him and it 
is not up to any one of us to sit in judgment of a fellow citizen 
who has been charged but has not yet had their day in court or 
had an opportunity to present a defence and tell his or her 
story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not seem to matter to the then member of the Alberta 
legislature.  He felt that it was very justifiable, outside of 
the protection of that chamber, to publicly castigate this 
person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about ethics, I think it is indefensible for 
him to make that kind of assertion as someone who has tried to 
stand tall as a member of the Alberta legislature in a very 
important position, who I believe was a minister of labour, who 
certainly was a finance minister, who worked in that 
distinguished position in that distinguished facility and who was 
entrusted with the confidence of the people of his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how anyone, including that particular member, can 
defend it.  It grates on us a bit on this side of the House to 
see someone who actually did that stand here and lecture us about 
ethics.  I do not know that they on that side understand the 
implications of the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he left town and came to Ottawa as the leader of Her 
Majesty's loyal opposition, leaving behind him a bill for the 
taxpayers as a result of the settlement that was made as a result 
of the letter that he wrote.  As a result of the unethical 
practice of castigating a member of the bar in the province of 
Alberta and attacking that person with his personal views, he 
left behind an $800,000 tab for the taxpayers in Alberta to pick 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a former attorney general from Alberta in the House.  I 
find it hard to believe that the hon. gentleman can stand with a 
straight face or can stomach the activity by the person who is 
now his leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give members another example of this holier than thou 
populist prairie preacher who comes into the House of Commons 
pretending to be the new sheriff in town, pretending he is going 
to change the way we do things, this is the fellow— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I strongly object to the 
characterizations of the member opposite, who is known in the 
House for his personal attacks during his speeches.  I ask that 
he withdraw that sarcastic reference to our leader he just 
uttered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  That is not necessarily 
a point of order, but on the other hand I would ask the hon. 
member for Mississauga West to be more judicious in his choice of 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure which one 
of the sarcastic remarks he wants me to withdraw, so it is 
difficult for me to respond to that.  The problem I have is that 
I am only telling the truth so it means that I cannot withdraw 
comments that are based on fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also tell members about comments made by the Leader of 
the Opposition in the election.  He informed the public that the 
seat he was running for had been voluntarily and cheerfully 
vacated by Mr. Jim Hart, who was the member of the day.  He said 
that.  It is in black and white.  We all know he said it and the 
members opposite know he said it, only for us to find out at a 
later date that Mr. Hart was given $50,000 in return for vacating 
his seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it interesting that the member for Wild Rose was quoted 
as saying “Fifty thousand dollars?  That is an awful lot of 
bucks”.  He was pretty upset about that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members who purport to tell us how we should behave in 
government paid off one of their members to open up a safe seat 
for their leader to run in.  I think the Canadian people did 
judge.  I found it interesting when I heard a member opposite, 
one who spoke earlier, say that we need to change this so the 
people of Canada could have confidence in the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has 172 seats in the country, with parliamentarians 
representing every province, every territory and every part of 
the country.  I will admit we are not as strong in some parts of 
the country as we would like, but we clearly have a larger 
majority.  I believe the Canadian people showed their confidence 
in the Prime Minister and in the government.  More important, 
they showed that they were not prepared to entrust the Canadian 
Alliance or any other party with the responsibility of governing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say that it is very difficult for us to accept 
lectures from a party when its deputy leader decides, after 
having railed against gold plated pensions in this place, to 
invest $89,000, magically turn that into a $1 million asset and 
then say that she needs to take care of her family.  The hon. 
member should have thought of that before she came in here with 
the pigs, the buttons and the snorting that went on in the most 
disgusting display that most of us have ever seen in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find out today that a second member, the member for 
Medicine Hat, has invested $50,000 to buy back in.  This is what 
he said in an interview from Ottawa: “I probably cannot square 
it.  We will try to do our best to explain it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I know that in a former life as Deputy Speaker you used to hold 
an awful lot of us to the issue of relevance.  I do not find any 
relevance in what this member is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know that after question period the hon. 
member for Mississauga West will have nine minutes remaining.  I 
am sure he will point out in the course of those nine minutes the 
relevance of the statements he is making to the motion before the 
House dealing with a statement about the ethics commissioner 
being responsible to parliament.  I am sure we will hear from the 
hon. member for Mississauga West as to relevance later this 
afternoon.

learned that the Liberal government in the past couple of years 
has relaxed our customs regulations to the point that they have 
now become an honour system called CANPASS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private aircraft with less than 15 passengers are free to land 
at any airport without customs inspection merely by calling a 
central phone number to report their arrival.  To make matters 
worse, the itineraries of these planes are considered 
confidential information by Nav Can so customs is truly working 
blind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regulations this loose Canada will quickly become the 
number one destination for organized cartels and their smuggling 
of drugs, guns and human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American government is so concerned with Canada's sieve-like 
borders that it is now considering the placement of troops along 
our border.  It has no alternative, since drug cartels can simply 
load up, fly to Canada and distribute south of the border.  Does 
it honestly make sense to the minister of customs that we do not 
search international flights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution is simple.  CANPASS must be scrapped immediately.

the United States it appears that the U.S. will move quickly to 
deploy the nuclear missile defence shield.  It is planning to 
coerce an already gullible foreign affairs minister and an all 
too willing Liberal government into joining them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year my former colleague Mr. Gordon Earle of Halifax West 
stated that a top U.S. defence official was quoted as saying that 
for all practical terms Canada is the 51st state. The nuclear 
missile defence shield program will not only give away more of 
our sovereignty in terms of our defence policy, but it will also 
suck away hundreds of millions of dollars from our already 
financially starved armed forces.  In the end it lead us down the 
path of nuclear missile madness and accelerate the arms race.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are outraged.  The government has so mismanaged the 
heating relief fund that multiple cheques are going to some 
households, prisoners are receiving the rebates and people who do 
not pay for heat are qualifying for heating relief.  Yet 
Canadians who need the assistance to help combat the high cost of 
heating fuel are not receiving these funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the government have administered this program so 
poorly?  Canadian taxpayers do not want to see their money being 
given to people who are not bearing the burden of high heating 
costs.  The government has allowed all GST credit recipients to 
qualify for this relief, at a cost of $1.3 billion.  There is no 
connection between receipt of a GST rebate and entitlement to a 
heating fuel rebate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown once again that it is governing by 
default.  Could the government tell us why some people are 
receiving rebates when they are not paying heating fuel costs? 
All we are asking for here is a bit of common sense.

Speaker, yesterday I asked the Prime Minister about his 
involvement in arranging $2.35 million worth of immigrant 
investor funds for the Auberge Grand-Mère.  I remind the House 
that the auberge had a golf course right next door to it, which 
the Prime Minister owned at the time.  He said there was no 
conflict because the Quebec government administered that fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No such luck. In 1996 brokers decided where those immigrant 
investor funds were spent and the Prime Minister met with those 
brokers.   Why is he denying the link between his meeting and 
those millions? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have explained all that very clearly to everybody.  I 
receive visitors in my office.  I receive all members who want to 
come and have a picture taken in my office.  A group came, took a 
picture, and I never talk to anybody.  I have nobody to take 
notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What surprises me is that for two elections the member was 
telling the people that she was holier than anybody else and that 
she would never accept a pension from anybody.  Now she is 
elected and is entitled to a pension, she changes her mind.  What 
about hypocrisy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  We all want to hear the 
questions as well as the answers.  I invite hon. members to 
restrain themselves while the questions are being put and the 
answers being given.  The restraint must apply to both sides of 
the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I know they changed the ground rules on the pension, 
but we should not be surprised they change it on just about 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Prime Minister just reiterated what he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I receive members of parliament from both sides every day at 3 
o'clock (now it is for photos) and visitors also come to see 
me...We shake hands, discuss things for two or three minutes and 
then they leave.  This visit was of the same nature. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is for photos.  I could only imagine how many the 
millions could have been raised if they had stayed for six 
minutes in his office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister needs to clarify this point.  Did he have 
more than one meeting with the immigrant investors? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I met them.  I never had any other meeting.  I do not 
remember the names of these people.  I saw their picture later 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I meet hundreds of people and I try to be nice with everybody, 
even if the hon. member comes to my office with some of her own 
electors. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
So, Mr. Speaker, here he is.  He did not have relations with 
those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an unbelievable connection here with a meeting that he 
had with a representative of the immigrant investor fund and 
money flowing to the Auberge Grand-Mère.  He could try and 
trivialize it away, but during the election campaign he said “He 
has not invested a damn cent in that”.  Surely he must know who 
he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we now know that $2.35 million was invested and 
funnelled into his own riding.  I am sure the Prime Minister 
would never try to mislead Canadians during an election campaign, 
so why did he deny that that money was ever invested? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister would have no reason to know what the 
immigrant investor fund is investing or not investing.  It is 
administered by the government of Quebec, and the member ought to 
know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is February 8.  As recently as January 29, the ethics

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister consulted the ethics counsellor in January 
1996 to advise that no payment had been received for the Prime 
Minister's shares in the Grand-Mère golf club.  Less than 90 days 
later the Prime Minister intervened with the Business Development 
Bank, lobbying for a loan for the Auberge Grand-Mère which 
adjoins and enhances that golf course. 
With his ownership of the golf club shares still in question, how 
can the Prime Minister possibly claim that there was no conflict 
of interest?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in response to the question raised by the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party, let me read from the letter dated 
January 29, 2000.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My conclusion, on November 21, 2000, was that “the Prime 
Minister, in calling the President of the BDC, did not violate 
any rule which has been established by the Canadian Government in 
terms of Ministers dealing on behalf of constituents with 
government agencies”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor went on to say that the ownership of those 
properties were transferred in 1993 before the now member for 
Shawinigan became Prime Minister of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister is familiar with Mr. Justice Ted Hughes who 
headed the Vander Zalm inquiry in British Columbia.  The Prime 
Minister himself named him to head the APEC inquiry.  He is a man 
of unquestioned integrity and independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister wants this auberge issue settled.  Would he 
agree to name Mr. Justice Ted Hughes to examine all the evidence, 
determine if there has been a conflict of interest in this case 
and report to the House of Commons?  This deserves an answer from 
the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday I questioned the logic behind the Liberal 
government's $500 million low interest loan to Brazil because of 
Brazil's policy to promote its aerospace industry with massive 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance told the House that Brazil never 
exercised that option.  However, page 33 of his department's 
1999-2000 performance report states that Canada did indeed lend 
the money to Brazil and that Brazil paid it back along with $20 
million of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the finance minister talking about an additional loan he was 
making to Brazil, or would he just admit he was wrong? 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the loan that is being raised, in terms of Brazil, on 
behalf of all the countries was made not by individual countries 
but by the Bank for International Settlements.  It is the one 
that provided the loan and a number of G7 countries guaranteed 
parts of the loan.  Canada guaranteed $500 million of that loan. 
The loan was paid back.  The guarantee was never exercised, as I 
said yesterday. 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I guess we should send back the $14 million in interest 
that we received as a result of that loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the finance minister not understand the irony of the 
situation of loaning money to Brazil which allowed them to 
subsidize their aerospace industry to the detriment of Canadian 
companies such as Bombardier? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal bungling may have put Canada on both sides of this trade 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were the Liberals so careless about protecting Canada's 
interests?   Were they too busy playing international boy scout 
to remember their national responsibilities here at home? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would suggest that the hon. member ask his researcher 
to look it up.  The loan was not made by Canada.  The loan was 
made by the Bank for International Settlements.  What Canada did 
was to provide a guarantee, for which we were paid.  The 
guarantee was never exercised.  I said that yesterday and I am 
saying it again today.  That is the fact.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

In this case officials are accused of covering up several cases 
of foreign diplomats smuggling children into Canada, abusing them 
as underpaid embassy domestics and sexually assaulting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister have any evidence of such incidents?   Has he 
asked his officials to investigate these allegations, and if not, 
why not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have asked for an investigation of these allegations. 
I expect it to be part of the report I receive from the

traffic accident, as well as other incidents where diplomatic 
immunity has been sought with respect to incidents that have 
occurred in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the minister for that answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious allegation.  We know that in the past there 
have been diplomats who have engaged in behaviour that has harmed 
Canadian citizens.  This is a different situation.  We are 
talking about people who are not Canadian citizens being abused, 
but nevertheless it is extraordinarily serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister give his assurance to the House that if 
diplomats are found engaging in this kind of activity they will 
be expelled from Canada?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> I would like to be able to finish 
answering the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 241 is very clear on that. The second important element, 
which I have mentioned several times, is that the Minister of 
National Revenue must not get involved in any of the 
investigations that may be conducted by the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there are indeed various ways used by the investigations 
branch to settle all the issues. It goes without saying that a 
number of investigations must be conducted. The hon. member of 
the opposition should look up the Income Tax Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is something interesting about these 
investigations. In a press release issued on January 18, the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency indicated that there is only 
one way to settle a case, that is through voluntary disclosure, 
and this option is only available if there are no investigations 
or proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister explain that the agency for which he is 
responsible is contradicting him by saying that there is either 
voluntary disclosure or else an investigation followed, if 
necessary, by legal proceedings? 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and 
Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the 
Regions of Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, generally speaking we 
look at the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are indeed cases which may involve legal proceedings. Then 
there are other ones that may involve voluntary disclosure. There 
are a number of ways to deal with a file. Each case must be 
examined on its own merit. We must look at the global picture. 
Again, I would refer people, and particularly members of 
parliament, to the Income Tax Act.

on Tuesday the minister of Indian affairs stated that the

January 31 for reportedly contributing to the ongoing deficit 
problems on reserve and that the new managers are insensitive to

<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to work 
with first nation communities across the country in a situation 
where there is a deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not new to any government in Canada to have a deficit. 
What we do is we work to build capacity in those communities in 
order to put the administrative finances in proper order. We are 
doing that in Sagkeeng.  We do that in other communities. We are 
working very closely with them to build the capacity to run good, 
solid governments and to deliver services to their community 
members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to hear this response, but the Sagkeeng 
band of Manitoba has much to be financially accountable for. 
Band members have formally questioned the sincerity of the chief 
and council over a new school project.  The general contractor 
has been forced into bankruptcy due to unpaid bills on this 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general confirmed on Tuesday that Indian affairs has 
a poor educational funding record.  Third party managers do 
little to address past wrongs.

<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the issues that we 
confront on a daily basis is the fact that first nation 
communities have the fastest growing population in all of Canada. 
With that comes a lot of financial issues and a lot of stress on 
the department of Indian affairs to keep up the building of 
schools right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would look, it is a well known fact that this 
department spends some $140 million a year in capital projects, 
many of them involving the building of new schools.  We are

all across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, several senior health bureaucrats, including the 
assistant deputy minister, knew beforehand that last fall 70 
staff members from the federally funded Fontaine Foundation were 
going on an all expense paid Caribbean cruise.  It is not the 
first trip members of this foundation have taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister waited for this issue to become public 
before trying to save his political face by calling for an audit. 
The foundation was flagged for mismanagement for many years.  How 
high does the mismanagement go within his own department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my senior officials assure me they were not aware in advance of 
this cruise that there was any suggestion public funds were being 
used for it.  At no time did they give authorization or approve 
the use of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows the very day that news became public I directed 
the forensic audit.  We subsequently went to court to ensure that 
all public moneys were traced fully.  I have given my assurance 
to the House, which I repeat now, that we will not rest until we 
trace every dollar and account for it publicly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am assured of that.  The minister said he would call 
an audit and get to the bottom of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday it was revealed in court that there may be no books to 
audit.  The minister's own auditors knew that there were 
irregularities in the Fontaine Foundation books back as far as 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been six years, $37 million, over 70 vacations, and 
several audits later.  How much longer will it be before the 
minister takes responsibility for mismanagement within his own 
department?  How much longer will he take? 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is apparent even from the question put by the member that we 
are now doing everything possible to ensure that all documents 
are examined and all moneys are traced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That effort will continue.  We will do what is required to 
ensure the public money is accounted for to the public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
we learned that Air Canada is currently surveying passengers on 
its regional flights in the west as to whether they prefer 
service in English or in French.  In this way, Air Canada hopes 
to get out of its obligation to provide services in French if at 
least 5% of its clientele demand services in both official 
languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister tell this House whether this 5% figure is 
the one he had in mind when he introduced in the throne speech 
the concept of “sustainable minority community”?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with the air industry restructuring legislation, our

its subsidiaries in all regions of Canada provide services in 
both official language, where demand warrants under the terms of

commitments with respect to the use of French on its flights in 
Canada, but, with its government approved monopoly in Canada, is 
severely cutting back its regional service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Transport tolerate the behaviour of Air 
Canada, which is literally destroying regional air service, as 
was the case in November, with the Baie-Comeau—Quebec City link?

in municipal taxes owed to them by the Burns Lake Indian Band.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To help this along the minister appears to be ready to spend an

same services that are now offered to the band for which they 
have not paid their back taxes and refuse to pay any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an urgent situation.  Will the minister meet with the 
mayor of Burns Lake and his officials on an urgent basis within 
the next two to three weeks to get this impasse resolved? 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

that I would. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is not exactly correct.  In fact 
the minister told me that he would be willing to meet with the 
mayor and his officials in a month or so.  A month or so is not 
good enough, because water and sewer services to the band will be 
cut off at the end of March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is prepared to spend about $10 million over the 
next five years to duplicate these services for a 59 person band 
rather than try to solve the current problem immediately like he 
should be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian

Veterans Affairs.  In 1975 the government's task force said that 
it owed money on interest it had held in trust for disabled vets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in 1985-86 the auditor general gave the same warning, but 
in 1990, rather than listening, the government passed a law 
saying that veterans could not sue for the money owed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year a judge said the government's law was illegal, but 
rather than act in the best interest of disabled vets the 
government has appealed the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister now do the right thing and return the money 
owed to the vets, or will he drag this issue through the courts 
indefinitely? 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain for his question.  The fact of the matter 
is that the decision of the lower court in what is known as the 
Authorson class action has implications for the operations of the 
Canadian government.  That is why the government has appealed the 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact yesterday the department filed its appeal papers with 
the Ontario Court of Appeal.  To comment further on a matter 
before the courts would be inappropriate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, rather than correct a past injustice 
the government is dragging this issue through the courts and we 
wonder for how long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is quite right that in October the Ontario Court of 
Appeal said that the government was wrong and that what it had 
done was illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts say that the government owes these vets money.  Will 
the minister now do the honourable thing, drop the appeal and 
negotiate with the vets?  Will he do the right thing and do it 
now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member knows 
that a decision of a lower court is not a final determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the appeal process has been exhausted there will be no 
final determination.  Again I repeat that until that is done it 
is inappropriate to comment.

Most people today understand that the first years in a child's

</I></B></P><P align=left>The network will be made up of research centres at the

<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before I call orders of the day, I wish 
to deliver to the House my ruling on the point of order raised 
earlier this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now ready to rule on the point of order raised by the hon. 
House leader of the official opposition, the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley, concerning the procedural acceptability of the 
subamendment proposed by the hon. government House leader on the 
amendment to the opposition day motion concerning the ethics 
counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the hon. opposition House leader, the hon. House 
leaders of the Progressive Conservative and New Democratic 
Parties, the hon. whip of the Bloc Quebecois, and the many other 
members who sought to assist the Chair on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair has considered the interventions made on either side 
of the argument.  As I said earlier in my remarks this morning, 
as a former practitioner of the art of dealing with opposition 
days, drafting motions and amendments from either side of the 
House, I have considerable sympathy for the point of view 
expressed on either side of the issue in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little doubt that the authorities are clear on the 
nature of opposition days.  In the oft quoted words of Mr. 
Speaker Lamoureux on March 16, 1971: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—when...opposition parties agree as to...a subject on a 
particular day, the spirit of fair play would require that the 
day should not be taken away by means of an amendment. 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it says on page 727 of <I>House of Commons Procedure and 
Practice</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments which have the effect of providing the basis for an 
entirely different debate are not in order. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Standing Order 85 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one amendment and one subamendment may be made to a motion 
proposed in the Budget Debate or to a motion proposed under an 
Order of the Day for the consideration of the business of supply 
on an allotted day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a review of our practice in this regard indicates that 
deftly worded amendments can and have been used to render 
opposition motions more palatable to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, on February 12, 1992, on a motion regarding a final 
GATT accord that was phrased “to call on the government to 
support unequivocally” any final GATT accord, an amendment was 
proposed to replace those words with the words “supports the 
government's efforts toward reaching”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 7, 1994, when the House debated a lengthy opposition 
motion that began “That this House strongly affirm and support 
the desire of Canadians to remain federally united as one 
people” and went on for eight lines describing the terms of such 
union, an amendment was deemed acceptable that deleted all the 
words after “Canadians to” and substituted simply “continue to 
live together in a federal system”.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the closest to the situation we face today is a 
precedent from October 28, 1997, where an opposition motion 
calling upon the government “to establish a comprehensive 
national fisheries policy” was amended to delete the word 
“establish” and substitute the words “continue the 
implementation of”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the situation that concerns us today does not involve 
an amendment, but rather a subamendment.  Once again, 
Marleau-Montpetit is very useful, because it states, on page 454: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sub-amendments must be strictly relevant to the amendment and 
seek to modify the amendment, not the original question; they 
cannot enlarge on the amendment, introduce new matters foreign to 
the amendment or differ in substance from the amendment. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The restrictions on subamendments are therefore severe.  Indeed 
a student of the evolution of House procedures might well suggest 
that the current practice, where the mover of an opposition day 
motion splits his or her time to allow another party member to 
move a single word amendment, was in fact developed in order to 
thwart the proposing of amendments that would transmogrify the 
original opposition motions into propositions acceptable to the 
government.  The possibilities for amending a single word 
subamendment are by their nature extremely limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such, I believe, is the case before us today where the 
government House leader has made a valiant, though not 
successful, attempt to propose a subamendment.  I must conclude 
that the proposed subamendment does not modify or refine the 
amendment but seeks rather to amend the original question. 
Accordingly the subamendment is not in order and cannot be put to 
the House.

was raised by an opposition member questioning the relevance of 
my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to spend the entire nine minutes reiterating what 
I said, but I was pointing out that some questions of ethics were 
coming from the other side.  Notably there was one from the 
leader with regard to his lawsuit and the $800,000 bill that he 
left foisted upon the taxpayers of Alberta.  Also there was the 
$50,000 payout to Jim Hart to free up a seat so that the hon. 
Leader of the Opposition could run, after that individual said 
Mr. Hart left voluntarily, voluntarily with his pockets bulging 
with money I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also question the fact that, contrary to the public statements 
two members made in the past castigating the pension plan, they 
decided to reinvest $89,000 for Edmonton North and $50,000 for 
Medicine Hat into the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relevance of all of that is quite clear to me and I think to 
taxpayers.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say that 
they will bring a new attitude to parliament somehow, that the 
pension is awful, and then buy back in and create a million 
dollar asset for themselves. They cannot say that they are 
prepared to deny an individual charged under the laws of this 
land his due right to defence in law and then duck the bill when 
it comes in as a result of a slander charge.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the relevance here is that we do not need lectures 
from opposition members about ethics.  They have shown no 
character, no moral fibre, no ability to stand behind the words 
they have uttered for pure crass political advantage on their 
part.  They have misled the Canadian public by coming into the 
House holier than thou and saying parliament needs to appoint an 
ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot in parliamentary terms use words like hypocrisy, so I 
will not.  However the things members opposite have said in 
public and with their own constituents border on questionable 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a little about the ethics counsellor.  The ethics 
counsellor has upon request appeared in the past before 
parliamentary committees.  Is it reasonable to assume that is the 
method that would be used for any official to answer to 
parliament?  Do we expect the ethics counsellor, or any other 
official, would be allowed to walk into the House and answer?  I 
do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the normal course of business we would expect any official 
appointed either by the Prime Minister or by the governor in 
council, with a job to do which relates to public business, would 
appear upon request before a parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is puzzling to me how opposition members can stand in their 
places, in spite of the litany of unethical activities that have 
occurred within their own ranks, and say that the ethics 
counsellor does not report to parliament.  Of course he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the fifth party, the former prime minister, wrote 
a letter asking for action and investigation on certain subjects. 
He received a response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign the Prime Minister did not duck the 
issue.  When accused of having done something wrong he asked the 
ethics counsellor to report immediately, unlike the Leader of the 
Opposition who asked that his court date regarding slander 
charges against him be conveniently deferred until after the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Prime Minister said to the ethics counsellor “Here are the 
allegations.  Yes, I am in the middle of an election campaign.  I 
want you to report now.  I am not afraid of anything.  I am not 
prepared to hide, duck and run like the Leader of the 
Opposition”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor wrote the letter which says that there was 
no conflict or wrongdoing.  It puzzles me, although I guess it 
should not, how the opposition has interpreted what he said.  The 
counsellor has examined the issue at least twice and reported as 
such.  He has done so in a letter released publicly.  Is that not 
accountable to the place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To then turn it around is the game that is played.  This is not 
about the ethics counsellor.  Opposition members are still bitter 
about what happened in the election.  They cannot believe it. 
They are still in shock.  They think the Canadian people made a 
mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been on both sides of electoral activity.  I have won and 
lost in 11 election campaigns.  I lost three and won the rest.  I 
believe that in every one of those eleven campaigns the voters 
were right.  When they make a decision that they do not want an 
individual around again that is their right.  The voters are 
never wrong.  I do not care if members like it.  I do not care if 
they think it is unfair.  The voters are always right.  It is a 
clear message in a democracy.  They have the authority and only 
they have the authority to make those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens?  We come back here again.  We have five parties in 
this place.  We have 172 seats.  We have a resounding majority. 
We have representatives from sea to sea to sea.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is elected for the third successive majority 
government and what happens?   Not even two weeks past the 
opening of parliament and the Prime Minister is attacked every 
day.  They get into the gutter.  They accuse.  It is personal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard questions about issues other than a few from 
the backbenches.  The frontbenches of the opposition parties seem 
bent on personal assassination and destruction of one of the 
greatest parliamentarians the House has ever seen.  Like him or 
not, the man's credentials are impeccable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they cannot deal with the issues and realize the people 
have shown confidence in the government, what can they do?  The 
only thing left to do is to get personal.  That is sad.  It 
frankly shows a lack of depth, a lack of ethics and a lack of 
moral fortitude within the ranks of the opposition that is quite 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever I talk in the House I get an e-mail from someone in 
Vancouver who gets upset, bent out of shape and tells me what a 
terrible person I am because I say these things.  Let us be 
clear.  The games played in this place are for nothing more than 
political advantage.  They have nothing to do with good 
governance.  They have nothing to do with representing individual 
constituencies when we get into this kind of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite know that full well.  They have even said it. I 
could read quote after quote about the ethics counsellor from 
members opposite.  Even today one member opposite stood in the 
House and said “I am not talking about the individual; he is an 
honourable person”.  The opposition House leader at one point 
accused him of being a barking dog, which was most unfortunate. 
Then some of his colleagues stood and said it was not true and 
that they thought he was an honourable gentleman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are trying to portray the ethics counsellor as an appointee 
of the Prime Minister who only talks to the Prime Minister, even 
though he has appeared before a legislative committee and 
answered in a public letter all accusations and charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members should be ashamed of themselves.  Instead of 
harping on personal attacks against the Prime Minister, why do 
they not look at the agenda and deal with things that Canadians 
care about like health care and education and EI reform?  Let us 
deal with substantive issues that make Canada the greatest 
country in the world, and let us try to make it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to be so fervent about it, but it is a disgraceful 
display by opposition members and a waste of a parliamentary day 
at great cost to the taxpayer.  They have no business pointing 
the finger at this side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, speaking of moral fortitude, I am rather surprised 
at the member because he should know, with respect to the leader 
of the Canadian Alliance, that the reason it was decided the case 
would not go to court is best known to himself.  A judge made the 
determination that no jury would be allowed.  That is absolutely 
unprecedented in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that almost $500,000 was spent to that point by the 
government of Alberta.  It then recommended that the Leader of 
the Opposition not go to court because he obviously would not 
have a fair opportunity to present his case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also know that the independent ethics 
commissioner in Alberta, who answers to the legislature, 
instructed the leader of the Canadian Alliance when he was the 
Alberta finance minister that he could not raise independent 
funds and was to see the case through with this method of 
payment.  The member knows that, and I am surprised he said 
things that were simply not true in his earlier statement before 
question period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is:  What is wrong with asking 
the Liberals to live up to their red book promise of 1993?  What 
is wrong with the words that the Liberals put in their red book 
and that the Prime Minister said they would be following through 
on at every opportunity they had?  Why does the Prime Minister 
choose to hold himself and his cabinet ministers to a lower 
standard than the premiers of Alberta, British Columbia and 
Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand this.  Perhaps the member can help me with 
this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I highly doubt that I 
would be successful at helping the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has appointed an ethics counsellor— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Not independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B> —an independent ethics counsellor who 
has reported to a parliamentary committee and has written letters 
that have been made public.  I do not know exactly what the hon. 
member wants, other than to portray this as something it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to the member's remarks with regard to his leader's 
shameful position, I want to point out that the former speaker of 
the Alberta legislature, who happens to be a former colleague of 
the Leader of the Opposition, is issuing a court challenge as of 
9 o'clock this morning mountain standard time wherein he claims 
it was not only unethical but also contrary to the rules of the 
Alberta legislature that taxpayer funds were used to settle the 
Alliance leader's defamation lawsuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member can give me all the justification he likes for 
that decision, but the Leader of the Opposition should pay the 
$800,000 that he generated because of his shameful activity.  He 
could have settled the case earlier for $60,000 but refused to do 
so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you for your wisdom in your first 
official ruling from the chair.  It certainly breathes new hope 
and aspirations for your humble servants in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to hon. members on both sides of the House trade 
barbs and attack each other's leaders.  Fortunately in the 
Progressive Conservative Party we do not have to defend the 
ethical standard set by the right hon. member for Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn back to the matter at hand, the matter of an ethics 
counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, stripping away the rhetoric and passion that he brings to 
the debate, does the hon. member opposite not agree that it would 
be in the interest of Canadians to have the ethics counsellor 
report to parliament and to have an impartial committee of the 
House determine the appropriateness of the ethics counsellor so 
that there would be no question as to the person's arm's length 
attachment to any member, be it the Prime Minister or any member 
of this House who might be questioned about their behaviour? 
Would it also not benefit this Chamber, this institution, this 
parliament to allow all members of the House to have input on the 
appointment of that person? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, would it also not benefit the credibility of that 
individual, after going through that process of selection, to 
report directly to parliament and not to the Prime Minister or 
the cabinet or the executive branch? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not also benefit the ethics counsellor's credibility to 
not appear after the fact before a committee, which is what has 
happened in this instance, and not to leak out in dribs and drabs 
correspondence and information that might have been exchanged 
between the PMO and this person? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would Canadians not benefit if the government simply lived up to 
its red book promises?  We know commitments have been broken.  We 
can talk about that ad nauseam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not agree that this is a preferred option, 
which is the intent of this particular motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish for his usual ability to bring some calm back 
to the debate.  I accept that he is sincere, unlike the official 
opposition.  However, I would say to the hon. gentleman that Mr. 
Wilson was appointed after consultation with leaders of the 
parties in the House. 
I think it would be unfortunate to call into doubt the integrity 
of Mr. Wilson, which I do not think was the member's direct 
intent.  It certainly could be construed as such, but I am sure 
he would not want to do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was agreement that he was an acceptable candidate, an 
acceptable person to act as an ethics counsellor.  It is quite 
standard, if we look at all of the agencies where individuals are 
appointed by the Prime Minister and by order in council, to have 
them appear before a committee to defend their actions and to 
answer for their department.  That was exactly what happened 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling by Mr. Wilson was clear when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me answer that, sir, by saying that it's my view that Mr. 
Chrétien does not have an interest in this matter.  He sold his 
interest.  He sold it.  According to his lawyer, this is an 
unsecured sale.  In other words, the only way he's going to be 
able to recover payment is either to take the individual in 
question to court or, as is now happening, try to organize a way 
by which the payment will be made. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has investigated it.  He has ruled.  He has been clear that 
if we were unhappy with it then we should go to committee and put 
a motion to call him before the committee and question him just 
as we would do for any other official. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is accountability to parliament through the processes in 
place, and the member knows that full well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am always interested in hearing what my colleague 
from Mississauga West has to say.  Although he may engage in 
nuclear rhetorical warfare at times, he does have some positive 
things to say.  I am not sure that this is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to rebut a couple of the comments he made.  One of 
them had to do with his interpretation of consultation.  It is my 
understanding that when he talks about consultation, what it 
means is that the House leader or the member of the government 
phones the other House leaders and says to them that this is the 
person they are appointing.  That is the definition of this type 
of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree with his House leader who said earlier 
today that the ethics counsellor does report to parliament? Would 
he agree with me that it is clearly the case the ethics 
counsellor does not report to parliament on matters having to do 
with the minister or the Prime Minister in terms of all the 
details of that investigation?  Would he agree with that comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Leader of the 
Opposition would like to recant the consultation and the 
consultative agreement that was made to appoint Mr. Wilson, I 
would invite the member to go to his leader and have him do that 
either in the House or in a letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he does not like it now then he is trying to turn the tables. 
If the consultation took place and the leaders agreed to the 
appointment, it is a little tiring to hear the complaint.  It is 
quite obvious what they do not like.  They do not like the 
conclusion that Mr. Wilson arrived at, or they would not have the 
motion on the floor and they would not be consistently trying to 
attack and personally assassinate the character of the Prime 
Minister during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all this is about.  They cannot get their teeth into any 
of the programs the government is putting forward for the 
betterment of Canadians, including tax cuts and reinvesting in 
health care, so they attack personalities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the 
motion.  I will be splitting my time with my hon. friend and 
colleague from Saanich—Gulf Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about ethics and credibility.  We should ask 
ourselves whether or not we truly have credibility in the eyes of 
the public.  That is what we are dealing with today.  That is why 
my party has put a motion today on the floor of the House for 
which there should be widespread agreement because it comes from 
the Liberal 1992 red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It stated that the Liberal government would appoint an 
independent ethics counsellor to advise both public officials and 
lobbyists in the day to day application of the code of conduct 
for public officials. 
The ethics counsellor would be appointed after consultation with 
the leaders of all parties in the House of Commons and would 
report directly to parliament.  We are putting the motion forward 
today because the government has not done this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard time and time again the cry of why there are not 
more ethics in parliament.  Why do we not have a system of 
accountability in parliament?  We have heard from the auditor 
general, Mr. Denis Desautels, eloquent interventions to the House 
on why we need ethics in the way we engage in governance today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He despaired again this week of the absence of ethical decision 
making in the way in which we engage in governance.  He 
repeatedly made reference to the willy-nilly spending on the part 
of government bureaucracies, with little or no accountability and 
little thought as to why or where these moneys were being spent. 
He said that underlying all this was the absence of a culture of 
ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A culture of ethics would only come from those who practise 
ethical leadership.  Some may wonder why we should have ethical 
leadership.  In the application of ethical leadership we develop 
a system or a structure beneath us that engages in ethical 
behaviours because their behaviours are patterned on the moral 
ethical behaviour they see.  That is what all this is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the large flaws and mistakes that occur are based in 
errors in ethics.  My party and other parties have repeatedly 
raised examples in this regard.  We saw it in the HRD scandal. 
The auditor general echoed that gross abject failures in the 
spending of the public's money and violations of the public trust 
took place time and time again because there was a lack of ethics 
ingrained into the culture of that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure that everyone understands there are many 
good people in the public service who are working hard to do the 
best they can, but in the cases we brought forward there was an 
absence of ethical leadership within the organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the department of aboriginal affairs we saw an absence of 
ethical leadership in the application of moneys that should be 
going to those people who are most in need.  My party and members 
out there in the aboriginal community are becoming more vocal 
because the moneys are not going to the hard edge of helping 
these people who are most in need in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people have some of the worst health care parameters, 
the worst housing circumstances, the greatest unemployment, the 
highest maternal mortality, the highest infant morbidity, and the 
highest infant mortality statistics in Canada, as a direct result 
of the absence of ethical leadership at the highest levels of the 
department and an absence of appropriate spending of those moneys 
for the benefit of those people most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister would very much like to see that those 
moneys are spent wisely.  I know the members that he serves would 
like to see it spent wisely.  However, if there is an absence of 
ethical leadership, these problems will not be addressed and the 
culture that supports the absence of ethical behaviour will not 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why my party and the government have said that we need 
an ethics counsellor that reports to the House, an ethics 
counsellor that reports publicly to the people who pay the bills 
of the House and pay that person's salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to hear what the government proposed.  It 
proposed the ethics counsellor as I mentioned before.  It 
proposed an ethical review of government contracts and ethical 
government advertising. The government House leader said that 
there should be established within the House of Commons a 
non-partisan nomination confirmation procedure for order in 
council appointments such as officers of the House and that the 
committee reviewing the procedure should have a veto power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were able to do this and if it were supported by an ethics 
counsellor, the public would have a greater faith in what we do. 
Our House leader and many other members of my party have put 
forth ideas on how we could reform parliament. 
Why?  Because, if we do not have parliamentary reform, if we do 
not democratize the House, which has become a veritable 
dictatorship, then we will not be able to engender the faith of 
the public.  We will not be able to engage, invigorate and 
stimulate the public in the decisions that take place in the 
House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know there are members from across party lines that share 
the utter frustration of living in the other virtual democracy 
that we have today.  The proof of the pudding can be found in the 
behaviour of the public during elections.  As we saw in the last 
election, fewer and fewer Canadians are actually voting.  They do 
not seem to think there is any relevance to the process of 
voting.  They feel disempowered, disaffected, disinterested and 
not engaged in the House and, to a large extent, they are 
absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were able to engage in the parliamentary reforms that my 
party has put forth, that indeed the government House leader put 
forth when his party was in opposition and that members of 
cabinet put forth when their party was in opposition, then we 
could make the House a democracy, a vibrant place where ideas 
could be thought over, constructive ideas could be battled over 
and at the end of the day we would have action on the big 
problems that affect all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of free votes in the House of Commons, I am pleased 
to hear that the government House leader mentioned electronic 
voting.  It is about time.  How about making committees more 
responsive to the public and less responsive to the Prime 
Minister and the minister at hand?   How about removing the 
parliamentary secretaries from all committee structure?  How 
about bringing government bills in draft form to committee?  It 
is what is being done in England.  Westminster is engaged in the 
same process as we are and is frustrated by the lack of democracy 
and accountability that exists.  Its system is far more 
democratic than ours but its members are apoplectic at their lack 
of power to represent their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public has moved from anger to disinterest to apathy over 
this House.  What a profound tragedy to have in the House the 
amazing potential that exists with all members across party 
lines, that we cannot employ their talents and use their ideas in 
the House and in committee.  We could apply those ideas, as the 
previous speaker from the government side said, to the big issues 
of health care, economics, social program renewal, demographic 
changes that affect us, aboriginal affairs and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I suspect all members find greatly 
disheartening is to sit in committees and hear wonderful ideas 
come from members of the public, ideas that if employed would 
have a positive impact upon the lives of Canadians.  However, we 
know in our hearts that those ideas will be put into a document 
that will be put on a shelf to collect dust forevermore.  Maybe a 
few years down the line the government of the day will see fit to 
study the issue once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the action?  We need an ethics counsellor to keep all 
of us on our toes.  We need an ethics counsellor who has the 
power of reporting like the auditor general does.  We need to be 
held to account to act on what we have been tasked to do.  If we 
do that, we will have a positive effect on the lives of Canadians 
and all of us in the House will be a much happier lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day the public would be very interested to 
know that the House is a demoralized House.  The House is 
yearning for change.  The House is yearning to apply the skills 
and talents of the people in the House and the skills and talents 
of the people in the public to come to bear on the problems that 
we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We beg and plead for the government to live up to its red book 
promise that said we need an ethics counsellor, to live up to its 
promise of democratizing the House and reforming parliament, not 
to give lip service to it, but to truly make the fundamental 
changes that will not damage its power nor its ability to shine 
in the public but that would strengthen its position and the 
position of all members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with a lot of interest to the 
speech across the way.  The member talked about ethics and 
credibility.  I am 100% in support of what he said but I have a 
question for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are not quite three months after the election and 
just recently two of his colleagues, the member for Edmonton 
North and the member for Medicine Hat said they would be taking 
the pension.  However, in the last three elections they campaigned 
against taking a pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How fair is that to the voters in those two ridings who listened 
to these two individuals at all candidates debates say they would 
not take a pension?  Then, less than three months after the 
election they reversed their decisions.  That is the party that 
talks about recall.  Should ethics not demand that those members 
voluntarily put themselves forward for recall and that a 
byelection be called in their ridings to give the voters a chance 
to vote on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us talk about some 
truth on the issue of pensions.  I am glad the member brought it 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when we were elected in 1993 our position was to have 
parity with the public service.  Second, when we were elected in 
1993, the MP pension was far more lucrative than it is today. 
Why?  The then Reform Party brought up solutions and forced the 
government to change the pensions so that there would be no more 
double dipping and MPs could not receive a pension when they left 
after six years.  Now MPs receive the pension after the age of 55 
and the pension is far less lucrative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this party did.  It would have never happened if 
the Reform Party had not come on the scene.  We are looking for 
equality and parity with the public service.  We have pushed the 
government far along those ways and we have a lot of which to be 
proud. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I want 
to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election as 
Speaker of the House of Commons.  I am satisfied, based on what 
you said concerning a government motion, that we will have a 
very good Speaker of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a question to my colleague in the Canadian 
Alliance. 
I am finding that, at the moment, the members of the Liberal 
Party are arrogantly trying to cloud the issue, instead of 
debating the text of the motion taken from their 1993 red book. 
Our Liberal colleague who asked a question before me 
surprisingly spoke of pensions, after the Canadian Alliance 
members accepted pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an ethics counsellor.  We are not concerned 
with the person who is the ethics counsellor, but rather the 
rules that should be set in order to give this counsellor real 
powers under the authority of parliament or of the leaders of 
the political parties.  At the moment, the Prime Minister makes 
the appointment, with his rules, and is the one to whom the 
counsellor is accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague in the Canadian Alliance how 
his party's motion, a verbatim copy of the 1993 Liberal Party 
red book, should be understood and accepted so that we may 
proceed with real parliamentary reform? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, absolutely, this 
particular motion comes directly from the government's red book. 
It is a promise the government made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the government's position in the Liberal red book. 
The simple question we are asking is why has it not implemented 
the promise for an independent ethics counsellor.  It is that 
simple. 
We are also saying to the government that it has widespread 
agreement on all party lines on its promise to have an ethics 
counsellor.  Why has it not implemented an ethics counsellor?  I 
do not know why that is.  That is why we are asking these 
questions.  Not one member of the government has stood up today 
and given us one rational answer as to why they have not 
implemented their original promise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I too would like to commend you on your decision.  I 
was very pleased to see that and hear the reasons for your 
decision.  We look forward to your speakership over many years to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate we are having today is all about one word.  It is 
about ethics.  I listened to the Liberal members.  I hope they 
will take this in all sincerity.  It is time we start to bring 
about changes to the House for the betterment of all Canadians 
and for all members, not just the members on this side.  We do 
need to make changes and they know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is far too much power surrounding the office of the prime 
minister which has evolved over the years.  It has grown and 
grown and has got stronger and stronger, even more so since the 
Liberals took power.  It is time we changed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a House of 301 members.  We are not all utilized in the 
House.  There are great ideas that we bring forward from our 
constituents.  When I was first elected to the fisheries 
committee in 1997, we wrote unanimous reports.  Those reports are 
now collecting dust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is a small step that we can bring forward for a 
positive change.  It is a change that one would think the 
government would be open to, particularly as the Liberal red book 
of 1993 said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will appoint an independent Ethics 
Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the 
day-to-day application of the Code of Conduct for Public 
Officials.  The Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after 
consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House of 
Commons and will report directly to Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key is reporting directly to parliament to ensure that we 
have openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard some members say a few minutes ago that there were 
consultations with the leaders of all parties on the appointment 
of the ethics counsellor, Mr. Wilson, and I am sure is a man of 
integrity.  At that time, it was the Reform Party and the member 
for Calgary Southeast was the leader.  I spoke to him about 
the consultation.  He described the consultation as being a phone 
call from the Prime Minister who said Mr. Wilson was being 
appointed as the ethics counsellor.  We have seen that time and 
time again from the executive of the government.  Its idea of 
consultation is to tell us what it is going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about partisanship, and how dare the 
official opposition bring this motion forward.  It says it is 
trickery and all of that.  I point out that there are five 
official parties in the House of Commons and that the Canadian 
Alliance, the Bloc, the Progressive Conservative Party and the 
New Democratic Party are all united on this motion.  They just 
happen to be all in opposition.  All of these parties agree that 
this is very important and that it is the right thing to do. Some 
of the speeches I listened were quite passionate about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal Party was in opposition there is no question that 
it too would agree with this.  Let me give you some quotes from 
when it was in opposition.  On February 17, 1993, the government 
House leader moved the following motion:: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for its continued failure 
to establish and to adhere to a clear and high standard of public 
sector ethics, for its incessant inability to function within the 
framework of existing legislation, guidelines and standards, and 
for its reluctance to bring forward strict new codes and 
legislation with regard to conflicts and other public ethic 
matters

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister was the leader of the opposition, he 
said “In order to achieve this agenda's integrity and public 
trust in the institutions of government are essential”.  He went 
on about the word trust.  Right now we have an ethics counsellor 
who does not report to parliament.  He reports in secrecy to the 
Prime Minister.  There is no openness.  There is no transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless all 301 members of the House have the courage to stand up 
and start doing what is right and start bringing about changes to 
this institution, the public's perception of this institution 
will continue to decline.  We can change that if we want to want 
to bring back meaningful debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday the Board of Internal Economy will be voting on 
whether the committee chairs should be voted in by secret ballot. 
There is another opportunity for government members who sit on 
that board to do what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the backbenchers step outside this door, when they are not 
on the record, they tell us all the time that yes, we need 
changes.  They say they would like to have some influence with 
the government.  Many of the government members will argue that 
they have less influence than the members of the opposition. 
Again, it is time that we start earning respect.  We will earn 
that respect only if we have the courage to bring about these 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward the Canadian Alliance was drafted by the 
Liberal Party.  I know it was drafted before the Liberal Party 
was elected to government.  It was a 1993 election promise which 
they have not fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ought to emphasize that, setting patronage aside, the four 
opposition parties passionately want to see this happen.  It is 
time that the members on the other side have the courage to do 
what is right so that they can look at themselves in the mirror. 
It is time they start bringing about changes to this institution. 
It is essential that we do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the one member from the government, the new 
member for Vancouver Quadra.  I do not know if someone from the 
House leader's office has got to the new member yet and rapped 
his knuckles, but he had the courage to speak out and do the 
right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new member for Vancouver Quadra, the former ombudsman for 
British Columbia, was asked about this very issue on the weekend. 
Again, I would like to commend Vaughn Palmer from the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I> for writing about this and bringing it to the attention 
of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the Liberal member for Vancouver Quadra.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We've led the country in conflict-of-interest legislation.  Our 
special prosecutor legislation is unique in Canada and in the 
Commonwealth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them is the conflict-of-interest commissioner who is a 
legislature officer rather than part of the executive of the 
government and therefore independent of the executive. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not so in the federal parliament.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We've gained good experience, proud experience and the federal 
government may want to look at that. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the Liberal member for Vancouver Quadra who was putting 
forward positive ideas that were absolutely in sync with this 
motion.  I have to say that the member was completely open and 
forthright.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked about the Prime Minister lobbying the federal 
business development bank three times on behalf of a constituent, 
the member said he was not comfortable with what happened with 
the Prime Minister and the federal business development bank. 
The member said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I don't think any of us should be comfortable with the confusion 
and the public unease that it has caused.  This is something 
we've learned earlier in B.C., that you need to make the rules 
very explicit, that you need to make the review processes very 
transparent and independent.  I think this is something I can 
take with experience to Ottawa. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me sum up.  We have to earn the trust and confidence of 
every Canadian and they want to see changes.  We can make this 
institution so much more effective.  We can utilize the talents 
of all 301 members from all sides of the House if we have the 
courage to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday the government members will have the opportunity to 
vote on their own idea, their own motion that they drafted back 
in 1993.  I hope they will have the courage to do what is right 
and start taking the first baby steps toward bringing positive 
changes back to this institution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
had an opportunity to look at the transcript of the ethics 
counsellor's appearance before the industry committee in the last 
parliament, which I think would be useful as a preamble here.  It 
states that the provisions of the conflict of interest code 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>apply to members of the cabinet, parliamentary secretaries, 
spouses and dependent children, members of ministers' political 
staff, and essentially all full-time Governor-in-Council 
appointees—in other words, the senior members of the executive 
branch of government.  This involves approximately 1,200 persons, 
with another 1,900 part-time appointees subject to the principles 
of the code. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, the code does not apply to other members 
of parliament or to senators.  I think it is a very important 
point, because both the last speaker and the previous speaker 
talked about how we need this ethics counsellor so that we can be 
kept on our toes.  In fact it is not applicable to MPs.  It opens 
up quite a different question if that is what the member is 
proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my question to the member would be maybe more 
fundamental.  Could the member advise the House what it is 
members of parliament would be able to do if the ethics 
counsellor reported through a reporting system and a committee 
that they cannot do today under the current arrangement?  What 
exactly can they not do today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me take the questions in 
order.  First of all with respect to the point that opposition 
members and backbench government members do not come under the 
purview of the ethics counsellor, I agree with the member. 
Absolutely we should.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I agree 
100%.  Right now the power is surrounded, in the Prime Minister 
and the executive.  The member is quite right and I would support 
that.  It would be another positive step that all members should 
be made accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his second question about what we cannot do now, the ethics 
counsellor reports only to the Prime Minister.  We cannot get 
those reports.  They go only to the Prime Minister.  They do not 
go to all members of parliament.  They are not tabled in the 
House.  That is what would change.  If we had that openness, that 
transparency, that total public scrutiny, it would hold all 
people to a much higher level of standards.  I believe it would 
probably lead to keeping some of them a whole lot more honest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the previous speaker.  I 
know he is very sincere in his remarks and he brings the 
appropriate tone to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He began his remarks by speaking of the main issue being ethics. 
I think the majority of people who have participated in the 
debate would certainly agree.  However, there has to be 
credibility behind those asking the questions as well.  There has 
to be an element of accountability. 
That is to say that a person is on solid ground when he or she is 
asking the questions or, in this instance, that when the ethics 
counsellor is tasked with overseeing the activity of the Prime 
Minister or another member of the House, he or she has that 
credibility and that accountability to this place.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has honed in on the difficulty of that position here. 
It is not personal.  It is not about Mr. Wilson.  It is about the 
office and the position he holds.  Would the member not agree 
that the intent was that he would report to the House, that he 
would do just that?  Would the member not agree that was 
certainly the intent when the Prime Minister and his government 
went before the electorate representing to the public that this 
commissioner was going to report to parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from the backgrounder that was attached to the 
original release when it was announced that the position of 
ethics commissioner—counsellor at that time—would be created. 
It said “The ethics counsellor will be available to the Prime 
Minister to investigate allegations against his ministers and 
senior officials involving conflicts of interest or lobbying”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that if he is available to the Prime Minister, 
he is not available to the House when he is investigating the 
Prime Minister.  Would the hon. member comment on that 
suggestion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member 
from the Progressive Conservative Party.  He is absolutely right. 
If I understand him correctly, what he is referring to is this: 
not only is it important, as this motion says, that the ethics 
counsellor reports directly to parliament, but it is also 
important that all members of parliament and other people have 
access to the ethics counsellor during the investigations so that 
they can put forward submissions, so that they can have a 
dialogue.  Right now that ethics counsellor is only available to 
one person, the Prime Minister, the person who appoints him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that when we are talking about ethics, the first 
way to derail the conversation is to trash talk and put the 
opposition, or in the other case the government, on the 
defensive.  At the end of the day all we end up doing is maybe 
improving our eligibility to be NBA players.  Beyond that it does 
not seem to add much to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possibly we can refrain from discussing specific instances and 
try to deal with the merits of the case.  I appreciate that this 
may be a novel concept in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House adopt the following policy from Liberal 
Redbook 1 and call for its implementation by the 
government:  “A Liberal 
Government will appoint an independent Ethics Counsellor to 
advise both public officials and lobbyists in the day-to-day 
application of the Code of Conduct for Public Officials.  The 
Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after consultation with the 
leaders of all the parties in the House of Commons and will 
report directly to Parliament.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it there does seem to be merit in the motion. The 
response of the government to the red book promise in 1994 was to 
create an office of an ethics counsellor who is independent.  I 
would dare to say that we have done that.  We have created the 
office of an independent ethics counsellor to advise public 
officials, mainly the government, the cabinet and parliamentary 
secretaries, and lobbyists, which is a separate item altogether, 
of the day to day application of the code of conduct.  That has 
been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nub of the issue is whether the ethics counsellor should 
report directly to parliament.  The ethics counsellor is to 
review ethical issues that come before the Prime Minister and 
ministers of the crown, to deal not only with real conflicts of 
interest but with perceived conflicts of interest.  He is there 
to give guidance and counsel.  He has additional responsibility 
under the Lobbyists Registration Act, which, as I said, is not 
relevant to this debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take it as a given that the opposition is not seeking an 
expansion of the role of the ethics counsellor; rather, they are 
merely wishing to change the reporting function from what it is 
presently, namely to the Prime Minister, to directly to 
parliament.  Again on the face of it, there does seem to be merit 
in the position of the opposition—if opposition members had no 
access to the decisions made by the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as members of the opposition know, the ethics 
counsellor is a compellable witness before a House of Commons 
committee.  He is even compellable before the House.  Indeed, his 
decisions and his material are subject to freedom of information. 
It is hard to imagine a more accessible officer.  If a member 
wants to review the activities of the ethics counsellor, a 
committee can summon him to appear, regardless of what the Prime 
Minister thinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of the debate is therefore quite simple.  Should an 
ethics counsellor report directly to the Prime Minister with an 
additional reporting function to a parliamentary committee and, 
indeed, parliament, or should he have a statutory responsibility 
to report directly to parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that if there is to be a change from reporting to 
the Prime Minister with a potential of reporting to a committee, 
as opposed to reporting to parliament directly, then there has to 
be a case made by the opposition that the work of the current 
ethics counsellor is deficient in some respect.  May I suggest 
that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point it is my view that the opposition has not made its 
case.  In fact, a number of members of the opposition have 
indicated that they believe that the ethics counsellor is a man 
of untarnished reputation.  I appreciate the concession on the 
part of the opposition that this is not a personalized attack on 
the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question therefore becomes, is there material before 
the House which would lead a reasonable person to conclude that 
the current ethics counsellor is not doing his job in a fair or 
impartial manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having listened to the representations of the opposition members 
and having read in the press about interpretations and 
representations of all members, I am not at all persuaded that 
there has been any evidence produced that this ethics counsellor 
is not doing his work in other than optimum conditions, and I am 
persuaded that he speaks with a force of moral authority to 
members of the government, which requires those members to take 
action.  On the face of it, members of the cabinet, the Prime 
Minister and parliamentary secretaries respond very quickly to 
what the ethics counsellor has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the best evidence is that in the course of three 
elections and subsequent mandates, there has not been a taint or 
a whiff of scandal or conflict among the members of cabinet, the 
parliamentary secretaries and the Prime Minister himself, 
notwithstanding vigorous attacks by the opposition and the press. 
Indeed, the press seems to be somewhat fatigued by the exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest endorsement, of course, is three majorities in a 
row.  My recollection of the election is that notwithstanding the 
effort on the part of certain opposition parties to call into 
question the integrity of the Prime Minister and indeed to raise 
the spectre of a charge under the criminal code, it in fact had 
no impact on the result of the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has started to circle in on an issue and 
obviously the most political one concerns the Prime Minister and 
a golf course in Shawinigan.  The report of the ethics counsellor 
exonerated the Prime Minister.  This is somewhat regrettable if 
one is a member of an opposition party, but it is a little like 
calling the system of justice into question because we do not 
like an individual judge's decision:  if we do not get a decision 
we like, perhaps we should change the forum so that a better 
decision can be obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore persuaded that this system does seem to work and 
I have some confidence that this ethics counsellor is doing a job 
under conditions that he sees as satisfactory.  I have yet to 
hear the ethics counsellor himself complain that the conditions 
under which he finds himself working and the person to whom he 
reports in fact compromise anything he might do.  I can recollect 
no evidence of any comments by this counsellor which indicate 
that he feels that his work is compromised by the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems, therefore, that the opposition needs to show that the 
ethics counsellor is compromised by the process.  It needs to 
give concrete and specific examples which show that the ethics 
counsellor and the process are compromised.  It needs to show 
that the existing system does not work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has demonstrated that the current system of 
reporting to the Prime Minister on request to a parliamentary 
committee, and indeed if requested to parliament itself, is a 
fair and open process whereby members of all sides have access to 
the decision and the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  The system is 
currently working.  I cannot see any compelling reason for the 
arguments on the part of the opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is one compelling argument for changing the system 
as it exists.  The compelling argument was a document that the 
member campaigned on in 1993.  He knows that he campaigned on the 
document.  He knows that he campaigned on this principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking him and his colleagues to keep their word on what 
they said they would do.  It surprises me how they can talk 
around the issue and say there is no compelling reason to keep 
their word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there has been a change in circumstances I would like to have 
the member tell me what is that change in circumstances, because 
a change in circumstances would mean that the promise was null 
and void.  If there is no change in circumstances from 1993 when 
he campaigned on the red book and this issue, I would ask him to 
vote for the principle because he campaigned on it.  I ask him to 
tell me how he could do otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not that old.  For the 
record I did not campaign in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to go through the details of the 
election promise.  It stated that a Liberal government would 
appoint an independent ethics counsellor.  That part was done. 
The ethics counsellor has been in place since 1994 and has 
rendered decisions, which possibly the government did not really 
like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It stated that the government would advise both public officials 
and lobbyists in the day to day application of the code of 
conduct for public officials.  The Lobbyists Registration Act has 
been passed and has been put in place.  I am assuming that public 
officials means the government, the cabinet, the Prime Minister, 
parliamentary secretaries, and so on.  Again, that has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It stated that the ethics counsellor would be appointed after 
consultation with leaders of the parties.  I understand that has 
been done.  Possibly certain members of the opposition did not 
see that as being a satisfactory form of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also stated that he would report directly to parliament.  The 
point of the debate is whether he has to report directly to 
parliament by statute or whether he has to report directly to 
parliament through the Prime Minister or through parliamentary 
committees on request.  As I said, I do not see circumstances 
which compel that to change. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member opposite. I 
know he thinks in a very technical and reasonable way.  He has 
given the example of a judge in this instance and I want to draw 
an example to his attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take an individual named Jean who is to go before a judge 
to be judged.  Before he goes before the trial judge on 
allegations he gets to pick and appoint the judge.  Then Jean 
appears before the judge.  While Jean is there, he is the only 
one who gets to present the evidence.  Jean presents his case to 
the judge that he appointed and hired.  After the judge has heard 
Jean's submissions he then retires.  After making his decision on 
the evidence presented by Jean, he then reports back to Jean.  He 
reports back to the person who hired him and then passes 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about the perception.  I know he 
appreciates the nuance.  The public should have confidence in the 
office of ethics counsellor which in and of itself includes the 
important distinction of ethics.  Would he not agree that the 
perception here is wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree that the in this instance the Prime Minister 
is being judged by a person he has appointed and who reports only 
to him?  Does the hon. member not see something wrong with the 
perception here?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises an 
interesting question.  My belief is that the answer is in the 
difference in the quality of the office, between what is a judge 
and what is an ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A judge necessarily needs independence in the process.  A judge 
necessarily hears evidence in an open and impartial manner.  A 
judge necessarily gives a judgment which has consequences. 
However, we are talking about an ethics counsellor.  An ethics 
counsellor gives advice.  An ethics counsellor gives counsel.  An 
ethics counsellor gives guidance.  There are no sanctions.  It is 
in the area of morality and ethics.  It is not in the area of 
legal precedent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, since this is my first 
opportunity to rise in the House since you have been elevated to 
your august position, let me say congratulations and all the very 
best to you as Deputy Speaker in the months and years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak against the opposition day motion.  As we 
are all aware, members of the House are proud of our traditions 
as a parliamentary democracy.  A parliamentary democracy means 
that the Prime Minister and ministers are accountable to 
parliament.  This includes the ethical behaviour of ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we know the importance of ethical behaviour.  We 
have a Prime Minister who is personally responsible for the 
government's ethical behaviour.  We have a record of taking 
action and we have made sure that a commitment to ethical conduct 
reaches all levels within the Government of Canada and is part of 
its everyday ongoing work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public service is a trust, and trust in institutions is vital to 
a democracy.  The Prime Minister is personally accountable to 
Canadians and to the House for the conduct of his ministers and 
his officials.  The Prime Minister's responsibility for the 
ethics counsellor reflects this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor provides reports to parliament on his 
duties under the Lobbyists Registration Act.  To establish a 
similar reporting on his duty in advising the Prime Minister 
would undermine the Prime Minister's responsibility for 
ministerial conduct.  At the heart of the Canadian system of 
government is collective ministerial responsibility.  This means 
that the government is responsible to parliament and it must 
maintain the confidence of the House in order to govern. 
Collective responsibility requires cabinet confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initiatives to strengthen integrity and transparency in 
government include more opportunity for policy debates in the 
House, changes to the pension plan for MPs to end double dipping, 
a conflict of interest code available to the public, a 
strengthened Lobbyists Registration Act, and the possibility for 
the auditor general to report to parliament up to four times a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House oppose the Canadian Alliance 
opposition day motion on the ethics counsellor.  The opposition 
day motion suggests that the government is not accountable to 
parliament for its ethic's policies and behaviour.  Nothing could 
be further from the truth.  Our government is accountable to 
parliament.  Parliament considered and passed the Lobbyists 
Registration Act.  The auditor general can now report to 
parliament up to four times a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strengthened code of conduct for public officeholders has been 
tabled in parliament and the Prime Minister and ministers 
continue to be accountable to parliament for their policies and 
ethical behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent ethics counsellor has been established to advise 
the Prime Minister on ministerial ethical issues.  The ethics 
counsellor is independent and reports to the Prime Minister.  The 
Prime Minister reports to parliament.  The opposition was 
consulted on the selection of the ethics counsellor.  The ethics 
counsellor reports to parliament on his duties under the 
Lobbyists Registration Act.  The ethics counsellor can be asked 
to appear before parliamentary committees and in fact has done 
so. 
As we have heard from my colleague, the hon. member from 
Scarborough East, not only has he appeared, but if necessary, he 
is a compellable witness before parliamentary committees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my first question to the 
minister has to do with the ethics counsellor.  When an ethical 
blunder that may be worthy of rebuke is reported to the Prime 
Minister why are the criteria not released to the public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the minister made constant reference to ethics, 
policies, great behaviour and integrity.  She said that the 
government has exceeded those expectations.  I am curious to know 
what steps have been taken to rebuke the unethical comments made 
by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration during the 
election campaign? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in relation to the hon. 
member's last unfortunate and gratuitous comment, it is most 
inappropriate for him to bring those comments into a debate that 
was begun today by the opposition in relation to the role of the 
ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that red herrings, such as the one he just 
raised, are inappropriate if we are to take the debate in 
relation to the ethics counsellor seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's first question was— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about Debbie's pension? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I just want to remind 
members on both sides of the House to please make their 
interventions to one another through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have here the conflict 
of interest code for public officeholders.  In fact, it is a 
public document.  It clearly outlines the principles of the code 
of conduct.  It begins with objects, principles, the 
interpretation thereof, the duties of the ethics counsellor and 
compliance arrangements.  It is a very detailed outline in terms 
of what any one of us has to do in relation to our assets and our 
liabilities, gifts, hospitality and other benefits.  It lists 
failure to comply, failure to agree and consequences thereof, 
compliance measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine what more information the member would need 
than this.  The information is available.  All he has to do is 
take it off the net.

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
the minister had the grace to admit what the Bloc Quebecois and 
its leader pointed out during the election campaign, which is 
that we all stand to gain from a process in which the ethics 
counsellor is selected, appointed and recognized by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that all the opposition parties would support rapid 
action in this direction.  There would be no doubt as to the 
integrity, legitimacy and relevance of the duties of a bona fide 
ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister admit, as a parliamentarian, that this kind of 
appointment must be the prerogative and the responsibility of 
all parliamentarians and not just of the Prime Minister, who 
uses it for partisan ends? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I fundamentally disagree 
with the premise of the hon. member's question. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1630

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, as I have already indicated, the ethics counsellor is 
appointed by the Prime Minister after a process of consultation 
with leaders of the opposition parties.  For the hon. member to 
suggest that there is anything dishonest or dishonourable, either 
in relation to this particular ethics counsellor or this office 
of the ethics counsellor, is certainly unbecoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already indicated that our system is one of parliamentary 
democracy and accountability.  The Prime Minister is accountable 
to the House.  He is accountable to the Parliament of Canada. 
Therefore, to suggest that somehow in the appointment of the 
ethics counsellor we are in any way treating the House lightly is 
a mischaracterization of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike in most functioning democracies, the Prime Minister comes 
here virtually every day and is accountable to everyone in the 
House for everything he does, including the appointment of the 
ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Given the importance of the issue and given the presence 
of the justice minister, who is without a doubt the highest 
ranking lawyer in the country, I wonder if we could have 
unanimous consent of the House to continue the question and 
answer period with her for another 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I can quote the Minister of Justice from just a couple 
of minutes ago, when she said that our system is one of 
parliamentary democracy.  I believe she also said that public 
office is a public trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see today in the debate on the motion and in the 
response and the defence being put on by the government is that 
the government really does not believe that we have a working 
parliamentary democracy.  I do not think they appreciate that 
public office is a public trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I say that is that it does come down to the heart of 
accountability.  Human nature being what it is, unless we are 
accountable to someone else or to some external force, human 
nature tends to suggest that we cover up for ourselves.  We do 
things that are not totally proper, but then we hope to get away 
with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is how I define accountability.  I have done a lot of work 
on the topic.  I was chairman of the public accounts committee in 
the House in the last parliament and a member of the committee in 
the parliament previous to that, and I deal a lot with 
accountability.  I work a lot with the auditor general who, in 
his way, tries to hold the government accountable by releasing 
his independent reports, his criticisms and the problems that he 
finds.  Sometimes they are overlooked by the government. 
Accountability means that one is responsible to forces that one 
does not control and that will affect one's behaviour.  If the 
forces are not totally and absolutely out of one's control, if 
one can manage them, manipulate them and dominate them, then 
there is no accountability, regardless of what the justice 
minister says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament was created and then evolved over several hundreds of 
years in the U.K.  It started off with a monarch who had absolute 
autocratic authority.  He did what he wanted.  He hung people, 
imprisoned people, taxed people and went to war.  He did whatever 
he wanted with absolute, total, autocratic authority, and the 
people said no.  Over several hundred years, the people wrestled 
from the monarchy the right to hold the government and the 
monarch accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House, as 301 parliamentarians, perhaps excluding the 
government benches, it is our role to hold the government 
accountable.  Unfortunately, we in this House either tend to 
think that we are part of government or, on the opposite side of 
the House, we hope that we become government.  Therefore we lose 
our focus on what we in the House should be doing, which is to 
hold the government accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the Prime Minister says that he is doing his bit, 
that he has an ethics counsellor who reports to him, it is an 
outright sham when it comes to accountability. 
For the justice minister to speak in the House about how 
accountable the government is and to say that they will vote 
against the motion indicates the disdain by which they hold the 
House and the members who sit in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look in the recent past at the HRDC billion 
dollar boondoggle.  There were numerous HRDC audits in the last 
number of years, internal audits that did not cause change. 
However, when the final audit got into the public domain and the 
minister could no longer control the response to it, we finally 
had some real accountability because the minister had to respond 
to forces outside her control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the Minister of Health, just yesterday, answering 
questions about the native treatment centre scandal in Manitoba. 
Why is that a scandal?  Because there is no accountability. 
The financial statements are not available.  The chief said that 
once the money flowed to the reserve it was no longer public 
money and he did not have to answer to anybody.  Now we find 
after years that thousands and millions of dollars have gone 
astray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that people are off on Caribbean cruises and they call 
it training.  How can that be?  The minute it becomes public and 
the minute that the chief no longer controls the responses and 
the demands for information, we find there is real 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the Shawinigan affair in the Prime Minister's riding. Let 
us compare the ethics counsellor reporting to the Prime Minister 
and the chairman of the business development bank who lost his 
job because he was suggesting that he did not do what the Prime 
Minister wanted.  I would expect that the ethics counsellor would 
have lost his job too if he did not do what the Prime Minister 
wanted.  That is a great affront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to a parallel a couple of weeks ago in the U.K. 
parliament.  The minister for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter 
Mandelson, was economical with the truth.  He gave some 
information to a junior minister who reported to parliament that 
turned out to be a bit shy of the whole story. Within two days he 
was no longer a minister.  If that type of thing happens in our 
parliament, unfortunately it is glossed over and it is business 
as usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few days the Minister of Foreign Affairs admitted to 
the House that he had not been in full command of all the facts 
in his department and his department had not been in full command 
of all the facts regarding the Russian diplomat who was expelled 
from Canada.  He has by and large mislead the House because he 
was not up to his job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I am having some 
difficulty with the last statement made by the hon. member. I 
would hope that he might continue his remarks by being somewhat 
more judicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs has provided us with more information as the days go on 
which does not support what he said in the days before.  He has 
suggested that he now is in command of more facts he has a 
different story to tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can draw whatever conclusion we want from that.  Had it been 
in the U.K. parliament he would have been gone.  There is no 
question about that, none whatsoever.  It did not cause a ripple 
in this place.  That is why there is very little accountability 
here.  That is why the Prime Minister is getting away with an 
ethics counsellor that reports to him rather than to the House. 
It is time the House wrestled back the responsibility it should 
have never given up to hold the government accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot expect the citizens on the street who are going about 
their daily lives to hold the government accountable.  That is 
why we were elected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament of Canada should hold the Government of Canada 
responsible.  For the Prime Minister to suggest anything else 
would suggest that he is more of an autocrat than a democrat. 
Members of the House are getting fed up with stories about the 
ethics commissioner saying no rules were broken and that 
everything is fine.  No rules were broken because there are no 
rules to break.  That also speaks volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lack of accountability led to a billion dollar boondoggle at 
HRDC.  Lack of accountability in the native treatment centre in 
Manitoba led to a huge waste of money.  We now have all kinds of 
misgivings about the deal going on in the Prime Minister's 
riding.  The auditor general is talking about gross incompetence 
in the Minister of Canadian Heritage's department because due 
diligence was not performed on 19% of the files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the frontlines the government does not respect the fact 
that parliament's job is to hold it accountable.  We 
unfortunately have given up far too much of our power.  It is

us and the Canadian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
suggest to the hon. member opposite that there may be a profound 
misunderstanding, wilful or inadvertent, on the part of some 
members about what the ethics counsellor is or does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the hon. member refer to the ethics counsellor as an 
ethics commissioner.  There is a very big difference.  The 
opposition is clearly seeking someone who will be an enforcer, a 
policeman, a judge, someone who will do his or her job in 
enforcing a code of conduct or ethics.  The ethics counsellor is 
none of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor is a counsellor to those who are 
appointed, who are ministers, who are parliamentary secretaries, 
so that they can avoid the difficulties of conflict of interest 
and pre-empt difficult situations.  That issue has been addressed 
back and forth today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put another issue to the hon. member.  All of us in the 
House are busily holding forth on the issue of compliance with a 
code of conduct which would exist for ministers, for 
officeholders and for parliamentary secretaries.  There is no 
code of conduct.  For all of those here who are holding forth, 
there is no code of conduct for members of parliament.  They are 
very willing to hoist upon the other officeholders a code of 
conduct, but not one element of a code of conduct applies to 
members in the House.  That is business that we have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we wax eloquent on what is missing in all of the other 
codes of conduct, I suggest we get our own House in order.  I ask 
the member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member was talking 
semantics about counsellor and commissioner.  The Prime Minister 
is not accountable to the House and he should be.  The intent of 
the red book motion was that the Prime Minister and the 
government be accountable.  If the forces are beyond our control 
to manage then we are not accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the second point raised about members of 
parliament not having a code of conduct, the Council of Europe 
has developed a clear code of conduct for its parliamentarians. I 
will be glad to work with the member to see if it can be 
introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members of the House can move on, hopefully with the 
encouragement of the Prime Minister and the government.  The 
justice minister said public office is a public trust.  I hope we 
can rise to that level to ensure that our constituents have faith 
in us as we perform our responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it start with the Prime Minister.  Let him demonstrate how 
he will rise above the smelly little scandals that seem to be 
cropping up each and everywhere.  He could set them aside by 
rising to a higher level of principle and ensuring that the 
government is accountable to the House.

There are a lot of semantics and careful, niggling little words

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the intent in the red book was to bring about 
accountability.  The hon. member knows well about accountability. 
He very much makes it his passion in this place.  He is the 
fiscal thistle who often brings out barbs of information against 
the government and its accountability to the House and to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put to the member the chronology of how things have 
unfolded.  The Prime Minister owned a property.  The Prime 
Minister sold the property.  The property sale did not go 
through, therefore in some form it came back to him.  It may have 
been in a blind trust, but it was a blind trust with a lot of 
peripheral vision.  However, during the time that the property 
was not sold, when it was in an inbetween, purgatory stage, the 
Prime Minister was making representations to the Business 
Development Bank to assist an individual, well known by the Prime 
Minister, in the sale of a property adjoining his own that would 
therefore enhance the value of the property held by the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this perception or reality?  Is this not a conflict of 
interest that should be viewed by an individual with 
impartiality, not connected to the Prime Minister in any way, 
shape or form?  That is what is at the crux of the issue that has 
led to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have a comment with respect to the 
perception of the public in the chronology that I have just laid 
out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the words of a wise 
person, whom I cannot remember at this time, if we have to ask if 
it is a conflict of interest, we can bet our boots that it is. 
Therefore, if we are ever concerned that we may be in a conflict 
of interest then we probably are in a conflict of interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate you on your appointment as 
Speaker.  As a new member I will certainly look to you for 
guidance as I deliberate in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour and a privilege to stand here today in our 
national parliament on behalf of the people of Edmonton 
Southwest.  Since this is my first address in this distinguished 
Chamber, I take this opportunity to express my sincere 
appreciation to the people of Edmonton Southwest.  They have 
bestowed upon me a tremendous honour, but also a tremendous duty 
and a tremendous responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank those people without whose efforts I would not be 
standing here today, not only for their efforts but also for 
their love and support.  I especially thank my family, 
particularly my mother and father.  One could not ask for more 
supportive parents.  It is to their credit, as well as a credit 
to the democratic principles of our citizens, that the son of two 
school teachers can rise and be selected by his fellow citizens 
to represent their concerns and aspirations in our national 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank my friends, mentors and colleagues at the 
University of Alberta, particularly in the department of 
political science.  I am quite cognizant to the reality that many 
individuals there may not have intended to help mould a Canadian 
Alliance member of parliament, but I am genuinely appreciative of 
their goodwill over the past number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, I thank the previous member of parliament for Edmonton 
Southwest, Mr. Ian McClelland, with whom I worked for four years. 
This hon. gentleman is well known to members of the House and 
achieved something notable during his time here:  respect from 
members on both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my arrival in parliament, many members have told me that I 
have big shoes to fill, in more ways than one.  Ian himself would 
likely describe this as a Sisyphean challenge, but it is a 
challenge I readily and heartily accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residents of Edmonton Southwest, if I can characterize them, 
are tough-minded, warm-hearted and principled people who focus on 
big issues and offer pragmatic solutions.  They are very honest 
in their critiques, but when there is work to be done they roll 
up their sleeves and get to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent election I noticed that their concerns related 
primarily to fiscal responsibility and the democratic nature of 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am pleased to speak today to the official 
opposition motion.  This motion speaks to the broad themes of 
democratic and parliamentary reform, accountability and 
transparency in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states that the House adopt the following policy from 
Liberal red book one and calls for the immediate implementation 
of it by the government: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal Government will appoint an independent Ethics 
Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the 
day-to-day application of the Code of Conduct for Public 
Officials.  The Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after 
consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House of 
Commons and will report directly to Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this motion is specifically related to the ethics 
counsellor, it does relate to the broader themes of parliamentary 
and democratic reform, fiscal responsibility, accountability and 
transparency, and members of parliament themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent election, people in Edmonton spoke 
passionately about the need for accountability from the 
government to ensure they were respected as citizens and that 
their taxpayer dollars were treated as funds in trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were very frustrated by the spending problems within the 
Department of Human Resources Development, but were more 
frustrated by the unwillingness of the government to take 
responsibility for those financial problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were particularly upset by the revelation that the auditor 
general was not able to present his report to the respective 
committee because of lack of attendance by government members. 
When this was combined with report of the information 
commissioner, in which he detailed concerns about the lack of 
openness in this government, people expressed grave concern about 
the lack of accountability and transparency of a government 
elected to serve their best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A common frustration I encountered from people was that public 
officials did not seem accountable to them as citizens.  They 
felt the only control they had was the opportunity every four 
years, or three and a half in this case, to walk into a polling 
booth and mark an X on a ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most serious problems facing Canadian democracy today 
is the concentration of political power within the Prime 
Minister's office and the lack of checks and balances to that 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada today has what political scientist Donald Savoie called 
court government as distinguished from the cabinet government and 
parliamentary government of earlier political eras.  We have 
almost reverted to what the hon. member for St. Albert was 
talking about, a monarchy style of government with a court that 
advises the monarch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's office has grown in size and scope since 
the 1960s.  This size and corresponding increase in power is a 
threat not only to our fundamental rights and duties as 
parliamentarians, but also to our basic liberties as free and 
equal citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are strong words, but I ask my fellow parliamentarians and 
fellow citizens to consider the powers currently exercised in 
Canada by one individual:  the power to appoint all the members 
of the cabinet; the power to appoint all the members of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, which has become more involved in public 
policy decisions and our daily lives; the power to appoint all 
the members of the second national legislative body, the Senate; 
the power to influence and appoint all the chairmen of the 
parliamentary committees; and the power to control the House of 
Commons by disallowing free votes through a misuse of the 
confidence convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves whether having so much power in one 
office with one individual is healthy for our democracy.  I 
believe we even have to question whether we are fulfilling those 
democratic traditions and principles we hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the political party in power, regardless of the 
person in the office, the concentration of political power, 
combined with the extension of the state more and more into our 
everyday lives, is a serious threat to our fundamental rights as 
citizens.  As more and more decisions are made that impact our 
lives, we as citizens have less control, if any, over these 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One step to address the problem is to restore parliament to its 
proper role.  With the increasing power of the Prime Minister's 
office and the increasing influence of the judiciary on public 
policy, the third aspect of our democracy, the legislature, has 
declined in importance.  This is an unfortunate trend for a 
nation that was established in the British tradition of 
parliamentary democracy, where parliament was intended to be the 
highest institution of political authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from historical reasons, one of the best reasons today for 
reinvigorating parliament and empowering parliamentarians is to 
fully utilize the talents of members in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous life as a political assistant and in my short 
time here so far, I have had the opportunity to witness some fine 
parliamentarians, men and women from all parties who are 
intelligent, independent minded individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current function of parliament within our institutional 
framework, combined with the manner in which this place operates, 
both of which are primarily caused by the concentration of 
political power, means that the skills of these thoughtful and 
deliberative MPs are not fully realized.  I would argue in fact 
that they are barely realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to think back to the debate this morning, when a 
member from another political party, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona who I think all members would agree is one of 
the more thoughtful, deliberative parliamentarians spoke.  He is 
has been in opposition almost his entire career.  Think of what 
he can effect in terms of change?  Are we fully utilizing the 
talents of members of parliament such as him if we simply sit on 
two sides of the aisle and have power so concentrated within the 
Prime Minister's Office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view this motion attempts to tilt the balance back from 
the Prime Minister's office to parliament by having the ethics 
counsellor being appointed only after genuine consultation with 
the leaders of all parties and by having the ethics counsellor 
report directly to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reporting directly to parliament will ensure the process is 
open and transparent to all Canadians.  It will make public 
officials and lobbyists truly accountable for their actions.  It 
will begin to make parliament and parliamentarians resume their 
rightful place as the institutional guardians of the public 
trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage all members on both sides of the House to 
reflect seriously on the motion and join with me in supporting 
its passage and implementation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a previous speaker alluded to the fact 
that there is no code of conduct for MPs in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the new member whether he feels there should 
be a code of conduct for MPs and whether that code of conduct 
should be enforced by an ethics counsellor, some person outside 
of parliament who reports to parliament.  Would he like to see 
such a situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the best control over 
parliamentarians is the voters.  As parliamentarians, we are 
directly responsible to the voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between the government and parliament, and 
I think the hon. member for St. Albert alluded to this.  There is 
a difference between the cabinet, which is responsible for 
ministries and departments, and parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change that happened in the Magna Carta was fundamental.  It 
is fundamental that parliament, as the representative of the 
people, control how the cabinet exercises and disburses the 
money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am going to be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations on your appointment as Deputy Speaker.  It is 
good to see you there.  I am very comfortable with you being 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to extend my condolences to the family of the late 
David Iftody, our colleague who died so suddenly this past week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say hello to our colleague from 
Vaudreuil—Soulanges who has not been able to join us yet.  His 
wife has been quite ill.  We send our best wishes to him, to his 
wife and to his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start my comments by relating to the House some of the 
testimony of the ethics counsellor, Mr. Howard Wilson, which he 
gave in the 36th parliament to the industry committee.  It is 
interesting that the ethics counsellor is appearing before a 
parliamentary committee.  The members should know that one of the 
opportunities we have is that the ethics counsellor can be 
summoned to committee and in fact has been summoned to committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his testimony, and it was related to many of the issues that 
have been raised in debate today, he referred to the conflict of 
interest code.  The most recent version was tabled in the House 
of Commons by the Prime Minister in 1994.  The member who just 
spoke should note that it applies not just to cabinet ministers, 
it also applies to parliamentary secretaries, their spouses and 
dependent children, members of ministers' political staff and 
essentially all full time governor in council appointees, senior 
members of the executive branch of government as well as part 
time appointees.  In total the conflict of interest guidelines 
apply to an estimated 3,100 persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the number of times questions of ethics may come up with 
that many people.  Imagine what would happen if all of a sudden 
the ethics counsellor were required to prepare a report or report 
through committee on the activities of his office in regard to 
some 3,100 people.  Imagine the allegations that could be made. 
Even with the debate today, allegations have been made with 
regard to some of the current issues allegations have been made. 
All of these have been shown to be unsubstantiated allegations. 
All members would have access to all of this information, and it 
puts us in a very awkward position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really have some concern about having the ethics counsellor 
being a position where at the whim of parliamentarians they could 
start to get into a lot of the details of the operations of that 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary to the House leader indicated that 
there was a difference between an ethics counsellor and an ethics 
commissioner.  Much of the discussion today has taken place with 
regard to the policeman, the person who would be judge and jury. 
That is not exactly the description of the ethics counsellor.  I 
wanted to put that on the table because we have to put this in 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to confirm that the code of ethical guidelines does 
not apply to members of parliament, nor to senators.  Imagine the 
allegations that would be made, never mind by another member of 
parliament, perhaps by people in the public generally.  Members 
will know from experience with their constituency offices that 
there are some fairly inquisitive people.  Imagine if someone 
bought a $50 or $100 ticket for a fundraiser and then all of a 
sudden the person got an appointment.  Someone in the House, 
regardless of what side, would jump up and say it was a conflict 
of interest or influence peddling and all kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an incumbency on all members of parliament to be 
honourable members of parliament.  We are taken at our word and 
when we speak in this place we always speak the truth.  To 
suggest that a member has misled or lied or whatever is contrary 
to the rules of this place.  We are all honourable members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that as a preamble, I would like to address specifically 
the details of the motion that is before this place.  It is with 
regard to an undertaking that the government made in the 1993 
election about establishing an ethics counsellor in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of elements to it.  The government itself is 
accountable to parliament.  We considered and passed the 
Lobbyists Registration Act and the ethics counsellor must enforce 
the provisions of it.  The auditor general now reports to 
parliament up to four times a year.  He can report almost as 
often as he wants in certain circumstances.  The code of conduct 
has been strengthened for public officeholders.  That was tabled 
in parliament and a copy is available to all Canadians on the 
parliamentary website.  The Prime Minister and his ministers 
continue to be accountable to parliament for their policies and 
ethical behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are accountable in this place.  We are accountable for all of 
the things that we do.  All of the information that passes 
through this place is available to members in one fashion or 
another, whether it be in the House during question period, or 
during debate, or during committee or other forums as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent ethics counsellor was established in accordance 
with the undertaking back in 1993.  Principally, his job is to 
advise the Prime Minister on ministerial ethics issues.  This is 
where I think the big responsibilities lie, because there is such 
a breadth of operations and responsibilities on our ministers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for Canadians to know that there is a very 
comprehensive code of ethics and guidelines on a variety of 
requirements.  Members of parliament must declare their assets. 
They must establish blind trusts for certain assets.  They are 
restricted in terms of certain outside activities.  There are 
rules with respect to gifts and hospitality to ensure that there 
would not be in fact or an appearance to be out of line with 
hospitality type items to the avoidance of preferential 
treatment.  It also sets out what happens in the conditions of 
failure to comply.  It is a very important code of ethics that 
has been presented to the House by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its totality what has happened so far fully complies with the 
spirit of the undertaking of the government that was laid out 
back in 1993.  The Prime Minister has an ethics counsellor to 
ensure that he has the advice on all material matters of ethical 
conduct so that he can ensure that he is kept apprised of areas 
where there may be risks or problems of an ethical nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress though that we are not talking about illegal acts. 
Illegal acts are dealt with by our judicial system and by the 
RCMP.  Members will know that RCMP investigations have been 
raised with regard to a number of allegations, whether they be 
HRDC or other matters that have come up over the years through 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a fundamental sense because the ethics counsellor discharges 
those responsibilities, he is accountable to the House from the 
standpoint that he can and has been subpoenaed to appear before 
committee to answer questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the debate today we heard about a particular issue 
that had to do with the Prime Minister.  The question is 
fundamental.  Does the prime minister, when he becomes prime 
minister, cease to be a member of parliament?  Do the 
constituents of the prime minister's riding give up their 
opportunity to be served and assisted by their member of 
parliament?  It is an interesting question.  It is pretty hard to 
imagine anyone not knowing that their member of parliament was 
also the prime minister.  That fact alone, which is indisputable 
and certainly there is not much one can do about it, probably 
would have some influence in certain corners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally a member of parliament has to have the opportunity 
to represent the interests of his or her constituents, and in 
this particular case the Prime Minister did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I heard so many people rave about the allegations of 
impropriety of wrongdoing, when in fact the ethics counsellor, 
who was given a vote of confidence by all parties after 
appropriate consultation, opined on that.  He said the Prime 
Minister had sold his interest in the golf course on November 1, 
1993. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it has been rather interesting to watch respected 
members, and I say that about this member, of the Liberal Party 
attempting to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is very simple and straightforward.  With the 
greatest respect, I point out to the member that we are not 
talking about the spirit of what was promised by the Liberals. We 
are talking about the words that the Liberals promised. 
Apparently, there is a big difference between those two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that when the ethics counsellor does not 
report directly to parliament, and the Prime Minister sets the 
rules for the ethics counsellor, then the ethics counsellor will 
make the ruling based on those particular rules. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that from time to time the House has to alter the 
criminal code.  It has to alter the Health Act.  It has to alter 
things to do with metric measurement.  Things do evolve.  In this 
instance, as long as it is out of the reach of parliament to set 
the rules, which a person of integrity like Howard Wilson will be 
deciding on, then it is not doing the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 this member and other Liberal members campaigned on the 
principle that the ethics counsellor “will report directly to 
parliament”.  Those are five simple words.  Let us not worry 
about the spirit.  Let us worry about the words on which they 
campaigned.  Why is the member trying to thread the needle here 
in such a way as to say that they are already doing it and that 
they do not need those words?  We are simply asking him to do 
what he promised in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, the ethics counsellor is 
independent and the member will not even acknowledge that.  The 
rules are not set by the Prime Minister.  The rules guiding the 
conduct and the role of the ethics counsellor are set out in the 
conflict of interest and post-employment code for public office 
holders of June 1994, under which the ethics counsellor operates. 
I think the hon. member maybe misspoke himself in describing what 
the facts really are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the question comes down to whether it is better that he 
report to parliament.  I do not know exactly what that means. 
Maybe it means to report annually to a committee or something or 
to allow us to go on a fishing expedition.  The point is that I 
believe members of parliament, as demonstrated by what has 
happened so far, can have the ethics counsellor appear before 
committee to answer all the questions and to be fully accountable 
for all questions on matters that are his responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, members also have the opportunity to receive from the 
ethics commissioner any reports on anything.  In fact the Leader 
of the Opposition and the leader of fifth party wrote letters 
asking for information and received it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that changing the instrument or vehicle in 
which the ethics counsellor operates could at all change what 
rights or opportunities members currently have.  It would not 
change anything other than the fact that it might give 
parliamentarians an opportunity to go on wild fishing expeditions 
with regard to 3,100 persons who are covered by this code of 
ethics. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, have listened to quite a bit of the 
debate on this motion today.  I am going to give a hypothetical 
case because it has not happened in parliament but it has 
happened in a provincial legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Mississauga South whether he 
believes that the fact that the ethics commissioner is appointed 
by the Prime Minister would have any impact whatsoever on the 
ethics counsellor's integrity and independence in judging a 
complaint about a leader of an official opposition party 
benefiting to the tune of $800,000 of taxpayers' money to settle 
a private—

for Waterloo—Wellington. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, first, I had an opportunity to review this opposition 
day motion.  Quite frankly it is crass politics at its worst.  It 
simply comes from the dying days of the campaign prior to 
November 27, when the reformed alliance people were floundering 
and did not know which way to turn, so they came up with this 
smear campaign against the Prime Minister. 
This is a man of enormous integrity, a man who has fought all his 
life to ensure good, decent and honest government, but here we 
have the kinds of antics we saw not only today but certainly 
leading up to the election as well, antics that denigrate the 
good character of the Prime Minister and others associated with 
him.  I find it objectionable.  I want to go on record as noting 
that.  I think the good people of Waterloo—Wellington do as well.

First, the ethics counsellor has repeatedly said that the Prime 
Minister at every step acted with great integrity and did not 
show favouritism or any kind of partiality.  He did so on behalf 
of his constituents.  Next, the highest court, the court of the 
electorate, spoke on November 27 and, first, re-elected the 
Liberal government but, second, noted that there were in fact 
some questions about the integrity of the leader of the reformed 
Alliance group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the evidence on that fact.  First, as was 
pointed out by the hon. member in her question to the other 
member who spoke, the leader of the opposition has $792,064 worth 
of reasons why he should be looking at his own nest before he 
starts considering others.  This was taxpayers' money that was 
paid out as a result of ego, arrogance and error.  He could have 
settled with Mr. Goddard for $60,000.  Did he do it?  No, he did 
not.  He let the taxpayers of Alberta pick up the tab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to take when we put that in the context of the 
grandstanding we are seeing today.  It is doubly galling when we 
think of the fact that on this very day, at nine o'clock mountain 
standard time, a civil court challenge is being launched by none 
other than the former Speaker of the Alberta legislature, who 
happens to be a colleague of the Leader of the Opposition.  The 
former Speaker claims that that $800,000 price tag—for ethical 
or unethical behaviour, take your pick—was in fact unethical but 
also contrary to the rules of the legislature of Alberta and that 
taxpayers' funds were indeed used to settle a private defamation 
lawsuit.  How ironic that it is happening on this very day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget another little story that took place about a 
month ago.  When he was seeking a seat in the House of Commons 
last summer, the Alliance leader claimed that Jim Hart, the 
sitting member for Okanagan—Coquihalla, had willingly and of his 
own volition offered to give up his seat.  Only recently did we 
find out that the seat had a price tag of $50,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, is it not so ironic that those people opposite, those 
holier than thou, reformed Alliance people, can always be on the 
side of the angels, depending on which way they spin their little 
web in their zealotry and other things?  Fifty thousand dollars 
is a lot of money.  In the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> of January 24, 2001, 
there is a quote which reads, “People would find it shocking. 
Fifty thousand bucks is a lot of money”.  That was the member 
for Wild Rose saying this about his very own leader and his very 
own colleagues.  There is a joke circulating on this point which 
says that the Alliance leader had the Albertans pay for his mouth 
and the Alliance Party pay for his seat.  Whether or not that is 
funny I will leave for you to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all on the heels of the former leader having a secret 
fund of $40,000 for clothing and other things.  Here we go again 
with the duplicity and the hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of duplicity, hypocrisy and other matters, ethical or 
unethical, let us remember the member for Edmonton North, the 
high priestess of principle herself on pensions.  There were pigs 
squealing, buttons in the House, pigs on the front lawn and other 
things, but she has found it in her heart, bless her dearly, to 
find $90,000 to buy back into the pension.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we not read today that the member for Medicine Hat has found 
$50,000 to do the same?  He says he is finding it quite difficult 
to square with his constituents.  Is it not always interesting to 
note that at one time they say one thing to certain groups of 
people in parts of the country when it is convenient to their 
purposes and quite another to another set of people at another 
time?  It does not always seem to jibe, and the circle always 
does not get quite squared, but holier than thou as they are, 
they keep plugging away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say here and now that we as a government take pride in 
the fact that we have provided an excellent service to Canadians. 
We have provided good governance in the keeping of Canadian 
values and institutions.  The Prime Minister, the cabinet and 
this government brought forward the Lobbyists Registration Act, 
for example, on the heels of the election after the first mandate 
in 1993.  The Prime Minister and the cabinet brought forward the 
notion of the ethics counsellor.  We did so knowing it was in 
keeping with the will of the people and knowing that we would be 
transparent and accountable in a manner consistent with what 
Canadians want and consistent with what I believe Canadians 
deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have maintained and held onto those high ethical standards, 
in keeping, then, with what parliamentary democracy is all about, 
in keeping with the constituents' wishes.  We have ensured that 
we have the kinds of appointments and ethical considerations in 
place that keep us moving in a way that is consistent with what 
Canadians want us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did we do it?  When we took power in 1993, what a rogues' 
gallery there was under the Mulroney era.  Need I remind the 
House that as a direct result of that, it was the ethics 
counsellor who brought forward the kinds of things that we now 
have in place because of what took place with the Tories prior to 
1993.  I could go through the list.  There were Sinclair Stevens 
and the royal commission that concluded there were violations of 
14 different conflicts of interest.  I could talk about André 
Bissonnette, the Minister of Transport, who left cabinet as a 
result of flipping land that went from $800,000 to $3 million in 
11 days.  I could talk about Roch LaSalle and others.  I could go 
on to Michel Coté and Senator Michel Cogger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I wanted to ask the Conservatives something, because 
they were getting on their high horse too.  They were going on 
about the kinds of clean and ethical things that they are capable 
of, yet we saw the rogues' gallery that preceded us in 1993.  I 
want to know why Conservative Senator Eric Berntson is still 
sitting as a member of their caucus.  If they are on such high 
moral ground, they should be asking for his resignation.  They 
should be booting him out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we remember that corrupt government of Grant Devine and the 
kinds of things that were happening there?  He is still sitting 
as a member of their caucus.  If they are on such high moral 
ground, the first thing they should be doing is getting him out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that at the end of the day this government has acted with 
honesty and integrity and continues to do so on behalf of the 
people of this great country.  For the reformed Alliance people 
to bring in this kind of crass political motion and to do so in 
light of their pension flip-flop, in light of the $800,000 that 
their leader has squandered on behalf of the taxpayers of 
Alberta, in light of paying $50,000 for Jim Hart's seat, in light 
of point after point of questionable ethics and doing it with the 
holier than thou attitude that only those people opposite have, I 
can tell you this:  the good folks in Waterloo—Wellington do not 
cut to that kind of chase.  They see hypocrisy where it is every 
time and I can tell you that on this day in this parliament it 
resides on those benches. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I really appreciate some of the 
examples that the member from Waterloo—Wellington gave about 
some of the incidents we could qualify as conflict of interest 
incidents or as unethical.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member perchance have any other examples on the part of 
the official opposition party or perhaps on the part of the 
former government party, the Progressive Conservatives?  I, as 
well as those in my riding, would be most interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am interested in these 
kinds of matters.  I find it interesting to do the research to 
get to the bottom of these kinds of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that the Conservatives under Mr. Mulroney 
had a decade of arrogance and high-handness when it came to the 
issue of conflict of interest and the unethical behaviour that 
took place.  What happened was a crying shame.  Members will note 
that under the leadership of the Prime Minister and this 
government that has not been the pattern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at length about the reformed Alliance people, 
those holier than thous who sit on that side of the House and 
preach the gospel of always being on the moral high ground when 
in fact they are down in the gutter to the extent of $800,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think about the member for Edmonton North and her 
pension.  I was playing the tape not so long ago and listening to 
the pig sounds.  The snorting was incredible.  The pigs were out 
on the front lawn of this great parliament and there were pig 
buttons, and all of a sudden that is all supposed to be 
forgotten.  Those members ran a couple of elections on the fact 
that they would never buy into pensions and now it is “oh, let 
us conveniently forget it”.  The member for Medicine Hat said 
that it was hard to square with his constituents, but he wants 
back in.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hypocrisy, the duplicity, the flip-flopping, the 
holier-than-thou-ism are unbelievable.  It is so sacrosanct, and 
yet at the same time they are sucking and blowing whenever they 
think they can get away with it.  I object and so do the people 
on this side of the House, as do my constituents of 
Waterloo—Wellington and most Canadians, because Canadians spot 
hypocrisy and duplicity every time, especially from those who 
always claim the moral high ground.  That is when it galls the 
most and that is exactly what we are seeing here today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member.  There is no doubt 
that many of us here in the House would agree that there are 
certain basic rules and principles that we should adhere to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member, in his holier than thou attitude, basically set the 
parameters under which we should all operate.  He looked at 
examples of the past and, perhaps rightly so, pointed out 
individuals and occasions about which none of us can hold our 
heads high and say that we agreed with what people did.  In 
saying so, the member himself undoubtedly is saying he does not 
agree with this either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member then saying that because he does not agree with 
this underhanded work, the conflict of interest we have seen in 
the past, his leader, the Prime Minister, should meet his 
Waterloo—not to pun the member's district—and perhaps step 
aside?  He is in the same boat as many of the others the member 
was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are you also saying that your leader is wrong?  That is the 
impression you have given the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I remind the 
hon. members to address the Chair and not each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I can clear this up very 
quickly.  That is not at all what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I was pointing out about the previous Tory administration 
is that between 1986 and 1988 there were no less than 14 
incidents of conflict of interest.  We had to clean up that mess. 
That is exactly what the Prime Minister, the cabinet and the 
government did.  We cleaned up that mess.  As a result, we now 
have good conflict of interest guidelines in place.  There is a 
conflict of interest person who, under the ethics commission and 
counsellor, does what is required.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Prince Albert.  As this is my first speech in the new 37th 
parliament, I will begin by thanking the people of 
Dewdney—Alouette for entrusting me with the honour to serve them 
for a second term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my wife Wendy and my four wonderful children for their 
continued love and support.  I thank my entire family, my 
campaign team and my supporters who worked so hard for so long. 
I also thank my hard working staff, Tara, Randy and Mark, for 
their endless hours of support, encouragement and dedicated 
efforts, and give great thanks to God for his grace and guidance 
in my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House today is one of significant 
importance.  I believe the motion before us and the subsequent 
vote provides all members of parliament a landmark opportunity to 
debate and work together to achieve a very important change in 
the way the government conducts its business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The action which we are championing with a non-partisan nature 
is one which could signal to Canadians that those of us who have 
been sent here to represent the people are willing to put aside 
bitter partisan bickering for the greater good of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent election fewer people came out to vote than in any 
time in our country's history.  We can draw many conclusions from 
this.  However I think it is obvious that our people are 
withdrawing.  More and more of our citizens, particularly young 
people, are deciding that it simply does not matter what they do 
at the polls, that things in Ottawa will never change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an attitude that more and more of our citizens are 
developing across regions, across age groups and in all 
cross-sections of Canadian society.  The simple fact is that 
fewer people are involved in the political discourse of the 
country.  As members of parliament this should be of great 
concern to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of great concern to me.  On a personal level, I learned 
through my father's experience as a veteran of the second world 
war the great price that was paid for our freedom, for our 
democracy, and for what we hold dear in this great country.  I 
will never forget my father's admonition to be involved and to 
take the opportunity to vote always.  I have done that and I 
encourage others to do the same, to be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As public figures we face the rigours of public scrutiny.  We 
need to be held accountable for our actions, as all people do. We 
have been entrusted with a really great responsibility. People 
are looking for leaders who are willing to be transparent, honest 
and ethical.  All successful organizations which stand the test 
of time are committed to these principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that organizations could flourish for a time even 
though they may neglect these ethical principles, but ultimately 
the lack of principle would lead to that institution's eventual 
demise.  That is why I believe that we can work together to pass 
a motion which was developed by the governing Liberals 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must give credit where credit is due.  The motion to appoint 
an independent ethics counsellor who reports directly to 
parliament was promised to Canadians in red book one.  We will 
allow the government to take credit for the initiative it brought 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a minute to rebut some of the arguments by the 
government that I have heard today.  There have been many 
attempts to deflect attention away from the motion by focusing on 
other issues.  It is a staid old measure in the government 
members' arsenal to deflect attention about their own actions by 
attacking others.  We are used to that.  Canadians are tired of 
those kinds of tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address specific points raised earlier in the House by 
the government House leader.  On several occasions in debate he 
said that the current ethics counsellor reports to the House of 
Commons.  He stated that the ethics counsellor reports on 
lobbyists activities and reports to parliamentary committees in 
regard to the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear and let Canadians understand the process 
under which the current ethics counsellor must operate.  He is 
appointed by the Prime Minister, paid by the government and 
reports to the Prime Minister in regard to conflict issues 
involving himself and his ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will not release the guidelines that the 
ethics counsellor uses and he is under no obligation to release 
any of these reports.  The ethics counsellor does not have 
investigative powers.  In essence, he is bound from being able to 
do what really needs to be done in order to have an independent 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assertion made by the government House leader in regard to 
the independence of the ethics counsellor was simply inaccurate 
due to the current process that is in place.  The government 
House leader went on to argue that if we did not have the current 
provisions in regard to the ethics counsellor in place brought in 
by the government, a future prime minister might say with regard 
to questionable activities “It is not my fault; ask the ethics 
counsellor”.  That was a point made by the government House 
leader.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assert that this may not only happen in the future but it is 
exactly what is happening with regard to the current Prime 
Minister's Shawinigan circumstances.  That is the current defence 
being offered by the Prime Minister in regard to the many police 
investigations into grants and loans in the Prime Minister's 
riding and in regard to his involvement with the Business 
Development Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to my colleagues that it is cold solace to any minister 
of the crown, or Prime Minister, to be cleared of any wrongdoing 
by a process that is so obviously flawed.  Would it not be better 
to have an independent ethics counsellor who could delve into 
allegations with investigative powers to clear up all details 
having to do with a conflict case?  That simply does not happen 
now under the current process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 23(3) of the conflict of interest code states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A public office holder shall not accord preferential treatment in 
relation to any official matter to family members or friends or 
to organizations in which they, family members or friends, have 
an interest— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit beyond all credibility for Canadians to accept the 
fact that the Prime Minister can pick up the phone for any of his 
constituents and call the president of the Business Development 
Bank of Canada and encourage him to grant a loan to a high risk 
file against the president's better judgment. That is simply too 
far of a stretch, but that is what the Prime Minister wants 
Canadians to believe in regard to the Duhaime case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister called the president on behalf of Mr. 
Duhaime, a friend who had taken the Grand-Mère hotel off his 
hands.  The most powerful elected official in the country 
intervened on behalf of a friend.  Something is very wrong with 
this picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become clear through the course of debate today that the 
government is unlikely to support its own idea promised to 
Canadians in its own red book.  The government, earlier today, 
attempted to pull some procedural tactics to change the entire 
intent of the Canadian Alliance motion, which I believe has the 
support of all opposition parties in the House.  It is indeed a 
sad day when the government engages in these types of tactics in 
an attempt to extricate itself from a very difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is hope though.  The Canadian Alliance will continue to 
work together with others in a non-partisan manner to bring forth 
suggestions, even suggestions presented by others, including the 
government, as is the case with the motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we willing to do that?  The opportunity for change is 
before us now, today.  Let us work together to make some concrete 
changes to restore the dignity of all members and the House of 
Commons.  Let all of us together signal to Canadians that we are 
less concerned about being right and more concerned about doing 
what is right for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to support this positive motion, first 
suggested by the government itself, brought forward by the 
Canadian Alliance today, and supported by all opposition parties. 
If we do that today, make a change and move forward, I believe we 
will set a positive tone in this place and restore the dignity 
and honour accorded to all hon. members from all parties who have 
made a great sacrifice to be here on behalf of their 
constituents.  If we are able to do that today, I believe we can 
send an important message to all Canadians.  Let us do that today 
and move forward on this initiative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask the member for Dewdney—Alouette a direct 
question.  I will resist taking a shot at him because of the 
ethics counsellor, the promises made, the level of debate in this 
place, the way we treat one another, the amount of respect we 
have for the House and the amount of respect we have for each 
other as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question that I was dying to 
ask the member for Waterloo—Wellington when he was up showing a 
complete lack of respect for this  institution and the members 
who sit in this institution.  I want to put forth to the member 
from Alouette a question on the behaviour of the Prime Minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question was asked of the Prime Minister this morning, but 
we did not get an answer, so I will ask the member from 
Dewdney—Alouette.  In January 1996 the Prime Minister confided 
to the ethics counsellor that he still had shares in the golf 
club adjacent to the Auberge Grand-Mère.  Although he thought he 
got rid of his shares in 1993, he found out in 1996 that he 
actually still owned those shares, which he had never received 
payment for.  We must understand that the value of these shares 
in the golf club adjacent to the Auberge Grand-Mère would be 
directly enhanced by any improvements made to the hotel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could anyone say there was not a conflict of interest?  The 
Prime Minister, within 90 days, was lobbying the president of the 
Business Development Bank of Canada on behalf of the owner of the 
Auberge Grand-Mère.  How can anyone say that did not directly 
influence and enhance the value of the shares in that golf club? 
I would like to hear an answer from the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague makes a 
good summary of a lot of details having to do with what appears 
obvious to most Canadians, that is, there is a conflict here with 
the Prime Minister and the things that have been happening in his 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the issues he raises, I think it is obvious to 
many people that although the Prime Minister claimed to have been 
cleared by the ethics counsellor, that process is broken and does 
not entirely reflect the facts of the matter.  If we were to get 
to the bottom of the facts and the details that are shrouded in a 
cloud of bureaucratic secrecy through the process the Prime 
Minister has established, I think it would be apparent to all 
that there is in fact a conflict in the situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to put a question to the member 
opposite.  There has been a lot of talk this day about 
ministerial and MP accountability.  Is it not true that the 
statement from the red book that forms the basis of the 
opposition motion under debate today makes no reference 
whatsoever to members of parliament or ministers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I do believe what the statement says is “to advise 
both public officials and lobbyists”.  Could the member explain 
if he does find anywhere in the motion reference to ministers and 
members of parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe the motion 
that we brought forward encapsulates the meaning directly from 
red book one.  That is my understanding.  We took some time to do 
that, because the Liberals, in bringing this item forward, had a 
very good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we would be surprised should the government choose 
to vote against such a motion, which it in fact introduced as a 
promise to Canadians in red book one.  I invite my colleague and 
all colleagues to support the motion.  It would be a positive 
step for now and for the future.

Madam Speaker, I have some preliminary comments on the matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a new member of the House.  Many voters told me in the last 
election that I was wasting my time coming to the House.  In 
their view, their members of parliament did not have an effective 
voice or say in the government of this country.  Many of them did 
not believe they were on the bus.  They were not in the back 
seat.  They were on the outside looking in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our academic people today have examined our 
parliamentary system and know it very well.  Basically, their 
conclusion is that we are creating a system of government which 
is presidential and does not really have any effective checks or 
balances built into it.  Mr. Diefenbaker many years ago pointed 
out some of the things that were happening in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to the House with an open mind.  I come here with the 
idea that we, as members of parliament, can improve the system of 
government, and I will give it a fair trial.  However, I come to 
the House with a lot of doubts in my mind.  Some of the things I 
heard this afternoon only confirm some of my worst beliefs about 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that I would like to start off with is; can Mr. 
Wilson, the ethics counsellor, given the process established by 
the Prime Minister's office, truly carry out this mandate in an 
impartial, objective and independent manner?  In no way do I 
question this individual's integrity in any way.  I believe Mr. 
Wilson to be an honourable and decent individual.  However, it 
has been my experience in life that a system dictates the 
results.  Excellent systems create excellent results, average 
systems create mediocre results and bad systems produce poor 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the process that has been established to investigate 
and report on serious wrongdoings by the Prime Minister or the 
ministers is a flawed, poor system.  People who work in a poor 
system are helpless to deal with that system and to affect the 
result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to point out some of the obvious defects with the 
system which have been created.  First, the Prime Minister's 
office has established the code of conduct for the Prime Minister 
and the ministers.  This is like asking the hockey coach to make 
up the rule book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the ethics commissioner is hired by the Prime Minister's 
office and in all apparent respects is placed in a position of 
master-servant with the Prime Minister being the master.  Once 
the ethics counsellor is finished with the allegation, he reports 
directly to the boss, the master, who is the subject matter of 
the very investigation.  The ethics counsellor is not directly 
accountable to the men and women who have been elected to the 
House to govern the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very old saying in our justice system, and I am sure 
all members have heard it before; not only must justice be done, 
it must appear to be done.  Because of a very flawed process, 
thousands upon thousands of Canadians do not believe in the 
integrity of the findings of the ethics commissioner.  They 
simply do not believe that those are correct results or an 
accurate assessment of what has taken place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said about Saskatchewan.  I am a member from 
Saskatchewan.  Anybody from Saskatchewan would realize, based on 
our experience, that we have to prevent these sorts of abuses of 
power from occurring again.  That means fixing the system and 
having a system in place that prevents those sorts of abuses of 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many respects the circumstances I heard in regard to this 
incident remind me of the sorts of incidents that occurred in 
Saskatchewan, but this is the Government of Canada.  I think many 
people in Saskatchewan see many similarities in some of these 
circumstances.  Everybody in the House should be concerned about 
those sorts of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this system to have the appearance of fairness and 
objectivity that people expect, the ethics counsellor must be 
dealing in a complete arm's length position, vis-à-vis the Prime 
Minister.  It is fairly apparent that a person with that type of 
position should be very akin to a judge.  He should have that 
sort of independence that we expect to find in our judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two points, as far as I am concerned, are not even close 
to being reality.  I would encourage all members of the House to 
support this very worthy motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I cannot resist a comment.  I find it 
very difficult to sit in the House and hear a member who has 
arrived here for the first time condemning what I believe is one 
of the best parliaments in the world.  It is also completely 
inappropriate and disrespectful of this place for him to make 
allusions to the problems that occurred in the legislature in 
Saskatchewan, which were of a deplorable and even criminal 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the type of thing that we expect from a brand new 
member in the House.  Maybe he should go back to his riding and 
consider that perhaps he has come to the wrong place for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would remind the 
member of what I believe I said and that was that I was coming to 
the House with an open mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I come from the reality is a large number of people firmly 
believe that the House of Commons is irrelevant.  The polls show 
that.  I am here to try to make this place relevant.   I want to 
see this federal system updated and reformed with a small <I>r</I> 
to make it relevant to people across the country so that 
everybody feels that they are part of it.  Then we would have no 
need to talk about alienation or disgruntled people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the learned member on the other side of the House does not 
realize that this system has to be updated in Ottawa, then he is 
living in a world that is out of touch with reality.   We have 
got to update our federal system and this is the time to do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the 
member across the way.  Quite frankly, any time any one of us in 
this House has run for politics, we have always been trying to 
make Canada a better place.  We put forward our ideas to the 
voters.  We take the chance and give the voters the opportunity 
to vote on whether or not they want us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member answer this question for me.  I will go to the 
issue of the pension on his side of the House.  The member for 
St. Albert had the fortitude to stand in front of his voters and 
say “I am going to go back into the pension”.  He put that up 
front so they could vote on it.  The members for Edmonton North 
and Medicine Hat went in front of the voters and were not honest 
with them.  They ran on the fact that they were not going to take 
the pension.  Then, less than three months after the election 
they vest back into the pension.  That is not fair.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party across the way talks about recall.  I would like the 
member to make a comment on whether or not he feels that these 
members should go back on recall to their voters and let their 
voters vote on whether or not they are going to take 
the pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remember how that 
was such a charged issue in the early 1990s.  Much of the public 
thought that was a sign that this place was irrelevant when these 
things were happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the predecessor party had a major impact on effecting 
the regimes in every province.  Alberta seriously reformed its 
gold plated pension plan.  It was one of the first things Mr. 
Harris did in this province.  In Saskatchewan Mr. Romanow 
reformed its pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only place that really has not reformed its pension system 
in a meaningful way I would say is the House.  The only way it is 
ever going to be changed is if people on this side of the House 
get more than 151 people on that side of the house. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague for 
Prince Albert on his first speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the hon. for member for 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey is under the assumption that my 
colleague has been here for seven years.  Perhaps he could be a 
little more observant.  He is in the current pension plan but he 
does not have a pension because he has only been here for a 
couple of weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another matter, I would like to ask my colleague a question— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sorry the 
members time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I sat through this debate for most of the 
afternoon and you will forgive me if I sound a little cross every 
now and then because one of the things that bothers me deeply is 
the kind of debate we have in the House when the opposition, in 
their zeal to score points against the government, which is right 
and proper, but in their zeal it attacks parliament and the 
integrity of members of parliament rather than attacking the 
government and this is the case in point. They have it all mixed 
up and very seriously confused. They have mixed up the issue of 
public service accountability and the accountability of members 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very pith of their motion is that they have gone to the 
Liberal red book of 1993 and brought out a paragraph that deals 
with the creation of an ethics counsellor.  They have taken that 
paragraph and put it in their motion.  The motion says that the 
House adopt the red book policy that says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—A Liberal government will appoint an independent Ethics 
Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the 
day-to-day application of the Code of Conduct for Public 
Officials. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say that the ethics counsellor will be answerable 
to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are having a little problem in reading.  That which I just 
stated makes no mention whatsoever of ministers or members of 
parliament.  Yet the debate throughout the entire day, not just 
with one opposition party but with other opposition parties, has 
been primarily targeting in on ministerial responsibility and 
ministerial accountability.  I might point out that the 
opposition members have very conveniently glossed over the 
question of MPs' accountability.  They all should know that there 
is in fact no code of conduct for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just consider that for a moment.  If we want a code of 
conduct for members of parliament, to whom do those members of 
parliament answer to? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the key to this debate, to understanding what the real 
issue is or what the real issue is not, is the reply that the 
Canadian Alliance member for Edmonton Southwest made to my 
question earlier in the debate.  I asked him whether he felt that 
MPs should be subject to a code of conduct and whether they 
should report to an external person such as an ethics 
commissioner who would be responsible for policing that code of 
conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Edmonton Southwest is a new member.  Probably 
because he is a new member of the Canadian Alliance, he was 
capable of replying with more candour than is normal for the more 
veteran members of the Canadian Alliance.  What he said in reply 
to my question was that in his view the best way to have control 
of parliamentarians was by the voters themselves and that we were 
directly responsible to the voters themselves as 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raises an interesting issue because there are things that 
we might say as MPs.  We might ask whether we are always ethical. 
Certainly there are issues that affect us as MPs which raise 
ethical questions.  Some of those ethical questions may pertain 
to how we deal with people who come to our riding offices and 
seek favours.  Those are real problems sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual MPs sometimes have to search their conscience.  They 
also have to ask themselves when 
they defend someone who comes to their riding for some government 
grant or another, they also have to search their conscience and 
ask whether they have done due diligence on that 
person.  If they have not done due diligence and are supporting 
someone then theoretically they have made an ethical breach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with other members.  For instance, I know of one 
member no longer in the House, so I can probably safely make 
reference to him.  He and other members too, in fairness, were 
inclined from time to time to take trips that were sponsored 
sometimes by foreign governments and in other instances by 
corporations.  It is a very real question in some of our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not all share the same opinion, but I can say as a former 
journalist that to take trips sponsored by a corporation or a 
foreign government was absolutely against the rules.  As a former 
journalist with the Toronto <I>Star</I>, we had a code of ethics, 
a code of conduct in a thick book which governed everything from 
what kind of gifts we could accept, how expensive those gifts 
could be, and absolutely condemned taking favours from 
corporations and foreign governments or anything else like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a question that could be before individual MPs, but if 
we were to poll individual MPs I think we would find tremendous 
variation in approach to what is ethical and what is not in this 
very fine area of whether or not we should listen to our 
constituents and what pressures or what favours we should take 
from lobbyists.  It is a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did try to address it with the Lobbyist 
Registration Act.  I was around when the Lobbyist Registration 
Act came forward in committee.  It is due to come forward again. 
I am glad it is coming back for re-examination because I never 
liked it then; it was an inadequate piece of legislation. Even 
so legislation was directed wholly toward the activities of 
lobbyists vis-à-vis civil servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where we come back to the point that they are trying to 
make.  Of course we have to have rules that govern the way 
lobbyists approach civil servants.  It is a serious problem in 
all governments when special interest groups with money bypass 
the political process and reach directly into the bureaucracy. 
That was a dreadful problem under the Conservative regime prior 
to 1993.  It was the subject of some books that would make one's 
hair curl.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The red book commitment was to bring public servants under a 
code of conduct and to advise public officials and lobbyists on 
standards of behaviour.  We did that.  We came out with a 
conflict of interest and post-employment code.  I have it here. I 
am not allowed to show things in front of the camera, but however 
I can assure people it is many pages long.  It describes in 
exquisite detail the responsibility of public officials. However, 
it does not apply to members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamentally good reason why it does not apply to 
members of parliament.  Members of parliament are here to be 
lobbied.  We are here so that people will approach us.  We are 
here to listen to the people.  We are here to listen to our 
constituents.  It is precisely the process of a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then ask ourselves why not have a code of conduct for members 
of parliament?  When this issue came up about five or six years 
ago, a joint House of Commons and Senate committee was struck to 
study the issue of a code of conduct for members of parliament. 
If it exists for journalists and public servants, why should it 
not exist for members of parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That joint committee deliberated for many months and I would 
like to think it had on it some of the most powerful talent on 
the Hill.  It concluded in the end that no code of conduct can 
apply to members of parliament because members are ultimately 
responsible to the voters.  The voters measure the integrity of 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony to that conclusion is it is precisely what the member 
for Edmonton Southwest said in reply to my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another thing that distresses me sometimes.  I have been 
in the House for seven years.   Whether there is or is not a code 
of  for MPs, I am willing to assure everyone in Canada who is 
watching that this is one of the finest collection of individuals 
with the highest level of integrity one could find in any corner 
of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I was upset by the allusions made by the member for 
Prince Albert who suggested in this place that members are not 
working in the best interests of not only their constituents, but 
in the best interests of the nation.  I have been here and have 
seen only people who work very hard.  I have only seen people who 
always search their consciences to determine if they are doing 
the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sometimes difficult when a member is in his or her 
constituency office and people approach and ask for help or the 
mayor asks to get a company into the riding because if it does 
not go into the riding there will be unemployment.  One has to 
balance these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say in absolute honesty that I do not know of a single member 
of the House who has in any way done something that I would have 
felt breached fundamental ethics or morals.  People have 
dilemmas.  They are not always sure what to do and whether it is 
always right.  I believe that the members of the House, and this 
is the strength of the House, have always acted in good 
conscience and with good heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now come back to the question of the ethics counsellor and 
the ministers and their relationship to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why we cannot have the ethics counsellor accountable 
to parliament and speaking to parliament is for the same reason 
that we cannot have MPs reporting to an ethics counsellor who 
then reports to parliament. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have the ridiculous equation where MPs are reporting to a 
person who reports to MPs.  Quite apart from that foolishness, 
the point is that ministers and the Prime Minister are members of 
parliament as well.  They are accountable to the voters.  In the 
end, the standards of ethics as perceived by the voters if 
disclosed in revelations by the opposition; if they have the 
goods on whatever ministers are doing then they disclose it in 
the House; and if the people feel that the behaviour of the 
ministers and indeed the behaviour of the Prime Minister is 
wanting then they have the opportunity to exercise the ultimate 
means of settling the matter.  They can vote everyone out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are accountable; the Prime Minister is accountable and the 
ministers are accountable to the voters.  It is the voters that 
determine the level of integrity in this place.  We cannot 
conduct ourselves in a manner that is unacceptable to the voters 
and survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was relevant in the debate today when allusions were made to 
the flip flops that had been done by the Canadian Alliance 
members with respect to the pensions that this is an ethical 
problem and it is an ethical problem that will be measured by the 
voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could stand here for days and complain.  After all the anger 
that was generated about fat pensions from the member for 
Edmonton Southwest and the member for Medicine Hat, do you know 
what happened in my riding, Madam Speaker, as a result of all 
that talk about gold plated pensions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one of my fall fairs I had a table with my Canadian flags and 
my brochures to meet the public.  The Canadian Alliance, the 
Reform at that time, set up a table directly opposite me in the 
laneway in the fall fair.  They had pigs there, little pink pigs, 
and labels that said “Sheila Copps”, “John Bryden” and “Bob 
Speller”.  Underneath the labels they had $750,000 for me and 
$1.5 million for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the most embarrassing thing imaginable because some 
60,000 people go through the Rockton International Fair on a 
weekend.  There they were promoting hatred for members of 
parliament.   If ever there was a case where members of 
parliament have committed an ethical breach, it is those former 
Reform Party members who, after criticizing the pension in such a 
vicious fashion, have turned around and bought back into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a question for an ethics commissioner.  This is not 
a question for an ethics counsellor.  They keep on confusing 
those terms.  This is not a question of a code of conduct.  This 
is a question that is going to be settled by the voters in their 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the issue we are looking at today.  The motion that they 
have before us is about the accountability of public servants. 
The government acted on the motion.  There is no reason to 
support the motion because it is already done, but they have used 
the opportunity of a motion that is a misdirection to attack the 
Prime Minister, to attack the integrity of all members of 
parliament.  I think that the people who will ultimately decide 
the fate of those on the other side who would make such 
groundless charges will be the voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  It being 6.15 p.m.,
