</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is the third time since I became a 
member of parliament that my property rights bill has been denied 
enough time for full debate.  This is the third time that MPs 
have been denied the opportunity to vote for or against 
strengthening property rights in federal law.  It is also three 
slaps in the face for each of the thousands of Canadians who have 
signed petitions supporting my bill.  So far I have personally 
received 578 pages of petitions signed by 13,729 Canadians from 
all across Canada who support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an insult to another major supporter of the 
legislation, the Canadian Real Estate Association, an association 
that represents more than 200 real estate boards in every 
province of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat for the third time in the House that it is time for us 
to make this bill, and all Private Members' Business that comes 
before the House, votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start the debate by asking a few questions.  I know they 
will be difficult questions for many Liberals to answer and 
almost impossible for the socialists in the House to understand 
but I am going to ask them anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does anyone own that the Government of Canada cannot take 
away from them?  The answer is nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone think they have any right to own the satellite dish 
they bought, paid duties and taxes on, and enjoy the programs 
they pay for and watch on their TV?  Does anyone think they have 
the right to own the gun that they legally bought to go target 
shooting or hunting with?  Does anyone think they have the right 
to own the money they paid into their own government pension 
fund?  Does anyone think they have the right to own and sell the 
crops they grow on their own land?  Does anyone think they have 
any right in Canadian federal law to be compensated for any 
property that the government takes away from them, including 
their own land? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone was thinking that as a Canadian citizen they had any 
of these rights or that somehow these rights were protected in 
Canadian law, I am sad to inform them that they are wrong.  The 
federal government can take anything anyone owns, anytime it 
wants, and there is not a thing anyone can do about it.  Only we 
in the House can do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the government's track record at taking the 
property from Canadians.  Over the years, an estimated 700,000 
Canadians have purchased direct-to-home satellite equipment, 
services and programs from the United States because the 
equipment, services and programs were not available to them in 
Canada.  This was a legal product that the Government of Canada 
collected both duty and taxes on.  The government then 
unilaterally passed a law that declared the equipment, services 
and programming people watched using their own satellite dish, 
their own decoder and their own television illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May of this year, the RCMP announced a crackdown on these 
made in Ottawa criminals.  My colleague, the member for Calgary 
Centre, made the directive public.  The RCMP directive states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although any such device or equipment brought into Canada may 
have had duty and taxes paid, the provisions of the 
Radiocommunication Act remain in effect.  The possession, use, 
sale, etc. of any such equipment is therefore illegal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Watching television illegally in Canada can result in a fine of 
up to $5,000 and/or up to 12 months in prison.  So much for the 
right to own and enjoy property in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 a farmer with a firearms licence issued by the federal 
government went out and bought a gopher gun, a firearm commonly 
used for hunting and sporting purposes, from a government 
licensed firearms dealer.  In 1995 the government passed Bill 
C-68 giving it the absolute power to prohibit any firearms if, in 
the opinion of the governor in council, really the Minister of 
Justice, he or she does not think the firearm should or could be 
used for hunting and sporting purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear by the noise in the background that the Liberals do 
not like this, but I think it is time they paid attention.  If 
the bureaucrats in the justice department think a gun looks 
dangerous and can convince the justice minister that it is 
dangerous, the minister can ban the gun by order in council. 
Section 117.15(2) of the criminal code gives the government such 
sweeping authority that it can ban any gopher gun without 
producing a shred of evidence that the firearm it is banning is 
dangerous. 
The government can ban any gopher gun even while ignoring factual 
evidence that the firearm is “commonly used for hunting and 
sporting” purposes.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can ban any gopher gun without any debate in 
parliament.  Nor is there any means of getting the prohibition 
reconsidered by parliament.  The government can ban any gopher 
gun without any statutory right of appeal for individual owners 
of these firearms because the criminal code does not contain any 
such rights of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can ban any gopher gun and declare the owners do 
not have any right to be compensated for the loss in value 
resulting from the government's arbitrary prohibition order and 
no right to be compensated even if the government confiscates the 
firearm from its lawful owner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, not even the Supreme Court of Canada could overturn the 
arbitrary prohibition order because it would be virtually 
impossible for any court to substitute its opinion for the 
opinion of the governor in council.  In fact, lawyers from the 
Library of Parliament confirmed this when they wrote, “courts 
would be loathe to find the governor in council acted in bad 
faith”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The punishment for possession of a prohibited firearm is 
imprisonment for up to five years.  So much for the right to own 
and enjoy property in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years, 670,000 federal public servants paid too much of 
their own salaries into their own government administered pension 
plans.  In May of this year, the government passed Bill C-78 
which declared that the surplus money these employees paid into 
their own pension plan was not theirs any more.  It was the 
government's.  The money the government stole was the property of 
its own employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do employees not have the right to own the portion of money they 
pay into their own pension fund?  Not if they work for the 
federal government.  If these contributions individuals made to 
their own public service pensions are not safe from the 
plundering by the federal government, what makes anyone think 
that the contributions they make to their RRSPs are safe?  So 
much for property rights in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Saskatchewan farmer, David Bryan, grew a crop of wheat on his 
own land.  He got into trouble when he tried to sell his wheat 
for a better price than the Canadian Wheat Board would pay him. 
The federal government charged Mr. Bryan with exporting his own 
grain to the United States without getting an export licence from 
the monopolistic dictatorial wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For violating this Soviet style decree, Mr. Bryan spent a week 
in jail, was fined $9,000 and received a two year suspended 
sentence. Mr. Bryan, with the help of the National Citizen's 
Coalition, appealed his conviction on the grounds that it 
violated his property right as guaranteed in the Canadian Bill of 
Rights and passed by parliament in 1960. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 4, 1999, the Manitoba Court of Appeal ruled against 
David Bryan's right to sell his own grain that he grew on his own 
land.  On page 14 of the ruling of the Manitoba Court of Appeal 
it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, which protects 
property rights through a “due process” clause, was not 
replicated in the Charter, and the right to “enjoyment of 
property” is not a constitutionally protected, fundamental part 
of Canadian society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone who is listening to this debate or who reads the 
record of this debate believe these words came out of the 
Canadian court of law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ruling confirmed what constitutional expert Peter Hogg 
wrote in his book <I>Constitutional Law of Canada</I>, Third 
Edition.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The omission of property rights from s. 7 (of the Charter) 
greatly reduces its scope.  It means that s. 7 affords no 
guarantee of compensation or even of a fair procedure for the 
taking of property by the government.  It means that s. 7 affords 
no guarantee of fair treatment by courts, tribunals or officials 
with power over the purely economic interests of individuals or 
corporations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is citation 44.9, page 1030.  Professor Hogg also wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The product is a s. 7 in which liberty must be interpreted as not 
including property, as not including freedom of contract, and, in 
short, as not including economic liberty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is citation 44.7(b), page 1028.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, without any protection of property rights and freedom 
of contract in the charter of rights and freedoms and with the 
courts ruling that the Canadian bill of rights does not provide 
any protection whatsoever from the federal government's arbitrary 
taking of property or infringing on our fundamental economic 
liberty, I decided it was time to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending the charter is a hugely complicated task because it 
requires a resolution to be passed in the House of Commons and in 
seven provincial legislatures, comprising about 50% of the 
population.  I decided to draft a bill to strengthen the 
protection of property rights in the Canadian bill of rights. 
Consequently, this would only strengthen the protection of 
property rights in federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In past debates the government has argued poorly that there is 
no need to strengthen property rights in federal law, that the 
Canadian bill of rights provides adequate protection of property 
rights.  The Bryan case proves that it is totally wrong on this 
count.  The bill of rights provides absolutely no protection of 
property rights.  Even if the government ignores the Bryan 
judgment, these rights can be overridden by just saying so in any 
piece of legislation passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill proposes to make it more difficult to override the 
property rights of Canadian citizens by requiring a two-thirds 
majority of the House.  My amendments would not tie the 
government's hands to legislate, but would send a clear signal 
that members of parliament think that adequate protection of 
property rights is so important that an override clause should 
pass a higher test in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the government agreed to abide by the so-called 
guarantees in the Canadian bill of rights, as currently worded, 
it would only protect three things:  the right to the enjoyment 
of property, the right not to be deprived of property except by 
due process, and the right to a fair hearing.  Unfortunately the 
bill of rights does not prevent the arbitrary taking of property 
by the federal government.  The bill of rights does not provide 
any protection of our right to be paid any compensation, let 
alone fair compensation.  The bill of rights does not provide any 
protection of our right to have compensation fixed impartially. 
The bill of rights does not provide any protection of our right 
to receive timely compensation.  Finally, the bill of rights does 
not provide any protection of our right to apply to the courts to 
obtain justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-237, my property rights bill, would provide this 
protection.  I offer the government this opportunity to take 
corrective action by voting to strengthen property rights in the 
Canadian bill of rights.  When passed by the House we could then 
work toward amending the charter of rights and freedoms, which is 
a much more complex process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention a couple of things in summation.  Why 
are property rights good?  There are three key reasons for which 
property rights are good and necessary.  First, they make society 
richer.  Second, they protect the freedom of individuals.  Third, 
they protect the environment.  Theoretically the protection of 
property rights makes society richer because those rights spur, 
through creative effort, the improvement of one's circumstances. 
Second, property rights protect the freedom of individuals 
because they allow people to make their own decisions about how 
to best use their existing possessions, including labour. 
Finally, property rights protect the environment because the 
problem of pollution is not that people pollute their own 
surroundings but that they pollute other people's surroundings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to briefly talk about the Magna Carta and the English 
bill of rights; however, I see that my time is up, Mr. 
Speaker, and I will have to do that another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These property rights have been around for a long time.  It is 
only recently that we have neglected them and failed to put them 
in our charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully request the unanimous consent of the House to 
make Bill C-237 a votable item.  I have given all the arguments 
for it.  I think there is much sympathy in the House for it.  In 
fact, many years ago it was passed and I think it is time we did 
it again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity this morning to speak to Bill 
C-237, an act to amend an act for the recognition and protection 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms and to amend the 
Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In brief terms this bill would amend the Canadian bill of 
rights.  The Minister of Justice feels strongly about the 
important role of property rights in our society.  Property 
rights represent one of the fundamental pillars of our legal 
system and our democratic society.  Indeed, our legal system is 
replete with protection for property rights.  However, the 
Minister of Justice cannot support the bill because it raises 
some very important concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian bill of rights already contains provisions for 
property rights in paragraph 1(a).  Bill C-237 would remove these 
provisions and would enact new and broader provisions dealing 
with property rights.  These broader provisions would have untold 
implications for federal laws.  For example, they could affect 
everything from federal laws dealing with pollution to 
shareholder rights to divorce laws making provision for the 
division of property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to look at the American experience with 
constitutional property rights to understand the implications of 
extending property rights.  In the United States property rights 
have been extended in ways that no one could have anticipated. 
This has led to huge amounts of litigation and has complicated 
and burdened the process of lawmaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early on in the history of the United States important social 
reforms were struck down by the courts in the name of property 
rights.  I am not saying that this kind of unfortunate judicial 
intervention would necessarily happen here, but to date no proper 
consideration has been given to this possibility.  One has to 
think very carefully before importing this kind of law into the 
Canadian context. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of property rights is, of course, an important 
principle in Canadian society.  No one in this Chamber would 
dispute that.  While agreeing with the principle of protecting 
property rights, we must be careful to have a clear 
understanding of the impact that the kind of legislation being 
proposed by the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville will have. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, as I have indicated, I think it is very important 
to remember that our legal system presently and appropriately 
acknowledges property rights.  The concept of property rights is 
fundamental to our legal system.  It is the basis of the 
operation of our economy.  This is reflected in the legal 
framework that governs our economy.  Every day property rights 
guide our actions in the way we do business.  Contract law, real 
property law, personal property law and so on are built on the 
concept of property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our legal system could not function without it.  As such, our 
legal system provides, as a matter of the common law that has 
been built over hundreds of years through court decisions, basic 
protections for property owners.  Hundreds of years of 
jurisprudence must not be lightly disregarded. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The common law provides basic protections for individuals 
regarding state action that affects their property, and statute 
law is also filled with protections for property rights. 
Whether we are looking at shareholder laws, banking laws, 
criminal laws or otherwise, these laws contain a wide variety of 
provisions that are designed to ensure fair dealing with 
property. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the Canadian bill of rights already 
provides protection for property rights.  As the member has 
pointed out, section 1(a) of the Canadian bill of rights provides 
for “the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of 
the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be 
deprived thereof except by due process of law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's bill would also amend the Canadian bill of 
rights in a way that is not consistent with the treatment of 
other rights in the Canadian bill of rights.  The bill would add 
charter-like provisions to the Canadian bill of rights that would 
be applicable only to property rights and not to the other human 
rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the Canadian bill of 
rights.  This would include new provisions dealing with imposing 
limits on rights, overriding rights, and obtaining judicial 
remedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not certain why property rights are treated differently.  I 
am not certain what the logic or rationale, if any, is for this. 
It seems to me that the bill is so focused on one issue that it 
does not recognize that the Canadian bill of rights contains 
other rights and freedoms, that the proposed changes do not fit 
in and that they do not treat all rights and freedoms on a 
consistent basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My reaction is that when we are dealing with something as 
fundamental as basic Canadian legal instruments for the 
protection of human rights, we need to examine all of the 
implications.  Let me be clear, property rights are fundamental 
to our legal system and society.  We will continue to support 
property rights and to promote respect for these and all rights 
of Canadians, but we cannot support a bill that unwittingly would 
put into jeopardy social and economic laws and policies that are 
important to the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the speeches 
of my colleagues on this private member's bill today and I found 
their arguments to be interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that there are two points of view on this issue, 
but I want to add another voice to the discussion this morning 
regarding property rights, which refers quite directly to the 
recent talks of the World Trade Organization in Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that we have gone out of our way in providing 
property rights to certain kinds of corporations.  Under the 
NAFTA and the provisions of the WTO, in the future more rights 
will be given to corporations to overrule the decisions of duly 
elected representatives of parliaments and legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the top of the list is the present initiative of Sun Belt 
Water Inc. of California, which wants to export fresh water from 
Canada to California.  Because the provincial government of 
British Columbia passed legislation which prohibited that 
particular initiative from proceeding, Sun Belt is suing the 
federal government, on behalf of the British Columbian 
government, under the provisions of the NAFTA for what it says 
could be as much as $10 billion in lost profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the ultimate in property rights being represented.  A 
company is saying that because elected Canadians, in their 
wisdom, chose legislation, in their judgment, to protect the 
welfare of future generations and the health of Canadians, it has 
property rights and it will sue for lost revenues that it would 
accrue in the future.  This is the ultimate in handing over 
rights to private corporations which will clearly, in many cases, 
go against the decisions of duly elected representatives of the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be more specific.  I could mention the legislation that 
we were driven into to protect patent rights for multinational 
drug companies.  We were under incredible pressure to regulate 
and to legislate in favour of multinational drug companies to 
give them a 20 year monopoly on any new drug.  We could debate 
whether 20 years is reasonable or whether it should be 2, 10, 50 
or whatever, but there was absolutely no choice that the 
intellectual property rights of international drug companies 
required us to pass legislation guaranteeing them monopoly rights 
on new drugs for 20 years.  One has to admit that is a very good 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think you will remember those days, Mr. Speaker.  The feeling 
was that we had no choice.  We were driven into legislating in 
favour of protecting intellectual property rights that would 
benefit multinational drug companies against the best interests 
of the consuming public.  When there is a monopoly drug 
situation, obviously there is not going to be any competition in 
the marketplace and people will be gouged.  I do not think the 
evidence has ever been refuted.  It is clear that because of the 
lack of competition by generic drug companies the prices for our 
drugs in this country are significantly higher than they normally 
would be or than they need be, which causes incredible pressure 
on our health care system, to say nothing of the consuming public 
in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about property rights, particularly as they focus 
on the corporate sector, this is getting close to Mecca.  This is 
as close to corporate heaven as one could possibly get. 
I could read all sorts of examples other than all the national 
drug companies that have been handed this incredible property 
right.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a controversy over some of the big forest companies 
and their forest practices.  People were saying that the 
legislation needed to be changed to stop the abuses of various 
forestry codes. The American companies said they would sue us for 
their lost profits if we imposed legislation to protect Canada's 
forests and stopped them from their cutting rights as they 
understood them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, American corporations have great property rights, much 
greater than Canadian corporations. I could throw in Mexico as 
well.  We have not been challenged by many Mexican companies but 
we have been by American companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be more specific.  In an article a little while back Time 
Canada Ltd. said that it would not have to make good on a threat 
to sue Canada for its pending magazine legislation.  We can 
debate magazine legislation and cultural legislation, but the 
reality is we have been interested over the years in 
strengthening our cultural sector through legislation to give 
Canada's cultural industries a bit of a hand up and assistance to 
enable them to get under way to compete in the international 
markets.  However, we have been reminded time and time again that 
if we assist our corporate sector particularly when it comes to 
culture, that they will sue.  They have the right now under NAFTA 
to do just that, and they want to expand that to include all 134 
countries under the WTO.  So there is time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote my friend Dalton Camp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I have lots of friends outside the realm 
of the New Democratic Party.  He wrote a very interesting article 
in which he said:  “Parliament approved Bill C-29.  It was a lot 
like motherhood.  MMT, a product of Ethyl Corporation of 
Virginia, has been banned in Europe and in California.  Almost 
every major U.S. petroleum producer, the minister said, had 
indicated support for the decision by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency to forbid MMT being marketed as a gasoline 
additive”.  He went on to point out that one-third of the 
American market, because of acute air pollution problems, 
prohibits MMT in these particular areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Europe does it.  The state of California does 
it.  One-third of the American market does it.  And so Canada 
said that we would also do the same thing, which we attempted to 
do in Bill C-29.  However, along came Ethyl Corporation which 
launched a $347 million lawsuit against the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These lawsuits by Sun Belt Inc. and Ethyl Corporation against 
the Government of Canada, were not against the Prime Minister and 
a handful of people sitting in some office.  Actually, the 
Government of Canada is the people of Canada, the taxpayers of 
Canada.  The Government of Canada is all of us, all 30 million 
people.  We represent those people in this place. When Ethyl 
Corporation sues the Government of Canada, it is suing the people 
of Canada.  Men, women and children from coast to coast to coast 
are being sued by Ethyl Corporation over the MMT issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what happened.  The government said to Ethyl 
Corporation that it was sorry, that it would back off and pull 
the legislation, that it would settle out of court for $20 
million and that it would also provide a written letter of 
apology. That is what we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about property rights.  Talk about corporate property 
rights.  One could not get a better provision than what we call 
chapter 11 under NAFTA which essentially guarantees the ultimate 
in corporate property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friend who sponsored this legislation has done it in 
the best interests of the constituents he represents as he sees 
it.  I do not think it is the right course when it comes to 
property rights in our country.  I am not a lawyer but lawyers 
have told me that about 90% of the cases in a law office are case 
law when it comes to property and that about 10% of cases refer 
to people.  In terms of property being protected, the track 
record is very very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues elsewhere will articulate other reasons that this 
legislation ought not to proceed.  I could talk about the 
provision of assets during divorce settlements as an initiative. 
If one of the spouses has property rights guaranteed and he or 
she owns 99% of the assets, how will that affect divorce 
proceedings in their settlements?  These are all arguments we 
have heard many times before.

Now they want to expand that through the WTO into virtually all

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-237, which is an act 
for the recognition and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strengthening property rights is a sentiment that we in the 
Conservative Party embrace wholeheartedly.  The party has a long 
history in this regard. This legislation would afford greater 
protection in the bill of rights for property rights for both 
individuals and corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was last before the House on October 1998. I 
congratulate the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville for bringing 
the issue of property rights back to the House of Commons.  He 
has been very dogged in his pursuit of this issue and his 
perseverance is duly noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate in a way because if the bill of rights was 
properly respected to the letter, this type of amendment would 
not be necessary.  Once again, it is to underscore or strengthen 
existing law to co-opt a good idea, so I think it is somewhat a 
statement of the obvious in some areas. The Progressive 
Conservative Party has always been a proponent of the rights of 
Canadians and in particular the rights to own and enjoy property. 
Fully and unconditionally we support this concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian bill of rights itself was enacted in 1960 by the 
Progressive Conservative prime minister of the day, John 
Diefenbaker.  It extended protection for the right to enjoy 
property, the right not to be deprived thereof except by due 
process, and obviously the right to a fair hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous comments at second reading I noted that in 1995 
the Progressive Conservative Party across Canada approved a new 
constitution which lists one of the four principles as the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A belief that the best guarantors of the prosperity and the 
well-being of the people of Canada are: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. the freedom of the individual Canadian to pursue their 
enlightened and legitimate self-interest within a competitive 
economy; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. the freedom of individual Canadians to enjoy the fruits of 
their labour to the greatest possible extent; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. the right to own property. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is in the Conservative constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of property rights has long been recognized as a 
fundamental aspect of social and economic justice in this 
country.  From the first settlers to those who faced the most 
overwhelming challenges of the size of this country, property was 
an immediate challenge.  Yet there are inconsistencies within the 
laws concerning property rights today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 17 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in 
association with others.  No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his property. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada ratified the UN Declaration of Human Rights over 50 years 
ago.  It underscores again the importance of these rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the costly and discriminatory Firearms Act, the 
government is depriving law-abiding Canadian citizens of their 
property. Let us not beat around the bush, this is what is at the 
principle of this bill.  I am referring specifically but not 
exclusively to rural Canadians who rely on the use of long guns 
for hunting, and farmers who use them for the protection of their 
livestock, for the elimination of predators.  It is viewed more 
as a tool and a farm implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon me at this point to say that on the 10th 
anniversary of the Montreal massacre it is perhaps ill-timed that 
we find ourselves debating this issue.  Anyone on either side of 
this gun registration debate I think would agree that we should 
be focusing on mourning the loss of the 14 bright young future 
leaders of our country who were gunned down in Montreal.  Yet the 
debate is here, it is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be noted that even with the current Firearms Act, 
nothing could have been done to prevent the psychopathic killer 
Marc Lépine from engaging in his shooting rampage.  Criminals 
simply do not register guns.  The Liberals' gun registry will do 
nothing to prevent gun related crime, but will impose 
increasingly expensive and discriminatory regulations upon 
law-abiding citizens.  Criminals will not participate in any form 
of legitimate gun registry.  The Conservative Party would repeal 
that element of the gun registry system. 
This is a narrowly focused law.  Other existing safety provisions 
introduced by the Conservative Party would be left in place, but 
the gun registry system would be gone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-237 is not of great concern to many Liberals because most 
of their support comes from urban Canada.  Only approximately 10% 
of the Canadian population would be immediately affected by this 
law.  Most Canadians do not register their firearms.  They do not 
have firearms to register.  The perpetual costs and inconvenience 
of this law is affecting mostly rural gun owning Canadians who 
live outside of city centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues like gun registry are a concern everywhere. Guns are 
property.  Law-abiding gun owners in rural Canada have a right to 
have guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent amendments to the Firearms Act unleash a 
discriminatory system on law-abiding property owners. The act was 
designed to put pressure on legitimate gun owners who have 
consistently demonstrated until now that they favour reasonable 
gun control and desire to live within the law.  It targets the 
wrong group. The criminal code is being used to run roughshod 
over property rights in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gun registry has been a complete failure, facing massive 
non-compliance by the over three million gun owners in Canada 
with seven million guns yet to be registered.  Provincial 
challenges at the supreme court level are indicative of broad 
disagreement about the approach the government has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the costs now spiralling into the area of $300 million, one 
has to question the priorities of the government with respect to 
crime in Canada.  As an example, $206 million has been set aside 
for the new youth criminal justice act over the next three years. 
This particular initiative has already cost Canadian taxpayers 
close to $300 million with very little impact, if any, on crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if registration could be processed on time, the cost is 
unreasonable to keep a farmer or a hunter from engaging in a very 
legitimate, legal exercise. Because the process has failed, many 
people will not register. The government will be confiscating 
property which legally belongs to the person in question without 
compensation.  Many may face arrest as a result of this criminal 
code amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recap, big brother can take our property without compensation 
and then throw us in jail. This will commence an unchecked growth 
in illegal gun sales around the country, encouraging sales on the 
black market. A panel of Liberal experts told the justice 
minister this would happen but she did not listen to that advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill denies and drives more legitimate owners into selling 
their guns or giving them up.  This will put more guns, illegal 
and otherwise, on the black market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that our prison system is suffering problems from 
funding and overcrowding.  We know that our police agencies are 
breaking down as a result of underfunding.  But the government is 
spending millions of dollars seizing law-abiding citizens' 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government spend more money on organized crime?  Not 
likely.  Will it set a greater priority for where the money 
should actually be spent?  It does not appear so.  There is a 
lack of consistency on the part of the government.  It is 
refusing to act on constitutional grounds with respect to this 
bill.  It, among other groups, will oppose it.  But the 
Progressive Conservative Party is going to support this bill for 
the reasons I have referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals rejected a truly effective DNA data bank system for 
similar reasons.  They said they were afraid of the legal 
consequences.  Yet they are going to keep a law that barely 
survived the Alberta Court of Appeal and is now going before the 
Supreme Court of Canada which we hope will succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have a duty to taxpayers to wait until the supreme 
court settles issues of constitutionality.  They should not be 
deterred or afraid by it.  The government suffers perpetually 
from charter constipation.  It has already spent close to $300 
million and counting. This will be followed by confiscation and 
lengthy court battles as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government argues that property rights are already 
adequately protected under the Canadian bill of rights.  If it 
cannot continue, this will violate article 17 of the UN 
Declaration of Human Rights by arbitrarily taking property from 
Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party does not want to limit the government's ability to 
legislate.  It needs to be constantly reminded that its powers to 
override property rights go against individual rights in this 
country.  There is a delicate balance that must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of property rights in our constitution is also very 
problematic.  The omission of property rights from section 7 of 
the charter greatly reduces the scope of the charter in this 
regard.  It means that section 7 affords no guarantee of 
compensation or a fair procedure for the taking of property by 
the government. It also means that section 7 affords no guarantee 
of fair treatment by courts, tribunals or officials with powers 
over purely economic interests of individuals or corporations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus section 7 “liberty must be interpreted as not including 
property, as not including freedom of contract, and, in short, as 
not including economic liberty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-237 will help enhance the protection that most people 
thought they already had under the constitution.  It does not try 
to change or challenge the charter because this is a complicated 
process.  Rather, it tries to strengthen property rights and 
provisions of the bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 237 would also accord greater strength to the charter of 
rights and for Canadians to enjoy property.  It would also 
enhance the right to be paid fair compensation, to have fixed 
compensation, to have timely compensation and to apply to the 
courts to obtain real justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-237 recognizes that the gun registry system has not been 
working.  The protests and legal challenges continue to mount 
against the existing Firearms Act, but the Liberal government is 
not using its good discretion.  It is abusing its authority.  We 
need legislation such as Bill C-237 more than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to send a message to those who do oppose 
gun registration.  Today is the day to remember the 14 women who 
died at École Polytechnique.  It is a day to remember that 
violence against women still exists.  The PC Party feels that 
this particular bill is worthy of support.  We want to send our 
condolences to those affected by this massacre.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to join my hon. colleague for 
Yorkton—Melville who has led the way in the House on the issue 
of property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is exciting to be part of a debate in the House that gets 
right to the heart of important philosophical questions about the 
scope of government and the importance of individual freedom.  I 
applaud my colleague for his integrity and his perseverance in 
the campaign to awaken Canadians to the frightening realization 
that property ownership is not a right in this country but a 
so-called privilege that the government grants and can take away 
at its whim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so special about property rights?  Nobel laureate 
Frederick Hayek wrote “Private property is the most important 
guarantee of freedom”.  More than any other social or political 
institution, the institution of private property is the primary 
mechanism by which we separate those activities and those choices 
which properly belong to government and those activities and 
choices which should be left within the jurisdiction and control 
of private citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never limit the size and scope of government without 
clearly defined private property rights.  Even the NDP wants to 
limit the size and scope of government.  Nobody wants to live in 
a country in which the government has no limits on its power to 
intrude into our lives.  The solution to intrusive government 
should be simple, but Canadians have no legal right to own 
property.  The institution of private property does not exist in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case any member of the House is unaware of the lack of 
constitutional protection for private property, I will 
provide some statements to my colleagues of various expert 
opinions on property rights in Canada: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrary taking of private property by the government without 
compensation would not seem to be justified.  However, the law 
clearly gives the government the right to pass legislation that 
takes private property without providing compensation, if the law 
so states.  In Canada there is no constitutional guarantee for 
compensation and the power of the government in this area is 
unlimited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was written by Gerald Lafreniere, Law and Government 
Division, Research Branch, Library of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several things are clear.  The Charter has never before and still 
does not protect economic liberty or property rights.  A 
deliberate choice was made to exclude them from the 
document...Those who assert that the Charter guarantees Canadians 
freedom to deal with their own property as they wish are flying 
in the face of unvarnished truth that the Charter does not even 
contain a freedom from State confiscation of Canadians' property. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement was made by Justice F. C. Muldoon in the judgment in 
Archibald v the Canadian Wheat Board case of April 11, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The product is a s. 7 in which liberty must be interpreted 
as not including property, as not including freedom of contract, 
and, in short, as not including economic liberty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was written by Professor Hogg.  I think it speaks to the 
essential connection between economic liberty and property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on.  There are many more legal scholars who repeat 
the same fact that Canadians lack the constitutional protection 
against the violation of their right to own property.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples of property rights violations or 
potential violations in the country.  I want to give the House a 
taste of the scope of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, farmer Andy McMechan was shackled, strip searched and 
imprisoned for five months for selling his grain, his property, 
without the approval of the Canadian Wheat Board.  He was allowed 
to go home for Christmas only after surrendering his tractor to 
Canada Customs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After January 1, 2001, 555,000 short-barrelled handguns will 
forcibly be confiscated as a result of an arbitrary government 
prohibition of these firearms.  Law-abiding gun owners have been 
told to turn in an estimated $280 million worth of property for 
destruction or disposal and will not be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also share a personal example on the issue of private 
property, which I have spoken about before in the House.  My 
family came here as refugees, as millions of other Canadians who 
have been in similar circumstances.  When we had to leave the 
country of Uganda our property was completely confiscated.  My 
parents lost everything they had worked for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, when we come to this country there is a respect of law 
and order and that gives people a great sense of hope and belief 
in the country.  Why not strengthen that element of property 
rights, as being proposed in this bill by my colleague for 
Yorkton—Melville?  It would put the hearts and minds of people, 
who have been through the terrible experience, as was my family, 
of losing everything due to the lack of concern for property, at 
rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example of an organization that has worked hard 
to promote the idea of property rights, which was given the 
runaround by the Department of Revenue's charities division with 
a complete runaround.  I bring up the case because it relates 
directly to property rights and to the Canadian Property Rights 
Research Institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>National Post</I> nominated the charities division of 
Revenue Canada as the slowest moving department in Ottawa.  I 
wish to also nominate the bureaucrat in charge of the department, 
Mr. Neil Barclay, for the dubious honour of being the laziest 
civil servant in the federal government today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In processing the application for charitable registration by the 
Canadian Property Rights Research Institute, Mr. Barclay received over 20 
phone calls and letters from opposition and government 
parliamentarians alike.  After two and a half years of broken 
promises and delays, CanPRRI has been denied its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Mr. Barclay was busy approving the applications of various 
other groups, the Canadian Property Rights Research Institute has 
been ignored and mistreated by a bureaucrat with an ideological 
bone to pick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the revenue minister will address this problem in the 
charities division and will insist on a departmental review of 
this application for charitable status. We know how important 
property rights are in the country and we need to continue to 
promote institutions that are willing to fight for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken today about a number of cases.  My colleague for 
Yorkton—Melville spoke about the importance of property rights. 
We have a chance to make a decision today and work toward 
strengthening private property rights in the charter of rights 
and freedoms.  I also call on my constituents and indeed all 
Canadians, who believe in the freedom of limited government, to 
demand that the government protect their fundamental rights to 
keep the products of their labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property rights might seem abstract but the simple act of 
locking one's door at night is an exercise of private property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did you know, Mr. Speaker, that the campaign to end slavery in 
the United States was based on the principle of self-ownership, 
an idea that was advanced centuries earlier by philosopher John 
Locke.  John Locke believed that the right to self-ownership is a 
foundation of the right to material property.  I stress this 
point to assure my colleagues that the private property debate is 
not just about land and wealthy landowners; it is a debate that 
affects us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, many Canadians take property rights for granted 
and do not understand that real individual rights begin with the 
right to own and to control private property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the House can do something that would strengthen 
the institution of private property and guarantee that Canada 
remains a free and prosperous nation.  They can work together to 
demand that the charter of rights and freedoms no longer excludes 
the protection for the fundamental right to own, use and enjoy 
private property.

Speaker, I was home recently and the issue of property rights 
became a very important issue as I moved about my constituency 
and held five town hall meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I visited one of the farms, I was quite taken with a rifle 
that was hanging above the fireplace.  The gentleman explained to 
me that this particular French rifle was now in his hands after 
five generations.  He does not know if it works but it is a very 
precious commodity.  Of all the things he could trace from his 
ancestors, who came from France to Quebec, later emigrating to 
Michigan and then to Saskatchewan, this was the family's pride. 
This was also the pride of my 10 year old grandson.  However, 
because we do not have the right in this country to own property, 
potentially that family heirloom could be seized without any 
recourse in law at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  No, it is not nonsense.  It is absolutely 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own area, I could drive on a back road and see four or 
five signs pointing out endangered species.  Nobody protects 
endangered species like the people in rural Saskatchewan.  Do 
members know what they genuinely fear?  They fear that all of 
these signs could be taken down.  If the government sees these 
endangered species signs, and the species the farmer is 
attempting to protect, it could, under new legislation coming and 
because there is no right to own property, confiscate any portion 
of that land. This is not just dreaming, this is actual fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau's name came over the radio last night because it seems 
that he will be named the parliamentarian or the politician of 
the century.  Who was it who argued vigorously and repeatedly 
for the inclusion of property rights in the charter of rights and 
freedoms?   He went to great lengths to guarantee Canadians the 
right to own property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resolutions were passed in the legislatures of British Columbia, 
Ontario and New Brunswick supporting inclusions of property 
rights in the charter but we do not have them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legal support is needed for the protection of property rights. 
The government knows this is a good bill.  My colleague has taken 
it to the committee and has argued three times to have the bill 
become votable, but for no clear, enunciated reason, can anyone 
on that side of the House offer a reason why that cannot be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way things are going in Canada, as we are moving from a 
democracy to a jurocracy, Canadians need to be worried.  We in 
the Reform Party are worried about what is happening to the 
democratic principles in Canada.  We are worried that more and 
more legal decisions and more and more legislations are being 
passed outside of these chambers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell the hon. members opposite that the fear they have about 
giving Canadians the right to own property will come back to 
haunt them.  By denying my colleague's bill, not once but three 
times, it will indeed come back to haunt them in the near future.

colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-237 would amend the bill of rights to provide added 
protection for Canadian citizens from the arbitrary decisions 
made by the federal government to take their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the arguments the Liberals put forward. They all 
stem from the fact that it would limit them in their ability to 
legislate and override the rights of citizens to own property. 
They fear that their power as government would be undermined. 
They point to the bill of rights as enough support.  The courts 
have clearly demonstrated that it was because it was not included 
in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that it is not 
constitutionally protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals point out that there have been hundreds of years of 
jurisprudence to support property rights.  However, in a few 
court decisions now, our courts in Canada have overridden all of 
that jurisprudence which stems back to 1215 and the Magna Carta. 
I think it is time we fixed that in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the NDP members. They tried to spin my bill as 
protecting the corporations.  Only corporations can challenge the 
legislation or can afford to challenge it I suppose. However from 
the speech by the hon. member of the NDP it became clear that 
corporations are better protected in Canada through NAFTA than 
are individuals.  His arguments were really a support for what I 
am trying to do today and indicated the need for property rights 
within our Canadian context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 17(2) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights states: “No 
one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property”.  Voters in 
this country have to know that the federal government by its own 
legislation, legislation that government members have supported, 
condones the arbitrary taking of property in direct contravention 
of article 17 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be honest and up front and not be hypocritical in our 
debate today.  Members of the Liberal government should hang 
their heads in shame rather than parade around the world claiming 
to be defenders of fundamental human rights.  What a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1903 Pope Pius X wrote to his bishops: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right of private property, the fruit of labour or industry, 
or of concession or donation by others, is an incontrovertible 
natural right; and everybody can dispose reasonably of such 
property as he thinks fit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have heard the proof that our fundamental property 
rights are under attack. Are we just going to ignore it?  Just 
because a bill is passed in parliament does not make the use and 
abuse of government force to violate fundamental property rights 
and freedom of contract of its citizens a good thing.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-9—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now ready to rule on 
a point of order raised by the House leader for the official 
opposition on Thursday, December 2, 1999 concerning the 
acceptability of report stage motions related to Bill C-9, an act 
to give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement, which were 
refused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion that the hon. member submitted sought to append 
the Nisga'a Final Agreement and Appendices as a schedule to Bill 
C-9.  The member was informed by the Journals Branch that his 
motion was not in order and could therefore not be placed, 
pursuant to Standing Order 76.1(2), on the Notice Paper. A second 
motion seeking to add the Nisga'a Nation Taxation Agreement as a 
schedule was also refused for the same reasons. The member argued 
that the Speaker or the staff of the Journals Branch could have 
made the necessary corrections to ensure that his amendments were 
in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding to the substantive issues raised, let me state 
that the onus has always been on members submitting amendments to 
ensure that they are in order.  There were however, more 
substantive reasons for ruling these motions out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Langley—Abbotsford made reference in his 
presentation to a ruling delivered by Speaker Beaudoin on May 17, 
1956 and found on pages 567-569 of the <I>Journals</I>.  I have 
read the ruling and was struck by what was said by my 
predecessor.  At that time, in dealing with an issue having some 
similarities to the present case, the Speaker stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it was customary not to include agreements in bills providing 
for the carrying in to effect of these agreements. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further drew members' attention to chapter 71 of the Statutes 
of 1948 in which are found an act to provide for carrying into 
effect treaties of peace between Canada and Italy, Romania, 
Hungary and Finland, in which none of the agreements were 
included. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A more recent example of this practice can be found in the James 
Bay and Northern Quebec Native Claims Settlement Act, which was 
assented to on July 14, 1977. Members consulting that statute 
will find that the agreement that is referred to throughout the 
act has not been appended to it as a schedule. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, the member is quite right in stating that a 
schedule containing an agreement or treaty has often been 
included in bills.  Where agreements or treaties have not been 
tabled in the House, this may be a convenient way of providing 
information for the use of parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to turn to the citations in Beauchesne's<I> </I>that 
the opposition House leader made reference to in his arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them—citation 704—makes it abundantly clear that the 
addition of a schedule of this type to a bill is not necessary. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another section of Beauchesne's sixth edition, a criterion is 
provided under which the Speaker will not permit an amendment to 
be proceeded with.  In particular, an amendment is not acceptable 
as stated in subsection 3 of citation 699 if it is deemed that it 
would have no effect or was unnecessary.  This principle is found 
as well on page 526 of the 19th edition of Erskine May.  One 
reason behind this rule is simply to prevent the House from 
voting needlessly.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, this particular question is not one with 
respect to which an established practice or clear procedure 
exists.  In trying to address this point of order, I have looked 
back to my predecessors and I find that they have not had to 
directly address this specific issue.  Despite what might be 
regarded as a principle precluding such proposed amendments in 
Beauchesne's citations 699 and 704, I am prepared to grant the 
benefit of the doubt to the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford 
in this instance.  I am willing to allow the proposed motions to 
be considered by the House, albeit in a slightly altered form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress that this is not a matter of technical detail.  Since 
the agreements have previously been tabled in this House, the 
motions in amendment should refer specifically to the tabled 
documents.  This will ensure that the text inserted in the bill 
pursuant to these motions is consistent with the documents 
already laid before the House. Accordingly, the form of the 
motions which will be proposed to the House will read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-9 be amended by adding after line 8, on page 10, 
Sessional Paper No. 8525-362-2, <I>The Nisga'a Final Agreement 
and related Appendices</I>, as Schedule 1. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And second: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-9 be amended by adding after line 8, on page 10, 
Sessional Paper No. 8525-362-3, The Nisga'a Nation Taxation 
agreement, as Schedule 2. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, these new motions will be numbered 470 and 471, 
will be grouped for debate in Group No. 5 and voted on 
separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford 
for drawing this matter to the attention of the House.

consent for the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That at the conclusion of today's debate on report stage of Bill 
C-9 all questions necessary to dispose of the said stage of the 
said bill be deemed put, a recorded division requested and 
deferred until the end of government orders on Tuesday, December 
7, 1999. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. chief government whip 
have the unanimous consent of the House to propose the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it has been said that this treaty, this agreement, is a matter 
introduced overnight.  I would simply remind this House that in 
the three year run-up to the signing of the treaty no less than 
500 public meetings and consultations were held, 296 of them in 
the Nass Valley and 13, no less, in a row, with a group of 
non-aboriginal residents.  If we compare this to city 
constituencies, it is an astonishing degree of public 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In approaching this agreement we must remember that it becomes 
law as far as the federal government is concerned, as far as 
federal constitutional law is concerned, with this enabling law. 
The enabling law is the product of considerable discussion 
between members of parliament and the former minister of Indian 
affairs, the hon. member for Brant, who is now in another 
portfolio, but it does contain one very important factor which 
has been addressed by some people from outside and was the 
subject of representations which I made to the minister.  It 
includes an express legal stipulation that the treaty is subject 
to the constitution and the charter of rights.  That is in the 
treaty itself, but to make assurance doubly sure I asked the 
minister to include this in the federal enabling legislation.  It 
is there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, I advised the minister that I and other members would 
be stating that our vote is cast on that basis.  We would have 
the third assurance, les travaux préparatoires, of which the 
courts must take notice of the parliamentary intent that the 
treaty, as enacted by parliament, is subject to the charter and 
to the constitution.  It means that there can be no provincial 
status, no third order of government unless it goes through the 
amending procedures, part V, sections 38 to 49 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these corrections were necessary because of doubts that 
I had in relation to section 35(3) of the charter of rights which 
was not in the original charter but added in 1983, 12 months 
after its adoption.  It applied to future treaties what was 
clearly applied in section 35(1), the original draft to existing 
treaties.  Those existing treaties, all of them, were a known 
quantity, and we had all studied them, and they were clearly 
within the constitution and the charter that was being adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To remove uncertainty I suggested at that time to the new 
minister of justice, one of our most distinguished jurists, Mark 
MacGuigan, the need for clarification.  He thought, I think 
correctly, that it would be an extreme interpretation to say that 
this was a back door way of changing the constitution, that it 
could be settled in the future.  In my view it has been done 
adequately and completely with the federal enabling legislation, 
the federal enacting law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back to some other points on which the minister gave 
assurances to members of parliament that the treaty would not be 
a template for the remaining 50 treaties.  It rests on its own 
special facts, among which is the fact that the Nisga'a leaders 
and the federal negotiators were superbly informed, they 
negotiated in good faith and with restraint.  These conditions 
might or might not be replicated in future treaties because 
different federal teams take part.  Every future treaty will have 
to be defended and supported on its own special sociological 
facts. Nisga'a stands alone.  It is not a template. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think when we get to the cities and municipal areas where 
conflicts of interest might reasonably be expected between 
different categories of rights, such as fee simple rights and 
claimed historic rights, that perhaps we need different and more 
advanced machinery, and I will come to that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recommendations to the Ministry of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development as to future treaties, I have made these 
suggestions.  In respect of all future treaties, the same 
principles and terms should be applied and the federal enabling 
legislation should cite that it is subject to the supremacy of 
the constitution and the charter of rights.  In fact, this 
means that the principles of procedural due process of law, 
judicial review and, among other things, the principle of 
equality before the law and equal protection of the law are 
applicable.  They are the supreme law of the land and in cases of 
conflict can be raised before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In respect of future treaty negotiations we also suggested that 
it be understood that the parties be required to undertake 
negotiations in good faith, which is a legal principle in 
international and constitutional law.  They must also apply the 
principle of good neighbourliness, which is one of the oldest 
principles of civil law.  It is part of the common law.  In cases 
of breakdown there should be resort to the principle of 
arbitration and third party settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need improvement of facilities for judicial review.  One of 
the problems we have had with cognate cases, not connected with 
the Nisga'a but the subject of some representations in the last 
few days to the parliamentary committee, is with the Federal 
Court of Canada.  As an ambulatory federal court, it is not 
perhaps as fully seized of local social economic facts as local 
courts. It may be that there should be consideration given to 
establishing a mixed claims tribunal with developed expertise in 
economic issues, or else to investing provincial supreme courts, 
which after all are permanent courts in the locality, with 
competence to adjudicate economic evidence on reference. 
I simply say that these are suggestions for the future treaties 
still remaining.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very useful suggestion is to include representatives of 
municipal and other elected governments in the negotiation 
processes for future treaties.  The Union of British Columbia 
Municipalities has established a list of five principles.  I 
think it makes sense because the local bodies have special 
expertise in relation to local water and power supply, as well as 
property title issues, and their expertise can be brought to 
bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention all this simply to say that Bill C-9 has been 
adequately considered and discussed.  There have been three years 
of public consultation.  It was open at all times to the 
parliamentary committee, if it wished, which is an all party 
committee.  It has a single member majority on the government 
side.  The opposition had only to ask for more detailed hearings. 
There was a strange silence in some areas of the opposition over 
those three or four years when jurisdiction could have been 
exercised in relation to the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found this again in relation to a matter to which we gave some 
attention, Bill C-49, the native lands administration bill.  It 
was reported by the committee with only one minor amendment, 
which had the unanimous endorsement of the committee.  It was 
only at the last minute that we realized there were problems that 
should be addressed.  With the co-operation of members of the 
House and the Senate, both Conservative and government members of 
the Senate, changes were made to Bill C-49, the native lands 
administration bill, which incorporated the principles of due 
process and similar guarantees that are certainly part of the 
federal enabling law in relation to the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put out four newsletters to my constituents after the signing 
of the treaty, perhaps about 6,000 words of detailed legal 
material, and asked for comments.  The comments came back.  They 
were passed on to the minister.  The changes the minister of 
Indian affairs made to the federal enabling law, in the text of 
the law, were as a result of representations made by 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is participatory democracy in action.  I think it 
is the way to proceed with legislation.  It is the best way to 
ensure that in the run-up to the 50 remaining treaties in British 
Columbia we can produce agreements without discord.  We do not 
want 19 long summers of discontent in British Columbia.  Our 
economy needs help.  There are other matters to attend to.  In 
good will and in good faith I think we can proceed with the 
further treaties.  I recommend adoption of the federal enabling 
law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member who has just spoken said that this is 
not a template of settlements to come.  If he would travel across 
Canada, as I did this past week, travelling across my 
constituency, he would not adhere to that particular hope or wish 
because it is already being stated across Canada by leaders of 
other Indian peoples that it will be a template.  It was stated 
in my province about four days ago that it will be a template. 
To say that this will not be followed across Canada is sheer 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this past week I had the privilege of travelling across 
my constituency where there are six native reserves.  They are 
all fine people and we get along well, but the point I want to 
make is that they are waiting.  They are waiting because there 
are some land claims to be settled.  By that time, with the 
government's help, the Nisga'a treaty will become a reality, and 
they will follow it all the way through.  It is what they will 
use in all future negotiations concerning land settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tract of land in northern Saskatchewan last week, as big as 
the entire Prince Albert National Park, was allotted to the Lac 
La Ronge band.  They themselves say “Wait until the Nisga'a 
treaty comes down and we will see what happens”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the myths that came out of this whole thing was that it 
was just another type of municipal government.  Nothing could be 
further from the truth. I served in local governments for a total 
of 21 years.  I served in the provincial legislature for a term 
and now I am here. A municipal government anywhere in Canada is 
nothing but a creation of the provincial government in the 
province in which it is located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happens under a provincial government. The province 
states that municipalities must have regular elections. The 
provincial government spells out the electoral process.  I do not 
see that.  After the electoral process is spelled out, then what? 
The municipality must have a bonded administrator.  That is a 
requirement of the provincial government.  On top of that it must 
prepare a budget statement that must be forwarded to the 
province.  At the end of the fiscal year it must then have a 
bonded chartered accountant to make sure the books are in order. 
When that takes place, it is printed and distributed among the 
citizens of the municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has created the myth that it is just another 
municipal government.  It is a brand new level of sovereignty 
created in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in Prince Albert the native workers at the casino 
decided they would unionize. With the help of the Canadian 
automobile workers, a union was created.  There was going to be 
an argument but the three or four chiefs stepped back until the 
next day. They said that the building will soon be sitting on 
reserve land and when they get sovereignty like there is under 
the Nisga'a treaty the chiefs said they will not have to adhere 
to the labour regulation board in Saskatchewan and will not have 
to listen to the labour regulations of the Government of Canada 
because they will be a sovereign state.  I wonder why they are 
talking that way already before using Nisga'a as a template.  Why 
are they saying it is nothing but a municipal type of government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each province has a right to establish certain laws.  The 
province in which I live has a highway traffic act. The 
municipalities within the province of Saskatchewan cannot create 
their own highway traffic act.  The province of Saskatchewan also 
has the right to contain within legislation hunting rules and 
regulations.  A municipality cannot do that.  The province of 
Saskatchewan has the right to have a labour relations board.  The 
municipalities cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the federal government trying to tell Canadians that this 
treaty is just another form of a municipality?  That is simply 
false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked with the Nisga'a people for one full year.  I taught 
there for a year. I have many friends who live there.  Let me 
say, they are afraid of the bill because of the various things I 
have just mentioned.  They want to enjoy the clear-cut 
accountability the rest of us have.  They do not want to be 
subject to a rollover to the same type of government which gives 
them more power but less accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces do not have a right to control trade.  That is not 
within their jurisdiction. That is the federal government's. Yet 
enshrined in this new type of municipality is a right to trade. 
That is fine but do not come out and tell the people that it is 
just another municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger is that we are creating, and could create very 
quickly in 10 years, 100 Nisga'a type treaties all across Canada, 
all a separate legal entity unto themselves. 
Can we see the map of Canada being drawn up with 100 different 
principalities, each creating their own labour laws, each 
creating all of those things that we give to the province and the 
federal government?  What are we doing?  We are dividing Canada 
into principalities and we are not doing anything to improve the 
overall governance level among our native people.  That is wrong.

It needs to be improved but this bill simply does not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended five town hall meetings last week dealing with a very 
serious issue in agriculture.  At each meeting the participants 
voluntarily got into this topic. They are concerned. They are 
very intelligent people.  We cannot tell the people that this is 
just another form of municipal government because it is not. We 
are granting sovereign power.  In many cases it is sovereign 
power that the province does not have.  In many cases it is equal 
to and can challenge the federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not just admit it?  Why does the government continue to 
propagate this myth that it is just another type of government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want my grandchildren to have the same right that I have today 
and that is to go down to my school division—and I sign 21 of 
those—and ask for an audited financial statement.  It must be 
due at a certain time every year.  Why is the government saying 
that this is another municipal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the right to vote at a specific, regular time for the 
people who serve in my town or in my school division.  I want to 
know that all of the moneys are being handled in accordance with 
the law of the province in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious thing.  We are not doing our native 
people any service or any value unless we instil within the bill 
the municipal type of accountability on a regular basis.  Ask the 
young people, ask the women and ask in many cases the chiefs. 
That is what they want and it is not in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going to proceed with this legislation. It 
will be to the detriment not just of the natives of the country 
but it very definitely is going to be to the detriment of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg hon. members to stop spreading the myth that it is just 
another municipal type of government.  That indeed is a myth. 
That myth is not selling in my province one iota. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to this very important Nisga'a treaty.  It 
is historic and one that all Canadians will benefit from as a 
result of the movement of this government and I believe 
rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Nisga'a agreement is an important page in Canada's 
history, I would like to take this opportunity to set out some of 
the facts surrounding this very important legislation. Perhaps 
even in the process I will correct some of the myths perpetuated 
by the Reform Party, including the member for Souris—Moose 
Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost I must stress that the Nisga'a treaty was 
negotiated within the constitutional framework of Canada. 
Everything done in the treaty was done in keeping with the 
constitution just as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes 
and affirms the existing aboriginal treaty rights of the 
aboriginal peoples of Canada. However, we do not know precisely 
the nature, scope or extent of these rights.  In many 
circumstances unresolved claims of aboriginal rights have 
hindered economic development. Accordingly a number of cases have 
been brought before the courts in Canada in an effort to define 
aboriginal rights. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1325

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these court decisions we have learned a great deal about 
aboriginal rights but not enough to resolve once and for all the 
disputes arising from continuing claims of aboriginal people.  In 
the most recent cases for example dealing with the existence and 
nature of aboriginal rights in British Columbia, the Supreme 
Court of Canada found that in the absence of treaties, lands in 
that province may be subject to aboriginal title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important is the fact that the courts have told us that 
aboriginal rights are group and site specific.  That means that 
wherever the courts consider issues concerning aboriginal rights, 
the courts do so in the context of the particular facts presented 
and in consideration of the particular group before them. 
Accordingly, while some general principles can be drawn from 
current case law, we cannot yet rely upon court decisions to make 
conclusions about aboriginal rights that would apply to all 
locations in Canada or in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that some court cases on aboriginal rights might take as 
many as 10 years to resolve and that they may not resolve issues 
in all locations, imagine how long it would take and how 
expensive it would be to resolve all outstanding aboriginal 
issues in British Columbia in this manner.  It is unthinkable 
quite frankly. We must all keep in mind that in all these 
instances, these court outcomes might not be palatable to 
everyone or for that matter, to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government agrees with the courts that negotiation rather 
than litigation is a better way to resolve outstanding aboriginal 
rights issues.  Besides, while litigation is adversarial and may 
not lead to good relationships, negotiations do lead to mutually 
agreeable solutions and better relationships.  That is the 
Canadian way.  Unfortunately that is something the Reform Party 
has yet not understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the historic practice of negotiation and resolution of 
outstanding aboriginal rights issues is called treaty making.  As 
in the case of existing aboriginal rights, the rights contained 
in treaties are also recognized and affirmed under section 35 of 
the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although treaties covering much of Canada were concluded prior 
to 1927, in British Columbia this process was never completed. 
The Nisga'a treaty is the first modern treaty to be concluded in 
British Columbia.  It resolves once and for all the Nisga'a 
outstanding claims of aboriginal rights including land and 
resources and self-government.  This is something we truly can 
and will celebrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, Hon. Ronald Irwin made public the Government of 
Canada's approach to the implementation of the inherent right and 
the negotiation of aboriginal self-government. The approach he 
presented reflects an evolution in thinking that stretches over a 
long period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades the citizens of Canada have been trying to find ways 
to reconcile the prior occupation of the country by aboriginal 
people with the sovereignty of the crown.  Long before the 
arrival of Europeans, aboriginal people lived in this country and 
looked after their own affairs.  First nations in British 
Columbia and elsewhere enjoyed existing governance and social 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing aboriginal rights are recognized and affirmed under 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  The 1995 federal 
inherent right policy recognizes that those section 35 rights 
include a right to self-government and that Canada is prepared to 
negotiate workable and practical self-government agreements and 
include them in treaties. There are different views about the 
scope and content of the inherent right, as in the case of other 
aboriginal rights, but this government has chosen to resolve 
self-government issues through the negotiation of practical 
arrangements within the context of our constitutional framework 
and legal framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to explain briefly how a negotiated resolution of 
claimed aboriginal rights to self-government works within the 
current constitutional context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution Act, 1867 defines the lawmaking powers of 
federal and provincial governments.  These are set out primarily 
in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  The scope 
of any aboriginal right in self-government may vary from 
community to community and accordingly to the circumstances of 
the various first nations. Consequently the aboriginal right of 
self-government under section 35 must be considered on a case by 
case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened in the case of the Nisga'a.  The Nisga'a 
final agreement does not only set out all the land and resource 
related rights that the Nisga'a will have under section 35 of the 
constitution act, it also identifies the self-government rights 
the Nisga'a will have under the same section of the constitution. 
The Nisga'a treaty will not alter the federal and provincial 
heads of power as set out in sections 91 and 92 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have charged that the Nisga'a final agreement creates a de 
facto third order of government that requires a constitutional 
amendment.  The meaning of third order of government is not 
clear.  What is clear, however, is that the Nisga'a final 
agreement works and that it works within the current 
constitutional framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of section 35 rights under our constitution does 
not mean those rights are set out in constitutional concrete as 
some critics claim.  Although section 35 rights are protected, 
they are not absolute.  A number of Supreme Court of Canada 
decisions have confirmed that governments still retain an overall 
authority but must justify any interference with aboriginal or 
treaty rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government will clearly operate within the Canadian 
constitutional framework.  Anyone who has read the Nisga'a final 
agreement knows that the charter of rights and freedoms will 
apply to Nisga'a government.  This means the Nisga'a laws will be 
subject to the charter as will Nisga'a government decisions, for 
example, in issuing permits or selling land.  The Nisga'a 
government will be subject to the charter just as all other 
governments are as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of repeating what has been said many times before, 
federal and provincial laws such as the criminal code will apply 
on Nisga'a lands once the treaty comes into effect.  While in 
certain limited circumstances Nisga'a laws may prevail, there 
will be no exclusive Nisga'a law-making powers.  This is a 
current model of law-making and important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a laws will only prevail for matters internal to the 
Nisga'a themselves, for example, laws relating to their culture, 
their language, the management of their land and their assets. In 
all other cases either federal and provincial laws prevail or the 
Nisga'a law must meet or exceed existing federal or provincial 
standards in order to be valid. It would be clear to anyone who 
closely examines it that the Nisga'a treaty works within the 
current framework of the Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps those who argue that the Nisga'a final agreement cannot 
be given full effect without first amending the Constitution of 
Canada just do not understand the process and do not understand 
the value of a negotiated reconciliation of aboriginal rights 
within the Canadian federation.  Perhaps they wish they could 
unilaterally impose their own arbitrary solutions.  We on the 
government side prefer negotiation and reconciliation.  After 
all, this is the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know where unilateral decisions would lead us.  We have 
seen solutions imposed by one group on to another throughout 
history.  Where possible lasting arrangements are best achieved 
when they are negotiated by all those who live by them. The 
Nisga'a treaty is one of these negotiated settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge all members of the House to leave the spurious, 
mean-spirited arguments behind, especially those of the Reform 
Party.  I just do not understand why Reform insists on pitting 
people against people, group against group, region against 
region.  It is not in keeping with the Canadian way.  It is not 
what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that all members of the House move very 
expeditiously to pass this very important and historic treaty.  I 
know that good judgment will prevail and that we will ensure the 
right thing is done.  That is after all in keeping with what 
Canadians want, with what is good for Canada, and we will prevail 
in this matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very glad to have an opportunity one last time to put out points 
of view regarding what I think is history in the making. I 
believe the passing of the Nisga'a deal is a monumental, pivotal 
point in Canadian history as we watch this group of aboriginal 
people take its first courageous steps toward true 
self-government. I hope we are seeing the beginning of the end of 
130 years of absolute social tragedy: the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the member who just spoke, I too am shocked and appalled at 
some of the tone and the content of the arguments I have heard in 
the House of Commons as the bill is debated.  I have watched as 
the Reform Party has systematically tried to discredit aboriginal 
people and tried to make the argument that somehow the Nisga'a 
are not ready for this move.  It keeps threading together 
isolated incidents of misuse of funds from reserves across the 
country.  It tries to thread that together into some argument 
that self-government is a bad thing or that aboriginal people are 
not ready or mature or competent enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have even heard Reformers stoop so low as to compare the 
Nisga'a deal to apartheid.  That is an injustice on many levels 
because it trivializes the struggle of black South Africans. 
Frankly, I do not think the people who said that even know what 
true apartheid is.  It is shocking to me that they would make 
that kind of comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For their benefit I did some research on what the apartheid 
regime really was.  I went to the Library of Parliament and 
obtained the legislation that actually made up the apartheid 
system in South Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the House to hear some of what is in the 
legislation, compare it to what we know about the Nisga'a deal 
and if we think there is any comparison or relationship 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One element of the apartheid regime was the Masters and Servants 
Act which made it a criminal offence to breach any contract of 
employment.  Insolence, drunkenness, negligence and strikes would 
be considered criminal offences under the Masters and Servants 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extra-marital intercourse between whites and blacks was outlawed 
by law.  That became a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Native (Black) Affairs Administrative Act contained the pass 
laws.  A black person had to carry a permit to enter a white 
neighbourhood.  One could be charged with promoting feelings of 
hostility.  In other words, if anything was said to anybody that 
may have promoted hostility, one could be arrested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what black South African people went through under the 
apartheid regime.  For the Reform Party to even compare the 
Nisga'a deal to apartheid, someone had to blow the whistle on 
that kind of ridiculous statement.  In trying to stop the Nisga'a 
deal the Reform Party has also stooped so low during the debate 
as to spread myths that simply are not true.  Reformers have said 
things about the Nisga'a deal that they know in their heart if 
they had ever read the deal are simply not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the Reform Party talks about is whether there 
should be a referendum on the agreement in the province of 
British Columbia. It knows full well that there is no precedence 
for a referendum. We did not have a referendum on NAFTA, or on 
the GST.  We do not have referendums on these matters.  We have a 
government that can decide these issues in the House of Commons 
or in the provincial legislatures.  The reason there had to be a 
referendum vote among the Nisga'a people is that they did not 
have a structure of government which was binding on all of the 
people there or they would have been able to do that by a more 
conventional means, as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should parliament not be able to change the treaty or alter it 
at this point to be able to make amendments to the deal?  This is 
a three party agreement.  Should any one party be able to impose 
their points of view on the other two? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Everybody in B.C. is against this deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  One of the members is saying that 
everybody in B.C.is against this deal. They are obviously wrong. 
This went to 46 communities in British Columbia.  They toured the 
province.  There was broad consultation. It was the longest 
debate ever in the history of the provincial legislature. It was 
ratified and passed and approved in its current form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Reform Party say that this deal somehow denies 
women's rights.  There is absolutely no basis for this claim.  It 
is a myth.  It is trying to do anything to undermine the 
legitimacy of the Nisga'a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this treaty protect property rights?  Reformers were trying 
to say that property rights were at risk.  The treaty transfers 
ownership of the land back to the Nisga'a people collectively. 
The treaty allows for various ways for people to then privately 
own the land that they live on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things were brought up during the 100 years of 
negotiation.  They were carefully contemplated.  They were 
debated and the issues are addressed within the text of the 
actual deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised this in the House before.  What is really galling 
is to see the Reformers trying to sell themselves as the 
champions of aboriginal people.  If we scratch the surface just a 
little, go back a year or so, we can see in <I>Hansard</I> what 
Reformers were saying about aboriginal issues; things like “Just 
because we did not kill the Indians and have Indian wars, that 
does not mean we did not conquer these people.  Is that not why 
they allowed themselves to be herded into little reserves in the 
most isolated, desolate, worthless parts of the country?” 
This is a Reform MP's comments on aboriginal people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another which I like even better.  I am talking about a 
man by the name of Herb Grubel who now works for the Fraser 
Institute.  When he was a member of parliament he likened Indians 
on reserves to people living on a south sea island courtesy of 
their rich uncle. This is the attitude of a man like Herb Grubel. 
If he is teaching school or university somewhere, he should be 
muzzled. He should have a muzzle on with attitudes like this. It 
is absolutely scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the advisers to the aboriginal task force of the Reform 
Party is a man named Mel Smith, a self-professed pundit.  Mr. 
Smith wrote a book called <I>Our Home or Native Land</I>, a clever 
play on words, criticizing any concept of aboriginal 
self-government. Obviously this is the true attitude of the 
Reform Party toward aboriginal people.  Look at the company it 
keeps, look at things the party says, look at quotes like I have 
mentioned which would make any decent person in this day and age 
shudder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Reform's past advisers, Tom Flanagan, whom I think at the 
present time is a college professor at the University of Calgary, 
wrote a paper asking why Indians do not drive taxis?  He 
proceeded to go on a diatribe about every other group of 
immigrants who come to Canada start at low paying jobs such as 
driving taxis and eventually work their way up the economic 
ladder. He was making the point that he felt these lazy people 
would not take low paying jobs and get into the workforce. This 
was from Tom Flanagan, another Reform adviser. This is truly 
horrifying and I could circulate copies of the article to members 
for their own information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next day or so we will see the last little bit of 
political mischief on the part of the Reform Party.  We will see 
those members go to the wall to do all they can to stop the 
Nisga'a deal.  They are forcing 450 and some odd votes tomorrow 
night and will make us stand up for every vote. I liken it to 
Custer's last stand.  These great Indian fighters are going to 
have one last stand.  But let us look at history and what 
happened at Custer's last stand.  The Indian people won and they 
will win tomorrow  even if we have to stand up 500 times.  I will 
stand up 500 times.  I do not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been very hard for me to sit in such close physical 
proximity to the Reform Party members and hear them and their 
outrageous comments for these past many months.  As a member of 
parliament from a riding with a huge aboriginal population, I for 
one am sick of hearing it.  The sooner this deal gets ratified, 
voted on and implemented the better it will be for Canada and the 
better it will be for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the myth that this particular deal will form the 
template for all other subsequent land claim settlements. Again, 
this is absolutely untrue.  The Government of Canada has the 
mandate under the constitution to enter into treaties of this 
nature.  The government is charged with that mandate.  It 
negotiates each individual contract based on the merits of the 
claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing I would criticize about the Nisga'a process is 
that it took 100 years.  There was nothing wrong with the 
process.  It was just spread out over too great a length of time. 
If we could somehow compress that to a reasonable length of time 
and keep that model of true negotiation and reaching a settlement 
in an amicable, that is the most civilized way of doing business. 
When we compare it to the alternative, which is violent struggle, 
the most civilized way for resolving issues of this nature is at 
the table, through collective bargaining and negotiation which is 
really what occurred in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now up to us.  We in the House have the privilege to vote 
on this deal.  I am very glad that I have the opportunity to vote 
on this deal.  This is the most significant thing I have been 
asked to do since becoming an elected member of parliament. I 
will be proud to stand up tomorrow and vote in favour of the 
Nisga'a treaty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very honoured to be speaking to Bill C-9, the Nisga'a 
treaty.  I would like to give the hon. members a description of 
who the Nisga'a people are, where they live and how their land 
claims agreement and the bill giving it effect have arrived here 
for the consideration of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a live along the Nass River in a relatively remote 
area of northwestern British Columbia, 100 kilometres north of 
Terrace and Prince Rupert.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than the 2,500 Nisga'a who live in four villages along the 
river and at its mouth, approximately 125 other permanent 
residents occupy the 24,000 square kilometres of this valley. The 
only communities in the Nass Valley are Nisga'a communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many other similar northern British Columbia rural areas, 
forestry is by far the most important economic activity, although 
fishing, ecotourism, pine mushroom harvesting and a few service 
industries also contribute to employment.  There are no mines or 
mineral claims, nor other major industries on the proposed 
Nisga'a land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a who live in the Nass Valley are one cultural group 
based among the northwest coast aboriginal people.  They have a 
complex culture based on the rich resources of the sea. 
Historically, like other northwest coast people, the Nisga'a were 
great artists, builders and crafts people.  They still are and 
their art graces the exteriors and interiors of many of the 
buildings in their villages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Salmon and the other resources of the Nass provide both food and 
the raw material for Nisga'a architectural, artistic and social 
achievements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a live in large and beautifully built cedar post and 
beam houses located in the permanent villages.  They have built 
ocean-going canoes, great totems, masks, horn spoons and many of 
the implements of everyday life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here on the banks of the Ottawa River, Nisga'a artistic and 
cultural achievements are on view in the Grand Hall of the Museum 
of Civilization and in the recently mounted “Common Bowl” 
exhibit.  They can also be found in many of the world's museums. 
Nisga'a artists are also well represented in the world's art 
galleries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today about 2,500 of the 5,500 Nisga'a live in four villages: 
Kincolith, Greenville, Canyon City and New Aiyansh.  Most of the 
other Nisga'a live in Terrace, Prince Rupert or Vancouver. Many 
Nisga'a still speak their traditional language, although everyone 
also speaks English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a villages have modern housing and infrastructure.  The 
schools and community buildings are in constant use to hold 
Nisga'a social, cultural and ceremonial activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although some of the Nisga'a share the difficulties common to 
all aboriginal communities, such as high unemployment and family 
breakdown, the Nisga'a have worked very hard to improve their 
circumstances.  A high value is placed on schooling and 
post-secondary education.  The Nisga'a operate their own 
provincial school district, school district No. 92.  It offers 
kindergarten to grade 12 for both Nisga'a and other residents of 
the Nass Valley.  One seat on the elected school board is 
reserved for a non-Nisga'a resident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a also operate a post-secondary college in conjunction 
with the University of Northern British Columbia.  It offers 
degree programs, life skills training, culture and language 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also operate their own health board and again provide for 
non-Nisga'a representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like other aboriginal people in Canada, the Nisga'a have 
struggled with the effects of the reserve and Indian Act system, 
residential schools and the lack of opportunities.  However, they 
have taken up every available opportunity to take over education, 
health care, social and family services and other government 
programs seeking wherever they could to strengthen their families 
and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have also worked co-operatively with their neighbours. They 
participate in regional district government where a Nisga'a 
elder, Harry Nyce, who visited the House on the day this 
legislation was introduced, sits on the board.  They also have 
for a number of years played a role in the Pacific Salmon 
Commission and its northern panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a have pursued a settlement of what they describe as 
the land question since at least 1887 when, as members of this 
place have heard, Nisga'a chiefs first travelled to the 
legislature in British Columbia to seek recognition of the 
aboriginal title, a treaty settlement and a measure of 
self-government.  Their trip to Victoria was unsuccessful.  In 
1890 they established their first land committee and in 1913 that 
committee sent a petition to the privy council in England seeking 
to resolve the land question.  Again, they were unsuccessful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the 1920s to the 1950s, the Nisga'a and other first 
nations' efforts to have their rights recognized and practise 
their culture were restricted. 
Legislation outlawed traditional practices such as the potlatch 
and made it illegal to raise money to advance land claims.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following repeal of this legislation in 1955, the Nisga'a 
re-established their land committee.  Under the leadership of Mr. 
Frank Calder, the tribal council took the land question to the 
courts.  This was a bold decision and a mark of the Nisga'a 
commitment to seek a resolution of their rights.  Many other 
first nations were concerned that this court case might be 
unsuccessful, but in the face of unfavourable lower court 
decisions, the Nisga'a pursued their case to the Supreme Court of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1973, the supreme court issued the Calder decision.  Although 
the court split evenly on whether the Nisga'a continued to hold 
aboriginal title, it recognized the possibility of aboriginal 
rights and title continuing to exist in Canada. This decision was 
a major factor in prompting the government of the day to adopt a 
policy of negotiating land claims where they had not already been 
settled in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a were one of earliest groups to take up negotiations 
as part of this new process.  They commenced in 1976.  However, 
without the participation of the Government of British Columbia, 
progress on issues related to land could not be made.  In 1990, 
the provincial government joined the process, and after that the 
pace of the negotiations began pick up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years after signing an agreement on how to proceed with 
negotiations, the two governments and the Nisga'a signed an 
agreement in principle, which set out the main elements of the 
agreement which is before us today.  Two and a half years later, 
the parties initialled the final agreement, a great achievement 
and culmination of over 100 years of perseverance by the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the House have heard a good deal about the 
consultations by the governments which accompanied the 
negotiations, consultations which included resource and other 
business interests, labour, local government and many interested 
Canadians.  What has not been said is how the Nisga'a consulted 
with their own people throughout the negotiations.  Every year 
the Nisga'a negotiating team met with a special assembly of all 
their members.  These special assemblies were well attended and 
included information sessions on every aspect of negotiations. 
Strategies were reviewed and directions given to the negotiators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, the Nisga'a brought many of their people, elders, 
band councillors and others to observe negotiations and report 
back to their communities.  Prior to ratifying the final 
agreement, they conducted extensive briefings in every one of 
their communities and their Terrace, Prince Rupert and Vancouver 
urban locals, and they have also maintained an excellent website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these and many other ways, the Nisga'a negotiators have 
provided detailed information to every interested Nisga'a person 
on this proposed treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this history, it is disturbing to hear from the 
official opposition members that Nisga'a cannot know for 
themselves whether this final agreement is good for them or not. 
I think the history of the negotiations of the Nisga'a land 
question shows very clearly that the Nisga'a are quite capable of 
making up their own minds, as they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by pointing out to all members of the House that in 
the process of negotiating the land question, the Nisga'a 
developed a philosophy they call the “common bowl”.  The common 
bowl is their pledge to work in concert to settle their claim and 
to share among all their people the benefits of that settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the House moved forward in the ratification of the 
final agreement.  It is time for the Nisga'a to finally benefit 
from their common bowl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very honoured to be able to speak to the Nisga'a treaty.  I 
certainly urge all members to vote on the agreement because we 
all know that the Nisga'a have decided that it is good for their 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Police studies confirm that the motivating factors of animal 
abuse are related to anger, control and power.  This is totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, specific changes to the criminal code should ensure 
that we make it illegal to brutally treat or viciously kill an 
animal, raise the maximum penalty for intentional cruelty, give 
judges the authority to order anyone convicted of cruelty to 
animals to pay restitution for shelter and veterinarian costs, 
and finally, prohibit anyone convicted of cruelty to animals from 
owning another animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must and we will protect our animals from such heinous acts.

healthy eating, nutrition and active living programs to deliver

a woman-hating killer took the lives of 13 students and one 
secretary at the École Polytechnique.  Since then, the 13 
have become the symbols of violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the December 6 Victims Foundation Against 
Violence, Claire Roberge, described the deaths of these women as 
occurring on a battlefield they did not know existed, the 
battlefield of equal opportunity. At that time, we thought that 
battle had long been won, but it appears that nothing has been 
gained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a mistake to believe that the battle to combat violence 
against women is over. Across this country, women and children 
are still being killed by men.

was from my riding, and of all women victims of violence, we

close to two million new taxpayers have been created.  That is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now the finance minister is taking credit for creating 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another tax statement from a pensioner in Ontario.  He 
sent in his pension pay stub dated September 30, 1999.  The total 
federal tax he paid was $4,434.  Last year for the same period he 
paid $3,465.  That is a $1,000 increase.  His pension stayed the 
same but his tax bill rose by that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government hurt pensioners by clawing back so much 
of their income each year? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is ridiculous for the Reform Party to quote 
pensioners because the fact is at the time that we were cutting 
the deficit, the Reform Party said we were not cutting it early 
enough.  The Reform Party recommended that Canadian pensions be 
cut.  For the member to stand up now and talk about that is 
simply nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not cut pensions.  We will not cut pensions.  That is the 
basic difference between us and the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
they have been cut already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bernard is another dissatisfied customer.  He wrote, “Along 
with my letter to the finance minister and the Prime Minister, I 
enclosed a copy of our family budget to show exactly how 
difficult it is.  The response I got from the government was a 
list of the dollars the Liberals have given to low income 
families.  I do not want charity.  I do not want government 
programs.  I just want my money so I can choose what is best for 
my family”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister hurt Bernard's family by 
confiscating so much of his hard-earned money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party knows that not only did we eliminate 
the deficit two years before Reform said it would, but we cut 
taxes three years before the Reform Party said it would cut 
taxes. Those are the facts. I understand why Reform members want 
to quote pay stubs.  The reason is after the next election there 
will be a lot less of them collecting paycheques. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
at least we are not collecting pensions like some others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's taxation tentacles are unable to reach the 
finance minister in Liberia but by Jove, they are reaching John 
in Oshawa.  Fifty-three per cent of John's income was gobbled up 
by the tax man. To put that another way, the government made more 
from John's work than he did. Let me quote John and ask, “Why is 
the government entitled to more of my money than I am?”  How 
could that be? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, members of the Reform Party just cannot live with good 
news.  The fact is that taxes are going down.  The national debt 
is going down.  Taxes are going down and the national 
unemployment rate is at its lowest level in the last 18 or 19 
years.  The real problem is they just cannot stand good news. 
And there is a lot more of it coming.

some like to be victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just said the Newfoundland House of Assembly has asked us 
to act.  We are not talking about the federal government.  We 
acted a few months ago for the Government of Quebec when we 
resolved a constitutional problem that had existed, I believe, 
for 50 years.  We do this from time to time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With his desire to stir up confrontation and discord, is the

The Prime Minister has said that we have other priorities for 
the moment.

my question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to welcome him back from the battle in Seattle.  I

the EU asked for the suppression of certain language and for 
shorter and less precise language in order to respond to cultural 
sensitivities at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the minister could explain what these cultural

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that Canada stands for transparency. We believe in 
transparency.  Of the 135 delegations in Seattle, the one that 
most engaged in a dialogue with the NGOs was the Canadian one. 
We engaged in a dialogue with the provincial ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On services we will fight for a bottom up approach as we said.

have been taken by certain provincial governments indicating a 
willingness to resolve all matters. Quite frankly, if that 
willingness were there, they would have resolved it a long time 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because the provinces have not been able to resolve their

There was a clear reference in that to the elimination of export

Speaker, the thalidomide situation in Canada brought to our 
attention in tragic terms the inadequacy of our health protection

</I></B></P><P align=left>In order that the experience never be repeated again, the health 
protection branch was set up under the auspices of the Food and 
Drugs Act to ensure that only drugs that have been proven safe and 
effective could be sold in Canada.

research lab but it is allowing drugs on to the market that do not 
meet the basic standards of safety and efficacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister assure Canadians that any new drugs allowed 
on to the market will not be approved at the expense of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in May 1998 Health Canada approved a new policy for approving 
drugs for the treatment of serious, life threatening diseases 
where there is promising evidence that the potential benefits of 
the drug outweigh its risks, where the risks can be monitored and 
where the company agrees to continue to study the drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy was developed to help those who are seriously ill 
and dying.  It is about compassion, and we make no apologies for 
that.  I observe as well that the drug referred to in the report 
today has already been approved in 30 countries around the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue we are raising today is not compassion. The 
minister already has the ability to allow drugs for emergency 
access relief or to speed up his own drug approval process and 
still operate within the law and according to safety standards. 
The question is, why does the minister proceed with a policy 
without any basis in law and without meeting safety standards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the regulations that he promised in April 1998 when he 
unilaterally and arbitrarily changed the law or, in the words of 
his own staff, where is the legal opinion to show that this

the Food and Drugs Act? 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it sometimes occurs that there are new drugs under consideration 
that might help those who are dying or are very seriously ill. 
If the conclusion is reached that the benefits of those drugs 
outweigh their risks, where the company that is proposing it 
agrees to continue studying it and we monitor the performance of 
that drug, then is the member saying that she would deny access 
to that drug to those who might otherwise die?  Would she turn 
them down when these drugs might improve their condition or 
indeed even save their lives?

well over a year ago, the Minister of Public Works knew that four 
out of five untendered government contracts failed to meet the

that over 90% of untendered contracts do not meet the 
government's own rules and will not even stand up to public 
scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple.  Why did the minister not fix the

<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the 
hon. member said, if he reads the auditor general's report he 
will see that the auditor general congratulated us for the way in 
which we handle publicly tendered contracts.  For example, we 
handled a major publicly tendered contract for maintenance.  All 
federally owned buildings are now being maintained by the private 
sector.  This was done with absolute transparency.  The member

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the auditor general congratulated the government for one contract 
out of four.  The auditor general said that over $1 billion in 
contracts are handed out each year without tender and with no 
justification.  In the 1993 red book the Liberals promised to cut 
sole source contracts, but instead they are skyrocketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister follow his own department's rules and put

in government the number of contracts given by public tender 
have increased drastically.  Over 80% of the contracts have been 
given through the public tender system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of decentralization, some of the smaller contracts in a 
department are direct and some may be given on a sole source 
basis or call-up source.  However, the policy is there and we are

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF TRAGEDY AT ÉCOLE POLYTECHNIQUE 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are gathered here today in the memory of 14 young women who 
should be getting ready to celebrate a new millennium with us. 
They should be feeling the pride of building promising careers. 
They should be starting new families.  But they will be enjoying 
none of these personal milestones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because fate, tragically, chose otherwise.  Because they 
were women, and because they were in the wrong place on December 
6, 1989, at the École Polytechnique de Montréal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time stood still in Canada on that day.  For the families and 
friends of the 14 who were taken by this act of insane rage it 
has never fully started again. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that we learned something from this horror.  We had 
to acknowledge that these murders revealed, as never before in 
Canada, the terrible reality of violence against women.  And we 
took action with one of the toughest gun control laws in the 
world and by making the justice system more responsive to the 
needs of women who experience violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the cold fact is that nothing we have done, or will do, can 
ever bring back those young lives.  That is why my thoughts today 
are first and foremost with their families and loved ones who 
have graciously allowed us to share in their private grief in 
this very public way.  Today we join them in reflecting what 
might have been but never will be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to join with the Prime Minister and other members 
to remember the victims of that tragic day 10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that day 14 promising young women lost their lives in a 
malevolent outburst of violence by a man with a gun. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer my deepest sympathy to the families and friends of these 
young women and to the young women who were wounded in this 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do so on behalf of all the members of the official opposition.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife Sandra and I have raised five children in our home. 
They are now young adults, two young men and three young women. 
On the day this tragedy occurred two of our daughters were 
attending classes at the University of Alberta.  As a parent, 
your heart sinks when you even hear about things like this and 
your mind races to two questions:  How safe are our daughters, 
any of our daughters, from similar acts of violence?  And, what 
can we do as parents, what in particular should we be teaching or 
providing at home in order to protect our children from violence, 
in particular violence directed toward women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later the news came out concerning the young man who had 
perpetrated these terrible acts, of the troubled life and 
background from which grew his pathological hatred of women.  I 
found myself asking a third question of particular relevance to 
parents with boys at home:  What can we do as parents, what in 
particular should we be teaching or providing our young men at 
home in order to deal with attitudes or conditions that might 
lead them to disrespect or discriminate against or to verbally or 
physically abuse anyone, but in particular those of the opposite 
sex? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All three of those questions are as relevant today as they were 
on this day 10 years ago.  They demand responses particularly in 
our homes and personal relations where the attitudes of young men 
toward women and vice versa are shaped far more than they are by 
public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps today the greatest tribute we can pay to those victims 
whom we remember and honour today would be to rededicate 
ourselves not just as legislators but as parents, grandparents, 
aunts and uncles to the prevention of violence in our society and 
in our homes, in particular the violence of men toward women 
epitomized by the tragedy of December 6, 1989. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 10 
years ago, 14 young women paid with their lives for the 
frustrations of a mad gunman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec society had considered itself sheltered from such things, 
but it learned to its sorrow that the culture of violence was 
still far too present in our everyday lives.  Unfortunately, 
that lesson was learned at the cost of 14 innocent lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lessons have been learned, yes, but the situation is still very 
precarious.  Since December 6, 1989, 858 women have fallen 
victim to family violence in Quebec and Canada.  In 1998 alone, 
there were 67 such tragic deaths. 
Although the homicide figures may now be dropping, the number of 
women using shelters for abused women is constantly on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is proof that we, as a society and as individuals, must 
continue to fight against violence, particularly violence 
against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what have we done to make violence toward women 
unacceptable?  Not enough.  We obviously still have a long way 
to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep up the fight so that women will be able to feel 
secure and no longer afraid.  We must stop seeing violence as 
commonplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, December 6, 1989 was not an isolated example.  Every day, 
women are being battered, being hurt by partners, other family 
members, or people they work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us, as a society, examine our consciences and take action 
against the violence we see on our television screens every day. 
Let us denounce violence in our schools, in our media, in our 
day-to-day lives.  Let us condemn violence.  Let us act to teach 
respect, tolerance and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the federal government to organize a violence 
awareness campaign.  The cuts it has imposed on women's groups 
are aberrant, when one considers that this affects the safety of 
the women of Quebec and of Canada.  These decisions must be 
re-examined for the safety of societies in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the parents and friends of the 14 women killed at École 
Polytechnique, I express my sympathies, and those of all members 
of the Bloc Quebecois.  We share the memory of that terrible 
day, and it will remain with us for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us ensure that the 14 did not die in vain.  Let us keep 
their memory fresh to galvanize our actions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, following the unthinkable tragedy in Montreal 10 years 
ago today, Dawn Black, then NDP member of parliament for New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby dedicated her energy to the 
passing of the bill that would ensure that the people of Canada 
would never forget and would be active in any violence against 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women who are victims of violence are left with lifelong 
physical and emotional scars.  The remembrance ceremonies in 
communities across the country serve to highlight the fact that 
for some women the physical scars may heal while the emotional 
scars that violence leaves on these women will take a lifetime to 
mend and will require change in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy in Montreal only heightened our fear.  Women's 
groups today have called again for a funding commitment to the 
women of Canada aimed at curbing violence against women.  A 
commitment from the government would be a fitting memorial to all 
of the women of Canada who have been victims of violence and it 
would be a promise for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we must reaffirm and recommit ourselves to the essence of 
Dawn Black's private member's bill that named December 6 as the 
day of remembrance and action on violence against women.  We 
cannot stop now.  We must counteract the feeling of vulnerability 
and insecurity that women face which hit the Canadian public like 
a shock wave 10 years ago today.  As a society, we must not only 
be intolerant but stand united in addressing the causes of 
violence against women so that women feel safe in their daily 
lives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with tears in my eyes and a heavy heart, as I am sure many 
of our colleagues in the House also do today, for 10 years ago 
Canada was changed.  We in this country have always been blessed 
with the ability to say that we live in a nation better than all 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago one man armed with his hatred forced us to view a 
darker version of ourselves, a Canada no different than the 
foreign societies we fear.  He did this by taking from us the 
lives of 14 young beautiful women in their prime from our own 
backyard.  It defined us as a country that no longer has to look 
outside its borders to find an example of malicious and senseless 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It changed us as a people.  We could no longer say that horrors 
such as these did not happen in our Canada.  Although I did not 
know these brave little souls, I came to know of their innocence 
and their courage.  We as a country came to know them to be no 
different from our daughters, our sisters, our neighbours and our 
friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember them not only as the only victims of violence 
against women, but as those whose story was so tragic that it 
forced the nation to turn its attention to the violent cruelty 
faced by women across the land at the hands of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to merely remember these brave women and mourn 
their loss, without taking the steps necessary to ensure that a 
horror of this kind does not take place again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today across the country the spirit of these young women will 
serve as a call to action.  Whether from Saint John, Saskatoon, 
Medicine Hat or Montreal, Canadians will stand together and 
condemn violence against women.  They will gather to pray and to 
comfort.  They will gather to harness strength and initiative. 
They will acknowledge the good that has been done in the name of 
those slain and focus on the challenges that lie before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Right Hon. Joe Clark, our leader of the PC 
Party of Canada, and all of our colleagues in the House, we wish 
to convey our deepest, heartfelt sympathies, unchanged by the 
passage of time to the families and loved ones of the 14 women. 
They will, as will their families, remain in our hearts, our 
thoughts and our prayers always, en souvenir de leurs vies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, in memory of the 14 young 
Canadian women who were murdered, would you please stand with me 
for one minute's silence.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NISGA'A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK191">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-9, an act to give 
effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, as reported (without 
amendment) from the committee; and of the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise again today.  It is 
probably the lowest point in parliament so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the Nisga'a agreement and the amendments to 
it at report stage.  The NDP and the Liberals would like to 
muzzle Reform. They have said so previously in the debate.  The 
Liberals used the phrase “the Canadian way” and it became 
obvious as we listened that it is really the Liberal way that 
they were talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot figure out why closure is being invoked on this bill. 
Is it because the public might raise concerns, or that the 
concerns with the bill might become more public and opposition to 
it would continue to grow across Canada, the same kind of 
opposition that is now present within B.C. among the majority of 
the people there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the people of B.C. have not had input.  I have heard one of 
the members from Vancouver talk about all the consultation and 
meetings that have been held.  The problem is the people of B.C. 
in their majority have not been allowed to address all of the 
concerns they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Liberals who spoke said he voted but with an 
expressed caveat.  He had reservations about this.  What a joke. 
What a joke to say, “I am going to vote yes to this agreement”. 
Does that member think that the minister of Indian affairs will 
listen once the vote is over, that anybody will take into account 
any of the concerns he expressed?  No, because once it is passed, 
it is a done deal.  People will just laugh at him when he says, 
“I raised this and I voted yes, but I want to have it understood 
that I have these concerns”. 
Does that member think any court will listen to him after this is 
implemented because he made a speech here raising some of these 
concerns?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member is playing pure politics if he is afraid to 
stand up now and be counted.  It will be too late after this bill 
is implemented.  Mark my words, this sets a precedent for which 
there will be no turning back.  The courts will take this and run 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just finished a speech a couple of hours ago on property 
rights.  The Liberals claim that the charter will protect the 
aboriginal people and all Canadians.  In my speech on a bill 
which the Liberals did not even allow to be votable, I said that 
there is no protection in the charter for property rights.  The 
court has said so itself.  Their appeal to the charter to protect 
aboriginal property rights is not based on any fact.  As my 
colleague said, it is valueless.  It is useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not had time to debate some of these things.  I have 
raised this issue but it will not be dealt with here.  Yet the 
Liberals claim that the charter will protect them.  I have 
pointed out areas where the charter cannot protect them and the 
court has said so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process has been flawed from the beginning.  The 
negotiations were secret for many years.  When other Reformers 
and I became aware of this in 1994 and 1995 there was a refusal 
on the part of the government to even have any public disclosure 
as to what was happening.  Any objections we raised were 
belittled. We were portrayed as being evil people.  Nothing could 
be further from the truth.  We are the only political party right 
now that is standing up and asking the serious questions about 
this treaty.  None of the other opposition parties are doing 
that, nor are any of the backbench Liberals doing this in any 
serious way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In B.C. the debate was cut off even before half of the treaty 
was debated.  The consultation is not just with four or five 
chiefs.  I have heard the government say that there were three 
parties involved in the agreement, but they were all the tops. It 
was a top heavy thing. The rank and file people have basically 
been shut out of this whole process and that is really a concern. 
Opposition parties should express the concern of all Canadians 
and only Reform is doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a change in the social contract. We are not focusing 
upon the cost.  We realize the cost could be unbelievable.  Some 
estimates run as high as $30 billion or $40 billion.  We have to 
look at how this is going to change the dynamics within Canada. 
The democratic rights of all B.C. are being thumbed by not having 
it fully debated and a referendum held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the points that has been raised is that we do not hold 
referendums on this kind of thing because there is no precedent. 
How ridiculous an argument can one have?  If it is this important 
and if it is going to involve a change that is this fundamental, 
we have to have input by all people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the Charlottetown accord?  The people spoke very 
clearly on the relationship of aboriginals to the rest of the 
country.  We are ignoring that and we are going ahead with this 
without having another referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what excuse one could come up with for not having 
a process that includes everybody.  The government ministers talk 
about listening to all sides but they have created the sides in 
this.  They have created the divisions that will get even wider 
as we continue along.  If it is so good, as the government claims 
it is, why not put it to all the people of B.C.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One person has asked, is there any place on reserve where the 
conditions are as good as off reserve?  The government has not 
answered that question.  People have said that they want to get 
out from under the Indian Act.  With this thing they are ending 
up with the very same thing.  They are not getting out from under 
the oppression that they are feeling at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned that the courts are going to be 
dictating this legislation. 
Do the courts have the right to tell members of parliament how 
they should speak?  That is what one Liberal asked.  I would like 
to ask that question.

justice stated clearly “We have one law for all, but it is 
flexible in its application”.  Only a Liberal could come up with 
that forked tongue type of speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hon. member said there are no legitimate concerns being 
voiced by grassroots people in B.C.  I would beg to differ. 
There are major concerns being voiced by grassroots people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that this is a template for scores of other 
treaties.  Does this not warrant more careful scrutiny? 
Unfortunately, we are standing alone in asking for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite some time ago when the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples brought in its report I made a speech.  In the context of 
the Nisga'a agreement, I would like to bring up some of the key 
points that were raised at that time, which are still valid 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point an editorial in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> stated 
that if those recommendations were to be implemented, and they 
are being implemented today, they would lead to separation, both 
political and economic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said that we need to move toward equality.  Here are 
some of the key, crucial steps that we need to take to move 
toward the goal of equality.  The Indian Act must be repealed and 
replaced with legislation that will move closer to true equality. 
This bill does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to agree on a definition of self-government.  I believe 
that the majority of Canadians, including grassroots Indian 
people, would support aboriginal self-government as long as the 
federal government's relationship with Indian reserves was 
similar to that of the relationship between provinces and 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of Canada's aboriginal people, and there are about 500,000, 
already live in municipalities under provincial jurisdiction. 
The federal government retains responsibility for about 350,000 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For self-government to work, Canadian law, including the charter 
of rights and freedoms, must apply equally to all aboriginal 
people.  Local Indian governments will never be truly democratic 
or financially accountable until and unless a normal local 
government to taxpayer relationship is established.  The federal 
government must make treaty entitlements payable, in part at 
least, directly to individual treaty Indians living on reserve. 
I emphasize that.  They should have the same rights as the rest 
of us.  They will not get that through this agreement and they 
should have that.  We need to move toward equality that will be 
of benefit to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every treaty Indian is entitled to compensation benefits or 
services promised by the treaty and they should have a choice of 
receiving those benefits directly from the federal government or 
through their local Indian government.  They should be able to 
exercise that option at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land claims settlements should be negotiated publicly, not 
behind closed doors, and they should outline all of these things.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I take great pleasure in rising today to participate in 
the debate on Bill C-9, the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but reflect on the mood of the House and how it 
changed from the very partisan thrust of question period to just 
a few minutes ago when we took a few moments to remember the 
terrible tragedy which happened at the École Polytechnique 10 
years ago.  I think that says something about us as Canadians and 
as parliamentarians, how our moods change, how we understand, how 
we can be tolerant and of course how we remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to today's debate.  The first and most important 
thing to say is that we acknowledge and appreciate the 
overwhelming support for the Nisga'a treaty from members of three 
of the four opposition parties represented in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard criticism often repeated by the official 
opposition.  Now we see hundreds of amendments aimed at 
dismantling, undermining and changing this agreement, which has 
been entered into honourably by different parties. 
We have to be very clear that Reform amendments seek to tear up 
the Nisga'a final agreement.  In this effort Reform members stand 
alone.  They are isolated.  They are wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Support from political parties as diverse in their views as the 
Bloc Quebecois, the New Democratic Party and the Progressive 
Conservative Party vindicates our view that the Nisga'a treaty is 
truly a non-partisan issue.  What the Nisga'a treaty demonstrates 
is the government's commitment to aboriginal peoples in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past weekend there was an agreement signed in my 
riding of Burin—St. George's among the Miawpukek First Nation, 
the Federation of Newfoundland Indians and Human Resources 
Development Canada for some $12.3 million, which will enable 
those people to address the needs of youth and equal access for 
people with disabilities, as well as the child care initiative 
that has been built into the Conne River agreement.  That 
demonstrates very clearly this government's commitment to the 
aboriginal peoples of this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty, as with other modern treaties, should rise 
above the ordinary back and forth and thrust of partisan debate. 
The amendments which have been proposed by the Reform Party 
relate more to its make believe treaty than to the bill before 
the House and to what the treaty would give effect.  In many 
cases, as we shall see during the course of the debate, the 
amendments do not relate to the actual document that has been 
negotiated among the parties.  Additionally, they do not relate 
to the specific provisions of the final agreement which have been 
restated in Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first treaty, the real treaty that was negotiated, has been 
ratified by the Nisga'a and Her Majesty in right of British 
Columbia.  It is this treaty that has been tabled before 
parliament, which will be ratified with the passage of Bill C-9. 
It is the treaty referred to by the government and the three 
opposition parties other than the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is trying to impress its make believe 
treaty upon members of the House.  The official opposition, the 
Liberal Party of British Columbia and a minority of editorialists 
seem determined to misrepresent the real treaty's elements. 
Among the many myths the official opposition seems bent on 
perpetrating are that the treaty undermines the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms and that it creates uncertainty.  Of 
course, that could not be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start by debunking the first myth.  Since 1982 the 
Nisga'a have agreed that their treaty would be subject to the 
charter.  Accordingly, the treaty clearly states that the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to the Nisga'a 
government in respect of all matters within its authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still the Reform Party attempts to tinker with the wording of 
this bill which reflects the final agreement.  Its Motion No. 25 
would delete the reference to the charter of rights and freedoms 
from the preamble of Bill C-9.  It is not its objective to make 
constructive amendments, but rather to tear them down and raise 
contradictions between the bill before the House and the Nisga'a 
final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing here once again, and what I have observed in 
the House of Commons since I have been here, is more of the same 
old Reform Party that Canadians have come to know.  The same old 
divisive nature and the same old obstructionist tactics and 
manoeuvres are being used by this official opposition known as 
the Reform Party.  Canadians are finally starting to see what 
really is behind the motives of the Reform Party.  Polling 
results across the country are starting to show that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result of its tactics, if accepted, would be a bill of 
contradictions, surprises, misstatements and errors.  Rather than 
building upon certainty and understanding, lawyers would have a 
field day trying to comprehend how the Reform bill would actually 
accord with the final agreement.  I ask once again, does the 
Reform Party want a final agreement with the Nisga'a nation or 
not?  Is there something it does not want to be final? 
I think all members of the House, after being engaged in this 
debate for a period of time, know the answer to these questions. 
The answer is no.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Being the kind of people we are in Canada, being 
parliamentarians in the House of Commons representing Canadians, 
I wonder what the true motives of the official opposition are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a country of tolerance.  We are a country of goodwill. We 
want to rectify injustices in the country.  One of the reasons we 
were sent to parliament was to deal with these issues.  What 
better opportunity to rectify some of the injustices of the past, 
to correct some of the wrongs of the past, to show compassion and 
to lend support where it is so badly needed than the Nisga'a 
treaty, Bill C-9? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is overwhelming support across Canada to ratify this 
agreement.  Why is the official opposition being obstructionist 
in its tactics?  That party will try to keep us in the House for 
the next 48 or 72 hours, with amendment after amendment, trying 
to obstruct and delay the implementation and approval of an 
agreement which will benefit many people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members of the Reform Party—and I see there are a 
couple present—if any of them see the inherent contradictions in 
some of the amendments they have proposed.  There are some 
startling contradictions in the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to learn about the Nisga'a treaty is to understand 
it.  In addition, numerous summaries and academic articles are 
available which support the treaty.  The Reform Party's arguments 
and amendments ignore hours of very valuable testimony setting 
out how this final agreement operates, the meaning of the final 
agreement and its constitutional status.  As the House carries on 
with its deliberations it will be necessary for all members to 
consider whether members of the official opposition are 
describing the actual Nisga'a treaty or their own make believe 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a have bargained with the federal and provincial 
governments peacefully and in good faith.  They have every right 
to expect that the treaty will be upheld and the agreement will 
come to fruition.  All Canadians can be proud that the Nisga'a 
final agreement is a fair, affordable and honourable settlement 
which puts to rest historic frustrations that have divided 
British Columbians for more than 100 years.  I say that the 
amendments proposed by the Reform Party, in motion after motion 
before us today, undermine that very objective.  The consequence 
is to separate Canadians, to deny what the Nisga'a have 
honourably negotiated and to weaken the treaty process in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty should be celebrated as a national 
achievement, proof that people working in good faith can resolve 
their differences without confrontation or litigation.  The 
Nisga'a have waited long enough.  This agreement has been studied 
and debated extensively and it must be ratified.  Then and only 
then can we go forward into the next millennium ready to face the 
challenges of the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
there is one very simple reason for which members of the official 
opposition oppose this treaty, which is that we are representing 
the views of the vast majority of our constituents in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the amendments 
proposed in Group No. 1 concerning Bill C-9, an act to give 
effect to the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government calls this a debate, but we all know that it has 
no intention of listening.  We all know of the government's 
commitment to pass the Nisga'a final agreement before we break 
for Christmas.  We all know that the government has made a 
commitment to refuse to even entertain any amendment to the 
Nisga'a final agreement.  In effect, the government is making 
parliament superfluous.  In this instance parliament no longer 
has power over its own legislation.  The government in power is 
forcing the passage of an agreement over which this place has 
absolutely no input or control.  It is indeed unfortunate that 
the other opposition parties are permitting this action to occur 
without a whisper of condemnation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of this place must at many times wonder whether we 
have become redundant when we continually witness the Prime 
Minister, his office and the Privy Council office dictate what 
legislation passes through this place and in what manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 is a prime example of the complete abdication of 
democratic principles.  Sure, we are being provided with the 
opportunity to speak, the opportunity to challenge the actions of 
the government and the opportunity even to vote on this 
legislation, but the government members are given their marching 
orders and the government is not open to any alteration of the 
bill.  It is all just a charade.  There is no democracy in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has been put in a position of accepting an 
agreement entered into by his predecessor and he has been told to 
get it through parliament without any changes.  It is a tough job 
because he has been given a Volkswagen and has been told to sell 
a Cadillac, with all due respect to the folks at Volkswagen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has an agreement that creates a third order of government and 
he tries to suggest that the constitution is not being thwarted. 
He has an agreement that creates inequalities and he tries to 
suggest that equality of all citizens is being upheld.  He has a 
clause in the legislation that clearly states that if there is a 
conflict between provincial and federal laws and the agreement, 
then the agreement reigns supreme, but he argues that this is not 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly like somebody to explain to me paragraph 13 of 
the general provisions of the agreement.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of an inconsistency or conflict between this 
Agreement and the provisions of any federal or provincial law, 
this Agreement will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency or 
conflict. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That quotation certainly appears to state that the agreement is 
paramount even to federal and provincial laws.  In fact, it 
sounds suspiciously like a constitutional document, but it has 
not been added to our constitution through the amending formula. 
It has been undertaken by the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and we are merely rubber stamping it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received quite an extensive e-mail from one of my 
constituents.  She is a 17 year old student who has taken the 
initiative to study the Nisga'a final agreement.  She is strongly 
opposed to the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is concerned about the land of the agreement being handed 
over to the Nisga'a people when the Gitksan and Gitanyow people 
also have claims to some of the same parcels of land.  What does 
the minister say about this issue and the concern?  He maintains 
that he is working on it and these other bands will be looked 
after in future negotiations and agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty in accepting these proposals.  First, if 
the land is already allotted to the Nisga'a and it actually 
belongs to these other bands, how can justice really be done to 
rectify the situation in the future?  Second, will Canadians have 
to pay a premium to these other bands should it be determined 
that they have been deprived of ancestral lands?  While I 
certainly do not suggest civil disobedience or illegal activity, 
my 17 year old constituent is certainly concerned that these 
other native bands might be forced to take the law into their own 
hands in order to obtain their rightful lands.  Is this what we 
are bringing forth with this legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have expressed my displeasure and disappointment over the 
complete disregard for democracy with Bill C-9.  I would now like 
to discuss a recent poll taken from the citizens of my home 
province of British Columbia.  It significantly supports the 
amendments as proposed by Group No. 1 in the report stage of this 
legislation.  The poll also strongly supports my claims in regard 
to the failure of the democratic principles to be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens of British Columbia were asked if they had had adequate 
opportunity to provide input to the Nisga'a treaty.  Of no 
surprise the results were much the same as they are for this 
place.  They have been given a fait accompli and have been told 
to live with it.  The deal is done.  The treaty and the 
legislation will pass unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 91% of the citizens polled from the riding of the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans did not feel that they had been provided 
with adequate opportunity to provide input into the Nisga'a 
treaty.  Will the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stick up for 
his constituents?  I think we all know the answer to that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of British Columbia were asked if they believed the 
people of British Columbia should have the right to vote on the 
principles of the Nisga'a treaty in a provincial referendum. Some 
94% of the constituents of the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism and Status of Women stated that they believed 
that they should have the right to vote in a provincial 
referendum.  What does the government say?  It states that the 
members of this place represent their constituents and vote for 
them, but that obviously fails to work democratically in 
situations such as this when members of parliament vote against 
the wishes of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poll also asked how the people of British Columbia wanted 
their federal member of parliament to vote on this treaty. 
Of those polled, 94% wanted the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam to vote against this treaty.  Do 
we really think this member will vote in compliance with the 
wishes of his constituents?  No, he will vote as he is told by 
the powers to be here in Ottawa.  It is a shame:  82% of the 
constituents of the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and 
Status of Women want her to vote against this legislation but she 
will not do so; 92% of the constituents of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans want him to vote against this legislation 
but he will not do so; 92% of the constituents of the member for 
Richmond want him to vote against the legislation, but he will 
not do so; and 91% of the constituents of Vancouver Quadra want 
him to vote against this legislation. I will not say that he will 
not listen to his constituents as he has been known to buck the 
powers to be in the past.  I can only hope that again he will see 
the light.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to conclude with a quote from Professor Ehor 
Boyanowsky who appeared before the panel of my colleagues in 
Vancouver.  Professor Boyanowsky is a professor of criminal 
psychology at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British 
Columbia.  His area of expertise is individual and group violence 
and inter-group violence and conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Boyanowsky told a compelling story based on an 
extrapolation into the future of the conditions being set up 
today under the Nisga'a agreement.  I will not go into his story 
but suggest that members read it for themselves.  There is one 
thing he did say which bears repeating.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The psychological literature is very clear.  Where you draw a 
line around people, where you can take an underclass and make 
them into an overclass, very quickly they become the object of 
enmity.  Where you form the basis of difference between people on 
an ethnic basis or genealogical basis, you create hatred.  This 
was true in eastern Europe, it is still true in the Balkan 
countries.  We are re-creating, reimposing because our English 
predecessors who came here knew no better, so they reimposed a 
British model on Canada.  I think what we have to do is say that 
we have a certain image in our minds of how Canada should 
function and we do whatever we can to try to preserve that.  This 
does not mean that we do not compensate native peoples for the 
lands and the injustices they have been the subject of in the 
past, but what we do is we remain true to certain kinds of 
principles.  And those principles are based on individual 
ownership, individual opportunity, and the opportunity for 
redistribution of resources unfettered by genealogical 
distinctions or ethnic differences.  I think that otherwise, what 
happens is you end up with enmity, with hatred and with people 
partially frozen in time between an old system and a new system, 
especially when they, for example, cannot use their lands. 
</UL>

<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to address a couple of points that I think are 
fairly key in this debate over this historic treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Canadian from the city of Mississauga in Ontario. People 
might wonder what interest I could have in a treaty with 
aboriginal people on the west coast.  I think there are some 
things happening here both as to how this place functions and the 
significance of the negotiations with the Nisga'a that should 
concern all Canadians from sea to sea to sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that there is no possible way, there are no 
circumstances, there is no opportunity for us to satisfy the 
concerns of the official opposition.  If there were, we would not 
be facing some 500 amendments to the bill after it has gone 
through the extensive process that it has gone through.  One 
would think that a parliamentarian could go through committee, 
could go through negotiations, could discuss within this place 
the issues of concern and come to some understanding of it. While 
the opposition says that the government is unwilling to accept 
amendments, it continues to put what I think the Canadian people 
would consider to be either frivolous or dangerous amendments to 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have been listening to the hon. member.  I am sure that 
he is aware that we put many amendments forward and they were all 
rejected at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  This is debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know that is the 
strategy of the Reform Party and that is fine if members want to 
continue to interrupt me because I will get the point across. 
The point is that what the Reform members are doing in terms of 
trying to gum up the wheels of government is, frankly, 
irresponsible.  If they would just admit that there is nothing 
that could satisfy their concerns because they have failed to put 
those concerns on the record in this place. They stand and talk 
about the potential impact to our charter. They say it is 
creating some new level of government.  What they do not say is 
that the Reform Party is inextricably opposed to self-government 
and self-determination by aboriginal Canadians. It is absolutely 
the case.  They will not say it but that is fundamentally what 
they are opposed to.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has had provincial hearings and community hearings.  We 
have had federal negotiators who have met for countless hours. 
We all know it has been an issue for in excess of 100 years.  We 
all know that the Nisga'a people have attempted to negotiate with 
the province of British Columbia and the country of Canada and in 
the past they have failed, so what do we do?  Do we simply ignore 
the injustices?  Do we simply ignore the heritage of the Nisga'a 
people in British Columbia, or do we try to move ahead 
incrementally and put in place a bill and a treaty that will 
bring some justice to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members can be obstructionist if they want to.  It 
is unfortunate that this issue has come down to a debate between 
our philosophy and theirs when in fact what we should be dealing 
with are the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about frivolous or even potentially dangerous 
amendments, let me give an example of one that the member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley has put forward. Clause 5 of Bill 
C-9 states, “The Nisga'a final agreement is binding on, and can 
be relied on by all persons”. The amendment being put forward by 
the member would delete the words “and can be relied on by”. 
Therefore the clause would read, “the Nisga'a final agreement is 
binding on all persons”.  The Reformers would delete the words, 
“and can be relied on by all persons”.  Why would they want to 
do that?  What is the impact of that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  During the negotiations the federal 
negotiator met with a number of third parties to this particular 
agreement.  Those third parties are companies in forestry, 
mining, fishing, other resource sectors, utility companies, other 
business interests, environmental groups, local government, Nass 
Valley residents who are not part of the Nisga'a people and many 
other groups with legal interests in this particular agreement. 
The Reform Party amendment would take away any opportunity for 
any of those groups to be able to challenge anything within the 
agreement, perhaps in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  Why would the Reform Party do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party stand in this place and say that the 
rights and the protection of women is not in the Nisga'a 
agreement.  The minister has stood in his place as early as today 
in question period and clearly stated—I do not know why they 
cannot grasp this concept—that the rights of Nisga'a women will 
be protected under provincial laws, the same way as all women in 
British Columbia and Canada enjoy protection.  Why does the 
Reform Party need to have it specifically addressed in the 
agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we put a clause in the bill that says that they can rely on 
this agreement, by deleting that, if we want to set women up as a 
specific group, then we are saying that women will not be able to 
rely on this particular agreement. The forest industry, or the 
mining industry, or the other groups I have talked about will not 
be able to rely on it.  We have to ask ourselves whether Reform's 
researchers do not understand the impact because words in this 
place are so all important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Words set the future course for the government. 
Words tell Canadians what the government feels and what the 
opposition feels.  By deleting those few little words in that 
agreement, we are potentially taking away the rights of so many 
groups who perhaps are not specifically mentioned in the Nisga'a 
agreement but who have a substantial interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example.  This agreement gives Canadians the 
right to reasonable access to Nisga'a lands.  Would the Reform 
Party's amendment deny that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own province of Ontario, in a place just north of Parry 
Sound, there was a dispute where the native community blockaded a 
road and would not allow access to cottagers, who had historic 
access, to their lakes.  If we were to follow and extrapolate the 
views of the Reform Party, they would lose any protection should 
that situation occur under the Nisga'a agreement simply because 
Reform put an amendment that said that those cottagers, to use 
that example, could not rely on the agreement.  They could not 
rely on their rights as Canadians to cross that particular 
barricade to access lands that perhaps will be isolated as a 
result of the redrawing of boundaries through this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know many members of the Reform Party.  I work with them in 
committee, whether it is on citizenship and immigration or public 
accounts.  I see the esteemed chair of our public accounts 
committee in this room and welcome him back after his trials with 
health problems.  We are delighted to see him here.  There is a 
reasonable individual, and there are others over there.  Do they 
not see that by deleting those little words it would take away 
the rights of all Canadians, interest groups, environmental 
groups and women to enjoy the access to and benefits of this 
particular agreement?  I think it is a mistake.  I can only 
assume Reformers do not understand it, but it is rather tragic 
that we have got to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just read another clause, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a Nation releases Canada, British Columbia and all 
other persons from all claims, demands, actions, or proceedings, 
of whatever kind, and whether known or unknown, that the Nisga'a 
Nation ever had, now has or may have in the future, relating to 
or arising from any act, or omission, before the effective date 
that may have affected or infringed any aboriginal rights, 
including aboriginal title, in Canada of the Nisga'a Nation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are members suggesting that there is something wrong with that? 
We are saying that in return for granting new rights and a new 
treaty to the Nisga'a people, we are asking that everybody else 
who could be impacted on in any way whatsoever be relieved of 
that implication.  This agreement is historical.  It is a 
travesty that Reformers are throwing out absolutely false 
information.  They should simply support this agreement and let 
the Nisga'a people enjoy the many benefits that come with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-9 at report 
stage, Group No. 1, an act to give effect to the Nisga'a final 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to first assure the Nisga'a people, other native groups 
and all my constituents, despite what the current powerholders 
say about our questioning of the deal, that my interest in the 
bill is to address the need for a better future for the Nisga'a 
people and all those under the Indian Act and in relation to each 
other and with other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that after years of negotiation within a framework 
dictated by the Indian Act but controlled by the federal 
government and Indian affairs, most Nisga'a leaders feel that they 
have no alternative but this agreement.  British Columbians have 
been wrongly told that it is this deal or nothing.  Sadly, it is 
just more of the same that has already failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition MPs are not similarly tainted.  We question and 
oppose because we do not believe this agreement, in the long term 
perspective, is in the best interests of the Nisga'a people, in 
the long range interests of aboriginals throughout B.C. or in the 
interests of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be noted that the official parliamentary aboriginal 
affairs committee shut out many astute witnesses.  So with a view 
to being more responsive to citizens than the traditional parties 
in the House, Reform conducted additional hearings to let others 
have a say. 
For example, one witness was Kerry-Lynne Findlay who was on the 
constitutional section of the Canadian Bar Association.  She was 
asked for her views.  Somewhat in this vein, I said to her that I 
was sure she had reflected a lot about these matters and of 
society's relationship with aboriginal people and that it was not 
just a Canadian problem.  I told her how I had discovered during 
my visit to Taiwan that it has aboriginals who it has to work out 
a relationship with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked her if she could reflect on society's general 
relationship with aboriginals, what would be a better way, in 
general principles, the main things we must not forget, if we are 
going to actually ameliorate the situation, raise standards of 
living, try to modernize democracy and try to get to a situation 
where we might say that we have one land, one law and one people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will paraphrase her comments.  She said “—people really get 
confused with the notion and the idea of assimilation—People 
say that if you are treated the same, somehow you will be 
assimilated if you are being treated equally”.  She went on to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I don't think that's what anybody is talking about, 
and clearly antiquated policies that try to achieve that hurt 
everybody and I don't think anybody quarrels with that today. 
However, that is not the same thing as bringing aboriginal 
peoples along with other peoples who live here, some of whom have 
arrived recently, into what we call sort of the mainstream of 
Canadian society.  That means that the opportunities are equal 
for all, even some recognition, perhaps, for those who need a 
little help to get where the opportunities are equally applied. 
But it doesn't have to mean that your culture disappears.  It 
doesn't have to mean that you language disappears.  It doesn't 
have to mean that your traditional ways and points of view and, 
particularly, your religious beliefs disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow...in government circles, the distinction between the two 
has been entirely lost and, therefore, there's been a buying into 
this concept that rather than getting rid of separation of 
peoples we will actually entrench it.  Again, most of the 
problems with the way it was done historically is that we took 
whole groups of people and said, “You will live there and please 
don't cross the line,” and in some cases even moved them into 
that place they were going to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet here we are now putting a (legal) fence up around those 
places and saying, “We're going to help you keep the outside 
world out”.  It isn't realistic in modern terms at all and I 
don't think it will work.  Over time I really fear we are headed 
toward civil unrest and more of the standoffs of the kind we saw 
at Oka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These occurrences will happen again...when people feel left out 
and that's what we are talking about. My solution is to bring 
people on board.  Bring everyone on board and have everyone part 
of the process.  So many of these decisions aren't even being 
made by the minister or the politicians, they're being made by 
the bureaucratic system in Ottawa and by faceless and nameless 
bureaucrats who do not have to stand up before the people and be 
accountable for their decisions, and that's a shame. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the comments she made.  Certainly, Ms. Findlay 
ought to know as she was part of the Liberal policy development 
machine in times past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Reform member on the committee put it to her further and said 
that often in the development of the treaty process we have a 
problem with government policy toward aboriginals and that it was 
very difficult at the beginning to get people to understand what 
the issues were because they simply were not involved.  He went 
on to say “I think that has been a problem, to a large extent, 
with some of the treaty process, that until it hits you 
directly”—such as the fishermen, many who are aboriginals, who 
will, as a result of this deal, lose their share of the 
catch—“it is merely an academic problem that you may or may not 
become interested in.  I think that's a pretty fair statement of 
the situation in the real world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the member, Ms. Findlay, the lawyer, responded 
this way about the political legitimacy and the broad community 
consent and awareness.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is, but I believe it is changing, I really feel, 
because I think finally, now, for whatever reason, linkages are 
being made right across the country, and I am certainly 
experiencing that.  When I send out an e-mail now, it goes all 
across the country, because I have people from across the country 
contacting me and saying, “We want to link with you and we think 
that the fishermen who are affected, and the loggers who are 
affected, and the non-native leaseholders who are affected, and 
the other people in the resource-based economies who are 
affected, we want to know you, and we want to support you and be 
part of this.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So you see groups springing up, the United Canadians for 
Democracy, that is a group that the leaseholders are part of 
forming, but it is based out of Ontario.  CanFree is a new group 
that has been set up right here in British Columbia. I think that 
you are seeing this more and more now, and certainly that's why I 
know who Phil Eidsvik is now, and he knows who I am.  This is 
why, when I was back in Halifax, I contacted fishers back there 
because of the Marshall decision that had just come down. So I 
think it's changing.  Again, though these processes take time, 
and time is something we don't have with the Nisga'a treaty, but 
it may be something we have with other treaties coming up and 
maybe so with this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government, the federal and the provincial 
government, are being, themselves, very naive now if they feel 
that they can continue to use that divide and conquer approach 
and that Canadians are not linking, because they are.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our effort today in the House is to do our constitutional duty, 
to require the government to make its case to the electorate. The 
point is that the Liberals are out of date.  When failed 
policies, wrong ideas and false assumptions narrow the range of 
choices, the shape of destiny will always be sadly lacking if not 
bringing deep sorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate to negotiate and the manner in which it was done by 
B.C. politicians is discredited.  The arrangement will not bring 
about lasting reconciliation, and it is just one treaty down and 
fifty to go.  The legal expectations are there now and the 
template is set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much is to be worked out in the future and so much is written in 
vague terms.  Fairness guarantees are very elusive in the 
package.  Its emphasis is to separate rather than bring together. 
Legal equality principles have been sometimes abandoned.  In 
such experiments, we must support equality, democracy, 
accountability and the coupling of entitlement with 
responsibility.  Tolerance and diversity and mobility rights are 
there entwined in the settlements with Canadian natives. It is of 
grave importance when we assess the proposal for embedding by 
treaty small closed societies in a large, complex and open 
society, that is itself struggling to keep its place in a 
changing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can ask how the treaty will help to engage the peoples in the

better as a country, for all not just a few, that I speak to the 
mistake parliament is making today.  For where there is injustice 
we must right it, where there is discrimination we must denounce 
it, where there is violence we must stand against it and where 
there are wounds we must heal them.  May we be generous, be fair 
and be honest in our deliberation and learn to be guided as we go 
forward determined not to reflect the mistakes of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing informs the public mind to understand and evaluate an 
issue like a public referendum.  First, let us have one.  Second, 
the government needs to ensure in better terms that we are not

Third, the government needs to ensure all Canadians that the 
competing overlapping claims will be accommodated and properly 
dealt with.

three things and the next time to be guided to negotiate more

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to be taking part in this debate, which is a 
very important one for the Nisga'a and the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important for all members to understand how the 
Nisga'a final agreement was negotiated within the Canadian legal 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement was negotiated with an eye to the 
rights and interests of all Canadians and, as recommended by the 
courts in recent cases such as Delgamuukw, is intended to 
reconcile the rights of the Nisga'a with the title and 
sovereignty of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although all components of the Nisga'a final agreement fully 
reflect the Canadian legal context, it must be linked to the 
Canadian constitution, Canadian laws and the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us look at how the Nisga'a final agreement relates to 
the Canadian constitution.  In fact, the Nisga'a final agreement 
recognizes the constitution as the supreme law of Canada.  No 
amendment to the constitution is therefore necessary to give 
effect to the Nisga'a final agreement, and the agreement does 
not alter the Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this agreement includes self-government provisions, the 
legislative authority of the Nisga'a will be exercised 
simultaneously with existing authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are a few examples of how the Nisga'a final 
agreement was negotiated with a view to the Canadian 
constitutional framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement states clearly that it does not 
alter the constitution.  The intention of the parties was for 
the Nisga'a final agreement to be interpreted in a manner 
consistent with the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to the Nisga'a Final Agreement Act states that the 
constitution is the supreme law of Canada and reaffirms that the 
Nisga'a final agreement does not alter the constitution.  The 
courts may refer to this preamble when interpreting the Nisga'a 
final agreement act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members have proposed that we delete from the bill the 
clear and unequivocal statement by all parties that “the Nisga'a 
Final Agreement states that the Agreement does not alter the 
Constitution of Canada”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What problems do they want to create?  What confusion are they 
stirring up with this amendment?  What is more, they are also 
proposing an amendment to the wording of the preamble as it 
relates to application of the constitution.  It is certain that 
Reform Party members cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed preamble makes the intentions of the parties clear 
and will assist the courts in their interpretation of the 
Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us touch on the charter of rights and freedoms as it applies 
to the Nisga'a final agreement. 
I want to point out that one of the general provisions of the 
final agreement calls for the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms to apply to the Nisga'a government in respect of all 
matters within its authority, bearing in mind the free and 
democratic character of the Nisga'a government as set out in the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore clear that the charter will apply to all 
activities of the Nisga'a government.  Consequently, the charter 
will apply not only to legislation enacted by the Nisga'a 
government but also to other activities, such as the decision to 
hire someone or to issue licences. The charter will protect all 
individuals who might be affected by the decisions of the 
Nisga'a government, not just the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last part of this article—“bearing in mind the free and 
democratic nature of Nisga'a Government”—is similar to the terms 
used in section 1 of the charter, which indicate clearly that 
the rights conferred by the charter are not absolute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments, including the Nisga'a government, must justify any 
limits to be imposed on the rights guaranteed under the charter. 
This expression shows therefore that the Nisga'a final 
agreement provides for the establishment of a government of a 
free and democratic nature.  A Nisga'a government established in 
accordance with these provisions could invoke section 1 of the 
charter like any other government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a have supported the application of the charter since 
the conclusion of the agreement in principle in 1996.  The 
language of the final agreement, as I have said, follows the 
wording of the charter to facilitate its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the Reform Party has proposed an amendment under 
which the Nisga'a government would be treated differently from 
other governments in Canada.  Does that make sense?  Does this 
further the integration of the Nisga'a into Canadian society 
which we are all seeking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform amendments run contrary to the desire of all of us 
here to see the Nisga'a government integrated with the other 
governments in Canada.  Is that really what they want?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to speak this afternoon on behalf of the 
constituents of Calgary East in the debate on Bill C-9, an act to 
give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many of my colleagues speaking here today, I am not from 
British Columbia, but that does not diminish our resolve to see 
an agreement that is in the best interests of British Columbians, 
Canadians, and the Nisga'a people.  That is why I am speaking to 
this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 is not an ordinary piece of legislation.  The agreement 
that is before the House is an arrangement providing for the 
government of the Nisga'a people, the government of the local 
economy and the government of the relations with each other and 
with non-aboriginals.  The bill seeks to replace a terribly 
flawed system that has existed for 130 years. It is a system with 
a track record of bringing poverty, family breakdown, violence, 
illness, shortened lifespan, unemployment and suicide to the 
aboriginal people of this country.  It is a system established 
and mismanaged for over 100 years by successive Tory and Liberal 
governments. The system as it exists today simply does not work. 
Its record speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An effort to change the system has led to a series of land 
claims, court cases and court actions which are further straining 
the relationships between aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
Canadians.  In addition to the billions and billions of dollars 
that Canadian taxpayers commit to the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development every year, the Canadian 
taxpayer is on the hook for a potential $200 billion price tag as 
an estimate of the cost of all aboriginal demands. This is an 
absolutely staggering figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that tensions between aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals are perhaps higher than they have been in years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many are looking at the Nisga'a agreement as a framework that 
will miraculously solve all our immediate problems and provide a 
template for the future.  However, this government does nothing 
to redress the key components of aboriginal governance and 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this agreement sought to give the Nisga'a people a chartered 
municipal government similar to the form of local government 
enjoyed by most Canadians, this would be a step in the right 
direction, a removal from special status and a step toward 
equality.  However, Nisga'a laws according to this agreement will 
override provincial and federal laws in a multitude of areas.  It 
will give the municipality paramount power over 14 areas of 
exclusive jurisdiction and shared powers in another 16 fields of 
federal and provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government will be exempt from a range of provincial 
taxes and stumpage fees and will not have to pay the GST. 
Individual Nisga'a citizens will be permanently exempt from 
having to hold or pay federal and provincial licences, fees, 
charges and royalties on fish and wildlife entitlements provided 
under this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance the above points may seem almost trivial. 
However, we must remember that this agreement is supposed to 
provide a template for 50 similar agreements in British Columbia. 
The precedent is being set for race based tax exemptions 
throughout British Columbia and indeed throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the lack of physical and democratic 
accountability in the Nisga'a agreement.  The Nisga'a treaty 
effectively centralizes power in the hands of governments on 
aboriginal lands and not in the hands of the people.  Individual 
Nisga'a will depend on the government in a variety of areas, 
including housing, social assistance and employment.  In fact, 
most of the employment on Nisga'a lands will be either with the 
Nisga'a government or with corporations owned by the Nisga'a 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly the model of economic development proposed in this 
agreement is one in which nearly all revenues flow from the 
federal and provincial governments to the Nisga'a government.  It 
does not flow to the Nisga'a entrepreneurs, workers, taxpayers or 
citizens.  It flows to the Nisga'a government to generate 
economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement in fact continues to deny aboriginals many of the 
political and economic tools available to other Canadians. From 
responsible self-government to all the tools of the marketplace 
and private enterprise for economic development, this agreement 
in essence denies aboriginal people access to tools that the vast 
majority of Canadians take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me look for a moment at property rights.  There is an 
absence on reserves of the most basic of property rights, just as 
there is an absence of contract rights.  There is an absence of 
free markets in housing, labour and capital.  Because these 
fundamental rights do not exist on reserves, many aboriginal 
people have had to leave the reserve in order to get the tools 
that other Canadians take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look to the many small business owners in my riding of Calgary 
East.  Many of them use their properties or homes to secure 
capital from the banks to get their businesses off the ground. 
This is a luxury that has been denied to the native entrepreneurs 
because of the system of socialist economics that exists on 
reserves.  The reserve system has not only had a negative impact 
on the aboriginal people, but it has been poisoning the 
relationship between aboriginals and non-aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that investors and business people thinking of doing 
business in areas contained in aboriginal lands and treaties are 
thinking twice about making these investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk now about what the official opposition 
proposes as a solution to a system that has proven itself to be 
ineffective and in fact harmful to aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals alike.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the official opposition believes in equality for all 
Canadians. Aboriginals and non-aboriginals alike should be 
entitled to the same rights, entitlements and powers in law with 
the freedom to use the law in different ways to give expression 
to their uniqueness and diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the official opposition believes that all Canadians are 
entitled to the services of a local government that is fiscally 
and democratically accountable to the people it serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the official opposition believes strongly that the 
department of Indian affairs should begin the process of funding 
aboriginal persons on reserves directly, then allowing local 
aboriginal government to tax its own people to get access to it. 
This measure would go a long way to enhance the process of fiscal 
and democratic responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we believe that private property and contract rights 
must be established on reserves.  We must develop real housing 
and labour markets on reserves, including equal economic rights 
for men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude my comments today, Bill C-9 does nothing to repair 
the damage caused by the 100 plus years of the reserve system. 
The bill does nothing to provide to aboriginals the basic rights 
that the vast majority of Canadians enjoy.  The bill does nothing 
to satisfy the principles of equality under the law, fiscal and 
democratic accountability, private enterprise and free market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill fails even the most basic of democratic principles.  It 
fails to take into consideration the democratic rights of people 
living in the federal riding of Skeena, who will be most impacted 
by the bill.  It fails to fulfill the democratic interests of 
British Columbians who continue to be denied adequate 
representation. It fails to take into account the interests of 
Canadians in general who have been denied full debate and 
disclosure of a bill that will have a tremendous impact far 
beyond the Nass Valley and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the member for Skeena and my Reform 
colleagues for standing in the House and fighting for what they 
believe is right, and for what I believe the vast majority of 
Canadians believe is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is unfortunate for the Nisga'a people, British 
Columbians and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows:  the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, 
Gasoline Pricing; the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester, 
Airline Industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in today's 
debate on the final stages of the Nisga'a treaty through the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the speeches this afternoon by my 
friends in the Reform Party. I use the term advisedly; they are 
my friends. I consider many of them my personal friends and I 
respect their views but they are totally different from mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had an image come to me.  It is an image of Colonel 
Custer standing on the plains in the west completely surrounded 
by aboriginal warriors.  In his last gasping breath, shooting 
wildly in all directions, he and his band of soldiers are wiped 
out. That is what I thought when I listened to my friend make his 
speech just a few moments ago.  He does not have blond curly 
hair, but if he had, he would be the typical picture of Colonel 
Custer in his last stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today and tomorrow as we vote, it will once again be a version 
of the last stand.  I say that with all due respect but that is 
how I feel.  The Reform members feel very strongly on certain 
sides of the issue.  I feel equally strong on the other. I had 
this image of Colonel Custer shooting wildly in all directions, 
knowing that this was it and finally succumbing to the bands of 
Indian warriors on that very fateful day which changed history in 
terms of the plains and aboriginal peoples. 
Today we are at a similar kind of crossroads.  Once again the 
people of the Nisga'a nation were consulted after their 
negotiators had gone through a very long and painful process of 
negotiation.  I cannot imagine the tolerance that lasted over 100 
years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you know this story and I will not repeat it in 
detail, but I will give a brief history of the Nisga'a.  They 
paddled their canoes almost from the Alaska boundary to Victoria 
over a hundred years ago, which is a long canoe paddle for 
anyone, to bring their grievances to the governing officials of 
the time.  They said that they had never agreed to cede their 
territory and they wanted to negotiate a deal.  We all know the 
terrible impact of the reaction when they were essentially told 
to turn around and paddle their canoes back home, which they did, 
but they never gave up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 100 years later, after the patience of Job was demonstrated 
for decades and decades, a deal was negotiated.  The Nisga'a 
people were asked what they thought about the deal.  They said 
that they agreed with it, that it was not a perfect document, 
that they thought they could get a better deal.  Some thought 
there were some problems with it, but overall they said it was 
the best deal they could negotiate with the provincial and 
federal authorities and they would accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is democracy.  That is what life is all about.  We 
negotiate a deal and then we ask people if they support it. They 
say yes and then we move on.  British Columbia said yes and now 
Canada is saying yes, presumably in the closing stages of this 
debate.  Then it will go off to the other place.  I suspect that 
because it has the support of the two parties represented in the 
other place it will pass rather expeditiously, having gone 
through a lot of public consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friends in the Reform Party are saying that there has 
not been enough consultation.  Fair enough.  That is debatable. 
What is enough?  I have held many meetings in my constituency. 
They were all public, open meetings which were well advertised 
and well attended.  The discussion was always very thoughtful and 
very progressive.  Yes, people had some concerns about the deal. 
I have concerns about the deal.  We all have concerns about the 
deal, but that is the way deals are made. They are not perfect. 
The people who negotiate them are not perfect.  We have come up 
with an agreement negotiated by individuals, all of whom are 
imperfect by definition, so yes we have differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House of Commons we witnessed a small political miracle. 
It is a small political miracle when Liberals are in agreement 
with Progressive Conservatives, who in turn are in agreement with 
people from the Bloc Quebecois, who in turn are supported by 
members of the New Democratic Party.  Four of the five political 
parties in the House of Commons are agreeing on a major issue. 
Yes, we agree regularly on minor issues, all kinds of trivial 
issues, all kinds of minor homework issues and technical 
questions, but this is not a typical little deal.  This is a huge 
initiative taken by this House that is historic in nature on 
which four out of the five political parties agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could say that they do not know what they are talking about 
or that they do not know what they are doing, but let us face it, 
these are honourable men and women who have obviously given this 
a lot of thought, who have read the agreement, who have studied 
it, who have heard the reactions, and who have, in their 
judgment, decided to agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we all feel that this is a perfect document?  No.  Nobody 
does.  However, we have looked at it, we have read about it, we 
have heard from our constituents and we have made a judgment, and 
four out of five political parties support it.  The Reform Party 
opposes it.  Fair enough.  It is a free country and it has a 
right to its position.  This must tell us something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consulted with Indian bands in my constituency of Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys.  I asked if they supported the 
Nisga'a deal and they all said no.  The Indian bands do not 
support it.  They would not sign the deal because they think it 
is not good enough.  Fair enough.  That is their view.  They say 
that they think they should do better and when they negotiate one 
day they will do better.  That is their stated position.  When my 
friends in the Reform Party say that this is a template for other 
agreements, I can say that the people of the Shuswap Nation say 
it is no template, that they will not agree to it because it is 
not good enough from their perspective.  All right, we will set 
that aside.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not disagree more with some of the points made by my 
hon. friends in the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say two things.  First, there will be a massive 
transfer of dollars from Ottawa to British Columbia for the first 
time in history.  I am talking about hundreds of millions, 
perhaps billions of dollars, which Ottawa will put into the 
economy of British Columbia.  If $100 million goes to the first 
nations of British Columbia, they are not going to invest that 
money in Hawaii or the Cayman Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Are you sure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My hon. friend in the Reform Party asks 
if I am sure.  No, I am not sure, but he is not sure either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are decent people.  These are people who are dedicated 
Canadian citizens who take pride in their territory.  They sure 
as heck are not going to invest the money in the Cayman Islands 
or Mexico.  The money will stay in British Columbia for British 
Columbians, both aboriginal and non-aboriginal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kamloops Indian band is one of a number of bands in my 
constituency which is incredibly progressive, leading the way in 
terms of change.  It has started a huge housing subdivision on 
its lands.  The houses are selling.  The band is building as we 
speak, in spite of the Musqueam problem which people have 
identified.  I am talking about a huge subdivision being built on 
Kamloops Indian land, being sold almost exclusively to 
non-aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous aboriginal businesses which are thriving and 
dynamic.  They are hiring individuals and doing well.  Alongside 
these businesses are hundreds of non-aboriginal businesses, all 
adding to the economy of the greater Kamloops area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kamloops Indian band developed industrial parks in 
co-operation with the city of Kamloops.  They agreed to share 
water and sewer treatment and various infrastructures to make 
economic development possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kamloops Indian band, working in co-operation with the city 
of Kamloops, has put together one of the most progressive 
industrial parks in British Columbia.  It is filled with 
non-aboriginal and aboriginal businesses and most of them are 
doing very well.  There is all sorts of local economic 
development, wealth creation and job creation.  It can be done. 
This band will soon be coming forward to negotiate a settlement, 
not along the lines of the Nisga'a agreement but along its own 
lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to voting on this issue.  Thank goodness we are 
moving to a new phase in our relations with aboriginal people in 
Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is good to follow a speaker from the party opposite who has had 
some very bright moments in terms of first nations people in his 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today we reflected on the terrible event which happened 
in Montreal 10 years ago with the massacre of young women by a 
lone gunman.  As Canadians we reflect on history.  Today if we 
reflect on our history we could go back some 400 years to the 
arrival of the Europeans.  They came to this continent and met 
the aboriginal people of this country who had their settlements, 
their ways of life, their culture, their activities and their 
civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1579 Sir Francis Drake claimed British Columbia for the English 
crown.  Over 200 years later, in 1793, George Vancouver 
arrived and for the first time met the Nisga'a people of northern 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In question period today the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration answered questions concerning the immigration 
policies of the country.  I am not sure what immigration policies 
the good people of British Columbia had back in the 1700s and 
1800s, but certainly the Europeans who came to that area were 
welcomed and they became a very important part of the British 
Columbia economy as we know it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia who lived in B.C. prior to the 
arrival of the Europeans found themselves at a great disadvantage 
in terms of the relationships which eventually developed between 
their people and the new arrivals to that colony.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of northern British Columbia, the Nisga'a, the people 
of the Nass River and the people of Fort Simpson, where the 
Hudson's Bay Company set up trading in 1834, encountered a new 
way of life.  They encountered a people who were very aggressive, 
who tended to push them back from their civilization and who 
interfered with their hunting and fishing grounds and their 
natural resources.  As a result, today we find ourselves trying 
to resolve a final agreement among the peoples of the Nisga'a 
nation, British Columbia and Canada which will terminate this 
period of conflict and develop a new arrangement by which all 
Canadians, especially the Nisga'a people, can live in their 
territories with some degree of pride and respect for our 
Canadian nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vote that was held among some 2,500 Nisga'a people living on 
reserve, with a very small minority of white people present, 
indicated that most of them supported the agreement that we are 
looking at today.  Some 61% voted in favour of it. Undoubtedly, a 
few felt that it was not right.  Probably more of them felt that 
the agreement we negotiated with them over some 20 years was not 
as generous as it might be.  In fact, the land settlement 
encompasses about 2,000 square kilometres and the original demand 
of the Nisga'a people was for some 20,000 square kilometres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the entire area of the Nass River 
which the Nisga'a negotiated is an area which is probably about 
one-quarter of the size of that small island at the mouth of the 
St. Lawrence River, the island of Anticosti.  It is a small area 
in terms of the overall size of the province of British Columbia. 
To some it sounds like a lot of territory and natural resources, 
but without a lot of people.  We hope that with this agreement 
those people will be able to develop an economy, an existence and 
an area in which they can have pride, show leadership and, above 
all, sustain their people and enter the economy of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard in the House today many statements about what we are and 
who others might be.  I would say that when we try to impose our 
values on others, whether they be in terms of ownership, how 
society should operate or our European traditions, we are not 
doing those people who were here before us much of a favour. They 
have a civilization that is thousands of years old. It is a 
civilization that was developed with great pride in terms of 
housing, artwork and the canoes they use to fish on the rivers 
and on the coast.  Those people do not need great lessons on how 
we might see all Canadians fitting into one pattern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Henry David Thoreau talked about people who listened to 
different drummers, who listened to different musicians, who had 
a different way of life.  As Canadians we have to realize that 
there are many people in this country who cannot be made to fit a 
single mould. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very impressed to find that on the Internet there is a 
tremendous amount of information on the Nisga'a treaty, the 
Nisga'a nation and the northern British Columbia area.  I ask 
people who are watching to consult the Internet, to look at those 
web pages to better understand the debate we are having tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final Nisga'a agreement reflects a different attitude than 
that which is reflected in the Indian Act, which has been a 
tremendous problem for many first nations peoples.  We find that 
there are great restrictions under the Indian Act.  The new 
Nisga'a agreement will mean that the people of the Nisga'a nation 
will develop a new type of arrangement among themselves and with 
our governments.  That arrangement will not only deal with how 
they develop the fishery, mining and forestry resources. 
It will also mean that they may develop a system of taxation by 
which they may tax their own people.  In the long run over a 
period of time, taxes will be applied both by the province of 
British Columbia and by the federal government in terms of income 
tax, sales taxes and GST.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, we hope it will develop among our people in that 
great area of northern British Columbia near the Alaska border a 
sense of pride and freedom and an opportunity to develop 
themselves.  It will show the other first nations of this country 
that when agreements are made, wise people sit down at tables to 
develop understandings and a new sense of arrangements.  It might 
become a lighthouse of great hope by which the people of our many 
600 first nations across the country may see themselves being 
involved in further agreements and attempt to resolve the many 
issues that have afflicted our country since the time when our 
two peoples came together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members today have indicated the problems of the American 
west.  As Canadians we can certainly be proud of the fact that in 
most situations in this country, the big stands like the stand at 
Little Big Horn never existed in terms of relations with our 
first nations peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are different opinions in the House.  I certainly 
cannot agree with some of the opinions I have heard. Hopefully as 
good people we can look to the strength and the goodness in all 
people and with that, with the development of the best ideas and 
the best resources, tonight and tomorrow as we look at this 
treaty we can come to a definite arrangement with the Nisga'a 
people which will be in the best interests of all of us as great 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate on the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not planned that I would speak but, after listening to 
all the speeches by members opposite and by members of all 
parties, particularly the official opposition, I now feel that I must 
make my humble contribution to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lived for several years in close proximity to aboriginals on the 
north shore, and that is where I got to know them.  Canada has 
some atoning to do when it comes to the native peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember that as recently as 1965 aboriginals were not 
allowed to have liquor on reserves. 
Unlike other Canadians, they were not allowed in establishments 
that served alcohol, such as hotels and taverns.  Aboriginals 
were excluded.  I saw this with my own eyes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I also lived through the period when, more 
through ignorance than ill will, Canadians, myself perhaps 
included in those days, treated aboriginals, our fellow 
citizens, unfairly.  Fortunately, with age comes experience and 
one gets to know and accept others, and often discover that they 
have things to teach us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak more specifically about the north shore, 
the Montagnais in Sept-Îles and the Bersimis, who are now known as 
Innu, as I learned recently.  I have worked closely with these 
people. I met with some good people who did not necessarily 
share our values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Astonishingly, they were not caught up in the idea of making 
money, an idea that unfortunately we all have developed to some 
degree, however varying.  The aboriginals I knew were not bent 
on making money at all costs.  They were at peace with 
themselves and with nature, but this did not exempt them from 
some serious attacks on their dignity.  I think that the worst 
thing that happened to aboriginals was the Indian Act passed by 
the federal government, in 1876 if memory serves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They were contained within very clearly defined parameters, 
rather like animals in a zoo.  They were fed, kept clean, 
housed, as in zoos, and could not leave in favour of an active 
and happy life without risking the loss of their status.  And 
what was the sense in all this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal people were stripped of their dignity, a dignity 
they had before we came along, and today they are demanding it 
back.  I am no different from anyone else.  I have no stones to 
throw at my friends across the floor. 
When the Erasmus-Dussault report came out we were told, and that 
was not so long ago, maybe two years, that it would be costly to 
reintroduce equity for the aboriginal peoples, to restore to 
them part of what has been taken from them, as well as the 
dignity they have lost.  The Nisga'a agreement is, in my 
opinion, a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a have perhaps been had, as far as certain aspects are 
concerned, and that is always a possibility with the government 
across the way.  Time will tell.  I am sure that the Nisga'a did 
not have the battery of experts, lawyers and so forth to conduct 
the negotiations as they would have liked, but that is what 
freedom is all about.  It is the ability to make one's own 
mistakes sometimes and also to fix them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this Nisga'a treaty.  These are the first nations. 
They have been here for at least 20,000 years. 
Historians do not agree on this, but there is no doubt they 
were here 20,000 years ago.  When the Europeans arrived, they 
were cavalierly crowded together.  There were 50 million of them 
in what is now Canada and the United States.  How many are left? 
I think there are even fewer of them in the United States than 
there are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have destroyed them, although perhaps not always 
intentionally.  Diseases against which they had no immunity 
killed many once the first Europeans appeared in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if there are many of us, Europeans and their 
descendants, who would have put up for so long with the 
treatment we have given the aboriginal peoples, without 
demanding compensation and without waking one day and saying “We 
want a say on the matter. 
We want to express our opinion, to direct our economic 
development and to be part of Canada's economic growth”.  I do 
not think many of us would have let ourselves be treated the way 
these people have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to avoid comparisons between the criminal world of 
the past and the attitude of some aboriginal people now because 
they have no hope.  Someone said to me the other day that young 
Italian immigrants arriving in the States in the middle of the 
last century and at the beginning of this one had no chance of 
settling in the North American context, benefiting from economic 
growth or enjoying the benefits of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were compartmentalized in a way that put them in the 
service of others all their lives. 
They had the right to settle in the United States, but not the 
right to prosper there, to live in peace, the right to happiness 
and, in particular, to hope.  That is what led to the emergence 
of gangs, and the same thing is happening here with our 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been contained, as I have said, and not allowed the 
opportunity to contribute to, and to profit from—for there are 
two sides to every coin—the benefits of the Canadian economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now with this little treaty, a first, we have succeeded in 
giving the Nisga'a the power to regulate themselves, a kind of 
self-government, although this will nevertheless be under the 
authority of the Canadian constitution and the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be the start of a better life for them.  Perhaps we 
will begin to see positive effects: far more interest, far more 
dynamism, far more hope.  When a people is deprived of hope, 
what does it have left?  Quebecers know something about that; we 
have not gone unscathed either.  That may be the reason why 
today the sovereignist forces are so strong in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be terribly insulting for the Nisga'a to see a newly 
recognized right challenged by people who were not here 50 years 
ago, people who are claiming that an injustice is being done 
because they are losing some of their province's territory. 
What exactly is going on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask Reform Party members to give this some serious 
thought.  Most of them were not here 50 years ago, while the 
Nisga'a have been around for a very long time.  Let them learn 
to live with others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as 1985 the former PQ Premier of Quebec, René Lévesque, 
recognized the first nations in Quebec and offered them 
self-government in a future sovereign Quebec.  We were 14 years 
ahead of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that my party has approved this Nisga'a treaty and 
I hope it is the first in a long list that will set the record 
straight and put a stop to the injustices that have been going 
on for over 125 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to join in the discussion on the Nisga'a 
final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate I have listened to my colleagues in the Reform 
Party with much dismay. Let me make one thing clear to the people 
of Etobicoke and all Canadians.  The Nisga'a agreement is not a 
race based policy of the government as charged by my colleagues 
in the Reform Party. It is an agreement that speaks to the 
principles of fairness, equity and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people have spent over 100 years bringing their 
claim to the attention of governments and their neighbours.  They 
participated in complex and significant negotiations and they are 
at this point in time in need of our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia where very few treaties were negotiated at 
the time of settlement, approximately 50 other first nations are 
in the process of negotiating land claim settlements and 
self-government arrangements with the federal and provincial 
governments.  We hear other members who are from that region 
speak of those arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From talking with my constituents I know that the Canadian 
public in general is supportive of addressing the longstanding 
grievances of aboriginal people.  However, I also know that some 
have not yet come to terms with the fact that imposed solutions 
are not good solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very nature of negotiation means that no one party can have 
everything it wants.  The ultimate goal of negotiations is to 
come up with solutions that balance all potential issues.  At the 
end of the day this means that certain parts of the agreement 
will be easily supported by certain sectors of society, while 
some groups will be more satisfied with other parts of the 
agreement. This is life and this is what happens in just about 
every area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To satisfy my constituents who are deeply interested in the 
agreement, I had to do my homework. 
I discovered that throughout the process of the Nisga'a 
negotiations government representatives consulted with the 
public, with third parties, with neighbouring communities, 
keeping them informed through briefings and information sessions. 
Approximately 500 consultations and public information meetings 
were held during the Nisga'a treaty negotiations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a provincial select standing committee on the 
agreement in principle held hearings in dozens of communities 
around the province.  All of this is well documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the advice from these consultations has found its way 
into the final agreement.  In fact the final agreement contains 
many provisions that directly reflect the concerns expressed 
during these consultation meetings.  We are encouraged to hold 
consultation meetings.  We are encouraged to hear from everyone 
in the community, everyone who has an interest in some way, and 
that has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those consulted indicated that they wanted the treaty to 
represent a final settlement with the Nisga'a people.  The treaty 
contains provisions ensuring that the treaty is final.  Those 
consulted told us that they wanted conservation to be a priority 
in the areas of fisheries and wildlife.  The Nisga'a treaty 
contains provisions to ensure that federal and provincial 
ministers retain their overall authority to manage fish and 
wildlife with conservation as a top priority. The treaty also 
provides harvesting entitlements that give all citizens a share 
of the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians told us that they did not want treaty lands to be 
separate from the rest of Canada.  The Nisga'a treaty contains 
provision to ensure that the Nisga'a lands may be registered in 
the British Columbia land title settlement or land title system. 
It also contains provisions to ensure that the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms and the criminal code and all other 
federal and provincial laws continue to apply on Nisga'a lands to 
protect all Canadians, Nisga'a and others. This is important for 
my constituents, this notion of fairness, this notion of 
partnership with Canada, this notion of being a part of the 
entire system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those consulted told us that they wanted all citizens to be 
subject to the same taxation regimes.  As part of this agreement 
the Nisga'a will pay taxes in the same way that all other British 
Columbians do after a transition period of eight years for sales 
tax and twelve years for income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final agreement reflects years of negotiation and the give 
and the take on the part of all parties.  I think my colleague 
from the New Democratic Party spoke quite eloquently about this 
give and take on the part of all.  They negotiated throughout a 
wide range of views.  Their goals were to act fairly, were to act 
justly, were to balance the range of interest expressed by people 
who were consulted and we see that this was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were issues that arose in a discussion that I had with 
constituents when they talked about overlapping claims.  What 
happens with one group of first nations people who are involved 
in negotiations and who have primary responsibility for resolving 
issues arising from overlapping claims with other first nations 
people?  That too is consistent with recommendations that have 
been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a report of the tripartite British Columbia claims task 
force that made some recommendations in this regard.  One of the 
things that was said was that first nations resolve issues 
related to overlapping traditional territories among themselves, 
that they resolve that among themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has always adopted this approach in its comprehensive 
claims policy.  However, Canada also recognizes that it is not 
always possible to resolve long standing disputes.  But we know 
that somehow this has to be worked out in a fair way in dealing 
with overlaps, that progress in addressing the claims of 
aboriginal people in this country could be very limited unless we 
allow them to negotiate among themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason Canada is prepared to proceed with treaties in 
the absence of overlap agreements provided that there are two 
conditions which must be met. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT66"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT66"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705
<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to set out those two conditions.  First, Canada 
must assure itself that best efforts have been made by the first 
nations involved to resolve the overlapping issues among 
themselves.  Second, Canada must assure itself that the treaty 
appropriately provides protection from infringement of any 
aboriginal rights other first nations may have in the territory 
covered by the agreement or the treaty rights which they may 
acquire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty has been a long time in coming.  The Nisga'a people 
have chosen a peaceful and lawful path to reach their objectives. 
It may not have been the easiest or the fastest path but all 
members in the House should applaud the Nisga'a for choosing it 
as the best way to maintain strong and respectful relationships 
with other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time to take action.  Now is the time to open the 
doors so that the Nisga'a first nations can have their proper 
agreement.  Now is the time to put a Canadian framework in place. 
It is not a Utopian solution that fulfils the needs and dreams of 
all Canadians.  It would be ridiculous to expect any agreement to 
provide that result.  It is, however, a practical and fair 
agreement that takes into account the broad spectrum of interests 
and sets out detailed provisions to allow people to live together 
in the best way that they can.  The parties have carefully 
negotiated, they have agreed on the terms of this treaty, it is 
time to get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us vote tomorrow to do what is fair, to do what is just for 
the Nisga'a people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to stand on behalf of 
Selkirk—Interlake and speak on Bill C-9, better known as the 
Nisga'a treaty, the Nisga'a final agreement act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been a great deal of information distributed in my 
riding by the government to inform people about what is actually 
in the Nisga'a treaty from the government's point of view.  This 
should have been done in a proactive way so that we could have 
understood.  As well, the government has distributed its 
information to selected entities in British Columbia and I am not 
sure where else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch for just a moment on the fact that Bill 
C-9 is a treaty for the Nisga'a people in northwest British 
Columbia.  It has been passed by the British Columbia legislature 
which used closure in effect to stifle debate in that 
legislature. There was a referendum in the Nisga'a treaty lands 
and the people there had a say on it.  However, this right of 
referendum was not extended to the people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in the House also that closure is being used to stop 
debate in the House where we are attempting to look at all the 
facts, at all the sections of the treaty and to expose to the 
government and to the Canadian people parts of the treaty that 
are not as perfect or as good as they could be.  What I am 
talking about is certainly the role of an opposition member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people never received a treaty from the British 
crown at the time of European colonization.  From the late 19th 
century to the mid-20th century the issue remained on the back 
burner without resolution.  Successive federal governments 
refused to negotiate or even acknowledge the need for a treaty 
relationship.  To a certain extent we have the Liberals in 
particular, and the Progressive Conservatives also as 
johnny-come-latelies recognizing that in fact they have been one 
of the biggest problems to the aboriginal people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 an agreement in principle was reached between the three 
parties after some seven years of closed door negotiations.  The 
final agreement was drafted over the next two years and was 
initialled in August, 1998.  Although the Nisga'a people had a 
referendum on the final agreement, the federal and B.C. 
governments, as I said earlier, have refused to allow a 
referendum to consult the people in British Columbia who live 
outside the Nisga'a reserve and in fact all Canadians through the 
idea of giving them information so that they could reach some 
conclusion on their own. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 4, prior to the agreement even being introduced in 
parliament, the three parties concerned signed the final 
agreement.  Then it was presented to parliament.  It would seem 
that perhaps the Canadian people should have had their say first 
before presenting this bill to parliament for debate and before 
the final signing was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that I believe and acknowledge that treaty 
agreements should be signed and that the treaties signed in the 
past have to be honoured.  In Manitoba full entitlement is being 
given in lands and money where the original compensation was 
deemed to be inadequate or was contrary to the treaties that were 
signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement contains both sections that are good and sections 
that leave some doubt as to whether or not they really serve the 
needs of Canadians and the Nisga'a people themselves.  We have a 
case of both good and bad in this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the Progressive Conservatives, the NDP and 
the Bloc.  What is their role in this parliament in dealing with 
legislation put forward by a government?  The role of an 
opposition member of parliament, whether in the official 
opposition or just another opposition party, is to critically 
look at legislation the government brings forward and not just to 
rubber stamp it saying, “Yes, that must be good.  The government 
brought it forward and it has been working at it a long time”. 
In fact, it should closely question and monitor what is actually 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately an opposition party may vote in favour of the 
legislation, but to stand here day after day, as the NDP, the 
Progressive Conservatives and the Bloc members have, and to 
simply applaud the Liberal government just does not cut it for an 
opposition member.  It is not doing the job we were sent here to 
do.  As a result— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I beg to contradict the hon. member from Selkirk.  We do 
not just applaud the Liberals on every piece of legislation they 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Nice try, but that 
sounds like debate to me.  The hon. member for 
Selkirk—Interlake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, the 
duty of opposition members in the House is to question closely, 
to hold the feet of the government to the fire, so to speak, and 
say “You prove to Canadians that in fact what you are saying is 
factual, that in fact you have had full disclosure, that in fact 
you have given all Canadians a full opportunity to understand 
something that affects them as fully as it does when the country 
signs an agreement with a people who were sovereign at one time 
in the British Columbia area”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extent of the government information sharing has been a 
website which is becoming more accessible.  Certainly in my 
riding it is more accessible all the time.  However it is still 
not sufficient to make sure that people are informed.   Many 
people, in particular middle age and older, are not too familiar 
with computers and as a result do not have the information.  They 
still have to live with the agreement that is signed and their 
children, on whose behalf they are making decisions, also have to 
live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the duty of the opposition parties to clearly identify the 
good and bad as I have stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simply stand here and say that they are not doing their job, 
while it may be the truth, is not sufficient either. 
The question is whether the other opposition parties are worried 
that the bill may not go through, even though they would like to 
see it go through.  However, we have repeatedly seen in the House 
that the Liberal government can quite quickly have its members 
vote the way it wants and pass the legislation that it wants.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to why we in the Reform Party want to question the 
Liberals closely on this, let us look at a couple of facts that 
have already been demonstrated.  The first one that concerns me, 
and should concern all Canadians, is that in a couple of 
sections, Nisga'a law, when it is passed by the Nisga'a people, 
will supersede Canadian law where the two are in conflict.  That 
strikes at the very heart of the supremacy of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second obvious thing I find right off the bat is that the 
land, which has been negotiated on behalf of the Nisga'a people, 
has overlapping land claims from neighbouring aboriginal peoples 
who also have a legitimate claim on the land.  It would seem that 
after it is signed, put into law and put into the lands registry 
office in B.C., it will be too late to have another negotiation 
later to sort out just what will happen to those Indian people 
who also deserve a share of the land.  It is their land as much 
as it is Nisga'a land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we want to create this kind of dissension for our 
children, our children's children and our children's children 
after that?   That is exactly what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that really bothers me is that aboriginal women, 
who I have spent a lot of time with over the last two years and 
have spoken on behalf of with regard to their rights under the 
Indian reservation system in the Indian Act, are not being 
specifically addressed here, particularly in the area of 
matrimonial rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that the government has failed to fully 
inform Canadians and give all Canadians a say in this treaty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at last I get to speak on the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by picking up on something the former 
speaker, the member for Selkirk—Interlake, said when he pointed 
out that it was the duty of the opposition to oppose.  I noticed 
that throughout this debate there have been representatives of 
the Nisga'a people in the gallery.  I would like to say to them 
that the member for Selkirk—Interlake is very correct. Something 
goes absolutely wrong in parliament when there is no opposition. 
This place becomes a dangerous place when everyone is on side, 
Mr. Speaker.  I do believe that the Reform Party, which seems to 
be the sole party that is opposing this legislation, is doing its 
duty, and quite properly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I would like to look at some of the arguments 
the Reform Party has put forward.  I have to say that I do find 
some of the arguments wanting.  I would like to just strip away 
some of the rhetoric of those arguments which seem to fall into 
three categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first argument is that the Nisga'a treaty is wrong because 
it transgresses the constitution in some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second argument is that there is great uncertainty about how 
the laws will be applied by the Nisga'a; those laws that are 
given to the Nisga'a people as a result of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Madam Speaker, one of the other major concerns 
expressed by the opposition was that somehow the citizenship that 
would be applied to the Nisga'a lands is a race-based 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firstly, Madam Speaker, on the constitutional question, I 
followed the debate very, very closely.  Quite frankly, there is 
no substance to the fear that the constitution of Canada is being 
somehow circumvented through the back door.  The reality is that 
there is nothing in this legislation and in the treaty that does 
not fully empower this parliament to devolve certain privileges 
in law to the Nisga'a people. 
It is no different than when the constitution or the Parliament 
of Canada gives certain privileges in law to a province, to a 
municipality or anything like that.  I just did not find any 
substance in the constitutional issue at all. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT69"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT69"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720
<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the second problem, the problem that pertains to how 
the Nisga'a people will manage those laws.  Well, there is always 
fear and this is where the debate from the Reform Party has had 
substance, because it is correct to look at what powers the 
Nisga'a people are going to have and to wonder whether the 
Nisga'a people are going to apply those powers in a just and 
equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some reason for concern in B.C. on this very issue 
right as we speak, because not long ago the Musqueam Band in 
Vancouver acquired from the Minister of Indian and Northern 
Affairs the right to manage its properties that were on the 
reserve.  It had a number of rental properties that came up for 
lease renewal involving some 71 non-native families.  This has 
led to a very unfortunate confrontation between the Musqueam 
leadership and the tenants on this property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to tell you, Madam Speaker, that I went out there to try 
to arbitrate and bring the two sides together.  It seemed to me 
that if both sides could sit down and work out their differences 
in good faith, the situation could be resolved. But, Madam 
Speaker, I failed in my mission, and as a result I wrote a letter 
to the minister just summarizing the results of my mission to the 
Musqueam, shall we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a few passages, Madam Speaker.  I will not 
take too much time on it.  If you are patient, you will see how 
it does relate to the Nisga'a peoples' agreement.  Anyway, I met 
with the Musqueam Band and its tenants on September 30-October 1. 
In writing to the minister, I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with representatives of the tenants first.  Given the 
acrimony of the current situation, they said they would like 
nothing better than to leave the reserve but, naturally, want 
some kind of compensation for the money they have invested in 
their homes.  In some cases that money may have been 
considerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day I met with the chief, the band lawyer, and a 
handful of the band council.  The discussion was dominated by the 
chief, the lawyer and one councillor whom I will refer to as the 
band leadership.  They were adamant that the tenants should 
either pay up or get out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my presentation I stressed that in my opinion while the 
tenants had long enjoyed an unreasonably low rents and probably 
did not have any legal basis for compensation, it was in the 
band's material interest to be conciliatory and offer the tenants 
something in exchange for the good will that would be engendered. 
I emphasized that if the tenants are evicted summarily, this 
could compromise the band's ability to attract new tenants and 
other investors.  The leadership rejected this proposition 
outright, although I do not know what impression I made on those 
councillors who did not speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly under the influence of their lawyer, who has no other 
client than the band, the leadership is convinced that the tenant 
properties are worth the rents decreed by the courts ($22,000 
average plus taxes of about $5,000).  The leadership contends 
that it has the full support of the band community in insisting 
on these rents.  I suggested that notwithstanding the court 
decision, rental properties are only worth what people are 
willing to pay.  This idea was rejected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite convinced that because of the failure between these 
two groups to come to terms, and because there is a lawyer 
involved who is preventing people of goodwill from speaking one 
on one, that not only will the tenants lose but I believe the 
band will lose.  I believe the band will lose heavily because I 
think it will have terrible problems getting any kind of income 
on those properties.  Nevertheless, it has become a political 
issue within the band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the chief said to me that he does not like 
politicians, and yet he appears to me to be playing politics 
himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I have one other paragraph.  I said to the minister: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the band is to learn a hard lesson by its unyielding attitude, 
then it must do so.  Self-government by any community means that 
the community must bear the consequences of the decisions of its 
elected leaders.  Enough advice has been offered the leadership. 
In the end the decision is theirs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that have to do with the Reform Party's concern about 
the Nisga'a?  It is simply that when we give people independence, 
when we give people the right to make their own choices about 
their future, we also give them the right to make mistakes, and 
that is democracy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times has the Reform Party—and it really only has been 
the Reform Party-raised concerns, and very legitimate concerns, 
about what the Nisga'a will do when they get this right to manage 
their own affairs.  Will they always make the right decision? No, 
Madam Speaker.  They may make many mistakes, just as the 
provincial government makes many mistakes, just as my own 
municipality and the city of Hamilton often has made mistakes 
that are quite contrary to the interests of the people in the 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, too, the Nisga'a must be allowed to make their mistakes 
because, Madam Speaker, that is democracy.  When it really comes 
down to it, what is sovereignty but the ability to make our own 
mistakes and be responsible for it.  So, I say that what we see 
is democracy in action.  Actually, I would hope that the Nisga'a 
will be tremendously successful, more successful, because if they 
leave the lawyers alone and if they negotiate and talk with other 
Canadians, with the spirit of goodwill, their own conscience and 
their own good judgment, I am sure that the Nisga'a nation will 
be a wonderful success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final question is the race-based citizenship. I want to 
draw your attention, Madam Speaker, to the fact that what we are 
really talking about here is not race-based citizenship, what we 
are talking about is territory.  We are talking about territory 
in the same sense that we talk about Quebec as a territory.  I 
noted that during the debate often the Bloc Quebecois supported 
the Nisga'a in their aspirations because the Bloc Quebecois saw 
resonance with the situation with the Quebecois, who wish of 
course to have a sense of preservation of their identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that the Quebecois or the Nisga'a are preserving? Are 
they trying to preserve the race?  I think not in the case of the 
Quebecois.  They would never that they want a province to be 
based only on the white race.  Are they trying to preserve 
francophones?  No, because there are allophones and anglophones 
in Quebec.  Are they trying to preserve the French language?  No, 
not just the French language because there are people who speak 
other languages, many other languages in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I suggest to you, Madam Speaker, that they are trying to 
preserve in the territory of Quebec, and I suggest to you this is 
the same situation with the Nisga'a people, is they are trying to 
preserve a culture, a heritage.  They do not want that heritage 
to be lost.  When I read the Nisga'a treaty and the legislation, 
I noticed that the Nisga'a have provided for the fact that 
ultimately—and maybe it will become that way—anyone could 
become a Nisga'a.  The key thing is to preserve a tradition, a 
tradition that goes back hundreds of years and goes back before 
Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on the surface, the Nisga'a treaty may appear to many 
Canadians to be an issue that only affects a relatively remote 
and isolated region of northwest British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe that Canadians are beginning to see that this 
treaty will have implications for the entire country that will 
extend beyond northwestern B.C. and well into the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much attention attributed to this treaty, 
although the official opposition believes that there still has 
not been enough debate on the issue.  Today I intend to focus on 
a few key aspects of the Nisga'a treaty, and specifically I want 
to focus on the following questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal vision for Canada?  What vision are the 
Liberals offering all Canadians, both aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal?  Where will this vision take us?  Will this 
Liberal vision actually lead to the building of a stronger, more 
united Canada or will it lead to the fragmenting and polarization 
of individuals and groups?  How does the treaty and others that 
will flow from it fit within a Canadian cultural reality that is 
becoming only increasingly diverse rather than singular? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us briefly consider some of the key components of the 
treaty.  First, it establishes a Nisga'a government in northwest 
B.C. with title to 2,000 square kilometres of land plus 
management rights over another 10,000 square kilometres.  It 
provides that government with $190 million in cash and gives it 
paramount power in 14 areas, along with shared jurisdiction in 
another 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It requires the Nisga'a to pay income tax in 12 years time but 
grants them preferential access to the local fishery and exempts 
them from paying certain other taxes and licence fees in 
perpetuity.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is perhaps most alarming is that the Nisga'a treaty is a 
template.  It is a model for more than 50 treaties to come in 
B.C.   There is no way to know precisely how much these treaties 
will cost but a 1999 study by R.M. Richardson and Associates 
estimates that the total cost could be as high as $40 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little doubt that the creation of more than 50 
entrenched ethnic government enclaves in B.C. will usher in a 
period of tremendous uncertainty in economic development.  The 
cost of settling these claims within the parameters set by the 
Nisga'a agreement will be staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Accounts of Canada estimated the total known costs of 
land claims in Canada to be about $200 billion.  In addition the 
public accounts document included the statement:  “The 
government is aware of an additional 2,000 potential land claims 
currently being researched by first nations.  A reliable estimate 
of these potential land claims cannot be made at this time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incredibly the Liberals are pursuing this and other treaty 
making without giving Canadians, especially British Columbians, a 
fair voice.  They have done this without asking what is 
affordable to the people of Canada.  This is hard to believe 
because it is the Nisga'a and other bands currently negotiating 
other treaties who will have to live together not only with the 
people of B.C. but with the rest of Canadian taxpayers as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now return to a central concern I have with the vision of 
Canada being offered by the Liberals.  Their policy course would 
be more appropriately referred to as one that is desperately 
lacking vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally the Nisga'a debate is about nothing less than the 
kind of country we want to create for our children and our 
grandchildren.  It is about whether we want to live in a Canada 
in which the quality of one's citizenship is determined not just 
by one's race, or whether we want to live in a country where all 
Canadians have equal rights under the law.  It is about whether 
we are prepared to stand aside and watch the government sow the 
seeds of perpetual ethnic conflict and division within Canada or 
whether we are prepared to say no to the failed and bankrupt 
policies of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Future generations of Canadians, those not yet born and those 
who are not of voting age, as well as future immigrants to Canada 
will be asked to assume a huge liability, both fiscal and social, 
that was never theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no exaggeration to state that the Liberal aboriginal 
policy has completely failed.  For one, it does not serve 
grassroots natives on reserves. Also, the costs of the Liberal 
solution supported by the Tories, the Bloc and the NDP are 
completely unaffordable to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty perpetuates all of the problems inherent in 
today's reserve system and entrenches them in a modern treaty. 
The failed policies of the past centred on the collective 
ownership of land are continued under the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side are echoing the concerns of millions of other 
Canadians who fear these treaties will leave enormous political 
and economic power concentrated in the hands of the band 
leadership rather than dispersing it among grassroots Nisga'a by 
guaranteeing private property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty also grandfathers many special rights for ethnic 
Nisga'a including a priority commercial fishing allocation on the 
Nass River and other entitlement programs available to status 
Indians but unavailable to other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While individual Nisga'a will pay income tax after 12 years, the 
Nisga'a government will be exempt from a range of taxes and fees, 
including the GST.  At the same time, the federal government will 
be obligated to financially subsidize the Nisga'a government in 
perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty establishes the shocking precedent of denying voting 
rights on the basis of race.  Non-Nisga'a living on Nisga'a lands 
will have no right to vote in Nisga'a elections even though they 
will be subject to all Nisga'a laws and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to believe that any government in the late 20th 
century would sign a treaty so grounded in race and special 
privilege.  It is hardly a wonder that British Columbians have 
been denied the right to vote on this treaty in a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of Nisga'a does not end at the British Columbia 
border.  Discussions relating to the reinterpretation of treaty 8 
in my province of Alberta have already begun.  The Nisga'a 
agreement will be an important precedent for bands seeking to 
enhance the agreements they made a century ago and which in light 
of Nisga'a are now modest in comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Reform is the only party opposing this treaty in 
parliament, the debate crosses party lines.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The proponents of the race based approach are the federal 
Liberals, the Tories and the NDP.  They have found it impossible 
to resist the pressure and inertia generated by the land claims 
industry in Canada.  Even in the face of conflict and division 
that these policies have so obviously created, they simply do not 
break with the failed policies of the past. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised and disappointed at the Bloc Quebecois' support 
for this agreement.  I also find it strange that the Bloc 
Quebecois is opposed to allowing the people of British Columbia 
to hold a referendum on an agreement that is as important 
historically and constitutionally as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their position perplexes me. How can they support a referendum 
on the sovereignty of Quebec, but be opposed to a referendum on 
an agreement that will set precedents for other agreements in 
Canada and even in Quebec, and even jeopardize their own 
sovereignist agenda? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opponents of this race based approach recognize that we 
simply have no choice but to chart a new course.  Both Reformers 
and provincial Liberals in B.C. oppose the Nisga'a treaty. In 
1982 former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think that there are different categories of Canadians. 
We believe that all Canadians should be equal and it would be 
desirable to attempt to define rights in a way which does not 
distinguish between ethnic groups. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with this fundamental principle and believe that if we 
are to ensure future ethnic peace in Canada, parliament must say 
no to the Nisga'a treaty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join 
my colleagues as we bring to a conclusion the debate on this very 
important bill which is long overdue.  As I listened to the 
opposition, it appeared to me that it would not matter how many 
more days or weeks we debated this bill, I do not think the 
official opposition could be convinced of the importance and 
value of passing this legislation. I agree with my minister, with 
my colleagues on this side of the House and the other parties 
that this must be done.  Bill C-9 must become a law of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is in northern Ontario.  Possibly after the minister 
himself who also represents a northern Ontario riding, I believe 
my riding has the second greatest number of first nations 
communities, approximately 25.  This does not make me any expert 
on first nations affairs but it does give me some insight into 
representing first nations communities with regard to the 
importance of taking this very important step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, as in most provinces, we have treaties with our 
first nations which provide some framework for negotiating issues 
of concern in relationships between the federal government, in 
some cases the provincial government, and our first nations 
communities.  Unfortunately this is not the case in British 
Columbia for different and valid historical reasons, but that 
does not mean we cannot find the basis for a treaty today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we struggle to interpret treaties of 100 or 150 years ago in 
today's context, this treaty itself will not be the silver bullet 
to answer all future problems. Like the treaties in the rest of 
Canada, it will provide an important framework and foundation 
upon which to allow our first nations communities to move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the allegation being made by the Reform 
Party that the Nisga'a treaty will form a template for all other 
agreements in British Columbia.  The Nisga'a treaty was not 
carelessly negotiated and it bears no resemblance to the 
hodgepodge of poorly conceived and often counterproductive 
amendments which the Reform Party has put before the House today 
for our consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is the result of more than 20 years of 
intensely adversarial negotiations. 
The treaty represents a delicate balance of interests and 
reflects the compromises and trade offs made by all parties 
through years of these difficult negotiations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be proud of the hardworking individuals who gave 
their hearts and souls to hammer out the Nisga'a treaty. 
Negotiators representing the governments of Canada, British 
Columbia and the Nisga'a Tribal Council deserve enormous praise 
for their patience and perseverance during the long years of 
negotiations.  Their determination to find a just and lasting 
solution to the Nisga'a claim has resulted in a landmark 
settlement that stands as an example of reconciliation and 
equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been learned from this treaty.  We have wrestled with 
some of the most contentious issues surrounding aboriginal 
self-government and implementation of the inherent right.  We 
have found ways to finally do away with the antiquated Indian 
Act, replacing its provisions with progressive measures that 
enable the Nisga'a people to manage their own affairs.  Perhaps 
equally important, we have come to a new understanding of how 
aboriginal and other governments in Canada can co-exist and bring 
benefits to all residents living on and adjacent to first nations 
lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty stands as a symbol of how Canadians work things out 
in a collaborative and honourable manner.  It further proves that 
Canadians can act as peacemakers around the world because they 
can indeed act as peacemakers at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must acknowledge however that the Nisga'a treaty represents 
only one step in a much larger process.  While this treaty 
finally and fully addresses the longstanding claims of the 
Nisga'a first nation, it cannot serve as the standard form to be 
used in drafting all other treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an assumption on the part of some that the 
Nisga'a treaty somehow serves as a template for the more than 50 
others being negotiated in British Columbia and as a template for 
other treaty negotiations in Canada.  It is important for 
Canadians to understand that this is simply not possible and for 
a number of fairly obvious reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First among them is the fact that a one size fits all model 
could never work.  Individual first nations are just that, 
individual.  The James Bay Cree of northern Quebec are as 
distinct from the Inuit of Nunavut, as they are from the Nisga'a 
in the Nass Valley.  Each first nation has its own unique 
history, culture and customs, geography, language and political 
structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An equally crucial consideration is location.  The issues that 
must be negotiated in a rural setting are often very different 
from those in an urban area.  Hunting or forestry issues may not 
be especially relevant to a suburban setting while matters such 
as ensuring a harmonious relationship with other local 
governments will deserve greater emphasis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important is the fact that the treaty process revolves 
around fair negotiation, not unilateral imposition.  By their 
very nature treaties involve give and take.  Every fair agreement 
must strike a reasonable balance between diverse and competing 
interests in accordance with local circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there is clearly a case to be made for 
learning from Nisga'a treaty experience.  One of the most 
valuable lessons is that treaties provide a reasonable way to 
resolve our differences peacefully and productively by working 
together for the common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia the absence of treaties has historically 
resulted in confrontation and lost economic opportunities for 
aboriginal people and other citizens.  This treaty proves that we 
can resolve those problems through negotiation rather than 
litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also practical reasons to apply lessons learned to the 
Nisga'a negotiation process.  Few people other than the 
negotiators themselves can fully appreciate the incredibly long 
hours and years of work that went into drafting the careful, 
detailed and precise language in this agreement.  Much of the 
time was spent by each of the parties developing their respective 
positions.  From Canada's perspective this entailed extensive 
third party consultations as well as careful legal and policy 
analysis. Having gone through this time consuming and costly 
exercise and having achieved a sound understanding of the issues 
being addressed, it makes sense for us to build on this knowledge 
in future negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also advantages to adopting elements from one treaty 
when they are applicable province-wide.  One of the most 
significant is consistency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular significance within that framework is the benefit 
of certainty over land and resource ownership and use, which is 
critical to providing stability for the business community.  This 
in turn encourages investments that lead to increased job 
opportunities for all people living in and around the affected 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most convincing reason to borrow best practices is 
that it makes sense.  It speeds up the treaty making process.  My 
hon. colleagues need to appreciate that it can take years to 
reach a final settlement.  This painfully slow process comes at a 
significant cost for the first nations directly affected and 
prolongs economic uncertainty within the entire region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that this treaty is not a template, but it will 
serve as a useful example for other negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ratifying the Nisga'a final agreement will enable us to achieve 
all of the objectives that are good for the country, good for the 
province and good for the first nation community itself.  Bill 
C-9 is clearly legislation that the House should support and the 
Nisga'a treaty is clearly the right agreement for the Nisga'a 
people and for the residents of northwestern British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members, including those in the loyal opposition who 
might consider changing their minds, to support this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
are debating today report stage of Bill C-9, the Nisga'a land 
agreement.  Last year, after years of closed door debates, talks 
and consultations, the Nisga'a agreement was signed, but the 
people of British Columbia had no input, nor were they given any 
opportunity for input.  I think that denial of democracy is one 
of the main reasons the Reform Party is against the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Wentworth—Burlington gave a very good speech. 
It was a speech from the heart.  It was not one that was simply 
cranked out in the back rooms and sent over to him to be 
delivered.  This was a speech that he had researched and he spoke 
from the heart, without notes I noticed.  He gave a very good 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I find it rather ironic that his government has moved 
closure on this bill every time it has come before the House.  If 
it had not moved closure, other members of his caucus would have 
been able to speak and we would have been able to debate the 
question.  I naively thought that was how the House should work. 
It should operate in a manner in which we can have divergent 
points of view and debate them.  We should be able to use our 
persuasive powers on the government and the government should be 
able to persuade us that perhaps we are not right and do not have 
the proper point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case I think we have the proper point of view.  I refer 
to the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys.  He 
spoke about the Reform Party being like General Custer.  General 
Custer was massacred.  We are not being massacred; we are simply 
pointing out what is wrong with this agreement.  The only 
possible way that we could compare members of the Reform Party 
with General Custer is that we stand alone. 
Reformers are the only ones who have said that this agreement 
needs to be rejigged or looked at again.  We have also said that 
it needs to go before the people of British Columbia in the form 
of a referendum.  However, the government, taking a page from of 
its cousins in British Columbia, the B.C. NDP caucus, has decided 
that no matter what stage this bill comes before the House it 
will impose closure and ram it through before Christmas.  I do 
not think that is the way things should be done in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development admitted that the only reason 
they went on the road with the committee was because of pressure 
brought to bear on them by the Reform Party.  I find it appalling 
that the government would say that it is not in its best 
interests or it is not one of its priorities to take the standing 
committee to the people this agreement affects the most, but to 
do it only because it was embarrassed or forced into it by the 
official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are on that side of the House voting for the bill, in 
one of the three opposition parties voting for the bill, or in 
the Reform Party, which intends to vote against the bill, we have 
to agree that this will have a lot more effect on Canada than 
simply on the residents of British Columbia.  It has a lot more 
to do with Canada than simply how it will affect the residents of 
British Columbia.  It will affect the people of British Columbia. 
There is no question about that.  However, it will affect 
everyone else in Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that there are at least 50 more of these deals to be 
negotiated in the province of British Columbia alone, and many 
more across Canada.  I heard from members opposite that they do 
not think this agreement will be held up as a template for other 
agreements.  I think that anyone who believes that has their head 
in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that every time this comes up we cannot even debate 
it?  The Reform Party carries the debate for the entire day. 
Occasionally we touch a nerve and a member of one of the other 
parties will jump up and grace us with some thoughtful and 
insightful points, as in the case of my colleague from 
Wentworth—Burlington.  Other than that, we have people coming in 
from that side of the House with predetermined notes which they 
simply recite.  I guess that is allowable in this place, but it 
is hardly debate.  Something that is as groundbreaking as this, 
something that is as precedent setting as this deserves a lot 
more debate than we have been giving it.  Where are the people? 
Where are the debaters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go to the schools in my riding I tell them that things 
are settled in the House of Commons by good, spirited debate, 
with speeches that are well thought out and well researched. When 
the students come here they find that is not always the case. 
They find that the government has a majority.  We cannot expect 
the government to be hamstrung by a handful of people who want to 
completely derail its agenda, but debate should take place and it 
has not taken place in this case.  That is a terrible travesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that we have said we do not like about this 
deal is that it sets a precedent by which all other agreements 
will be measured and argued. 
Therefore, we have to make sure we get this one right.  This one 
above all has to be right.  It has to be one that we can live 
with and that our children's children can live with, one that 
actually empowers native people and gives them freedom.  I do not 
think, from what I have seen of this bill, that it accomplishes 
those things.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of summers ago, on one of the Indian reserves in my 
riding, a group of people had a sit-in in an administration 
building.  Their problem was that they were not being dealt with 
fairly.  They said there was bias in how things were done by 
their band council.  If they were in the in group, they were in; 
but if they were in the out group, they would never be in.  They 
also said that huge amounts of money were not being accounted 
for. They wanted to have something done about it.

problems to the House.  We asked the former minister of Indian

either prove that the people who were making the claims were 
right or prove that the council had acted properly.  The minister 
said “No.  This is strictly their business.  This is entirely up 
to them”.

station, they will notice members of parliament repeatedly 
getting up and down, again and again, probably for hours on end, 
voting on 469 amendments proposed by the Reform Party to this 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite interesting in itself, in that it is an unusual, 
highly irregular practice in the House, what we tend to call the 
highest court in the land, where 80% of the members will vote for 
the treaty, but we have an obstructionist group putting forth 
amendments and pretending to have a legitimate debate.  I think 
it is important to inform the Canadian people about what is 
happening in the House as we have this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to begin by making some primary 
observations and I would like to go into some discussion about 
the applications of the charter and the constitutional 
implications for this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said many times that this is an historic treaty 
which breaks away from the confines, the handcuffs and the 
shackles, as members of the Reform Party would say, of the Indian 
Act.  That is the same Indian Act that has held first nations 
people bound to the confines of their reserves and their lands. 
It is an attempt to break free from that, to move on into the 
21st century and to do it with dignity which would be supported 
by all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it quite interesting in testimony to hear from our 
member from Nunavut who talked about her parents not being able 
to vote until 1960, like Canadian first nations veterans who 
fought for this country.  While living on reserve they 
nonetheless joined the forces in the second world war and made 
great contributions to this country.  They came back home and 
were not able to vote.  I wonder where those who are opposing the 
treaty now were to defend them in those important historical 
moments? They were not there.  Their voices were conspicuously 
silent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members have talked about consultation.  We know 
that we have had a debate in the House.  We have had a week long 
trip in British Columbia.  The provincial legislature had the 
longest debate in recent history in British Columbia, 116 hours 
of debate.  Through an all-party standing committee dealing with 
these matters, there were 34 meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many other meetings conducted even in places like 
Trinity College in British Columbia, a well known Christian 
college.  I believe Chief Gosnell and others went at their 
invitation to meet with them and discuss openly with the students 
and staff what the treaty meant and what they were intending to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Anglican church in British Columbia also invited them, as 
well as others.  Wherever they were asked to go they willingly 
went to talk about these important features with all Canadians, 
anyone who was interested in hearing.  So we have had 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the constitutional legal framework of this 
agreement.  What is important to understand in the debate with 
the Reform Party is this.  We have heard a lot of this over the 
past number of months about the protection of women's rights, 
constitutional third order of government and so on.  Let us set 
out very clearly for the Canadian people the fundamental point of 
the Reform Party's argument and why it would oppose the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental point, Reform Party members argue absolutely 
wrongly and I think they realize that as well, is that this is a 
constitutional amendment.  In other words, the 14 areas of 
jurisdiction laid out in that treaty would somehow contravene or 
spill outside of the constitution or those protections provided 
in section 35 for existing treaties and new treaties that would 
be negotiated now, such as this one, and in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They argue that if that is the case this would trigger a 
referendum both in the House of Commons in Canada under part V of 
the constitution or those particular provisions in British 
Columbia where it would trigger a referendum there.  This is 
absolutely not true.  This is absolutely false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that there are no powers in that 
treaty, in that bill that contravene the constitution. There are 
no new powers.  The powers delegated throughout that process in 
that treaty, those 14 areas, are those that are normally used 
within the understood provisions of aboriginal self-government 
for first nations people and they are quite gentle in their 
application in terms of delivering health services, education, 
child welfare, to name a few.  They are not the kind that are the 
normal cause of debate in terms of constitutional provisions in 
this country.  These are very everyday kinds of services, such as 
child welfare, that in fact, quite honestly, through 
federal-provincial agreements many first nations have been 
delivering for 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the experts say about this?  What do the experts tell 
the Canadian people about the debate?  We have heard from the 
Liberal Party.  The Tories are agreeing with us and the NDP and 
the Bloc, but the Reform Party is saying no.  Let us turn to the 
experts for a moment and ask them.  What did they say in their 
testimony? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Scott from McGill came under questioning in one of the 
first rounds of questions from the Liberal side and I had the 
opportunity to ask him the question.  Professor Scott was chosen 
by the Reform Party as one of the folks it would like to have 
testify at the committee table.  What did he tell us?  He said 
that this is no constitutional amendment. 
I believed him.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that same group was Professor Brad Morse, a former vice-dean 
of the University of Ottawa, and still teaching there, who again 
reiterated that in his view this was no constitutional amendment. 
In fact, he went on to discuss the seven years of applications 
of law where the supreme court of the United States had applied 
these same kinds of provisions in the U.S. courts recognizing 
those rights of first nations people and without violating what 
they call the sacred constitution of the U.S.  The same would 
hold here.  This is no violation, no abrogation, no derogation of 
those provisions that were negotiated in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard from Professor Hogg and Professor Monahan.  Those 
who are lawyers, either watching this debate, or who might read 
about it after, or even here in this Chamber, will know that 
Professor Hogg is the dean of constitutional law in Canada.  Any 
student will know that his written textbook is required reading 
in first year constitutional studies across Canada. We had him 
testify before our committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from some of his observations, as well as 
a colleague of his, Professor Monahan, another equally eminent 
and respected legal scholar who is called upon frequently by the 
media and others to give his observations on a number of issues 
affecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Monahan in responding to questions said that “While I 
think there are some respectable arguments that can be made,”—I think 
he was being very generous here—“challenging the 
agreement on the basis of some older cases”—he is referring to 
the privy council which was the supreme court at the time—“in 
the early part of the 20th century, in my view, the better or 
more persuasive legal conclusion is that the agreement”—the 
Nisga'a Treaty, Bill C-9—“and the ratifying legislation is 
valid”—here we go—“and does not constitute an amendment to 
the Constitution of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also went on to talk about section 35 recognizing both 
existing treaties and future treaties.  That is spelled out very 
clearly in section 35 of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did Professor Hogg have to say?  I am quoting him in his 
analysis and he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have very little doubt that the courts will decide that there 
is an aboriginal right to self-government.  So the Nisga'a people 
have those things now whether or not the treaty is entered into. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that there is no constitutional 
amendment and, therefore, no referendum.  It is clearly within the 
boundaries of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Before we resume 
debate and to make it clear to everybody, debate will go on until 
6.27 p.m.  Therefore, there are about 15 minutes left. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to finally have an opportunity to debate 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that I have had to wait until debate at report 
stage for this opportunity on such an important bill which can be 
construed as constituting a constitutional amendment, according 
to many of the expert constitutional presenters who appeared 
before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the official opposition in British Columbia, the 
Liberal Party there, this treaty constitutes a constitutional 
amendment.  For that reason alone I find it really quite 
disturbing that the government has rammed the bill through the 
House with undue haste, with a fraction of the time taken to 
consider it at the provincial legislature in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, two weeks ago, as we know, the committee studying the 
bill travelled through five communities in British Columbia 
hearing from a hand-picked witness list.  Many of the 
organizations and individuals who applied to appear before the 
committee to express their concerns were refused the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those organizations was the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation, a large advocacy organization representing some 
80,000 Canadians; representing some 20,000 of them in British 
Columbia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This organization had prepared a 30-page study, including 
thoughtful appendices and original research by constitutional and 
economic experts, and yet it was denied the opportunity to 
present its views on behalf of its members to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the opportunity to read part of its submission, 
which was never heard by the parliamentary committee because of 
the Liberals' refusal to have a full and complete debate.  I will 
take the opportunity to read some of their analysis into the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do so, there has been something of a debate today on 
whether or not the treaty constitutes a template for future land 
claims agreements.  Indeed, it is not the official opposition in 
this place who originated that argument, rather it was the then 
British Columbia premier Glen Clark, one of the principal 
negotiators of this treaty, who said that it constitutes a 
template for future lands claims settlements.  We are simply 
taking one of the principal negotiators at his word when he 
suggests that this treaty will be a template for the future. 
Obviously it will not be a precise template, but a very important 
precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear my colleagues from the New Democratic Party speaking in 
caustic tones about the Reform Party's opposition to this treaty, 
yet they seem to ignore the fact that perhaps the most credible 
New Democratic attorney general in Canadian history, Alec 
MacDonald, the former NDP attorney general in British Columbia, 
has spoken out publicly and vociferously against this agreement. 
This opposition does, and ought to, cut across partisan lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One non-partisan organization that I know something about, the 
Canadian Taxpayers Federation, was denied a hearing on this 
treaty.  It released a study which called on the minister of 
aboriginal affairs to read the fine print of the Nisga'a treaty. 
The Canadian Taxpayers Federation says that the $490 million cost 
of the Nisga'a settlement for cash, land and resource transfers, 
is likely understated as it does not include any estimates on 
mineral, water or fisheries resources to be transferred.  It also 
says that fair party compensation is likely, significantly 
underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say that “the $490 million cost quoted by the 
government does not include taxpayer transfers to the Nisga'a 
government which will cost taxpayers, according to federal 
negotiators, a minimum of over $400 million in additional 
transfers over 15 years for one settlement with one native band. 
The Nisga'a treaty is not final in a multitude of senses”, 
according to the CTF.  It says that four appendices in its study 
from constitutional legal expert Mel Smith, a former principal 
constitutional adviser to three successive B.C. governments, are 
attached to the review and that they list 49 sections of the 
treaty where there are explicit requirements to consult or 
negotiate agreements and a further 22 sections of the agreement 
where paramountcy is unclear or not stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says there is a ratchet up provision where any favourable tax 
exemptions granted to other bands over the next 20 years will 
need to be given to the Nisga'a as well, and that there are 17 
instances where the Nisga'a treaty or future Nisga'a laws will 
prevail over federal or provincial laws in the event of an 
inconsistency.  The Nisga'a government will be anything but 
municipal as proponents claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipal governments do not possess power over citizenship, 
culture, adoption and all levels of education, timber resources 
and court systems whereas the Nisga'a under this treaty will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision on whether non-Nisga'a will be able to vote in 
Nisga'a elections is up to the Nisga'a government.  Senior levels 
of government have traded away a core political right, the right 
of taxpayers to be represented by those who will have the power 
to tax them in this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTF's B.C. director, Mark Milke, is quoted as saying that 
the Nisga'a treaty “is neither fair nor final to taxpayers and 
it gives powers to one native band similar to powers possessed 
only by the federal and provincial governments”.  He says that 
“in addition it trespasses upon the basic political right to 
vote for those who would set the taxes.  Canadians deserve better 
than a document negotiated by a distrusted B.C. government and 
rammed through parliament by a federal government afraid of 
debate”.  He says that “when politicians horse trade core 
political rights and negotiate open and financial commitments, 
taxpayers deserve a vote on it”.  By that I infer a referendum, 
which I think something like 80% of British Columbians have 
expressed a desire for. 
The CTF's submission goes on to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Nisga'a treaty and the B.C. treaty process will involve a 
substantial reallocation of taxpayer money, Crown-owned 
resources, and Crown-owned land. Because of federal and British 
Columbia cost-sharing agreements, every Canadian from St. John's 
to Victoria will be affected.  In addition to the costs to 
taxpayers, forgone tax revenues (from forestry stumpage for 
example) will result from land to be transferred.  Such land 
transfers could one day also affect the public treasuries of not 
only Canada and British Columbia—given the lack of treaties in 
some provinces and the possible judicial reinterpretation of 
treaties already signed and thought to be final—but other 
provinces as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, municipal tax bases within British Columbia may be 
affected—

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to detail how that is the case. In addition, the 
Nisga'a treaty in fact removes the long-held political right to 
taxation with representation, and thus runs counter to the basic 
principle of liberal democracy. Disenfranchisement for any 
reason, cultural or in pursuit of justice for past wrongs, can 
hardly be said to be either responsible or in taxpayers' 
interest. It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the size and responsiveness of governments to taxpayers 
is directly related to the powers that such governments possess. 
The more portfolios that a government possesses, the higher the 
price tag for such a government is likely to be...  The Nisga'a 
government will far more closely resemble provincial and federal 
governments than municipal governments.  That is an important 
point to remember in the context of taxation, tax transfers, and 
the disbursements of such tax dollars by the proposed Nisga'a 
government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It asked how much the treaty will cost.  In 1995 there was $125 
million in cash according to government estimates.  In 1996 the 
agreement in principle cost $190 million in cash.  At the time, 
the B.C. government failed to include the value of the crown land 
and resources transferred in the deal.  When pressed, the 
government reported the land to be worth $107 million.  Thus in 
1996 government estimates totalled $297 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 leading up to the final agreement, the B.C. government 
still insisted the cost of the treaty was only $190 million 
according to press releases.  But the opposition Liberals leaked 
a copy of the treaty, the official estimate jumped to $312 
million.  When questioned on the breakdown of the costs, Premier 
Clark admitted it was closer to $382 million. The premier's staff 
shortly thereafter added items not mentioned by the premier and 
the cost rose to $459 million.  The next day the figure was again 
revised to $490 million, where it remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not include any estimate of mineral resources to be 
transferred, any estimate of water resources to be transferred or 
any estimate of fisheries resources to be transferred. There are 
monetary transfers to the Nisga'a of $160 million over five years 
after implementation of the treaty as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on but unfortunately I have run out of time.  A 
serious concern is being raised by a major taxpayer group about 
the long term fiscal implications not just of this treaty, but of 
dozens of other treaties which will be negotiated with this as a 
template.  We should pause because of these concerns rather than 
rush to the judgment which we see from all four other parties in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents I will be voting for these 
amendments and against the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take the opportunity to describe how 
the Nisga'a final agreement deals with private property and land 
ownership.  My comments will be particularly helpful to our 
Reform Party colleagues. It has become painfully obvious to the 
rest of us in the House that they have not read the agreement and 
do not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the official opposition have suggested that 
individual Nisga'a citizens will not be able to own private 
property on Nisga'a land.  They also suggested that members of 
Nisga'a governments will be unable to exert undue influence over 
Nisga'a citizens because of lack of security over tenure to their 
homes. This is simply not true.  Let me take the opposition 
through what the final agreement really says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the final agreement the Nisga'a will own their lands in 
fee simple, the highest estate in land known in law.  No longer 
will the crown hold the Nisga'a land in trust.  No longer will 
the minister of Indian affairs have to approve every use made of 
their lands.  Nisga'a lands will not be lands reserved for 
Indians.  The reserve system and the application of the Indian 
Act to the Nisga'a will end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a will own their land and its resources, other than 
water, submerged lands, and the private properties which were 
excepted from Nisga'a land. 
If they choose to do so, the Nisga'a will be able to create 
private parcels of Nisga'a lands and dispose of them without the 
consent of either Canada or British Columbia.  There is the 
essence of private property ownership. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the Nisga'a meet the requirements set out in the 
final agreement, they will also be able to register these parcels 
in the provincial land registry system.  This is something that 
Nisga'a leaders have indicated they wish to do once they have the 
legal means to do so, and the political direction from their 
constituency, the Nisga'a people. The owners of parcels 
registered in the land title system would realize all the 
advantages and securities of the system, just as private property 
landowners enjoy those advantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this is available to the Nisga'a people under the Indian 
Act, yet some members opposite would seek to prevent this 
significant advancement through nonsensical amendments which they 
have proposed.  What is the purpose of this obstructionism? These 
same members purport to represent the interests of grassroots 
Indian people.  Do they not want private property ownership 
rights for the Nisga'a people?  Do they not want to end the 
application of the Indian Act and the Indian reserve system for 
the Nisga'a people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the Reform members opposite should take the time to talk 
to Nisga'a people.  The Nisga'a people in a clear and substantial 
majority strongly supported this agreement and would stand to 
benefit from being treated like other Canadians for the first 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What some members opposite have missed is that through this 
agreement the Nisga'a will finally have responsibility for 
managing their own land.  If their democratically elected 
government decides to do so, they can create parcels of fee 
simple land, register them in the land titles system, sell them 
to anyone they choose and allow them to be mortgaged.  None of 
those opportunities exist today under the Indian Act. That is but 
one of the many reasons why the Nisga'a final agreement is such a 
significant step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has suggested that individual Nisga'a 
will not have private property rights and that Nisga'a 
governments will own the housing communally.  The opposite is 
true.  Appendices C5 and C6 list many hundreds of individual 
Nisga'a, in fact all the Nisga'a, who now have homes in four 
villages.  Appendix C5 lists those Nisga'a who now have 
certificates of possession.  Appendix C6 lists those Nisga'a 
whose current band council have allocated housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those names in both appendices will receive the same private 
property rights to their homes. Those rights will include the 
right to exclusively possess and use their land, in effect 
individual ownership of land and improvements. This ownership 
right can be passed down through their estates and marital 
property settlements.  These rights cannot be expropriated by 
Nisga'a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is not accurate to suggest that the treaty does 
not provide for individual property rights or that residents will 
be exposed to arbitrary decisions of Nisga'a government.  In fact 
this agreement provides a new level of security for Nisga'a 
families and a range of opportunities for economic development of 
land which are not currently available to the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the official opposition have their own views of 
what is best for the Nisga'a people.  That is the old way of 
doing business, to arbitrarily choose for aboriginal people what 
we think is best for them. The Reform Party is living in the 
past.  This is the past that they claim to condemn but for which 
in fact they would have future generations condemned to repeat by 
virtue of a lack of vision and a lack of trust and the strength, 
spirit and capabilities of the aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a have chosen differently.  That is their right. 
Through peaceful negotiations, patience, dedication and a spirit 
of co-operation and compromise, all three parties to this 
agreement have chosen differently.  They have chosen to move 
forward in a responsible positive way that will benefit the 
Nisga'a people and respect the interests of all other Canadians.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>GASOLINE PRICING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK890"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, just over a month ago I raised a question in the 
House about the competition problems in the gasoline industry.  I 
raised it in the context of Statistics Canada saying that energy 
prices and gasoline prices were “the major driver of inflation” 
in Canada.  The inflation rate had just hit 2.6% at that time. 
This is significant because the Bank of Canada has an inflation 
target of between 1% and 3% and when inflation threatens to go 
higher than 3%, the bank raises the ceiling on its overnight rate 
and all the banks follow suit and before we know it, interest 
rates everywhere are going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bank of Canada mainly looks at increases in the so-called 
core inflation rate which is the CPI for everything but food and 
energy.  Nevertheless the reason analysts were starting to be 
concerned last month is because once energy prices go up for a 
period of time, they start to affect the cost of other goods and 
services in our economy.  Then the core inflation rate goes up, 
the bank gets worried, it hikes interest rates and we all end up 
paying higher prices and mortgage rates as well as the higher gas 
prices and energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything goes up, such as gasoline, another thing goes up is 
that oil company profits go up.  The same week I asked my 
question, oil refining companies like Suncor and Imperial were 
posting record profits and the crude price had not even jumped as 
high as it got a month later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked by question very deliberately about competition problems 
in the gasoline industry, an issue clearly within the 
jurisdiction of the federal government and the Minister of 
Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister chose not to hear the question that way for his own 
reasons.  The fact remains that he has done nothing about 
monopoly pricing in the gasoline retailing industry and now high 
gas prices are threatening to hike inflation and interest rates 
which will affect the entire economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has done nothing, but others have tried to do 
something.  For example, I led a group of six individuals who 
asked the Competition Bureau to investigate why prices had gone 
up after competition was reduced in gasoline retailing in my 
province of Saskatchewan. 
I received the bureau's report just last week.  It said “sure 
there is less competition now”.  It said “sure that can lead to 
higher prices”.  The bureau just did not see that the prices 
have gone up.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But they did go up.  Everyone in Saskatchewan knows they went 
up.  I put out a press release in September 1998, over a year 
ago, after my office was swamped with phone calls about a four 
cent a litre gas price increase at the pumps.  However, this four 
cent price hike did not show up in the Competition Bureau's 
database of prices that it showed me when it tabled its report. 
So it had to find that there were no competition problems.  I am 
not convinced nor are my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians believe there are no problems in gas pricing and 
that gas prices are lower in Saskatchewan than in seven other 
jurisdictions, then they can vote Liberal, as I am sure they 
will, as they did in the Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar byelection 
where 15% voted Liberal, an amazing increase from the last 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the next CPI numbers are due out on December 17. 
Gas prices remain high and the Minister of Industry remains 
uninterested in doing anything about them.  He is more anxious 
about hockey than he is in protecting consumers from gas prices. 
So what else can be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, it is time for a different approach.  I am convinced 
more than ever that we need an energy price review commission to 
hold oil companies accountable to justify their price increases 
in this country and to take a more active role in bringing the 
oil companies to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am moving now to update and table my private 
member's bill calling for an energy price review commission, 
which I hope can accomplish those very objectives in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I wonder if the parliamentary secretary will 
actually speak to the question I posed last month or whether he 
will repeat the industry's mantra that there is no problem, it is 
all in our imagination, just relax and trust the oil companies, 
and if Canadians believe gas prices are lower than they have ever 
been, they should vote Liberal, don't worry, be happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the answer from the parliamentary secretary? 
<P><A NAME="LINK891"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the question today is just as 
confusing as it was last week, simply because the hon. member 
goes from pricing to competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that the Competition Act contains all the 
necessary tools to investigate and prosecute offences in the 
gasoline industry.  I can assure the hon. member that where 
allegations are made to the bureau that companies or individuals 
have crossed the line of appropriate business behaviour by fixing 
prices or engaging in anti-competitive conduct, the Competition 
Bureau will act appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bureau finds evidence supporting allegations made it 
will actively pursue these matters through the competition 
enforcement of the Competition Act.  For example, criminal 
charges were laid in September of this year against a refiner and 
two retailers of gasoline for price maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the bureau's investigation finds that the allegations are 
not sustained or do not support the conclusion drawn by the 
complainant, the bureau will discontinue its investigation.  It 
is important to realize that when an investigation is 
discontinued due to lack of evidence, it does not mean that the 
act is deficient or requires amendment.  It means that there is 
no sufficient evidence of anti-competitive activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also point out to the hon. member that the authority to 
regulate retail gasoline prices falls within the purview of the 
provincial government not the federal government.  Therefore, the 
hon. member's suggestion to have the federal government establish 
an energy price review commission that would have as its mandate 
to review and regulate gasoline prices, could not be undertaken 
by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member, my good friend, wants to achieve this, he 
should take this case to his colleagues in the Government of 
Saskatchewan.  The hon. member should realize that price 
regulation usually results in increased costs, higher prices and 
distorts the normal operations of the markets.  Reliance on 
market forces and not regulations is in the best interest of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to hockey, I think Saskatchewan needs a hockey team 
too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.34 p.m.)
