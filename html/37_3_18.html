	Mr. Speaker, this past weekend I hosted a spectacular event in my riding of Kitchener Centre called  See Jane Run.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Jane Run is a venue that brings women together to help each other:  women helping women sit on more boards, to feel empowered within our community, to succeed in corporate life and to become leaders in whatever their realm of interest is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women from all age groups have said that there is a need for these kinds of opportunities, to share their knowledge and experiences so that the next generation of Canadian women can continue to benefit and to create new opportunities, not only for women but for all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred and forty  women participated in this year's event.  They came to listen to a dynamic speaker, Marion Thomson Howell, and to learn from each other.  We were left with one message at the end of the day.  This must continue.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it has been 10 months since the borders were shut to Canadian beef  and the government has not gotten the borders re-opened. Not only that, the government is expecting producers to rely on the CAIS program, of which details have not been finalized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realized net income is the worst it has been since statistics were kept in the 1920s.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government has been responsible for the viability of the agriculture sector since 1993 and it has done a poor job. The agriculture minister claims to be in charge but has failed miserably at getting the borders re-opened. He has not even completed the necessary regulatory changes that need to be made before the borders are re-opened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian farm families are facing bankruptcy. It is time the government stands up and takes responsibility for helping our producers and their families through these terrible times.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today  I would like to commend the region of Halton, as well as Burlington, Oakville and Halton Hills  on their clean air initiatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halton started buying biodiesel in October 2003 and  now it accounts for almost 40% of their total fuel purchases. Biodiesel helps reduce smog causing emissions and air toxins from being released into the air. They also have an anti-idling engine policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burlington has programs in place to encourage the use of public transit and a public awareness campaign.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half a century the station has provided the very best in entertainment and information programming.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CKCO's journalists are exceptional and in the last five years, the station has received seven awards from the Radio-Television News Directors Association. CKCO Television has become an institution and its journalists a trusted source of information on local, national and international events.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we maximized every bit of potential from our non-renewable resources and if we carefully managed our renewable resources, all our provinces would have stable economies. The problem is that we are not getting maximum benefits from resource development. We are not protecting or enhancing our agriculture, our fisheries, our forestry and our environment generally.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize a remarkable Cape Bretoner who touched many lives in her 85 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth Beaton was born in New Waterford, Cape Breton in March 1918. At 15, she found her true calling in life, joined the Ursuline order and became Sister Bess Beaton. Though she would spend the next 70 years working in Edmonton as a dedicated teacher, she found time to occasionally return to her beloved Cape Breton.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to teaching, she was also an avid athlete in her younger days. That interest in sports was recognized by the basketball team at Edmonton's Archbishop Jordan High School, which made her an honourary member, complete with her own team jersey.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her death in January of this year has left the world and the many people she touched a little poorer, but when she was here she made our lives a lot richer.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, with every day that passes under a Liberal government, the situation facing women gets worse. We are losing, not gaining ground.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the evidence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oxfam reported recently that half the women working in Canada earn less than $20,000 a year. This is precarious work and it is on the rise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Prairie Women's Health Centre in Manitoba reported that almost half of Canadian households with core housing needs are headed by women. That means they live in desperate housing conditions and they are invisible to the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now today the Canadian Institutes of Health Research confirms that wealth means health, that one-third of women-headed single parent families are poor and that without a national child care program, low income children face a lifetime health and learning disadvantage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the federal government in all this? It is AWOL, missing in action, obsessed with filling their corporate pals' pockets, with turning huge surpluses over to tax cuts and paying off bankers while more than 50% of the population falls further and further behind.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. McGee's book traces the story of the Fairbank family which for 124 consecutive years has sold Lambton County crude to Imperial Oil, a company also founded in Lambton County.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, today the Canadian Medical Association launched its national health access campaign, calling on governments to act now to ensure Canadians have timely access to quality health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CMA president, Dr. Sunil Patel, noted that one of the easiest ways for the federal government to relieve the pressure on an overstretched system would be to fully reimburse or zero-rate the GST now paid for health care services.  Correcting this historic oversight was the reason I presented a private member's bill addressing this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero-rating health care services will help hospitals and other health care institutions groaning under the weight of ever increasing capital costs.  Currently, the GST paid by hospitals alone would fund the purchase of some 25 MRI machines.  Zero-rating all health care services would result in an infusion of $210 million per year, reducing waiting times for needed care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CMA points out that this is in keeping with the recent announcement regarding the GST and the new deal for cities.  Now is the time for a new deal for health.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister said he was going to take the guillotine to the heads wearing the crowns.  Instead, the government has suspended three crown corporation bosses without releasing the review done by the President of the Treasury Board.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had further conversations with the principals of the Auditor General who reinforced the information we were given. I am quite willing to sit down with the member and point to the sections of the Auditor General's report that detail that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then presented my findings and  beliefs about the confidence that the government could have in the 11 agencies.  I was pleased to report confidence in 8 of them. I had some concerns with 3 of them and we acted on that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For   André Ouellet, the former cabinet colleague of the Prime Minister, his suspension amounts to a $10,000 paid vacation.  He is the highest paid bureaucrat in Canada, running Canada Post, a crown corporation responsible for the misdirecting of millions of dollars.  Yet, as a Liberal friend of the Prime Minister, Mr. Ouellet continues to collect a salary.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that question goes right to decisiveness and I think the Prime Minister and the government has been very decisive on the crown corporations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes to a question of fairness. To that end, it also goes to the question of what Canadians feel and the encouragement they have for Canada Post.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly, we must understand that on the Auditor General's suggestion, we acted quickly. I spoke with the chair of the board of the Canada Post Corporation.  There is an independent audit being done.  Concurrently, there is an audit being done on the internal management practices. We will have a report from those audits in 90 days.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question. I also appreciate the fact that she has been a leader in recognizing that the banning of landmines around the world is an extremely important measure that this country has undertaken for years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the country during the week of March 1, we will be celebrating Canadian Landmines Awareness Week.  I know that many church groups, many schools and others will be having dinners to raise money to help people in countries that are affected by this scourge.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a government, we are committed to ridding the world of landmines.  As a people, we are committed to helping other people who suffer under this scourge.</p>

	I am now prepared to rule on the question of privilege raised on February 12, 2004 by the hon. member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby concerning misleading statements contained in the 1999-2000 “Report on Plans and Priorities” of the Department of Public Works and Government Services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the hon. member for having raised this important matter, as well as the hon. member for St. John's West, the hon. deputy House leader of the government and the hon. parliamentary secretary to the government House leader for their comments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing this issue to the attention of the House, the hon. member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby cited three paragraphs from the Auditor General's 2003 annual report in which the Auditor General states that Parliament was misinformed by the 1999-2000 “Report on Plans and Priorities” of the Department of Public Works and Government Services. The “Report on Plans and Priorities” was tabled on March 25, 1999 as recorded in the <i>Journals</i> of that date at page 1673. The hon. member quoted paragraph 3.100 of the Auditor General's report which reads:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their remarks, both the deputy government House leader and the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader pointed out that the Auditor General’s report stands referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. The public accounts committee is actively pursuing a study of the difficulties with the sponsorship program detailed in the Auditor General’s report.</p>

	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chair views this question as one of utmost importance. Evidence of its seriousness is clear in the language used by the Auditor General. She speaks of Parliament being “misinformed” and “bypassed” with respect to its fundamental duty to oversee and approve government expenditures. Any attempt to subvert or obstruct the House in fulfilling its constitutional obligation is one which all members must view as an attack not only on the House but on Canada's system of responsible government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has not been any suggestion that the findings of the Auditor General are inaccurate. I share the concern of all hon. members regarding the present situation as this House cannot carry out its responsibilities unless it is presented with accurate and complete information by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there has been nothing presented to the Chair that indicates the source of the misleading information. In raising this issue, the hon. member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby did not state that either the minister or the deputy minister knew that the “Report on Plans and Priorities” was misleading when they signed their names to it.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not, of course, absolutely necessary that the minister be aware that a document is misleading in order for a contempt to occur. In describing the 1978 case cited by the hon. member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, where contempt was found to have taken place despite the lack of any intent on a minister’s part, <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i>, p. 87, states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>On December 6, 1978, in finding that a prima facie contempt of the House existed, Speaker Jerome ruled that a government official, by deliberately misleading a Minister, had impeded a Member in the performance of his duties and consequently obstructed the House itself.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case before us today, no evidence has been brought forth to show that, in preparing the report on plans and priorities, departmental officials deliberately intended to deceive their superiors and so obstruct hon. members in the performance of their duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must conclude that the requirements for showing that a prima facie breach of privilege has occurred have not yet been met in the present case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, this matter is currently the subject of a study being carried out by the public accounts committee.  The investigation of issues raised by the Auditor General in her reports forms a key part of the mandate of that committee as set out in Standing Order 108(3)(g).  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report from the public accounts committee may present the House with evidence that certain individuals provided information in a deliberate attempt to mislead the House.  If that proves to be the case, it would certainly constitute grounds for the raising of a question of privilege at which point it would be possible for hon. members to deliberate in full possession of the committee's findings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House that a determination that a breach of privilege is not prima facie  at this time in no way interferes with the right of any hon. member to raise a new question of privilege following the tabling of a committee report or the disclosure of pertinent information from any other source.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I recognize the importance of the issue raised by the hon. member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, I am not persuaded that a prima facie breach of privilege exists at present.  As I have indicated, I remain fully open to considering the question should further evidence be brought to the attention of the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  I rise on a question of privilege.  During question period the Minister of Public Works and Government Services implied a number of things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He often  lectures us about the truth and makes sure that statements in the House are factual. In his answer in reply to a question he implied, first,  that I wrote a letter to Mr. Gagliano on behalf of my constituents.  That could well be but   I have been unable to find it in the last half hour or so. However when my constituents approach me and ask whether there are government ministers or departments that can  help them with whatever project,  of course we forward that on to the minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  the implication that the minister gave was that   there was something sleazy or wrong about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he implied that I used the term   sponsorship slush fund  in my request; that I thus knew about the slush fund, much as my colleague, the Minister of the  Environment, might have known, and that I   was trying to take advantage of that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, he implied that I got money from the slush fund.  When I checked the record just now I found that in that period of time my riding received absolutely nothing.  I can only conclude that the reason for that is because I am not a Liberal and   probably me sending letters to ministers   is the wrong thing to do because that means I do not get the money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am asking for an apology from the minister and, more important, that he table that letter so that the truth, which  he always talks about, is    available to you, Mr. Speaker, and to the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am happy to respond to the concern raised by the hon. member for Red Deer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My answer to a question from the opposition was to deal with the issue of the appropriateness of members of Parliament making representations to government on behalf of a constituent.   I was merely  trying to suggest that the member for Red Deer had also written to, in this case, the minister of public works and government services at the time, Mr. Gagliano, on behalf of a constituent.  That was on Dec. 12, 2001. I would be happy to table this or give a copy to my friend if he has lost it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, Mr. Speaker, through you,  I would remind the hon. member that I did not use the term  slush fund  in my answer.  I have never used that term in the House.  In fact, I consider it a completely inappropriate term to be used in the House for a program.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What there is and what is very clear is not improper representations.  I was doing quite the contrary of criticism.  I was endorsing the hon. member for his representation on behalf of his constituent to the minister of public works in the way that the constituency office of the Minister of the Environment had.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more was being suggested than that, but certainly I am happy to provide the member with a copy of his letter.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak today about Bill C-21, an act to amend the Customs Tariff.  I also welcome the opportunity to support the motion that this legislation be referred to committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, this bill provides for the continuation of a longstanding policy of providing preferential tariff treatment to developing and least developed countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two tariff programs in question—the General Preferential Tariff (GPT) and the Least Developed Country Tariff (LDCT)—are implemented through the Customs Tariff Act and are set to expire on June 30, 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill proposes that the programs be extended for another 10 years, from July 1, 2004, to June 30, 2014, as per past practice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before discussing the bill, I first want to provide some background, which will help to put these measures in context.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the mid-1960s there was a growing recognition that preferential trade treatment for developing countries was a means of fostering growth and the well-being of poorer nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following a recommendation by a United Nations conference on trade and development, developed countries implemented unilateral tariff preferences for goods originating from developing countries in order to help them increase their export earnings and stimulate their economic growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's general preferential tariffs program, the GPT, was implemented on July 1, 1974, for a 10 year period and has been renewed twice since then, in 1984 and 1994. As indicated, it is now set to expire on June 30, 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the GPT, more than 180 countries and territories are entitled to zero or low tariffs on a range of products that are covered under the customs tariff, with the exception of some agricultural products, refined sugar and most textiles, apparel and footwear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, Canadian imports under the GPT were valued at $9.3 billion and accounted for 2.8% of total Canadian imports. </p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1983, Canada introduced the Least Developed Country Tariff—or LDCT—in an effort to provide even more generous preferential tariff treatment to goods from the world’s poorest countries, as designated by the United Nations based on a number of criteria such as national income, health and education.  This program also expires on June 30, 2004, as I stated before.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 2003, the government, acting on a commitment made at the 2002 G-8 Summit in Kananaskis, provides complete duty-free access under this program to all imports from 48 least developed countries, except for certain agricultural goods such as dairy, poultry and eggs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, Canadian imports under the LDCT were valued at $408 million, accounting for 0.12% of total Canadian imports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have provided some background to these two programs.  Now, I would like to explain why they should be extended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin, extending the GPT and LDCT for another 10 years reaffirms the government’s commitment to promoting the export capability and economic growth of developing and least developed countries—the main reason these programs were initially established.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also provides a predictable business environment to traders using these programs, both in the developing world and here in Canada.As well, an extension would be consistent with the practice of other developed countries, such as the United States, members of the European Union and Japan, who also continue to have similar programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, continuing these two longstanding unilateral preferential tariff programs sends a positive message to beneficiary countries who see such programs as an important factor in encouraging their development.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision on whether to extend the GPT and the LDCT affects a number of stakeholders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it affects the exporters in developing and least developed countries that benefit from the preferential access provided by the two programs. The premise that originally led to the establishment of preferential tariff programs--that they would encourage and increase  exports from developing and least developed countries and hence stimulate economic growth--still holds today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various studies by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank support the principle that export expansion contributes to economic growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these programs clearly benefit developing and least developed countries, Canadians also benefit from them. As a result of lower tariffs on goods from the developing world, Canadian consumers enjoy access to imported goods at competitive prices and will continue to do so if these programs are extended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Canadian producers will continue to benefit from the reduced tariffs on inputs they import from the developing world and use in production of goods in Canada, which ultimately increases the competitiveness of Canadian industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these programs were not extended, the increased duty costs  incurred by Canadian importers and consumers would be approximately $272.8 million.  Not continuing these programs would  also raise questions about Canada's commitments to international development.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted earlier, all other major industrialized countries provide preferential access for developing and least developed countries, and some, such as the United States, Japan and the European Union, have extended similar programs in recent years.  As such, not extending the GPT and LDCT would isolate Canada internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing these programs would also be consistent with our commitments to assist developing and least developed countries.  These commitments have been reiterated on many occasions in fora such as the G-8, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations. Clearly, letting these programs expire could negatively affect Canada’s image internationally.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons that justified the introduction of the GPT and the LDCT decades ago still remain.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economies of many developing countries have still to make great strides if their citizens are to attain acceptable income levels.  This bill constitutes one substantive measure Canada can take to continue to assist the developing world in achieving this goal, and continues Canada’s tradition of assisting the developing world.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering this bill, I encourage hon. members to keep in mind that Canada stands with all other major industrialized nations—the United States, Japan and the European Union—in supporting the developing world through such programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, let me review the advantages of extending the GPT and LDCT for an additional 10 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Canada would continue a longstanding international practice of providing preferential tariff treatment to goods from the world’s poorer nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, continuing the programs for a fixed period of 10 years will provide certainty and predictability to traders using them in Canada and in the developing and least developed countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, continuing the programs complements Canada’s foreign aid policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, while these programs were mostly conceived as an economic assistance measure for developing and least developed countries, they also benefit Canadians by providing them with goods that are subject to lower rates of duty.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 10 year extension of these programs is consistent with past practice, provides a predictable business environment to traders and reaffirms the government's long term commitment to international development.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the government is aware of the situation in the clothing and textile industry and is currently looking at additional  measures to support the industry.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-21, an act to amend the customs tariff.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of state articulated the need to extend this program, which has been in existence for some time and will come to an end on June 30, 2004.  He gave his Liberal spin on it, indicating that it would help everybody in the Third World developing countries.  He said that we should continue with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Conservative Party agree with the minister and will support the bill because of another aspect.  If we do not support the bill, then there could be the possibility of no tariffs and this would result in our markets being flooded by uncontrolled goods coming into the country, which would impact Canadian jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a regime of controlled access, giving preferential treatment to developing countries and the least developed countries as well as ensuring that our markets open up slowly to foreign goods, while at the same time taking advantage of it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are more in line with having what we call free trade agreements.  In light of the fact that the WTO talks in Cancun collapsed, it becomes more important for the world trading regime to consider what to do about tariffs.  That is critically important because, in globalization, all studies have indicated that a reduction of tariffs in  foreign trade is beneficial to everybody, including Canada.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be splitting my time, Madam Speaker,  with my colleague from Edmonton--Strathcona.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand that a country like Canada, which is based on exports and has a GDP of 48%, now  close to 45%,  has a regime that regulates international trade.  We would like to see this being done under the guise of free trade agreements or special agreements with other countries that would benefit our exporters, benefit other consumers and benefit other countries as well as, with lower tariffs thereby giving an advantage to everyone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand right now, due to  the collapse of the WTO talks in Cancun, we do not know where the world trading regime will go.   For that reason, we will support this bill because we need a regime that will control the flow of goods until we know the outcome of the WTO talks, should they carry on and what agreements will come into play.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about two tariffs,  the GPT, or  the general preferential tariff, and the least developed country tariff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have articulated the reasons why we will support the bill.  In short, until the outcome of the WTO talks and other tariff regimes on controlling the flow of goods come into play, will support the bill.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to now dwell on the point of preferential tariff and the least developed country tariff. We know that in order for developing countries to get out of poverty, it is more important that they engage in fair trade practices where they have access to the markets of developed countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up in Tanzania, a country that is classified as a least developed country. We see the poverty over there on our televisions.    We see Canadians helping building  wells, hospitals and classrooms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pictures that we do not see are the people, like my family and other families who used to live over there, engaging in businesses. We never see the developed side of those countries. Now there is a huge element of development in these countries where businesses thrive and succeed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help them become an engine of economic growth,  they need a market. For a long time the  western world market  was closed. It used to be one-way trade when I was there.  Everything went from here to there, but nothing came from there to Canada. As a matter of fact those countries were just supplying raw products to developed countries.  However, that does not create prosperity. Prosperity is when they have products growing over there, when they manufacture and make products in their own country and then they sell them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming out with the general preferential tariff and the least developed country tariffs, where there is almost zero tariffs,  gives this country the opportunity to access those markets, where it can help those countries. Of course, the problem now is we have to look at how we can help these countries with investment flows so they can take advantage of these tariffs. If there is no investment flowing to those countries and if they do not have an industrial base, what is the point of having preferential  tariffs, if they cannot export anything to other countries? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Prime Minister was appointed by the United Nations to look at private investment flow. As a matter of fact, I wrote to him,  not in the his capacity of the Prime Minister, but his capacity as a member of the United Nations panel  looking into private investment flow.  I gave him my input on what I thought should have been part of his report on  how we could assist in sending private investment to these countries so eventually they could enjoy economic growth. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become quite evident and all studies suggest that because of globalization  almost 200 million people have been lifted out of poverty, both in China and India. There is concrete proof out there, contrary to what my friends in the NDP would say, that globalization has not worked.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we are supporting the bill.   Although the bill is for 10 years, there are other venues that we have to look at to ensure that we reach the objective of tariff reduction,  which is to help the least developed countries and developing countries.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am informing you from the outset that I have no intention of splitting my time with anyone. I should normally use all the time that is allocated to me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to say that the Bloc Quebecois will support this legislation. Bill C-21 seeks to extend, to June 30, 2014, those sections of the Customs Tariff that allow Canada to provide preferential tariff to imports from countries that are members of the World Trade Organization, and to imports from the least developed countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois will support this legislation because we simply cannot disagree with it. To oppose it would be tantamount to reneging on our international commitments, including with the World Trade Organization. This would also be tantamount to reneging on our international commitments in the area of  development assistance, particularly those made by Canada in Kananaskis regarding Africa. I will get back to this later on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few moments ago, my hon. colleague from the Canadian Alliance referred to the impacts of globalization. Heaven knows, globalization has many impacts, both positive and negative. As I said yesterday, in another speech, it is not about being for or against globalization. It is about benefiting from it while simultaneously trying to limit the negative impacts of the totally unavoidable phenomenon of globalization to which we must adapt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I also mentioned yesterday, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois has repeatedly said that asking if we are for or against globalization is a bit like asking, each and every day of our lives, if we want the earth to stop turning. We must deal with this phenomenon and try to benefit from it as much as possible and to limit its negative impacts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are benefits to globalization, of course, both for industrialized countries like our own and for developing countries that want to use globalization as a stepping stone to gain access to the international trade network. The bill before the House will give developing countries, those less developed, easier access to the international trading network.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also negative impacts. Earlier, I heard the Secretary of State for Financial Institutions say, at the end of his speech, that he will soon be announcing adjustment or assistance measures for the soft sectors of the Canadian economy that are hard hit by globalization, like the textile, footwear and apparel industries. Good. However, I happen to remember that, when we talked about the advisability for Canada to sign NAFTA, those who were against argued that it would have a negative impact on a number of manufacturing sectors in Canada and in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They asked, demanded and begged the government for adjustment measures, not only for the workers in such industries, but also for the industries themselves. In fact, globalization does not necessarily mean that we must write off all manufacturing operations in industrialized countries. Globalization simply means that we must change, reorient and modernize our sectors and our economic niches.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about manufacturing industries, we must remember that we benefit from a certain number of advantages, such as the presence of significant capital and of technology that can be used to manufacture high value added products.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of producing clothes just to be producing clothes, we have the technology and the capital that we could use, for example, to produce clothing and textiles in the health or food sectors, where we could carve out niches that would be unique to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the speech by our colleague, the Minister of State for Financial Institutions, who said, nearly two decades later, that measures are needed to support the manufacturing industry in the textile and clothing sector, we would have expected the government to have taken action well before now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative impacts are already being felt in our ridings and our communities. Very recently, a business in my riding, Genfoot Lafayette, which has been operating in Contrecoeur for over 100 years and makes the famous Kamik boots, announced that it will be closing its doors at the end of this week to move its operations—at least the production that was done in Contrecoeur—to the People's Republic of China.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did this government do? Absolutely nothing. In the meantime, businesses are closing and workers in our communities are losing their jobs. At Genfoot Lafayette, we are talking about nearly 200 workers, many of whom are women over 50 who will have great difficulty finding another job. These workers are losing their jobs, and the government has no programs in place to assist them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government withdrew from the program for older worker adjustment, thereby adding to their plight. I hope that the Minister of Human Resources Development will agree, at the request of the Quebec minister responsible for employment and social solidarity, to  renew the pilot project, which is helping—although not to any great degree, but helping nonetheless—place older workers in new jobs. There is still no news from the government in this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the almost total lack of measures to help workers in soft sectors such as textile, apparel and footwear manufacturing, for example, the government must, at the very least, commit to rapidly renewing POWA to help the older workers at Contrecoeur who will lose their jobs by the end of this week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on. A company in Drummondville has closed its doors. It was not a Mickey Mouse operation. We are talking about a company that makes designer jeans closing its doors. Several hundred employees in Drummondville are going to lose their jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this government do? It tells us that it will eventually come up with assistance measures for the textile, apparel and footwear industries. They should have thought about that in 1988, 1989 and 1990. It is now 2004, and the government is saying it still needs to think about it. In the meantime, jobs are being lost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are negative impacts from globalization, but there are, as I mentioned earlier, positive ones as well. We have to be consistent in honouring our international commitments with members of the World Trade Organization, and also in our relationship with a number of least developed countries and the 49 least developed countries on the UN list, including 34 African countries. We all know about  Canada's commitment to African countries. We must therefore support this legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have statistics that were quoted in 1994 by my colleague Philippe Paré, who was the member for Louis-Hébert at the time. I must say  this is a step back in time for me because, in 1994, I spoke to the bill for renewing preferential tariffs until the end of June 2004. My point is that the amount of money developing countries are losing because of protectionism in industrialized countries is much greater than any development aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important and positive measure for developing countries. We have to vote in favour of this legislation.</p>

	Madam Speaker, let the record show that it was a Liberal who said no to that suggested amendment by the official opposition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not here to speak to that at the moment. I am here to speak to Bill C-21, an act to amend the Customs Tariff. As has already been said by previous speakers, this bill would extend the general preferential tariff and the least developed country tariff for another 10 years as they were both due to expire in June 2004.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These regulations would allow for products imported from a list of 48 least developed countries and from other countries which have preferred trading partner status to be brought into Canada without having to pay customs duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally the list of products that could be imported from least developed countries was relatively limited, but as  a result of the least developed countries initiative announced by the Canadian government after the 2002 G-8 meetings in Kananaskis, the list of eligible products includes everything other than certain agricultural products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it might be laudable to open the Canadian market to products from developing countries, the problem with this legislation--and we do not oppose it, but we do want to point out this problem--is that it reinforces the system that currently exists in which North American retailers can get cheaper products, especially apparel from developing countries.  These are countries without labour codes, minimum wage or environmental standards. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it is important that developing countries be able to export goods to Canada, the Canadian government must take a much more active role than it ever has in ensuring that these products are produced in unionized and fair workplaces, a concern that is not reflected in the least developed country tariff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that our markets should be more open to least developed countries because we know that to some degree this is key to economic growth for them.  Although I must say that I think the model by which countries are expected to grow and develop their economies by an overemphasis on export markets can also be destructive, where stable and sustainable local economies have often been destroyed in the name of creating export markets.  This has often had a terrible effect on the environment and on the sustainable way of life of peoples in these various countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not take for granted that the only way to development in the least developed countries is through this overemphasis on export markets.  To the extent that export markets play a role in the development of the least developing countries, developed countries have a responsibility to open their markets.  However, do we have a responsibility to open our markets for the products that then flow from these least developed countries without regard for how they are produced?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the products flowing into our country, as a result of the reduction in tariffs, are products that are produced in sweatshops or are produced in workplaces that not only are not unionized but cannot be unionized because of no recognition or poor labour standards in particular countries, is this what we call a fair trading regime?  Not at all.  This is at the root of many of the objections to the current model of globalization, which everybody has been singing the praises of for the last 20 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not suggesting that any particular least developed country should adopt the same labour standards which we enjoy here in Canada.   Sometimes I wonder whether we enjoy them any more, when we see that the CNR is able to import American scabs with impugnity into the current rail strike. But let us believe our own mythology for a minute and say that Canada has good labour standards. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been persistently--in all the forums in which I have spoken as NDP trade critic and many other New Democrats and social democrats around the world have spoken--asked that core labour standards be recognized and enforced.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are core labour standards? Core labour standards are basically the right to form a trade union, the right to organize collectively, the right not to be a victim of slave labour. These are very basic rights.  If even these rights were recognized and enforced around the world,  we would move closer to what everyone says they want, which is a level playing field, but it is not a level playing field.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be a level playing field for the corporations in some way or another, but it is not a level playing field for Canadian workers. It is not a level playing field when they have to compete with workers in other countries who do not even have core labour standards, who cannot organize, who cannot defend themselves without ending up in the river or the victim of some death squad or losing their job, or whatever the various levels of punishment are depending on the country.  That is not a level playing field.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the big lie that is at the root of the current globalization model, that somehow we are all moving toward this great level playing field where the competitive will thrive and those who are not competitive will fall by the wayside.  There is nothing competitive in the best sense of the word competitive about exploitation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we now have is a global economic system that rewards countries on the basis of how much they persecute their workers. I do not call that competition.  I do not think exploitation of workers should be a comparative advantage, to use a traditional economic theoretical term.  I do not think exploitation is a comparative advantage or should be regarded as one in the global trading system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why in the House back in 1994 when  the legislation was brought in to implement the World Trade Organization, I moved amendments to the implementing legislation for the World Trade Organization that called on the government to prohibit imports from countries that were engaged in child labour. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another element of what it means to have core labour standards is no child labour.  Is this some kind of radical socialist idea, no child labour?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are saying is that when it comes to the global trading system,  there should be the same zeal for enforcing a level playing field as there is when it comes to investors' rights.  Right now we have this perverse moral hierarchy whereby for  investors or a transnational corporation, their property rights and their investor rights have to be protected because that is a sacred thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,  a working person's  job can disappear overnight if the owner can find a group of people to make it cheaper under more exploitive conditions somewhere else in the world.That is what is happening to manufacturing jobs here in Canada, in the United States and now even in Mexico because this capital keeps seeking the lowest common denominator. Therefore jobs disappear out of Canada into the United States, from the United States into Mexico, and now they are being lost out of Mexico to China, where we have the worst of all possible worlds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In China we have the worst of capitalism and the worst of communism; a single party state running a capitalist economy.  Yet our government is so far up the rear end of the Chinese market that we cannot even find it. It will not say anything critical of China because that might damage our opportunities for penetrating the Chinese market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on one of the trips to China. It was disgusting to watch how uncritical the Canadian corporate elite and the Canadian government were when it came to China.  Talk about the wilful blindness that the government has with respect to the sponsorship scandal. It pales in comparison to the wilful blindness that the whole world has right now about China.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if everything could be made in China? What would the rest of us do?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just some of the concerns that we bring to this kind of legislation.  We understand the intent but in the absence of recognition and enforcement of core labour standards, this kind of legislation is going nowhere.  It is a recipe for exploitation and it is not going to solve the world's economic problems.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-825421"></A><a HREF="#Int-825508"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-825413"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, CPC): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I too want to address Bill C-21, an act to amend the customs tariff. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to chat about some of the things specifically to do with where we in the Conservative Party are coming from and maybe take the opportunity to respond to some of the concerns of my colleague from the New Democratic Party.  He spoke quite eloquently about the concerns Canada should have in trading with developing countries and some of the concerns we may have with labour standards and those sorts of issues with which I think all Canadians are definitely concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-21 amends two sections of the customs tariff, just so people are clear on what exactly the bill is doing. Specifically, the general preferential tariff and the least developed country tariff are being proposed to be extended for another 10 years until June 30, 2014. Currently the legislation expires on June 30, 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some colleagues on all sides of the House have said that one of the challenges  if this does expire without being checked is that Canada could be flooded with goods from all around the world. This  could really put our own companies and industries at a huge disadvantage, especially when we look at some of the tariffs that are in place outside.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some areas we have seen  the process and  the way the legislation works. Orders in council for certain countries can reduce that overall tariff. There are  three different sections of countries that Canada recognizes. There   is the most favoured nations tariff,    the general preferential tariff and  the least developed country tariff. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though our tariff rate is currently set at 35%, and it  should not be any higher, orders in council normally go through the process of reducing those tariffs for specific countries, depending on our trading relationships with  those countries or on some of our foreign aid strategies  in  trying to help stimulate the economies of many of those countries. One of the things that happens is that through the process of orders in council, that tariff is often reduced with regard to some countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly from our point of view, this has to be done over a period of time. I do not think we can drop that tariff, especially if there are other countries which have tariffs that are higher with regard to many of the Canadian products being exported to those particular countries. It would really put us at a disadvantage here in Canada if we dropped those tariffs overnight. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party of Canada  does support free trade and the engaging of developing countries to encourage their development and, it is  hoped, to have an evolution of an economy similar to that of industrialized countries. We want   to encourage the ability of those countries to export their products and obviously create more wealth at home in those particular countries. Overall, we would like to see that tariff reduced when it comes to countries around the world, but we clearly understand that it may have to be managed carefully. It is hoped that in the future, as we continue to deal with many of these countries in developing free trade agreements, that we would see that tariff reduced completely with many of those countries, or at least reduced over time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the New Democratic Party spoke quite passionately about the problems in  many of the countries we deal with in the third world  and what sorts of standards they may have in place. Here in Canada, even though sometimes we have challenges within our own standards for labour and in reaching agreements between companies and workers,  overall, people would say the standards in this country are quite high, especially when we compare them to some of the third world countries. I would make the argument that many  countries that may have questionable labour practices are going through a process because they are diversifying, they are creating the ability for their economy to evolve, and it takes time before some of these economies evolve as far as those of  some of the  industrialized countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to help that process. It does not mean that we support the practice of child labour or  that we support  the persecution of any group. We need to continue to help those countries develop a middle class and  continue to create wealth in those countries so that there can be that  evolution of those standards.</p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all gone through that in our history.  If we look at the  industrial revolution here in the west and at some of the standards that existed and the creation of wealth, we were able to improve those labour standards.  We improved the conditions for our workers.  As I said, they may not be perfect but  they have come a long way when we think back to the time of the industrial revolution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can speak  from the experience of my own family coming from Africa.  My family fled Africa in the early 1970s as refugees and came to this country.  The working class in Africa was going through a transformation.  Many of the families that lived in those countries, such as my own family, were involved with industrial activities.  We were manufacturers, retailers, importers.  There was a whole host of opportunities for which  many people who emigrated to east Africa took advantage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time there were obvious challenges.  Many of the working class were not very well off.  They were challenged in trying to look for opportunities for themselves to improve their conditions.  Often many of the people who were moving there from India, as my family had generations ago, created working environments and created opportunities for many of the workers to improve their lives.  The conditions that they worked in were often quite good.  Slowly that changed as competition evolved in those countries and opportunities continued to grow.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did not happen overnight, and we know it did not happen overnight here, but   we cannot close the door on some of these countries that may not have the best practices.  In the long run, by creating opportunities and by creating competition and giving them the ability to export some of their products  helps to create the middle class and the  wealth in those countries that then can change those standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be highly irresponsible if we went down the road that my NDP colleague suggested, which was to shut the door on many of those countries that are going through those challenges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use that tariff in many cases as leverage.  Due to the current process, as I outlined,   if we do change any of those particular tariffs that   come by orders in council of the government, those countries with which we have problems could be targeted specifically and it  could   encourage them to  improve their conditions.  Therefore  if we were to  reduce those tariffs in their favour,  they could  continue to build wealth in their home nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the key is   to balance the growth and the continuous evolution of our industries here in Canada with the developing world.  We know Canadians are very much in tune with foreign aid and trying to help many of these countries around the world.  What better way to help them help themselves than by allowing them  to produce products at home and then be able to export them to countries that are willing to purchase them, such as Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House we do realize the importance of Bill C-21 that is in front of the House.  We do understand  that   the process of extending the tariffs for another 10 years is something that  has to happen in order to evolve and to balance the trade of our own industries here in Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we also want to make sure that in committee, as we continue to discuss the bill, that we look to the future  to see  how we can perhaps reduce those particular tariffs  so that in the end we can help many of these developing countries.  Hopefully we would have most of these countries not in these three different categories that we currently recognize them, but as preferential trading partners around the world.  That is the direction in which I would prefer to see the bill go.  We will be supporting the bill as it stands.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am a little surprised that I am in here speaking to the  third reading stage of this  legislation,  the marijuana bill. I am very disappointed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the government recognizes what it is dealing with here. In fact, the Prime Minister indicated to the country that he would make   some substantive amendments to the bill from the previous prime minister's position but  he did not do that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago here in the House I had asked the Prime Minister about that. Basically he just smiled, shrugged his shoulders and put if off.  It is ironic how one changes one's position on something, one's promises and commitments to a nation, once one  becomes Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take my time going through what is wrong with the bill but, first, I must say to all people in Canada that we have studied the drug problems  for about 18 months. We had about 41 substantive recommendations. Many of them were fairly good recommendations that would  curb the problems with ecstasy, crystal meth, cocaine, heroin  and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the government realized that those recommendations were somewhat conservative in nature, it moved right ahead and threw in this decriminalization of marijuana, got everybody else off the agenda of that, and went on with the bill here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was really quite irresponsible because the problems with drugs do not end with the decriminalization of marijuana. That is the real issue here. What the country does not have  at this point  is a national drug strategy. People are dying every day from drug overdoses and  from addictions to all sorts of drugs, whether they are prescription drugs or crack, heroin or crystal meth. It is absurd  to think that we are here talking about the decriminalization of marijuana when there is no drug strategy in place. That is the real problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go through the bill. We are talking about drugs. The Liberals have a hard time with this kind of issue. They are trying to find out what I am talking about, if members can believe it. I will  go through the amendments that are not in this bill and  the problems that have  not dealt with in the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I should not say anything about Liberals not being in the House when I am talking about this, but it is amazing when I am standing here speaking to  such a precedent bill and  there is nobody  from the Liberals to listen. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First,  the government is telling the country that it will get tough on marijuana, so it puts in maximum penalties for grow ops.   It has said that it is really going to push hard on the grow op side of it, that four to 25 plants would constitute an offence punishable by up to $25,000 and/or 18 months in jail on summary conviction. Well that is fine, but where I come from in British Columbia, and in many parts of this country, telling a judge there is a maximum $25,000 fine for a grow op is laughable. The person would likely come out of there with a $500 fine at best. In most cases they would come out with a slap on the hand and   told not to do it again. They walk away and laugh, then go start another grow op, and on it goes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum fines would be all right if judges and lawyers understood the issue and applied those fines, but they do not, and it is not happening right across the country. What is required are minimum fines for such operations so that judges understand that there is a minimum penalty for these things. Giving the discretion to the courtroom is a mistake. I do not know how many times I have tell that to the government.  It is not listening. When the government tells Canadians that it is getting tough on this grow op business, it is not. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some of the other things the government did not address in the bill.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government said there would be fines for minor possession.  The fines are different for adults than they are for young people.  When I pursued this in the justice committee and in the drug committee, the answer from the other side was that young people could not afford the fines.  If they can afford the marijuana, they can afford the fines.  The propensity to say that they are young and therefore the fine should be lower for them than for an adult is ridiculous.  The government is sending a message to young people that it is cheaper for them to get caught.  It is wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something else in conjunction with this legislation is  that no resources have been provided for police to crack down on organized crime that is profiting from lax enforcement.  The government says that it will put in this great program to cut down on drugs but it does not provide  the  resources to the police departments.  What are the police going to do?  Are they going to pick up from the explosion of grow ops and the explosion of the drug trade in hard drugs?  I think not.  The government has to put some money where its mouth is on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what else the government did not address in the bill.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeds of crime legislation was not amended to adjust for drug seizures.  It was not touched at all.  In fact, I can go through a litany of cases, and I have them here, hundreds, if not thousands of cases.</p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, the guy over there who proposes to be a minister does not understand the concept so he is heckling.  I do not mind the heckling;  I kind of enjoy it. I wish he were smart enough to understand the consequences of what they are not doing.  That is the problem with this government. It sends in a few ministers who do not know what they are talking about but try to understand a system as serious as drug problems in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through it.  The proceeds of crime legislation has to be amended.  The issues are these.  In many cases in the country, for grow ops in particular, for crystal meth labs, or for the trafficking of harder drugs, the cars they are driving, the money they are making, often goes back to the individuals.  In fact, I've had cases--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Reg Alcock:</b> No, wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Randy White</b>:  The minister says no, but the fact is that I have cases, many of them, which show that in the courtroom the criminals, the dealers, are getting away with the proceeds of crime more often than not.  That is unfortunate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to deal with the damages that are caused through grow ops, and crystal meth labs in particular, has to be dealt with somewhere along the line.  Discussions have to take place between the federal and provincial governments and even the municipal governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more we are finding that young people in particular are buying houses that have been damaged through these kinds of operations.  In fact, I have letter upon letter showing that young people bought a house with practically the last bottom dollar they had and they got  into the house to find out that there had been severe damage done and they needed another $80,000, $90,000 or $100,000 to renovate the place before they could even move into it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage is caused by playing with the electricals, by mould in the walls, by dangerous odours from crystal meth labs and so on and so forth, yet no discussion on this has taken place among all three levels of government.  But we take in a law like this one and deal with only a very small aspect of the drug problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No legislation has been developed to curtail financial institution funding of mortgages related to grow ops.  It may seem a little surprising, but there is one particular trust company in the country that has funded many grow ops. Here is what is happening. Individuals are putting their applications forward, typically using a certain type of job, a very low paying job, and the applications just get whisked through a particular trust company and approved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I just finished dealing with one individual who has been on welfare for all nine years that  he has been in this country.  He came here with no money.  He has been on welfare for nine years. I found out that now not only is he dealing drugs and has particular grow ops, but he owns three houses, all financed through the same trust company. Just how does he own three houses when  he has been on welfare for the total time he has been here?  The fact is that the proceeds of crime legislation cannot and will not take those houses from that individual.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have two situations.  Now we have finance companies funding grow ops because it is lucrative and the cash is there, and it is non-tax-dollars cash, and we also have proceeds of crime legislation that is failing to do its job. In addition to this, there has been no coordination whatsoever among federal, provincial or municipal agencies on the welfare issue itself.  I have, through my sources, dealt with welfare agencies that are finding more and more individuals on welfare who are using the grow ops as a source of income. Their source of income is much higher than before but the coordination in catching these individuals is not there.  Those are the kinds of discussions that have to take place as well before we get into just simply finding an answer and calling it decriminalization.</p>


	<A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No commitment has been obtained from the judiciary to increase penalties within the limits set out in this bill or to follow the established possession guidelines, and here is the problem.  People are going to go into the courtroom, for certain,  when they get  caught with 31 or 33 grams of marijuana.  The judge is going to say that up to 30 they can get a fine and the judge will not want to call them criminals just because it is 31 or 32 or 33 grams.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to be on the slippery slope again.  We are going to find ourselves with the judges out there saying  that maybe they should make  it  50, 60 or 100 grams, and that other places have 100 so they will have 100.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has to be an agreement with the judiciary in this country that what we say in the House of Commons for fines and penalties is what we mean to have happen. It is totally inappropriate to have the judges once again make the rules and extend the penalties  based on their perception of what they think is right.  That has cost us a great deal of time, money and effort in this country as it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with something called decriminalization, that is, giving a fine for the minor possession of marijuana.  The government says that minor possession is for from zero to 30 grams.  It says that zero to 15 is a fine and  15 to 30 is a fine or   a criminal charge, but more likely than not it will be zero to 30  with a fine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to understand that 30 grams is approximately 45 to 50 joints.  An individual   can walk   around the  school ground  with that and get a fine.  Anybody walking around with 35, 50 or 55 joints is not  a recreational user. A recreational--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Reg Alcock:</b> You don't know that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Randy White:</b>  This ill-informed minister says I do not know that. The fact is that I do know that.  The fact is that anybody with that many joints is not a recreational user.  Anybody  who knows the industry itself would be smart enough to understand that, and anybody who  smokes marijuana  would tell us that as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting for all the folks listening  to know that I am getting badgered by a minister of the crown, but what really gets me is the amount this individual does not know and does not understand and  yet he would stand in here and support a bill that is really a very poorly performing bill and  will not resolve the problem anyway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The THC component of marijuana is more or less the addictive component and  gives you the buzz, the high or the low or whatever  one is  going to get from it.  Over the years it  has increased from about 3%  or  4% to around 15% or 16% now.  In fact, the first recorded death by smoking marijuana was two weeks ago in England.  The death was certified as directly attributable to marijuana smoke.  The marijuana he was smoking was from Africa.  The potency and the types  of marijuana weed are increasing  by leaps and bounds today.  As more  and different strains are developed, we are finding that there is basically no control.  There are  no parameters on the potency of the THC itself.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So today we are dealing today with a bill that  considers, for a person with 40 joints, that the THC component of  those 40 joints   is approximately 8% or 10%.  That will not necessarily be the case tomorrow or the next day, or five months or five years from now.  The government is making a presumption based on something that is incorrect and no effort whatsoever has been made to deal with that aspect.</p>


	<A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say this: This country needs a national drug strategy. I have been around this country more than enough times dealing with addicted individuals.  I have been in Europe, the United States, Mexico and throughout Canada, so I do happen to know what I am talking about on this issue and I initiated for Parliament itself the special committee studying the illegal use of drugs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really required is a way to get our young people and elderly people off drugs.  I find it reprehensible, actually, that the government would consider funding a shooting-up site in Vancouver when it will not put money into rehabilitation and detox facilities throughout this land. I find that reprehensible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in my community alone, one facility has recently shut down.  We had a rehabilitation facility for young, teenaged addicted girls. I went to the previous minister of health and said that we needed some money to keep it open.  We had parents lined up trying to get their kids into that place.  The government beat around the bush for four or five months and nothing happened. Nothing happened and these kids are out on the street.  It is disgusting.  Then I find out that the government is funding, in part, a shooting-up site.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this. People who have children on drugs--and I know people who do--go to the government and ask for help for their child.  Do we want a government that says yes, it will send people's children to a shoot-up site where they can shoot up in a relatively clean facility, or do we want a government that will take our children and put them in detox and rehabilitation?  There is no choice for parents.  I know what they would choose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has to act as a judicious parent on these issues.  It has to have a national drug strategy that looks at abstinence, not permission to use. It is sad that this has come to the House.  The decriminalization of marijuana is a very minor part of a drug strategy, so minor it does not even rate.  I am sad to see that today this is all the government can come up with.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I not only reported it to the police but I wrote a letter to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, as a matter of fact. All I was told was that they could not tell me because of privacy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say this.  Again, I think it is reprehensible that a financial institution  in this country would knowingly be funding mortgages for grow ops.  That is a fact.  It has been on television;  I have the documents here.  It is either a fact or a coincidence that over 400 mortgages have come out of that one institution.  The one individual I referred to who has been on welfare for six years or so and never had any money when he came into the country has three houses and all three are mortgaged by the one institution.  I would say that is not really a coincidence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did report it.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the member for Langley—Abbotsford for his research on the drug problems in this country and on the failure of government and government agencies to deal with this matter in an effective way.  There is no question that it is a scourge on our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that keeps coming up time and time again, of course, is the issue of these grow operations.  They bring vast amounts of dollars into organized crime, they destroy property and they feed and fuel the drug industry in a substantial way in this country, and our agencies cannot seem to get a handle on it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that particular point, I have a question for the member. What legislation would he like to see crafted that would deal with drug grow ops and put them out of commission for once and for all? How would the enforcement agencies actually be able to apply their strategies to knock them out?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on these grow ops and crystal meth labs, we must have minimum penalties and minimum fines.  It cannot be at the discretion of the judges because they are not using it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities owned by dealers must be seized. Vehicles must be seized as proceeds of crime.  This is not something where there is discretion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently saw a judge use discretion and this happened in my riding in Langley. There was a drug bust.  The drugs were in the same room with $400,000 wrapped up in vacuum plastic about 10 feet away from the drugs.  The police seized the drugs and took the dealers to court. The judge said that there was no proof that the money which was  wrapped up 10 feet away was gained by way of drugs.  He said that it could have been gained legitimately as the dealers claimed who, by the way, were previously busted. Therefore, he gave the money back to the dealers. He gave 400,000 tax free dollars back to the dealers on something he felt could not be proven.  Who keeps $400,000 cash stashed in a room? No business person does that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That money should have been seized.  It should have been given to the Crown or at least to the police agency that seized it and used for better purposes.</p>

Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on third reading of Bill C-10 which will reform Canada's laws as they relate to the possession and cultivation of cannabis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 is the culmination of a long process that illustrates how the House should approach a major reform of the law in a non-partisan spirit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties in the House can point to parts of the bill that respond to concerns that they raised and points that they made.  Of course, there are divergent views in the House as there are across the country, but Bill C-10 represents a modern made in Canada approach to dealing with the harm caused by marijuana.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are well aware of the major steps that led to this reform.  The House in May 2001 agreed that a special committee on the non-medical use of drugs should be established. The special committee undertook extensive public hearings across Canada. Witnesses from government departments, specialists in drug issues, educators, police and concerned Canadians made their views known. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special committee made many recommendations regarding overall drug policy.  The government has responded to those recommendations by renewing Canada's national drug strategy and providing $245 million over five years for education, prevention, law enforcement and harm reduction strategies. The special committee also recommended alternative measures for dealing with possession and cultivation of up to 30 grams of cannabis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that there were three minority reports.  While the Canadian Alliance considered 30 grams too much, both the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois supported the intent of the recommendation, although they both had concerns.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-38, introduced by the government in May 2003, followed up on the recommendation of the special committee. This bill was referred to the special committee before second reading.</p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Minister of Justice said that this demonstrated that the government was listening  and willing to consider amendments to ensure we got it right, and that the special committee on non-medical use of drugs was well positioned to examine this issue after the exhaustive work it did to prepare its report, which was released last December.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special committee in turn took its responsibility seriously. At this time I would like to thank the members of that all-party committee, including the chair, the member from Burlington.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did make important improvements to the bill. In particular, it recommended that the bill make it an offence to release personal information to foreign governments and international organizations in relation to the offences of possession or cultivation of small amounts of marijuana that are punished by a ticket.  They are still offences, but it is the way of handing out the fines and the sanctions that have been adjusted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes the cultivation of one to three plants for personal use punishable by a fine of $500 for an adult and $250 for youth.  It provides that where there is an agreement between Canada and a province, the offence could be prosecuted by a ticket under the Contraventions Act.  It requires that the government review the impact of the new legislation within three years.  We are pleased with that addition.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to Bill C-38 proposed by the special committee were accepted by the government. The result of all these actions is the bill now before us, Bill C-10, which I believe meets the expectations of Canadians.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are aware of the problems that a criminal conviction for the possession of a small amount of marijuana can cause for a person.  It can close opportunities for employment and prevent travel to certain countries.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a society, Canadians have decided that it does not make sense that a young person who makes a bad choice in life by experimenting with marijuana should receive the lasting burden of a criminal conviction and face such serious consequences.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members are also aware that Canadians want stricter sanctions on large marijuana growing operations, which are both a danger to our communities and a source of revenue for organized crime.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 reflects what Canadians want.  Marijuana remains a prohibited substance and its possession will remain a criminal offence.  This is the message that youth must understand, that there are sanctions.  This is not legalization.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 reflects what Canadians are telling us.  Marijuana remains a prohibited substance and its possession will remain a criminal offence.  However, the procedure for punishing a person who is convicted of possessing a small quantity of marijuana or cannabis resin for personal use has been changed in a way that better reflects the attitudes of Canadians toward the seriousness of the crime.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana will be punished by a summons or a ticket and not by summary conviction. The fine will be set at $150 for an adult and $100 for an adolescent, if there are no aggravating circumstances.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police officers will retain the discretion to give a ticket or a summons to appear in criminal court for the possession of more than 15 grams of marijuana and up to 30 grams.  If a summons is issued, then the maximum sentence will remain a $1,000 fine and/or six months in jail.  These fines would be higher in many cases than what offenders are getting now.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that when a youth is facing a charge, his or her parents will be notified.  We believe the punishment for possession will now be seen by Canadians as fitting the crime.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 also responds to Canadians' expectations concerning the cultivation of marijuana. It will double the maximum penalty for cultivation if the offender has more than 50 plants. In addition, it  sets out a number of aggravating circumstances which would require courts to provide reasons for not imposing a prison sentence.  </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate that the penalty for cultivating up to three plants be reduced. The person who is growing only three plants or less is likely to be cultivating for personal use; however, we deplore the use of marijuana.  Canadians recognize that there is a difference in culpability where the person is growing for personal use as opposed to cultivating for sale to others. Bill C-10 makes that distinction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members are aware that Bill C-10 by itself will not solve all the problems that drugs are causing in our country. It is of course important that  criminal law be modernized. Bill C-10 should lead to more uniform enforcement of the prohibition of possession of marijuana. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently it depends in what city, town, province or  territory one lives. This hopefully will assist more police officers encountering a problem.  Tickets will be issued that then will get paid.   The amounts for youth will be of the amounts that they can pay and the money will not come from parents pulling dollars out of their pockets. These are sanctions for youth.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those sanctions will free up police officers so that they can do more important work and not be there handing out numerous charges in some areas and voice reprimands in others.  It does not seem to be much of a sanction for youth if they are in a city or town where it is just a verbal warning as opposed to this ticket that is going to cost money each and every time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 should lead to more uniform enforcement for the prohibition of possession of marijuana. The greater penalties for cultivation combined with the extra police resources that the government is funding under the national drug strategy should reduce the prevalence of grow ops. We all know how important it is to go after the grow ops.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the drug problems being experienced by our communities across Canada require a comprehensive response to address the underlying causes of drug abuse. Much of what has been done does not fall on the shoulders of the federal government. It is therefore particularly important to note that the government's commitment in renewing the national drug strategy is to work with provincial, territorial and municipal governments, addiction agencies, non-government organizations, professional organizations and associations, law enforcement agencies, the private sector and community groups to reduce the harm to individuals and to society of drug abuse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is playing the leadership role that it should play in the fight against drug abuse and it is rejecting the “Ottawa knows best” attitude that in the past has hindered cooperation with our partners. Through the mechanism of a bi-annual conference, the first of which will be held this year, the government will bring all the stakeholders together to set research, health promotion and drug prevention agendas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, the amendment made by the special committee and accepted by the government that, after three years, there must be a comprehensive review of the effects of the alternative penalties on Canadian society is to be welcomed. This was a good addition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my sincere belief that when Parliament reviews the effects of Bill C-10 on Canadian society, it will find that the legislation struck the right balance, and that Bill C-10 will have played an important part along with the many individuals and initiatives who are working and being funded under the national drug strategy in reducing the harm caused by drugs to Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out to Canadians that operating a motor vehicle while impaired by any substance remains a serious criminal offence. Driving while impaired by drugs including marijuana is included in the offence under subsection 253(a) of the Criminal Code.  Section 254 of the Criminal Code calls for minimum penalties for impaired driving including a mandatory minimum $600 fine on a first offence, a 15 day minimum sentence on a second offence, and a 90 day minimum sentence on a third offence. The maximum penalty for impaired driving is five years unless someone is hurt or killed putting the maximum penalty up to 14 years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for police dealing with drivers impaired by drugs is proving a person's impairment because as yet, no scientific screening device exists to determine the levels of impairment by drugs. The government is proceeding to deal as expeditiously as possible with practical difficulties inherent to proving the drug impaired driving offence.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultations that were started last fall have been completed.   We intend to move forward very quickly in this area.  This is an important area to the government, and I do not want Canadians believing that we will let this area go.  We are actively working on it right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the bill has proven to be of some difficulty for members in the House, but we are not sent here to do the easy things.  I firmly believe all of us in the chamber, on every side of the House, want to improve the lives of Canadians. We want to make penalties and sanctions fit the offences in a manner that is appropriate and in a manner that will not destroy lives, but will allow in some instances, especially with our youth, them to make an error in judgment, to be sanctioned, then to move on with their lives and not carry a penalty for the rest of their lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my colleagues have talked about pardons. Canada has a pardon mechanism.  People can apply for pardons on an individual basis.  Some members, who have worked very hard on the bill, wish we could wave a magic wand and erase the criminal records of people who carry these records because of a simple possession charge.  There are maybe over 6,000 people in Canada who carry criminal records because of a simple possession charge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no mechanism to do a broad amnesty or pardon because we have to look at the specific situation of everybody's case.  When examining pardons, it is a material part of that process to see what exactly is being pardoned, such as  whether the original offence was a plea bargain down from a more serious offence.  We should not do a retroactive blanket pardon.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are students heading toward universities or professional schools who would make good and productive members of society, but  who may have in their youth taken part in activities that are still illegal in this country.  They might be unable to obtain employment, or  they might be unable to take university courses, or they might be unable to work in a government office if they carry that criminal record.  They may have to delay their education.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anybody excuses bad behaviour.  However, we on this side of the House, with the help of those who look seriously at the bill before us and who look at what we have a chance to change in society, think there is more than ample reason to change the law today.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10 deserves the support in the House.  Ladies and gentleman, colleagues in the chamber, it has been a long time coming.  The Le Dain commission was nearly 30 years ago.  I believe we should move cautiously forward.  Some people advocate going immediately to legalization.  Most of the time our bills move forward step by step. Law, just like anything else, is a living tree.  I urge all members of the House to support Bill C-10.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am really worried about what we have done in the House of Commons with regard to this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a research paper from the University of California, Berkeley. That research paper, and others who helped me, showed that the first marijuana cigarette that a person smokes goes into the brain cells and stays there for nine days. It affects the way one thinks, the way one feels, and one's whole attitude.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I had worked at a church before I came up here. There were 23 young people who came from the local high school every day at noon hour and a man gave them marijuana every day. He gave it to them until they became addicted, and it is addictive. This is something I do not think the government realizes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told the minister of my church that I was going to go out and tell those kids that I would buy them hot dogs and pop and that I would bring them in. However, they could not smoke up before this. If they smoked up afterwards,  we would not call the police. I said that I wanted to see if we could get them out of the alleyway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a few weeks, but we finally got them out of the alleyway and we were able to get them away from the man who wanted them to pay for their marijuana.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five Christmas Eve's ago my doorbell rang back home. I went to the door and this gentleman was standing there. He said, “Mrs. Wayne, do you remember me?”  I told him that his face was familiar. He told me that his mom and dad were in the car and that he had just came back from Toronto. I said, “Your Tony” and I asked him what he was doing.  He told me that he was a draftsman in Toronto.  He said that if I had not taken him out of that alleyway, he would be laying there now on cocaine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they do get caught with a small amount of marijuana, they should get a penalty, and they will be pardoned.  We have been able to pardon some. I do not understand how anyone on the government side could say it is all right for them to have--</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the single convention on narcotic drugs, the convention on psychotropic substances and the convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.  Canada is party to all three of these international conventions dealing with illegal drugs.  These treaties require the member countries to prohibit certain activities, including the production, trafficking, import and export of drugs. Countries do and must provide adequate penalties, including imprisonment for serious drug offences.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are debating today a matter that has, with time, become routine in the House of Commons. However, today's debate on acknowledging the Armenian genocide of 1915 has particular force this time, since it is a votable motion, unless a premature election call puts an end to our work in Parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who knows me knows that I have long been interested in this matter. They know, as I do, that it is essential to  acknowledge history to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Acknowledging the past also changes how we see and therefore analyze current and future socio-political conflicts that  risk turning into genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to review the Parliament's acknowledgement in the past of the Armenian genocide, the strategies used by the lobby denying its existence, the situation in Quebec and abroad and,   in conclusion, discuss the facts and the importance of voting in favour of Motion M-380.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the motion reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That this House acknowledge the Armenian genocide of 1915 and condemn this act as a crime against humanity.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of the 37th Parliament, in other words, since the last federal election in 2000, this is the fourth time we are debating a motion to acknowledge the Armenian genocide. Of the three motions previously debated, I had the pleasure to introduce two of them and the  member for Brampton Centre put forward the other.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most of the speeches were in favour of acknowledging the genocide, we have not had the opportunity to put this motion to a vote because of the old rules of procedure for private members' business. This is the first time in a long time that we will have the opportunity to truly take a position in this debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to go back to 1996 for the last vote in the House of Commons on this topic. At that time, parliamentarians, including myself, unanimously supported the following motion: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That the House recognize, on the occasion of the 81st anniversary of the Armenian tragedy which claimed some 1.5 million lives on April 24, 1915, and in recognition of other crimes against humanity, the week of April 20 to 27 of each year as the week of remembrance of the inhumanity of people toward one another.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois and amended by the governing party, was certainly a step in the right direction. Nonetheless, note that it did not talk about  genocide, but rather a tragedy. This was not the wording originally proposed. We initially talked about an act of genocide, but it seemed to be difficult for some parliamentarians to use this term, which is how we ended up with the amendment we did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there has been a lot of water under the bridge since and that is why it is all the more important to  update the debate. Moreover, as surprising as it may seem in the Parliament of Canada, the Senate was the precursor to all of this.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 13, 2002, the Senate of Canada adopted a motion that had essentially three objectives: to recognize the events of 1915 as genocide; to condemn any attempt to deny or distort this historical truth as being anything less than genocide; and,  to designate April 24 of every year as a day of remembrance of the Armenian genocide. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate adopted this motion and the Earth continues to turn. This did not result in  acts  of violence or terrorist attacks, as certain opponents of Motion M-380 would unfortunately have us believe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be  useful at this point to rectify certain facts as to the pressure coming from those who agree with the denial theory. That they do not agree with my actions, I can imagine. That they do not share my viewpoint on history, no one would be surprised. By the way, we all know that history should be read with care, because it has the weakness of having been written by the victors. Still I do not approve of using a fear of terrorism to discredit the recognition of the Armenian genocide and I refuse to agree to the statement that motion M-380 is tainted with  racism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demagoguery is certainly not the best way to enhance one's arguments. In that spirit, the various threats about  peace and the deterioration of relations between Canada and Turkey do not consider the precedents for recognition of the Armenian genocide.</p>


	<A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be clear that the House of Commons will not be creating a precedent by voting in favour of this motion. Just across the Ottawa River—and it was done in Ontario, too—the Quebec National Assembly officially recognized the genocide in 1980. More recently, on September 10, 2003, Quebec passed a law proclaiming April 24 Armenian genocide commemoration day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, a number of states and parliaments have recognized the Armenian genocide. To name just a few: there was Argentina, Belgium, France, Russia, the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, and more recently, Switzerland. Many states in the U.S.—nearly 30—have also recognized this genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the European states and parliaments is particularly interesting. While Turkey threatened the countries that had recognized the genocide with economic and diplomatic retaliation, it was hoping, at the same time, to get support for its entry into the European union. These  threats never became reality and the Turkish ambassador in Paris, having been called home for a short time after the genocide was recognized by the French National Assembly, returned to his duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recognition did not stir up any particular tension in Franco-Turkish relations, nor did it provoke acts of violence or terrorism between French people of Armenian origin and those of Turkish origin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are against the motion will argue that history is for historians and that it is not up to politicians to determine what the truth is. Where facts are concerned, many experts, scholars, historians and researchers have examined them and came to the conclusion that a genocide did indeed occur. Among those experts were professor William Schabas, a specialist in international law, Léo Kuper, a genocide expert, and Raphaël Lemkin, an eminent contributor to the development of the United Nations Convention on Genocide. They have always recognized the 1915 genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the politicians who have acknowledged  the genocide are Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, two former British Prime Ministers, as well as Adolf Hitler, who said, and I quote:</p>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who are still wondering if it is up to us to reflect on history, this should be food for thought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the 20th century, 1.5 million Armenians were killed. They did not die while fighting during the first world war, but rather in the context of that war, which is quite different. Following on this argument, could we say today that the six million Jews who were killed during the second world war died on the battlefield? No, they were killed in the context of the second world war, but not because of the war, that goes without saying. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge today the very compassionate action taken during the 1939-45 war by the Turkish ambassador to France who saved a significant number of Jews from the Lyon area from the concentration camps and probable, if not certain, death.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before World War I, 20% of the Turkish people were not Muslim, compared to 2.5% after the war. These figures are facts that have been recognized by a great number of historians and experts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should hon. members support my initiative? Let me give an example. If a person wilfully commits a murder in front of you, if everyone knows about it, including lawyers, judges and police officers, but no one acknowledges that it is a murder, what criteria will people use in the future to distinguish what is a murder and what is not? Closing our eyes to a historic reality creates the risk of making this non-acknowledgement a form of precedent for events that are occurring now and that will occur in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning a genocide requires well defined strategies and dynamics, and we must recognize them for what they are to understand the conditions that lead to such crimes against humanity. By acknowledging that the events of 1915 are a genocide, we will allow researchers, historians and academics to study what happened, while keeping in mind that this was indeed a genocide. These people can then compare various genocides and try to identify the similarities and the circumstances that are conducive to such acts.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have all the tools needed to best understand how a genocide is organized, perhaps then the international community will be able to identify the signs in time to take immediate action instead of intervening too late, as happened in the Rwandan genocide, that this House just acknowledged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this acknowledgement is not to condemn the current Turkish government. Nor does Motion M-380 ask that it provide any reparations in terms of money or land to the Armenians. By acknowledging the Armenian genocide, Canada is not pointing a finger at the Turkish government. It is merely acknowledging history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I want to reassure the Turkish community and tell them that this motion in no way attempts to hold them responsible for what happened in the early 20th century. What happened belongs in the past, and we  must acknowledge it as such, since we are opposed to all forms of violence and the misfortunes that violence begets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we will not bring the victims back, but we will, at the very least, ensure that historical justice is rendered and give ourselves the tools we need to build a better world. During their lives, individuals and peoples are often wounded. The deeper the wounds, the longer it takes to heal. I truly believe that, by acknowledging the genocide perpetrated on the Armenian people,  we will be helping to heal their scars and give them and the international community the desire to view the future in solidarity and with respect for our differences.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague. I know she is very passionate about this subject. We have had a number of opportunities to work together on this issue. I congratulate her once again on being tenacious enough to put forward her point of view once more on this subject that is very important for the Armenian community in Canada I also congratulate her for her overview of all the very important facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry, but I have to say that on this side of the House there is no unanimity. There is certainly a lot of support, it is true, and we shall prove  that to her  when our turn comes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask her a question and give her the opportunity to provide more details. In the countries where this motion has already been adopted, have there been negative consequences? That is one of the criticisms one hears everywhere; that there will be negative fallout in the countries concerned.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her comments, which I greatly appreciate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, economic threats sometimes are sometimes effective. They are used because people think they work well. All we know, particularly in the case of France, is that neither France nor Turkey has withdrawn from any of the various contracts connecting them. I am convinced that it will be the same here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In business, people say money is money and that we pick one country over another based on whether it is in our economic interest to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we think that Canada will continue to negotiate with Quebec, because Canada wants to do business with Quebec, I think that, regarding the Armenian genocide and the possibility that the Turkish government may reconsider its investments in Quebec or the rest of Canada, this is another form of pressure. But as a parliamentarian and a member of the public, I know that this kind of thing has no influence on our collective decision.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the member for her comments on the following two questions.   After the French government recently passed a motion on genocide, the Swiss government did a similar thing. Could she comment on the reaction by  the Turkish government to protest the action of the Swiss government? That is my first question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have received many letters of complaint from the Turkish point of view from the United States.  Those are  Americans telling us what to do.  I wonder if she would comment on those two points. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, in this whole issue, reparations are not what really matters. What really matters is that the Armenian people know that their historic reality and the wounds that were inflicted on them be recognized by the international community. As far as I am concerned, this is about much more than a reparatoins. It is very easy to give money or a little something but, in fact, not to acknowledge anything.</p>

Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to applaud the hon. members who are taking part in this debate. I would especially  like to acknowledge, on our side, the tenacity of the members for Ahuntsic and Brampton Centre. This being my first time in this position, over the past few days they have provided me with a great deal of information on this issue. Now I am delivering a speech on this important topic. I would also like to thank the hon. member for Laval Centre, who put forward this motion, and the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank everyone taking part in this great debate on the tragic events that took place between 1915 and 1923 during the first world war and the fall of the Ottoman Empire. These events resulted in many victims in the Armenian community and other communities in the region.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many atrocities were perpetrated during  those years and all of Europe, the Middle East and Asia Minor suffered a great deal. Millions of people were forcibly displaced and, in addition to the terrible  anguish of the exodus, many did not survive. As we know, our government has expressed on many occasions, in the House and elsewhere, its profound compassion for the Armenian people and others who suffered so much during that period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to quote a passage from a personal message sent by the former prime minister to Canadians of Armenian descent on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the Armenian tragedy of 1915:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to reiterate that during the debate on the Armenian tragedy in 1996, and as mentioned earlier, the House adopted a motion recognizing the week of April 20 to 27 each year as a week of remembrance of the inhumanity of people toward one another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I emphasize that on June 10, 1999, following comprehensive consultations, the position of the Government of Canada with regard to these events was clearly set out in a statement made in the House by the hon. member for Halton, speaking on behalf of the foreign affairs minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote from a reply by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the House on April 18, 2002, to a question from our colleague, the member for Brampton Centre, in which the minister stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>As [the hon. member] will recall, the government and the Prime Minister on many occasions have expressed the sympathy of our government and our people for the tragedy that occurred to the Armenian people with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of course followed that with:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>We still urge that we should consider these tragic events in their historical context and remember that we must move forward and try to ensure peace and harmony among all people.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statements make it clear that we remember the suffering caused by this painful period and attach a great deal of importance to ensuring that the memory of this human tragedy is preserved in our collective consciousness and passed on to future generations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has always been a land of hope for the millions of immigrants who have settled here and those who continue to do so in a spirit of renewal and reconciliation. It is extremely important to keep this concept in mind. Our diversity remains one of our country's greatest qualities, helping us not only to forge economic, political and cultural links with the rest of the world, but also to project and promote our ideals and values such as tolerance, respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all working toward ensuring that these values are reflected in the work of international organizations and in the tools developed to prevent any recurrence of the horrors of the past to uphold human rights. We have a highly credible voice in many countries and within international fora such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in discussing the real possibility that people of different origins and cultures can live together in peace and security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of course listens to us because we speak knowledgeably of our own reality. Canada has steadfastly supported the development of international instruments to promote and uphold human rights and the rule of law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are particularly proud of Canada's leadership role in promoting major international initiatives such as the Ottawa convention on landmines and the International Criminal Court initiatives that are an integral part of Canada's global human security agenda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We attach great importance to establishing positive, comprehensive and of course productive relationships with and between all the countries of the region, including Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Indeed, a stable, prosperous region where reconciliation has triumphed and mutual trust reigns could generate positive developments and spin-offs beyond the immediate borders of the countries concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To place this issue in the context of a European dream, one characterized by reduced tensions and increasingly successful examples of peaceful solutions to political problems, the relations between Armenia and Turkey are of major concern. Again I would like to underscore what we have learned:  that both Armenia and Turkey have begun negotiations to begin a process which will hopefully lead to the normalization of their relations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe firmly that it is vital to establish contact, dialogue and relations when and where we can. This is why the Minister of Foreign Affairs wrote to the foreign ministers of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, encouraging dialogue and offering our willingness to play a supportive role. Now is not the time for the House to pass the motion, as this would only result in upsetting the ongoing dialogue between Armenia and Turkey.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that the motion as brought forward is one that will pit members on a number of sides on various poles and I believe it is important for us to take into consideration the good work that has been done by a lot of people to try to bring this forward. A famous prime minister once said that we must strive for justice; it is impossible to do it at all turns but certainly the most important emphasis is justice in our own time.</p>

	It is a little disappointing, Mr. Speaker, that we cannot share our time in this debate.  It is disappointing because here in Canada we do try to resolve our differences by giving different points of view. We do not resort to violence or military action.  It is just disappointing that this happened this way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third time that I have spoken about this issue over several years. I want to compliment the member for Brampton Centre for raising it before and also the member today for raising it again, because it is an issue that certainly means a lot to a lot of people.  It brings out a lot of emotion and a lot of sadness to people's hearts when we talk about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just thinking that we in North America were all moved by the disaster of September 11 when several thousand people died.  Here, we are talking about a million and a half people, 250 times as many people, who were lost during this period from 1915 to 1923.  It was a catastrophe of monstrous proportions that took place at the end of the Ottoman Empire and involved World War I.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only just possibly imagine what it is like for the Armenians to grasp the situation when we have turned our whole continent inside out because of the September 11 disaster that we experienced. In fact, it was only a small disaster relative to what they have gone through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole debate surrounds the terrible massacre of human life between 1915 and 1923, with estimates in excess of a million and a half men, women and children lost.  There was violence and there were deportations, internments, mass murders and all kinds of atrocities.  We in the House can hardly imagine what went on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good that we raise these issues, discuss them and raise public awareness of them and that we extend our sympathy to those who still suffer and are torn over the awful events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We abhor any mass slaughter or killings, whether they are in Rwanda, the Middle East or Europe, by any country or any group.  It is important that we remember these issues and work toward finding ways to prevent them. We have a responsibility in Canada to do that now and we have a responsibility to make sure that atrocities in the past are not forgotten.  We are very fortunate here in the way we resolve our issues and fortunate that we have not been subject to anything like what those people in any of these disasters that I mentioned had to have experienced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very important that we make sure we do everything we can to prevent them, as we are in Afghanistan now and in other areas around the world.  It is certainly important that we keep the issues before the public so that we will never forget these awful things that happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end my comments with that.  This is the third of three debates I have been involved with, and perhaps if I had not been involved with the debates I would never have known anything about this. I hope that Canadians who are listening will take a lesson from it, learn about this issue and give it a lot of thought.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to support and second this motion recognizing the Armenian genocide of 90 years ago and to condemn this atrocity as a crime against humanity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to commend the hon. member for Laval Centre for bringing forward such an very important motion tonight. I also want to congratulate our fellow citizens, especially Canadian Armenians, who keep fighting for justice to be done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you all know, my hon. colleague for Burnaby—Douglas has moved a great number of motions along those lines over the last 10 years and more.</p>


	<A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that the NDP, through the member for Burnaby—Douglas, has called for April 24 to be officially designated as a day of remembrance for the 1.5 million Armenians who fell victim to the first genocide of the 20th century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all heard false arguments for why Canada should not recognize this genocide.  I am very sorry to say that I think we heard one such argument or set of arguments from the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs this evening. I think that is regrettable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common argument that one hears--and I think we need a moment to consider this--is that if this recognition of the Armenian genocide were to be adopted by the Parliament of Canada, Canada-Turkey relations would be adversely affected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose the same people who make that argument would have argued that we in Canada should have plunged ourselves into  Bush's Iraqi war because one could say that we might have suffered some retaliation. In fact,  many would say we are suffering some retaliation.  However, it was an important stand of principle that the Canadian people took in opposing the illegal, unjustified war in Iraq and it is time for us here in Parliament to take a  similar principled stand in recognizing the Armenian genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I do not wish to encroach on the time of other members,  I want to briefly wrap up by quoting from the current president of the Armenian National Committee of Canada and again recognize the important ongoing work that has been done, contrary to the parliamentary secretary who basically says, if I understood his comments, why do we not just let it go and move to the future?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be understood that people move on from such a brutalizing experience to their people, particularly family members and loved ones, by being able to have an acknowledgement of the atrocities and then being able to leave it behind them.  It is a psychological matter.  It is a political matter. It is an historic question of justice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote, in conclusion, from the very thoughtful submission of the Armenian National Committee of Canada:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there has certainly been a change in the atmosphere in this chamber versus the  atmosphere of   two hours  ago. That is a clear indication to me, and to everyone else, that this is a solemn occasion and a sensitive one for all the members present in this chamber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell the House that in October 1995 I was fortunate to have visited Turkey. Why did I visit Turkey?  I formed the Canadian-Turkish parliamentary friendship group here and was keenly interested in that country. I  was hoping to develop more positive relationships with a country that I knew very little about, and    most parliamentarians knew little about the country as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a highly organized and planned trip, one in which I had complete control in determining whom I would meet, the topics of discussion, concerns, places to examine, from the highest levels of governmental and religious control to the bagel peddlers on the street.  Without any doubt, it was a fantastic learning experience.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I left Canada, I did a lot of research and had the opportunity to meet with some Canadians of Armenian descent and leaders in the Armenian community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never forget that meeting because they did their very best to convince me not to visit Turkey.  They presented to me a picture of a country where they claimed  human rights did not exist for the masses and where the  Kurds were being persecuted daily.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, one story I remember so vividly  claimed that if  people were  caught speaking on the street or overhead on the bus or on the streetcars speaking one of the Kurdish dialects, they   were reported and could be punished.  They told me quite a few others. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I soon discovered that none of their horror stories were true. The constitutional protocol of the Turkish government states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> Differences of languages, faith,  and origin within our national culture enriches our cultural life.  The natural prerequisite of a democratic social structure is that these differences can be expressed freely within the scope of national integrity.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventeen constitutional amendments, early in 1995,  introduced   democratic reforms in the human rights areas, the most important being freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of assembly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reforms are working. I found that there were 15  Kurdish newspapers, numerous books written in the Kurdish dialects and today, eight years later, the evidence is overwhelming with over 3,000 independent, not government controlled, radio stations, some broadcasting in the Kurdish dialect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While visiting the Turkish grand national assembly, which is its parliament, I discovered that over 100 members   sitting in that parliament were of Kurdish descent, such as the minister of foreign affairs, Mr.   Hikmet Cetin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the democratic improvements that have taken place in Turkey since 1995--and I compare it to   all the other countries surrounding Turkey and near Turkey--I firmly believe that Turkey stands out as the most secular and democratic state in the Middle East.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my first visit I met many Canadians who had invested in economic projects in Turkey.  From Montreal, there was  the  famous LaSalle College International Fashion School, whose graduates are found in many houses of fashion throughout the world. There was Netas, a giant telecommunications enterprise in Istanbul, a company which is 51% owned by  Northern Telecom, and the list goes on. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highlight of my visit was visiting the enormous complex subway system that was under construction in Ankara, the capital city. Government officials, engineers and representatives from Bombardier Incorporated and SNC-Lavalin, Quebec companies, and a delegation of officials from the Bombardier  plant in Thunder Bay--Thunder Bay is my riding--where the subway cars were built, took me on the first trial run of the cars in that system. In that trial run I discovered that they were all highly impressed by the effectiveness of the system and by the superior workmanship revealed within the subway cars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not enough time to deal with the economic relationships between Canadian and Turkish companies. Supporting and accepting this motion, for which there is absolutely no proof of a planned genocide of Armenians, would have disastrous economic effects on  Canada's economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this very moment, pending the outcome of this motion, we could win or lose a billion dollar contract to have over 300 subway cars built in the Bombardier plant in Thunder Bay. Over 1,000 employees are involved, mostly highly trained and skilled union members. Parts are manufactured in Thunder Bay, which involves a great number of other skilled workmen, and a great number of parts and systems are manufactured in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SNC-Lavalin, a major contributor to telecommunications and control systems for the subway, would also be severely affected, which would mean a decrease in employment of this company, not only in Ontario, but especially in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ties with Turkey are growing in a very positive manner and we must not jeopardize this beneficial growth in an emotional, reckless, foolhardy manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say a word now about the claimed planned genocide. The Ottoman Empire was comprised of 25 countries. For many years turmoil prevailed throughout certain regions, especially in eastern Anatolia and Armenia, which is in the far eastern section of what we now call Turkey. Even before the Balkan war started in 1912, many were moving and leaving that area for safer havens. Prior to 1912, British, French and Ottoman sources claim  the Armenian population was somewhere between 1.05 million and 1.5 million. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historian Dr. Justin McCarthy of the University of Louisville, British historian Arnold Toynbee and Monseigneur Touchet, a French missionary, all calculated that the Armenians lost approximately 600,000 people from 1912 to 1920. However, during the same period, over 2.5 million Muslims, including Turks, Kurds and Tartars, died in eastern Anatolia. We have no idea how many Russians were killed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Armenian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1920 declared that, after the war, 280,000 Armenians remained in the Anatolian portion of the occupied Ottoman Empire while 700,000 Armenians emigrated to other countries such as France, Australia, the United States, and Canada, where the majority went to Quebec. Clearly then, a great portion of the Ottoman Armenians were not killed as claimed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each needless death is tragic. Equally tragic are lies meant to inflame and perpetuate ethnic hatred. That is not the Canadian way.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion  I would like to quote  what the former prime minister, Jean Chrétien,  said on April 24, 2002:</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  in recognition of my colleague from Brampton, I will only take  three or four minutes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken on similar motions a couple of times  and I have put on the record what I think is a pretty compelling and undeniable historical record. In my last intervention on this issue, I began reading from headlines that appeared in Canadian media outlets during 1915 and 1916.  I would  like to continue citing a few of these. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member from Thunder Bay to perhaps listen to what the Canadian media was reporting as objective news facts during the genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headline in <i>London Free Press</i> on October 22, 1915, read, “Armenian race may disappear before war ends. Vatican has appealed for unfortunate people”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Globe</i> newspaper, predecessor to the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, reported on October 23, 1915, “A million Armenians wiped out by Turks. Only 200,000 Armenian inhabitants of Turkey now remain in country”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Globe</i> on Saturday the 27th, 1915, reported   “unspeakable cruelty to the lot of Armenians, massacres of unsurpassing  horror committed, people burned alive, torturing, beggaring, all descriptive language practised on defenceless Christians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was according to Viscount Bryce.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Ottawa Evening Journal</i> on November 29, 1915, reported, “a saturnalia of slaughter by refined methods as young Turks set out to wipe Armenian race out of the world”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Ottawa Evening Journal </i> of November 30, 1915, reported, “crime of Belgian venial sin when Armenian massacre known to nations”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the  headlines in the Canadian media of the era.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the <i>Globe</i> newspaper, on December 15, 1915, reported, “a million Armenians massacred by Turks. Lord Bryce publishes further report of atrocities in Asia Minor”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were  the accounts of Canadian journalists and their firsthand sources in the region at the time. This is not some arcane debate between historians on differing sides. This is a recognized objective, historical fact that cannot be denied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move briefly to the comments of the parliamentary secretary, who continues to use the government's language of a tragedy. Oxford describes a tragedy as “a serious accident...or natural catastrophe”, whereas it defines a genocide as “the mass extermination of human beings, esp. of a particular race or nation”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the historical fact  is absolutely clear and undeniable that that was what occurred during the first world war in that region. There was a deliberate attempt by an element of the then Ottoman government  to destroy the Armenian people. I believe that just as the western world has recognized the reality of the Holocaust and has learned from the terrible historical lessons of that era, so too must we learn from the first great genocide of the last century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   closing I want to say that I have many friends in the Turkish Canadian community.   I have had representations made to me by the excellent Turkish ambassador to Canada,   by the Turkish consul in Calgary  and other members of that community. I believe the passage of this motion should in no way, shape or form cast any kind of cloud over the marvellous contribution made to Canada by Turkish immigrants, nor should it in any way inhibit our fantastic relationship with our NATO ally and aspiring European Union member in Turkey.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reject categorically the notion that acceptance of the historical reality of the genocide will in any way inhibit our relationship with Turkey. I believe in that relationship. I am a fan of Turkey as a Muslim country that is seeking to lead the way in terms of democracy and human rights. Yes, it is imperfect, and yes,  improvements are needed  in many areas in terms of minorities, but it is so much further ahead of many countries in that region. We need to continue to build on that relationship and we need to ensure that the Turks in Canada do not feel that this motion in any way places any culpability on the Turkish people. That is simply a red herring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of  the vast majority of members in my party,   we ought to recognize the historical realities so that our grandchildren and their grandchildren will know that this was the first great genocides, and that we must recognize it in our history if we are to prevent these things from reoccurring in the future.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  I would like to thank my colleague from Laval Centre for presenting the motion.  This is not the first and it will not be the last.  I would hope it would be the last because we have worked on this in the past and we have to get on with debating other issues in the House to do with the Armenian-Turkish relationship. I hope we support this motion and go forward from here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reflect on the comments made by my colleague from Thunder Bay. He mentioned that Turkey is ready to join the European Union. That is a false statement because Turkey has tried for the last 30 or 40 years to join and every time it has been  blocked for many reasons.  The first issue was the human rights treatment by the Turkish government against a minority. The second issue was the Kurdish minority treatment.  The third issue was the Armenian genocide. The fourth issue  was the                        Cyprus issue. If it does not address these four issues, Turkey will never be a European Union country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague mentioned  that the Turkish constitution is such a fantastic instrument.  He may be right, but the Turkish constitution was written after the genocide.  No constitution in the world would provide that type of clause. Even the Hitler constitution did not provide for genocide of the Jews. The Rwanda constitution  and  the Bosnia constitution never provided a clause to  kill a minority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are done in the name of national security. Turkey at the time felt that the Armenians were a threat to national security: “Let us eliminate  them; let us solve it with a final resolution and get it over with”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the NDP mentioned Iraq, the U.S. and Canada.  She is 100% right.  We can afford to upset the U.S.A. when we do about $1 billion of trade a day.  With Turkey our trade  over two years was $1 billion. If we can provoke the U.S. in these conditions, what is the big deal about a so-called provocation with Turkey? Of course we know this whole thing is hot air.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When France passed a resolution two or  three years ago, the Turkish ambassador was recalled from Paris to Ankara and six months later he went back.  It said it was going to cancel the contract.  No contract was cancelled. Therefore the argument is totally false.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Thunder Bay  mentioned that SNC-Lavalin and the Canadian government are involved in  a contract with the Turkish government to provide some 300    rail cars. I have been there long enough, especially on this issue for 25 to 30 years.  Three years ago there were discussions that Turkey was going to buy a Candu reactor from us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time there is a motion in the House that this issue is close to a settlement or a final resolution, Turkey comes up with a so-called memorandum of understanding. If anyone believes that Turkey is going to buy these rail cars  from Bombardier, good luck.  They are really naive to believe that Turkey is going to pay for this.  It has no money to pay for its own daily expenses so how could it afford to pay so much money for this kind of  fantastic service?  Bombardier should know better. That company is being used to provoke the Canadian government to take a stand against the Armenian question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned earlier that we owe it to ourselves to know and recognize the history of this issue.  This is not to do with the Turkish government. At the end of the day the relations between the two countries, Turkey and Armenia, will improve because this issue is out of the way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a list of the countries that have recognized the genocide.  The most recent one is  the Swiss government on  December 16, 2003. Others are the Canadian Senate on  June 13, 2002;  the European parliament assembly on  April 24, 2001; the Italian chamber of deputies; the Lebanese parliament; the French national assembly; the Belgian senate; the U.S. House of Representatives; the Argentine senate; and   the European parliament. There was  a French law in  January 20, 2001.  Again there is  the European parliament; the French national assembly; the Swedish parliament; the council of the European parliament; the Lebanese parliament; the Hellenic parliament; the Russian Duma; the European parliament; the Cyprus parliament; and Uruguay. There was a joint declaration of France, Great Britain and Russia on May 23, 1915 to condemn what happened to the Armenians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Calgary  also read a few pages of a book. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in my possession  a newspaper articles from the <i>Evening Telegram</i>, the <i> Globe and Mail</i>, the <i> London Times</i> and the <i>New York Times</i>.    I also have in my possession all the resolutions I read earlier, about 40 or 50 pages, that passed through the parliaments of Canada, the United States and  the European parliament.  I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House to leave these documents with the clerk for further study.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember debating this issue way back.  I remember a few years ago there was the Créditiste Party some 30 or 40 years ago.  They raised this issue--</p>

They are not edited.  They are simply historical facts as they were written in 1915.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am sure anyone who would study these historical  facts would find many undisputed facts in this presentation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that the Créditistes in the 1960s were probably the first political party in the House of Commons to raise the issue of the Armenian genocide.  Since then, in the 1970s and 1980s we  passed many resolutions in the House to bring the issue into focus for the Canadian public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the issue was quite forceful and brought out many points of view on how to solve this problem.  I am pleased that our Parliament in the past 10 years has passed many resolutions.  One resolution was passed a couple of years ago by the Senate.  The resolution asked the government and the Parliament of Canada to recognize this genocide as an historic event.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second resolution passed nine to seven in the foreign affairs committee.  That was an historic day for us.  The foreign affairs committee accepted the fact that the House of Commons must recognize the act of genocide and passed the resolution on to the Government of Canada.  I would like to have that motion passed again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion was:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That the Committee invite the House of Commons to recognize the genocide of the Armenians, which began at the turn of the last C century, by the Ottoman Turks, during the First World War.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a resolution passed in 1996 which was mentioned earlier.  The resolution declared April 20 to 27 as a week of remembrance of the inhumanity to fellow man.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is that we have to continue this struggle not only for the sake of Armenians, not only for the sake of the Turks, but it is vital  to recognize the historical fact.  When we take positive steps, it will help bring these two nations together forever.  They will live together  because Armenia and Turkey are still there.  Armenia will not vanish and neither will Turkey.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better that we do our part to bring them together so they can move forward for the peace, security and prosperity of both the Armenians and Turks.</p>
