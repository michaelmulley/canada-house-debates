	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt who have concerns about the 
Liberals' proposed endangered species protection act. The 
Canadian Cattleman's Association oppose this bill because their 
land will be devalued without providing necessary compensation.
<P>
	The government plans to bring down its own despotic recovery 
agenda instead of listening to the individual stakeholders. A 
Reform government would have created this legislation from the 
ground up by consulting with the individual stakeholders. We 
would have spelled out the recovery plan process and provided a 
greater understanding of what is expected of the individual 
landowner. We would have addressed the issue of compensation for 
land devaluation before introducing legislation. A private and 
government operated fund would have been set up.
<P>
	In all areas Canadians need a fresh start, including a meaningful 
process in the area of environmental protection. The Liberals have 
failed us again and it is Liberal cabinet ministers who will be added 
to the endangered species list following the next election.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, delegates who attended the recent Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture annual meeting had  one important message on cost 
recovery to make very clear. From potato growers in Prince 
Edward Island through wheat growers on the prairies to apple 
growers in British Columbia, the message was the same. The 
government has this issue all wrong.
<P>
	Farmers from coast to coast will have a smaller net income this 
year because of other government policy decisions. On top of lower 
incomes and higher input costs, the government is heaping 
additional increased costs on everything from inspection fees to 
marine steerage fees on to the backs of farmers. It seems like this 
very unsympathetic Liberal government has decided to turn user 
fees into a source of revenue for the government.
<P>
	It is time to re-evaluate the cumulative effect of what has been 
done, and in consultation with the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture and other farm groups, revisit the whole issue of cost 
recovery programming.

citizens of six Toronto area municipalities rejected the Ontario 
government's proposal for megacity amalgamation. One 
understands the results of this vote when one considers the 
substance of these proposals and the fundamentally undemocratic 
process that accompanied them.
<P>
	Toronto voters have said no to a proposal which, while 
purporting to address problems of governance in the Toronto area, 
ignores the best advice of all municipal government experts. They 
have said no to a proposal which creates a mega monster, unable to 
respond to the real needs of the region and too far removed from its 
citizens for local accountability. They have said no to a 
fundamentally ill-conceived proposal to finance welfare and 
housing from the municipal tax base.
<P>
	Mike Harris and his government should heed the message. The 
best interests of the Toronto region, which represents 25 per cent of 
the GDP of this country, is at stake. Now is the time to abandon

flooding because the Canadian Coast Guard hovercraft was not 
available to clear the mouth of the river, as it was being repaired.
<P>
	This absurd situation prompted me to ask on several occasions 
that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans make sure to change the

available, if needed, during the months of January, February and

<P>
	This year, when we had this spell of milder weather on February

any chances, and the craft was overhauled in November in order to 
be ready to respond to any emergency come January.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all the media in Quebec are commenting on the 
government's anti-tobacco bill, and the majority are definitely in 
favour of a more flexible approach to sponsorship and the 
broadcasting of sports and cultural events associated with tobacco 
companies. Every one is amazed at the unnecessarily rigid stand 
the government has taken.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize he has a perfectly good issue 
and that this government, because of its unwillingness to 
compromise, is spoiling everything and even alienating thousands 
of citizens who are recent recruits to the anti-smoking movement? 
Does he not understand?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker 
the government's main concern is the health of our young people. 
Everyone knows that tobacco advertising has a tremendous 
influence on young people who start smoking when they are 13, 14 
or 15, and it is worse in Quebec than anywhere else.
<P>
	When we introduced this bill a few months ago, the Quebec 
Minister of Health criticized us for not going far enough. I read one 
of Mr. Rochon's draft bills on tobacco, and I want to quote a 
passage from clause 22, which goes much further than our 
proposal. It says that all funding of sports, cultural or social 
activities or facilities, either directly or indirectly, for the purpose 
of promoting tobacco in any manner whatsoever, is prohibited. 
Perhaps our friends opposite should stop playing politics with this 
issue and take a serious look at the problem.
<P>
	We have shown some flexibility. The companies asked for a 
three-year moratorium, and we agreed to a two-year period of 
adjustment. However, the problem is still there.
<P>
	We did not do this because we felt like it, but because it is our 
duty to take steps to protect the health of young Quebecers. I know, 
the Bloc Quebecois is always more intent on political gain than on 
protecting the interests of Quebec's young people.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not very brave of the Prime Minister to use what other 
people are doing as a shield to justify his own actions. This is 
hardly a sign of bravery. He is the  one on the stand here, not Jean 
Rochon in Quebec City. The question was put to the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	And the question is this: Why is the Prime Minister being so 
intransigent, why is he doing such a poor job? Why is he getting 
everybody up in arms against him and, in the process, undoing any 
progress made in the fight against tobacco? He does not realize he 
is sabotaging his own cause.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition tries to please everyone. We 
act responsibly, and these are very serious responsibilities. When 
the Quebec Minister of Health speaks, he does so as the person 
responsible for people who need medical care.
<P>
	I will read you a letter sent to me by Mario Laurin in Val-d'Or. 
Mr. Laurin is fighting lung cancer caused by smoking. Here is his 
letter: ``Our children's health is surely the most precious thing in 
the world; you must protect it, with legislation if necessary. Mr. 
Prime Minister, I urge you to stand up to the tobacco companies 
and get Bill C-71, the anti-tobacco bill, through Parliament''.
<P>
	I could quote other people suffering from cancer caused by 
smoking. As I said this morning, we can tolerate advertising 
directed at adults who smoke, but not when it goes after young 
people in their early teens. Those who represent the tobacco 
companies know that if a person has not started to smoke by the age 
of 19, he probably never will.

that can express what I think of the Prime Minister. But I can tell 
you that everyone in Canada agrees with the need to reduce our 
consumption of cigarettes.
<P>
	However, there are various ways to achieve that objective. Some 
are more acceptable than others, and some are less effective.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister of Canada realize that a young person 
who goes to the Du Maurier tennis open is far more likely to buy a 
tennis racket than a package of cigarettes when he goes home?

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Grand Prix will be held next Sunday.
<P>
	We want to keep the competition. In fact, the companies will 
have the right to do on-site sponsorship. Furthermore, the bill gives 
them another two years to adjust to the new rules. However, we 
decided that we would take steps in Canada to prevent tobacco 
advertising from affecting young people of 13, 14 and 15, and we 
will continue to do so. The tobacco companies can advertise on the

<P>
	Since the Prime Minister refuses to understand, I shall be very 
clear. Clause 31 of the bill has three paragraphs: (a) and (c), which 
say the same thing, and (b), which contradicts the other two. Can 
the Prime Minister make a commitment in this House to do 
everything in his power to ensure that paragraph (b) is  deleted

<P>
	It should be noted that the National Cancer Institute of Canada 
said this about advertising: ``There is substantial evidence that 
young people are aware of and respond to cigarette advertising''.
<P>
	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said: ``Image based 
advertising is particularly effective with young people in that the 
information conveyed by imagery is likely to be more significant to 
young people than information conveyed by any other means of 
advertising''.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member that members of the Bloc 
Quebecois can throw that aside and accuse the government of being 
unreasonable, but the hon. member knows full well that this 
government has been prudent and has been reasonable. We have

Speaker, when the Liberal government brought in medicare in 1965 
it promised to pay 50 per cent of the approved cost. That was a 
condition on which provinces like Alberta and Ontario joined the 
plan.
<P>
	Thirty-two years later federal funding of medicare has dropped 
to 16 per cent. This Prime Minister, who claims to be a defender of 
medicare, has cut health care by 40 per cent since coming to power.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister can cry crocodile tears about the Montfort 
hospital. He can blame Mike Harris. He can pretend it is a national 
unity issue. But he is the one who is primarily responsible for 
hospital closures across the country.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister continue to blame others for 
hospital closures and waiting lines when he is the one who has cut 
health care funding by 40 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as usual, the leader of the third party has the wrong figure. 
We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8653"> 8653 </A></B>
<P>
have not cut transfer payments by 40 per cent. The Minister of 
Finance can reply to that in detail.
<P>
	We just had to put the finances of the nation in good order. This 
is the same leader of a party who was telling us that we were not 
going fast enough. Remember when we said to the Canadian people 
we would do that in three years, go to 3 per cent. He wanted to go to 
0 per cent in three years. We took three years. Now we have the 
lowest interest level that we have known in 35 years. All the 
provincial governments are benefiting from the fact that they pay 
less on their debts because of the action of this government to put 
the finances of this country in good order.
<P>
	By the way, perhaps the leader of the third party should report on 
the success of his campaign in Alberta against Ralph Klein.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister and the government had some choices 
to make in the federal budget. They chose to cut health by 40 per 
cent since 1993. The Prime Minister can find $2 billion a year in 
subsidies for CMHC. He can find $850 million to $1 billion in 
subsidies for the CBC. He can find $300 million in subsidies for 
Via Rail. He can find over $2 billion in subsidies for corporations 
like Bombardier and others that receive corporate subsidies. But 
the Prime Minister cuts health care by almost $4 billion a year.
<P>
	Are crown corporation subsidies and business subsidies a higher 
priority with the Prime Minister's government than the health care 
of Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is such a thing in politics as the flip-flopper of all time. This 
is the same member who in March 1995 stood in his place and 
condemned the Minister of Finance who gave notice, gave 
predictable funding to the provinces with the cash floor for the 
purposes of health care, thereby providing $25.1 billion.
<P>
	The leader of that party in March 1995, in an amendment to a 
non-confidence motion, condemned the government for its failure 
to eliminate the deficit quickly and decisively within one year.
<P>
	This is the flip-flopper of all time. He says one thing on Monday 
and another thing on Friday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in Reform Party proposals, our fresh start, we proposed 
cutting in virtually everything else in order to increase federal 
health care funding by over $4 billion a year. There are some 
ministers in this House who are experts on cutting health care. 
They are the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Health.
<P>
	Look at their record. Here is what they have cut in health care: 
Newfoundland, $85 million; little P.E.I., $20 million; slashing 
health care expenditures in New Brunswick by $103 million; 
Quebec, $1.2 billion; Ontario $1.3 billion.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	How can the government possibly maintain that it is the defender 
of medicare when the Prime Minister and the finance minister have 
hacked, gouged and slashed health care by almost $4 billion a year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
the time we took office, transfers to the provinces had been 
declining for nearly a decade. When we took office we put in place 
a series of cuts in our own spending that allowed us in the last 
budget to commit to the provinces that not only were the transfer 
cuts at an end but that the transfers were now put on a formula that 
would allow them to increase in the years ahead.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party used words like gouge, scrape 
and cut. Let me quote from ``A Fresh Start for Canadians'', 
Reform's most recent program. The Reform Party has said: ``On 
top of the existing reductions in transfers, the Reform Party, on 
taking office, will immediately cut three and a half billion dollars 
from the Canadian health and social transfer''. What do you call 
that?

<P>
	Yesterday, in Washington, the Minister of Foreign Affairs met

Albright. One purpose of the minister's visit was to make 
preparations for the next meeting between the Prime Minister and 
the President of the United States.

	Could the minister report on the discussions he had with his 
American counterpart concerning the Helms-Burton law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr.

reached agreement on numerous matters involving co-operation, 
such as on Haiti, the expansion of NATO, and other issues.
<P>
	But we certainly had an opportunity to express once again our 
opposition to the Helms-Burton law and we will continue to lobby 
against this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
months now, the government has talked, expressed its point of view 
and taken various steps, but it has done little of a concrete nature.
<P>
	I will address my supplementary to the Minister for International 
Trade. Late last week, in order to comply with the U.S. anti-Cuban

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

Wal-Mart, it is being looked at by justice officials. We expect that 
Canadian companies will abide by Canadian law. That was the 
intention of our amendments under the Foreign Extraterritorial 
Measures Act.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, hospital closures 
are hanging like an albatross around the Liberal government's 
neck.
<P>
	I would like to go into health minister's backyard real close. In 
Nova Scotia over the past year hospital bed closures have totalled 
25 per cent. It is interesting to note that waiting lists in the province 
of Nova Scotia in the same period have climbed 25 per cent. They 
are longer.
<P>
	Will the health minister simply stand up and admit that his 
government's policies of cutting health care transfers by 40 per 
cent are directly responsible for the increasing waiting lists in his 
home province?
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as many reputable organizations have said with regard to health 
care spending, no less than the National Forum, Canada has the 
second most expensive system of the OECD countries.
<P>
	The hon. member, in his selective memory with reference to the 
facts, forgets to inform the House that under this government and 
this Minister of Finance in this fiscal year alone we are providing to 
the provinces in terms of equalization payments in excess of $8.6 
billion. In addition, the interest reductions we have been able to do 
on our fiscal side provide an additional $1.6 billion for the 
provinces.
<P>
	The issue is not one of funding. The issue in provinces across the 
country has to do with the management of the health care system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the second 
time we have heard it is just a management problem that is at heart 
here.
<P>
	What did the Liberals do with the money that should be going to 
the hospitals? The first thing is the health minister tried to divert 
funds in his own province. The second thing he has done is he gave 
$33,000 to the Cape Breton Yacht Association.
<P>
	Reform would simply take those funds and put them into the 
hospitals, which is quite a contrast, I should think.
<P>
	Will the health minister simply stand and admit that his 
government policies are responsible for longer waiting lines in his 
own province?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what an interesting day it is. The hon. member on October 17, 1995 
said: ``Medicare is bad for everyone''. On November 23 he 
changed his mind. He said that medicare was important to all 
Canadians. Then in March 1996 the very distinguished, the 
eloquent, the very colourful leader of that party said: ``There is 
going to have to be continued reductions in social transfers''.
<P>
	I know the Bloc Quebecois is huffing and puffing, but I did not 
think the Reform Party would be puffing and huffing too.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Secretary of State for the Federal Office of

<P>
	For over a year now, the federal government has refused to 
renew the framework agreement on regional economic 
development with Quebec. In the meantime, sectoral agreements 
have expired, and the regions of Quebec are now suffering as a 
result.
<P>
	Is the federal government prepared now to show its good 
intentions and conclude agreements on regional development with 
Quebec, as it did recently in ratifying agreements with New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
predecessor at the Federal Office of Regional Development wrote 
on two or three occasions to the Government of Quebec precisely 
to conclude a harmonization agreement on intervention in regional 
development in the province.
<P>
	Unfortunately, at the time, the two or three attempts were 
declined by the Government of Quebec, which was not interested in 
reaching a harmonization agreement. This was in the period before 
the referendum, and the provincial government certainly did not 
want to show that the federal system worked well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8655"> 8655 </A></B>
<P>
	What we did then was to set up a new program under which 
the Federal Office of Regional Development intervenes where it 
can do the most within its areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	We are now prepared to go ahead and discuss harmonization 
with the Province of Quebec, even if harmonization is a fact, 
because we were farsighted and wanted to look after the public's 
interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not know if that is profitable federalism, effective federalism, but 
when the Liberals formed the government in 1993, nearly two 
thirds of the money spent by the federal government in Quebec on 
regional development passed through the economic and regional 
development agreement. Today, three years later, it is less than a 
third. The federal government prefers to operate directly, over the 
heads of Quebec and the regions.
<P>
	Is the Secretary of State prepared to put a stop immediately to his 
circuitous strategies and to negotiate in good faith with Quebec in 
the best interest of the regions of Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as regards 
the investment of money in regional development, the funds 
invested in Quebec compare favourably with those invested in all 
the other regions of Canada.
<P>
	What upsets the members of the opposition is that, because they 
refused a year and a half ago to sign a harmonization agreement 
with the Government of Canada, we set up a regional development 
structure, which suits the public and meets their needs. There are 
13 regional offices within the federal office, and there are 55 
community futures development corporations. Why are they so 
upset that we have understood and that the public is now beginning 
to understand? Because even if the Government of Quebec is not 
interested in it, the process of harmonization is being carried out by 
the organizations themselves locally. That is what profitable 
federalism is all about.

``ordre public, section 1709(2) and article 27(2) of the WTO code.

	Can the minister tell us if there are any public interest exceptions 
permitted under these or any articles of the NAFTA and the WTO

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our reading of section 1709(2) of the NAFTA 
and the WTO intellectual property clauses is that there are very 
limited provisions in terms of changing our present laws in any 
respect. It covers very urgent types of circumstances and does not 
allow for us to return to the pre-1993 compulsory licensing 
provisions.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Vehicle emissions are a major source of air pollution. Canadians 
do not want to put their lives into danger every time they leave the 
house. What has been done to ensure that in future Canadians will 
breathe more safely, and has the minister been able to secure the 
co-operation of the provinces in this effort?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me thank my hon. friend and colleague for raising that 
question.
<P>
	The number one culprit, when we speak of air pollution in our 
cities, is caused by car emissions. That is why the government has 
announced, starting with next year's car models, that the standard 
emissions in Canada will be the tightest anywhere in the world.
<P>
	Along with the new generation of car emission standards, we 
need to usher in a new generation of cleaner fuels. That is why the 
government has moved boldly on MMT, on benzene and on 
sulphur.
<P>
	When the cars hit the road, that is provincial jurisdiction. Older 
cars pollute 10 times more than new cars. That is why the province 
of Ontario, for instance, should stop paying lip service to this issue 
and begin to walk the talk by putting an inspection and 
maintenance program for cars in place so that all of us can breathe 
a sigh of relief.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yesterday, the hon, member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie raised the question of privilege. He has 
been notified that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8659"> 8659 </A></B>
<P>
shall be getting, if not a response, at least an explanation or a brief 
speech  explaining what occurred. I therefore give the floor to our 
friend, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Bloc House leader, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, rose on a question of privilege. I would 
like to reply to some of the points he raised, as they referred to a 
document he tabled in the House yesterday.
<P>
	In the course of his intervention the hon. member referred to an 
advertisement in a Quebec newspaper and said that it was similar to 
the GST advertising in 1989. By analogy he claimed that it was 
inappropriate, just as the advertising was in 1989, because it 
implied that specific legislation was in place, that it referred to 
specific provisions it purported were already law when the bill still 
was not passed. That was the reference the hon. member gave the 
House when he raised his question of privilege.
<P>
	While I acknowledge the precedent exists, the matter before us 
today is in clear and stark contrast because the advertisement now 
in question does not refer to any provisions of any law or any 
proposed law.
<P>
	The advertisements that were placed in the Canadian media 
present a number of facts about conditions that relate to the use of 
tobacco. The advertisements do not claim that the provisions of any 
bill are already enacted. Mr. Speaker, on careful reflection of both 
the English and the French versions you will see that is the case. 
The French version of the advertisements call on the readers to 
support la loi anti-tabac. In English it refers to anti-tobacco 
legislation. If one wanted to be an absolute purist one might argue 
that the French Translation ought to say ``le projet de loi'' and in 
English it ought to say ``bill''.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	However, one must bear in mind that we are dealing with 
advertisements. It is common in such cases to use colloquialisms 
that may not, in the strictest sense, be precise. To the layman, 
however, the meaning is very clear. In French one frequently hears 
the phrase ``le projet de loi'' referred to merely as ``la loi'' even 
though it has not yet passed, just as in English one often refers to a 
bill as legislation, even though in the strict sense of the word it is 
not legislation until enacted.
<P>
	There is very substantial proof that these advertisements do not 
in any way represent Bill C-71, which is still before the House, as 
having been enacted.
<P>
	Clause 1 of the bill gives us some very important information on 
this matter of privilege. Clause 1 of the bill gives it a short title, 
namely the tobacco law, or in French la loi sur le tabac. The 
advertisements refer to  anti-tobacco legislation, la loi anti-tabac, 
which is not the short title, the long title or in fact any title of the 
bill before the House.
<P>
	In conclusion, the advertisements do not in any way interfere 
with the ability of the House to consider the legislation before it. 
They do not refer to the number or the title of any bill before the 
House and they do not describe the provisions of any bill before the 
House. They describe a reprehensible public problem and urge 
citizens to support unspecified legislation to deal with these 
problems. This does not in any way impair the ability of the House 
to do its duty. Respectfully, I would submit, it is not a breach of 
privilege. It does not encroach on the privileges of the members of 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to speak in support of the question of privilege raised by the hon. 
member for Laurier-Saint Marie. There is certainly a violation 
here that should be noted.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to take you back to a decision and 
comments made by Mr. Speaker Fraser in this assembly with 
regard to the debate on the GST, the goods and services tax, and a 
debate that went on at that time. As I understand it, prior to the 
passing of the GST legislation, the government of the day put 
advertisements in the paper to the effect that the legislation had 
been passed by Parliament and was the law of the country. 
Certainly on that basis that was a violation.
<P>
	The advertisement we have before us today does that again. It 
says: ``I support the anti-tobacco law,'' which is not on the books as 
of this moment in time. Again, that is the same violation which was 
noted by the hon. member, the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I would like to refresh your mind, Mr. Speaker, of comments 
made by the hon. member who is now the House leader for the 
government, Mr. Herb Gray, who said at that time with regard-
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to refrain from using 
names. The title of the minister is enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
recognize that. I was making an attempt to be clear in my definition 
of which House leader I was referring to and I understand the ruling 
as such.
<P>
	The then House leader of the opposition party is now the House 
leader of the Liberal Party which is in government. Referencing the 
GST advertisement of the day he said that in effect there would be a 
new tax on January 1, 1991. The advertisement was intended to 
convey the idea that Parliament had acted on it because that was the 
ordinary understanding of Canadians about how a tax like this one 
was finally adopted and put into effect. That being the case, it was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8660"> 8660 </A></B>
<P>
clearly a contempt of  Parliament because it amounted to a 
misrepresentation of the role of the House.
<P>
	Speaker Fraser of the day said the following with regard to those 
comments and the advertisement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This advertisement may not be a contempt of this House in the narrow confines of 
a procedural definition, but it is in my opinion ill-conceived and it does a great 
disservice to the great traditions of this place. If we do not preserve these great 
traditions, our freedoms are at peril and our conventions become a mockery of 
modern and responsible members on both sides of the House. That ad is 
objectionable and should never be repeated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was said clearly to members who are now sitting in the 
House and were present for Speaker Fraser's comments at that 
time.
<P>
	It has happened again. It is unacceptable. It has been a violation 
of privilege and I recommend, Mr. Speaker, that you rule 
accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
here during that time. Those ads were very different from what 
appeared in publications yesterday.
<P>
	In the substance of the ad there is nothing that says the 
legislation is passed or that it would become effective on a certain 
date. It does not refer to the result or the consequences of the 
legislation as the GST ads did.
<P>
	There is no point even considering the content of these ads 
compared to the GST ads that caused the ruling by Speaker Fraser, 
which was a good ruling and one I supported.
<P>
	In terms of this question of privilege I see nothing in the ads that 
violates the privilege of any member vis-à-vis the piece of 
legislation which was before the House yesterday and will be back 
in the not too distant future.
<P>
	I simply leave for your consideration, Mr. Speaker, that in 
comparing the two issues you find there is no question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Health makes a very persuasive argument about the 
devastating impact of cigarette smoking. I noticed an ad in a 
newspaper today entitled ``Let's Sponsor the Health of Our Kid'' 
which went on to state a number of facts.
<P>
	It said that in Canada each year 256,000 young people start 
smoking on average at age 14. Half of these young people will 
smoke all their lives. One in every five deaths is caused by 
smoking. Smoking related diseases cost the Canadian health care 
system $3.5 billion. As many as three million Canadians alive 
today will die from tobacco related causes.
<P>
	If that in fact is the case, if that is the impact of cigarette 
smoking in Canada and if the minister is being sincere, surely 
cigarettes ought to be banned. The importation and sale of 
cigarettes should be illegal.
<P>
	The ad goes on to ask the reader to support anti-tobacco 
legislation. That is misleading. Bill C-71 is  not anti-tobacco. It 
does not ban or prohibit the importation and sale of cigarettes, 
cigars or any other form of tobacco.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	If the government and the Minister of Health were making this 
case in terms of the devastating impact of cigarette smoking, if one 
in every five deaths is caused by smoking and smoking related 
diseases cost the Canadian health care system $3.5 billion, to be 
consistent they have a legal and moral responsibility to ban 
tobacco. By simply banning advertising on sport cars and at 
cultural events is not good enough.
<P>
	The Minister of Health is either sincere or, as he said earlier 
today, he should go all the way as opposed to huffing and puffing.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are getting more into debate. I would like you 
to speak to the particular question of privilege.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to me 
the matter is fairly simple. In the question of privilege which we 
raised, we did not accuse government representatives responsible 
for placing this advertising message of any malicious intent. We 
are not saying that they were trying to make any false 
representations, not in the least.
<P>
	Today, instead of just admitting the mistake, the parliamentary 
secretary is trying to argue that a document can be referred to as 
both a bill and an act.
<P>
	If it is true that the same document can be called both an act and 
a bill, in future the two expressions could be used interchangeably 
all the time, and we will never know where we stand. No one is 
saying that the government had wrong intentions, we are saying 
that the government made a mistake. Please acknowledge your 
mistake and make the necessary apologies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will hear one more intervention on this question 
of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I refute the 
arguments put forth by the government whip who suggests the 
matter is not that relevant. He would lead us to think that the vote in 
the House was assumed by the government. If we ever find that the 
government of day can assume the outcome of a vote in the House, 
democracy in this country is in extreme peril.
<P>
	I draw attention to page 4460 of <I>Debates</I> when the Speaker ruled 
regarding the GST issue on October 9, 1989. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under these conditions, the Chair feels it must exercise extreme caution against 
unduly restricting the authority of the House to deal with a perceived contempt, 
especially given the arguments which have been presented.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="8661"> 8661 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I must confess that I have certain doubts regarding this case. Normally in cases of 
doubt, it has been the practice for Speakers to allow an appropriate motion to go 
forward for a decision of the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to consider in your ruling the 
fact that democracy is assumed by the government and to allow this 
motion to go forward.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This question of privilege was raised yesterday by 
the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie. Today I received 
opinions from eminent colleagues in the House, opinions which I 
am sure you will give me some time to consider.
<P>
	I do not know at this point if I have the documents in English and 
in French. I saw the hon. parliamentary secretary referring to a 
document in English. I would ask him to table it so that I can see it.
<P>
	I will take all the representations of today including the 
precedence of my predecessor, Mr. Speaker Frazer, a very highly 
regarded Speaker of the House, and other Speakers who have ruled 
on matters such as these. As we know, no two matters are virtually 
always alike. It is for that reason I will take my time in making a 
decision. I will get back to the House if it is necessary.

	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to table the eighth report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance.
<P>
	It deals with Bill C-70 which does two things. It makes a number 
of changes, clarifications and amendments to the GST. Much more 
important, it is the first step in creating a national harmonized sales 
tax replacing all 10 existing sales taxes with one. This is a first step 
in that direction.
<P>
	I thank the many witnesses who appeared before us and made 
presentations. I thank members of all three parties, including the 
member of Beaver River who is giving me all her attention right 
now, who worked in an assiduous and constructive way with us. I 
thank, as  always, the staff of the House of Commons who again

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. During his 
submissions the hon. member said that this report represented the 
beginning of a harmonized GST across the country.
<P>
	That is a misstatement of fact, given that several provinces have

tax with the GST.

dissenting opinion.
<P>
	I would like to add that the Bloc Quebecois supports the concept 
of harmonizing sales taxes, but cannot support the Liberal 
government's wasting everybody's time and energy with a 
half-baked and unfair scheme.
<P>
	In the current state of affairs, there is no proof that Bill C-70 
simplifies and improves things. On the contrary, as regards the 
rules governing the display of prices, consumers may find an item 
bearing four different prices in a catalogue or on a retailer's 
shelves.
<P>
	Bill C-70 will considerably complicate the lives of individuals 
and businesses. So the big questions remained unanswered, 
because the Liberals are putting their electoral interests before the 
interests of the taxpayers. We also think that the government 
should redo its homework and go over Bill C-70.

	The intent of the bill is to amend section 24 of the Immigration 
Act, which would allow a person seeking to come into and remain 
permanently in Canada to be deemed a permanent resident if he or 
she lived in Canada for 25 years or more prior to 1970 before 
leaving Canada.

	This amendment would address the concerns of many Canadians 
who have reallocated outside Canada for a period of time and are 
now faced with having to reapply for permanent resident status 
with of course the appropriate security checks. This has resulted in 
numerous bureaucratic delays and in many cases the process can be 
quite cumbersome.

private member's bill which will amend the Criminal Code to 
provide for the arrest of those in breach of condition of parole or 
statutory or temporary release.
<P>
	I must acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the 
Abbotsford city police, particularly Constable Mike Novakowski 
who provided the incentive and foresight to put this bill in force. 
Because of police officers like Mike Novakowski throughout 
Canada we will eventually have safer streets in our community.
<P>
	This enactment makes a breach of a condition of parole or 
statutory or temporary release an indictable or summary condition 
offence, as is the case for breach of a probation order.
<P>
	Paragraph 495.(1)(a) of the Criminal Code allows a peace officer 
to arrest a person who has committed an indictable offence or 
whom he finds committing a criminal offence. Therefore this 
amendment enables a peace officer to arrest a person who is in 
breach of a condition of parole or release.
<P>
	The amendment to section 497 provides for such a person to be 
held to give the board that granted the parole or release, if the board 
considers it advisable, an opportunity to apply to keep the person in 
custody until it is able to issue a warrant of apprehension to 
facilitate a review of the parole or release under the Corrections

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for requiring Canadians to pay over 70 
per cent more in CPP premiums, thus increasing payroll taxes that are a cancer on 
job creation, while refusing to eliminate the huge subsidy that those same Canadians 
must pay to maintain the gold-plated MP pension plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on this motion which 
pertains to the government's 70 per cent hike in CPP premiums. I 
will begin with a brief review of the Liberal-Tory record on the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	The plan was established in 1966 under the Liberal government 
of Lester B. Pearson. The plan was originally established as a pay 
as you go plan. It has been described critically by Bill Robson of 
the C.D. Howe Institute as a pyramid type scheme in which income 
for early investors is provided not from investment in real assets 
but from the capital of later investors.
<P>
	During its 31 years of existence the CPP has never been 
administered by anyone other than Liberal and Tory 
administrations. Over the years various observers have pointed out 
that the CPP was headed for trouble and that it would require a 
significant increase in contributions to deliver the benefits 
promised, particularly to the aging baby boom generation.
<P>
	Successive governments ignored this problem and the situation 
was allowed to deteriorate to the point where drastic action was 
required. On February 14, four days before the federal budget was 
brought down, the finance minister therefore announced that 
Canada pension plan premiums would be increased from 5.8 per 
cent of earnings to 9.9 per cent of earnings over six years, a 
whopping 73 per cent increase in payroll taxes, the greatest single 
increase in payroll taxes in the history of the country.
<P>
	He also announced that despite the increase in premiums there 
would be no increase in benefits. Thus the average worker will end 
up paying a total of $1,635  per year matched by another $1,635 
from the employer. Self-employed people will pay both shares just 
to receive a pension of less than $9,000 per year, in 1997 dollars.
<P>
	What was most conspicuous about the government's 
announcement was what it did not contain. First, there was no 
acknowledgement of the mismanagement by both Liberal and Tory 
administrations which allowed the CPP to get into this situation in 
the first place. As has been pointed out, if the CPP had been a 
private plan and had been mismanaged in this way, its managers 
would now be making licence plates in some penitentiary.
<P>
	Second, there is no honest assessment of the negative impacts of 
the 70 per cent hike in payroll taxes, in particular the negative 
impacts on jobs, even though the finance minister on previous 
occasions has acknowledged that payroll taxes are a cancer on jobs.
<P>
	Third, there is no serious assessment of alternative approaches to 
securing retirement income for Canadians at a lower cost such as 
those proposed by the Reform Party of Canada. What the 
government has neglected to do, my colleagues and I now propose 
to do in this debate, starting with an assessment of the negative job 
impact of a 70 per cent increase in CPP premiums. We want the 
finance minister to frankly admit, first of all, that the 70 per cent 
hike in CPP premiums is a payroll tax hike and to table in the 
House his department's assessment of how many jobs this payroll 
tax hike will kill so that we can propose counter measures.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In his presentation to the finance committee on October 17, 
1994, the finance minister clearly referred to CPP and QPP 
contributions as payroll taxes and acknowledged their negative 
impact on jobs. But now that he has had to increase them, the 
finance minister is living in denial and says exactly the opposite. 
He now says that CPP premiums are not a payroll tax.
<P>
	The finance minister refuses to acknowledge, for example, the 
position of the Minister of Industry, who ought to know about such 
things, and who said in the House as far back as 1991: ``When you 
look at the burden of payroll taxes on small firms you have to 
include, of course, the Canada pension plan employer 
contributions. The combination of all these payroll taxes imposes 
an onerous burden, especially on small and medium sized 
businesses''.
<P>
	Perhaps most importantly, the finance minister is flatly 
contradicting the published views of the forecasting division of his 
department. I refer to a paper by Mr. Joe Italiano of that division 
published on April 25, 1995, entitled ``Growth in CPP and QPP 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8665"> 8665 </A></B>
<P>
contributions: Implications for employment and participation''. In 
that paper Mr. Italiano clearly defines compulsory CPP and QPP 
contributions as payroll taxes. He also studied the employment 
impact of the Tory increases in these payroll  taxes from 1986 to 
1993 and showed how they had killed 26,000 jobs.
<P>
	We therefore call on the finance minister to frankly and honestly 
admit that the 70 per cent hike in CPP premiums is a payroll tax 
hike of unprecedented proportions and to table in the House his 
department's assessments, and we know that they run these 
assessments, of how many jobs this payroll tax hike will kill so that 
we can propose counter measures.
<P>
	In criticizing the government's ill-conceived approach to 
rescuing CPP, Reformers are not saying that nothing should be 
done, far from it. But what we propose in our fresh start platform is 
a more comprehensive reform than what the government proposes.
<P>
	Our fresh start proposals to secure retirement income for 
Canadians are a combination of Canada pension plan reform, of 
expanding the RRSP system and of providing tax relief for lower 
and middle income seniors. Our proposals-we will argue this 
during the election campaign-deliver more retirement income per 
dollar invested than anything that the government has proposed to 
date.
<P>
	I hope that MPs will ask me about this superior alternative in our 
question and answer time because it is worth the House 
considering.
<P>
	Finally, I want to conclude with some observations on the 
government's moral authority to lead pension reform. To gain the 
trust of Canadian seniors, Canadian youth and the aging baby 
boomers, the government must be seen to be acting fairly and 
ethically on the issue of pension reform.
<P>
	The Liberal government abandoned its responsibility to act 
fairly and ethically on this issue when it adopted, as its first pension 
reform priority, not the improvement of CPP, not the improvement 
of pensions for the Canadian people, but when it adopted as its first 
and highest pension priority the provision of the gold plated 
pensions for its own MPs and other MPs willing to receive them.
<P>
	What does the average Canadian worker get at age 65 after 
contributing to CPP at 9.9 per cent of earnings? A lousy $9,000 a 
year. But what do Liberal, Tory, NDP and Bloc MPs get who 
accepted the gold plated MP pension plan at age 55? If they live to 
age 75, pension benefits amounting to: for the Conservative 
member for Sherbrooke, $4.3 million; for the Liberal member for 
Cape Breton-East Richmond, $3.9 million; and the NDP member 
for Winnipeg Transcona, $2.7 million. And the list goes on and on.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	When it comes to issues of integrity, a moral authority to lead, 
we have observed that the government has a blind spot and perhaps 
a fatal blind spot.
<P>
	On February 5 I asked both the Prime Minister in the House and 
later in the day his ethics counsellor in  committee whether they did 
not see an ethical dimension, an integrity dimension, issues of right 
and wrong with respect to the political interference with the 
Somalia inquiry, the stonewalling of the Krever inquiry, the use of 
the justice department to go on a political witch hunt and the Prime 
Minister's broken GST promise.
<P>
	The Prime Minister professed not to understand what I was 
talking about but the answer of his ethics counsellor was more 
revealing. I was asking about ethical matters, matters of public 
trust and integrity and right and wrong. On February 5, 1997 at the 
Special Joint Committee on A Code of Conduct he said: ``I think 
you are speaking about policy questions, questions in which there 
is a difference between opposition parties and that of the 
government. It is the essence of our democratic system. I do not 
believe I can go and take your question''-questions about the 
ethics of those situations-``any further than that''.
<P>
	In other words, political interference and cover-up in the 
investigation of a murder, stonewalling an inquiry into tainted 
blood from which Canadians died, misuse of the powers of the 
justice department, breaking a key campaign promise and denying 
you broke it-I would add to that list giving yourself a gold plated 
pension while giving Canadians tin plated pensions-by the ethics 
of the Prime Minister and his ethics counsellor are simply 
differences of opinion on policy matters, not matters of trust or 
integrity or right and wrong.
<P>
	If these are the ethical standards of the government, I believe it 
will never be trusted by Canadians to bring fairness and integrity to 
the pension issue. By its own actions and blindness it has forfeited 
that right to others.
<P>
	To conclude, I am reminded of a study on integrity and 19th 
century British politics by the historian D.C. Somervell. He 
focused his study on two British statesmen, William Gladstone, the 
moralist who if he did not see right and wrong in an issue was 
uninterested in it, and Benjamin Disraeli, the pragmatist at the 
other end of the scale who never saw right or wrong in any issue, 
only differences of opinion.
<P>
	What was Somervell's conclusion? He concluded that while it is 
an error to discover moral issues where none are in fact at stake, it 
is a greater error to be blind to them when moral issues really arise.
<P>
	When the government put the old age security of MPs ahead of 
the old age security of Canadians, it committed that greater error, 
which is why I urge hon. members to support the motion before the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
worthwhile noting that while given 20 minutes to speak on this 
subject matter, the member for Calgary Southwest devoted barely 
half of his speech to the subject matter on the Order Paper which 
reads in part: ``This House condemn the government for requiring 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8666"> 8666 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians  to pay over 70 per cent more in CPP premiums-,'' and 
so on.
<P>
	It is a fully misleading statement. The fact that the hon. member 
would devote half of his time speaking about tainted blood, misuse 
of justice, integrity of government, ethical standards rather than 
addressing the subject matter of the Canada pension plan 
demonstrates how thin and how poorly researched his subject and 
his speech are by the people who prepared it for him.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	Obviously the member from Calgary does not know his subject 
and the people who prepared his speech for him today ran out of 
steam in dealing with it, so much so that he had to fill up the time 
available to him with other subjects which are not contemplated in 
the motion.
<P>
	The member from Calgary is trying to mislead Canadians by 
convincing them that there is a 70 per cent hike in the Canada 
pension plan contributions. I would like to ask the member for 
Calgary Southwest whether he would use his ability to go through 
the proposal that has been approved by the 10 provinces and the 
Government of Canada and verify for himself that the 70 per cent 
figure is totally wrong. The reality is that the increase for the 
employee goes from 2.9 per cent of pensionable earnings in this 
year to 3.5 per cent in 1999 and gradually to 4.9 per cent by the year 
2003.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer the hon. member's 
points by making three of my own. First, in not using all the time 
allocated to me, I am of the belief that if you want to practice 
economy in government it starts with economy of speech.
<P>
	Second, I found the member's comments interesting because 
they illustrate the last point I was trying to make. The member 
obviously sees no connection between getting the moral authority 
from people to reform pensions and the fact that the government 
lost that moral authority when it gave its party the MP pension. The 
very fact that the member sees no connection between that issue 
and the MP pension precisely illustrates the blind spot of the 
government.
<P>
	With respect to his substantive point, Reform has gone through 
the proposals that the minister and the provinces agreed to with 
respect to the reform of CPP. It is our conviction that the CPP 
cannot be fixed simply by working on it. We have to look more 
broadly at all the contributing factors to retirement income. That is 
why our proposal includes the following elements which I will take 
just a couple of minutes to explain.
<P>
	First, a guarantee that existing seniors, every Canadian aged 60 
and above, will receive all the benefits promised to them by CPP.
<P>
	Second, a proposal to shift younger Canadians on to an expanded 
RRSP system, mandatory, tax sheltered retirement savings 
accounts like RRSPs and these deliver,  of course, greater pension 
benefits per dollar invested than anything that has ever been 
proposed for CPP.
<P>
	Third, for older workers not young enough to accumulate an 
adequate retirement income by expanded RRSPs alone, we propose 
a transition combination of CPP and expanded RRSPs to ensure 
pension benefits at least on a par with CPP if not better.
<P>
	Finally, through our fresh start tax relief proposals, we propose 
to lift 1.2 million Canadians, including 300,000 seniors, off the 
federal income tax rolls altogether, thus improving their retirement 
income.
<P>
	If one takes the collection of those things, the modified CPP, the 
expanded RRSPs and the tax relief afforded to seniors, our 
argument is that the package delivers greater retirement income per 
dollar than anything we have seen from the finance minister or 
from the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, hopefully I will be brief and the leader of the Reform 
Party will be brief in his answer.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to the presentation this afternoon. My 
understanding is, along with some other things, he wants to expand 
the RRSP system.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I would like to pose a question to the leader of the Reform Party 
stemming from his presentation this afternoon. Does he realize and 
is he considering in his Reform program, the fresh start program, 
that the CPP which came into being in 1966 actually has several 
aspects? It includes not only the retirement benefit plan but a 
disability option, a death benefit, and a benefit for spouses and 
children in the unfortunate or untimely death of the contributor. 
Are these not important aspects to the Reform Party?
<P>
	I note with regard to his comments that in comparison the 
members' pension program was changed a year and a half ago. 
There are three important aspects of that program. The minimum 
retirement age was reduced to age 55 or increased to age 55. There 
had never been an age limit before. The reduction in benefits of 
over 20 per cent saved over $3 million in one year alone. It also 
eliminated double dipping which is something the Reform Party 
could check its members on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear these 
members defend the MP pension plan. I invite the hon. member to 
join me in any place in the country. We will round up 1,000 people. 
The hon. member can defend the MP pension plan and I will argue 
against it. At the end of the day I do not think there will be much 
question about where the Canadian public stands.
<P>
	With respect to the member's substantive question at the 
beginning, when I say we propose to guarantee the CPP benefits to 
the existing generation of seniors and make provisions for others, 
we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8667"> 8667 </A></B>
<P>
intend to guarantee the  entire range of benefits. We are not just 
speaking about retirement income.
<P>
	With respect to survivor benefits, under this expanded RRSP 
program we propose a substantial improvement over CPP. We 
propose to improve the retirement incomes of surviving spouses, 
particularly elderly widows, by proposing that 100 per cent of the 
funds of a deceased individual's RRSP would be transferable to a 
surviving spouse tax free. Nobody would have to go hat in hand. 
That is a far superior survivor benefit to that offered by CPP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I 
point out to my hon. friend across the way in terms of members' 
pensions that 400 of the 600 living ex-members of the House get no 
pension whatsoever.
<P>
	Second, I have a young constituent who was permanently 
disabled at the age of about 31. If it was not for the CPP disability 
clause he would have nothing. He has no family. He has no other 
means of support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat. We made clear that we are 
continuing to support the benefits of the CPP program to the 
existing generation of seniors. Therefore the member is going 
down the wrong path by implying that we will cut that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. In his intervention the member for 
Davenport on two or three occasions used the word mislead with 
reference to the Reform Party and to the Leader of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	At citation 49 of Beauchesne's that is considered 
unparliamentary language. I wonder why, Mr. Speaker, you 
allowed him to use that phrase not once but repeatedly.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The point was not raised at the time. 
There did not appear to be an uproar in the House. As I am sure 
hon. members realize, unless there is an uproar in the House almost 
immediately no word as such becomes unparliamentary, except the 
one word we all know.
<P>
	If the hon. member wishes, I will look at the blues and come 
back if necessary. The normal test is that people get very excited 
when such a word is used. I hate to tell the member that is the case.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to reply to and passionately oppose the 
Reform motion before the House.
<P>
	The motion clearly stakes out the opposition position that it 
interprets the changes to the Canada pension plan as business 
bashing and fiscal foolishness. That position is based on partisan 
politics, not fact or logic.
<P>
	Let me be blunt. We had to make some tough decisions about the 
CPP. The changes are not painless or pleasant, but that happens 
when we try to fix something that should have been reformed years 
ago, in fact decades ago. These changes are not based on decisions 
made in isolation and imposed without consultation.
<P>
	One of the many realities ignored by the opposition motion is 
that these are reforms agreed upon by the federal government and 
eight provinces representing the significant majority of Canadians. 
These are reforms based on a year long process of public 
consultation and intense discussion and negotiation between the 
two levels of government. Most of all, these are changes to the CPP 
with an overriding and concrete goal: to preserve and secure one of 
the key pillars of our national pension system.
<P>
	The third party can play games with phoney mathematics and 
hidden agendas, but the federal and provincial governments had to 
address a real problem and find a workable solution. That is what 
we have done, to the benefit of Canadians today and for generations 
to come.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the Canada pension plan affects all 
working Canadians and their families. It is the compulsory 
earnings based plan that forms one pillar of Canada's public 
pension system. The proposed changes are a strong and balanced 
package of reforms that will ensure the Canada pension plan is 
there for Canadians today and in the future. There for Canadians 
means not just for workers when they retire but equally to help 
Canadian workers and their families should they become disabled 
or die.
<P>
	This is something the third party ignores in its public proposals. 
The fact is that about 30 per cent of CPP benefits go to disabled 
persons and for survivors' benefits, but for the Reform Party these 
Canadians do not seem to exist.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why I find the assumptions underlying today's motion by 
the Reform Party so disgraceful. These assumptions shamelessly 
dismiss contributions paid by workers and their employers as little 
more than common payroll taxes. They completely ignore the real 
issue, which is that CPP contributions guarantee every Canadian 
worker a pension. In this sense, CPP contributions constitute an 
investment, ensuring workers a secure retirement and adequate 
benefits both for disabled workers and families of deceased 
contributors.
<P>
	CPP contributions will not swell the government's coffers and 
the government cannot use this money for its expenditures. On the 
contrary, contributions go into a separate fund used to pay pension, 
disability and survivor benefits. Under the proposed amendments 
to the Canada Pension Plan, money collected in future will be 
invested so as to obtain a greater return for contributors. Not only  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8668"> 8668 </A></B>
<P>
will Canadians get back all the money they contributed but, in 
addition, they will see increases in their pensions and other 
benefits.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	These are not just empty words. Allow me to remind the House 
that the tax system treats CPP contributions as pension benefits. In 
the calculation of income tax payable, contributions qualify as tax 
credits for workers and tax deductions for employers.
<P>
	Unlike the situation that arises when taxes are increased, 
increases in CPP contributions result in decreased tax revenue and 
a tangible drop in government revenue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today's motion prefers to ignore these facts. It is the type of 
self-serving argument and attitude that prefers to drive wedges 
between Canadians, between generations, between regions, rather 
than build for a fair and shared future. It is a motion that suggests 
we are imposing harsh hikes in CPP contributions and that ignores 
the much heavier increases that would otherwise have had to take 
place. It does so because it is a motion that ignores the very real 
problems we have had to address with the CPP.
<P>
	The plan's chief actuary reported that the plan was simply not 
financially sustainable under the current contribution schedule. 
This is why firm, forward looking action had to be taken. The only 
fair way to deal with the problems facing the CPP is to increase 
contributions now so that Canadians can begin to pay enough to 
cover the costs of their own pensions plus a fair and uniform 
portion of the unfunded liability that has built up over the past 30 
years.
<P>
	There is no mystery about the problem. Basically the costs of 
CPP benefits have grown faster than originally expected when the 
plan was first instituted in 1966 and will escalate dramatically 
when the baby boom generation reaches age 65 around 2011.
<P>
	I remind the House that under the existing legislation, as a matter 
of statute, contribution rates were already scheduled to rise to more 
than 10.1 per cent in 2016. In other words they were to virtually 
double. Even then the chief actuary of the plan has shown that 
without changes the CPP fund would still run out of money in less 
than 20 years. Without additional changes, contribution rates 
would have to increase from that 10.1 per cent to over 14 per cent 
of pensionable earnings to cover escalating costs.
<P>
	It is essential to recognize that by acting now to fix the CPP we 
are limiting contribution rates to a maximum of 9.9 per cent. Then 
they can be frozen and remain steady thereafter while providing the 
same benefits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The increase in CPP contribution rates that we announced is not 
the first in a series of increases. I  repeat, the contribution rate of 
9.9 per cent to be borne equally by workers and employers is a 
maximum that should never be exceeded. The rates will not 
increase again. This increase is lower than the 10.1 per cent already 
projected under the existing legislation, and is well below the 14.2 
per cent that would have been required if we had not acted now.
<P>
	It is true that the contribution rate in 2003 will be about 40 per 
cent higher than the rate foreseen under the existing legislation, 
but, at the same time, thanks to the amendments we are proposing, 
the contribution rate in 2030 will be much lower than projected. It 
will in fact be approximately 30 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	This means that future generations, our children and 
grandchildren, will not be weighed down by an incredible financial 
burden. It also means that people in their middle years whose 
contributions had been less than the amount required to pay future 
benefits will now pay contributions that are more equitable in that 
respect. Younger Canadian workers and young people entering the 
labour force will pay contributions that are not as high as 
previously planned. Also in the interests of fairness.
<P>
	What about present CPP beneficiaries? Why are these people not 
affected? There is no doubt that many are drawing pensions that are 
far more generous than they would be on the basis of the 
contributions they paid. That is true, but it is not their fault. If 
anyone is to blame, it is the plan itself which was not adjusted in 
the past as it should have been, because previous governments did 
not have the political will to make these decisions.
<P>
	That is why our proposal is accompanied by measures to make 
the Canada pension plan more accountable and provides for more 
frequent review. Furthermore, any new initiatives under the plan 
must have full financing before they can go ahead. However, it 
would not be fair to make our seniors, who made their retirement 
plans of the basis on the existing plan, pay their costs retroactively. 
We signed a contract with our seniors and for the sake of fairness, 
we must honour that contract.
<P>
	As you can see, the proposed changes to the Canada pension plan 
are not an affront to business or the taxpayer. They do not involve 
an additional tax or some new trick in our tax system. In fact, these 
are prudent and basic measures that are entirely in line with our 
record for sound management of public moneys and reflect our 
commitment to be fair in every respect.
<P>
	If we had failed to make the difficult decisions that were 
necessary, younger generations would have had to pay twice as 
much as they will now, without receiving a penny more in benefits. 
This would have been neither fair nor affordable, and indeed it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8669"> 8669 </A></B>
<P>
would have been excessively costly. To put such a burden on future  
contributors would, in all probability, have led to the collapse of 
the plan. We could not afford to let this happen.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Acting now will ensure the Canada pension plan is on a secure 
and stable financial footing for the foreseeable future. As I said 
before, the CPP changes were not decided in isolation. They reflect 
a truly national consensus based on public consultations and a 
decision making process that involved the provinces as full 
partners.
<P>
	Believe me, no government at any level likes to ask its people to 
pay more for the same services. But it is a price many Canadians 
have told governments they are willing to pay in order to preserve 
the plan they believe in and want to be able to depend on. They told 
us so during the public consultations which were held in every 
province and territory last spring as part of the federal-provincial 
review of the plan. Canadians clearly said that they valued the CPP. 
They told us they wanted it fixed, not scrapped.
<P>
	During the review, we and the provinces examined a number of 
options and heard opinions from both ends of the spectrum. We 
considered many alternatives, but narrowed our choices to those 
which would ensure that no one's benefits were jeopardized; not 
those of today's beneficiaries, nor those of future generations. We 
listened when Canadians everywhere said the Canada pension plan 
is important to them. They want it preserved, and preserved in a 
way that does not pass on an unfair burden to younger generations. 
It is worth remembering that the debate currently taking place is 
not about choosing to increase contribution rates. It is about 
choosing to preserve the Canada pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Canadians asked their governments to make the CPP sustainable 
by strengthening its financing, improving the funds' investment 
practices and reducing costs. The changes proposed do exactly that.
<P>
	Before concluding, let me briefly talk of another element of 
today's motion, an example of the political game playing that 
demonstrates the desperation of the third party. Reform members 
have attempted to create a link between the proposed Canada 
pension plan changes and the current pension arrangements for 
MPs. This is not just a comparison of apples and oranges. It is more 
in the realm of sour grapes.
<P>
	I need not remind you, Mr. Speaker, that many Canadians belong 
to a pension plan, not only members of Parliament. For any pension 
plan member, pension income represents deferred compensation 
and thus an earned benefit. We must also remember that the terms 
of the MP's plan were designed to take into account an MP's 
unpredictable career pattern-as I think most Reform members 
will see within the next few  months-lack of job security and the 
fact that many members take a substantial salary cut in undertaking 
parliamentary service. The MP's pension plan, like other employer 
sponsored pension plans, provides a pension arrangement for a 
targeted plan member population and therefore is adapted to their 
needs.
<P>
	For the record, MP's pension contributions are higher than the 
norm for employer sponsored pension plans and are significantly 
higher than the contributions required under the Canada pension 
plan. I should also note that under the MP's plan members of the 
House of Commons contribute 9 per cent of all salaries. By 
comparison, in 1997, employee contributions under the CPP will 
be equal to 3 per cent of pensionable earnings. This rate is 
projected to increase to 4.45 per cent over the next six years.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the House that in July 1995 and in the 
context of a freeze on parliamentary salaries, the government 
amended the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. 
Under the new arrangements age 55 has become the minimum 
pensionable age. As well, benefits for MPs in respect of service on 
or after July 13, 1995 have been reduced by 20 per cent. Also, the 
practice of double dipping has been curtailed within the federal 
public sector, which is the only sector over which the federal 
government has jurisdiction.
<P>
	These changes went beyond the government's red book 
commitment to reform MP's pensions and have significantly 
reduced the related costs to taxpayers. In fact, savings over the past 
year have been in excess of $3 million. Also, as with any pension 
plan, the MP's plan is regularly examined with a view to balancing 
the needs of retiring MPs and the related costs.
<P>
	The real issue, of course, is not a comparison between the CPP 
and the MP's plan. This is just electoral grandstanding. What 
today's motion tries to dismiss and discredit is the very real and 
historic reforms that the provincial and federal governments are 
bringing to the national workers' pension plan, reforms that will 
affect many millions of Canadians today and in years to come. By 
our work, these Canadians can plan for their retirement in greater 
security without having to wonder if the CPP will be there for 
them. It will because we have acted. This is the type of action that 
sustains our great country and that Canadians expect and demand 
of a government committed to their future.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I am proud of what we have done and confident that the vast 
majority of Canadians see it as the major achievement it is, one 
firmly and fully committed to their best interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with great respect, as far as the comments of the President 
of the Treasury Board regarding the MP pension plan and its equity 
vis-à-vis other Canadians'  pension plans are concerned, Canadians 
know full well that members of Parliament through their pension 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8670"> 8670 </A></B>
<P>
plan got the gold mine and Canadians got the shaft. Of that there is 
no doubt. People know it and they know it for what it is.
<P>
	In his comments the President of the Treasury Board pointed out 
that the provinces went along with the changes to the Canada 
pension plan. They went along with it obviously because they have 
been partners in this rip-off of Canadians for 30 years.
<P>
	What the President of the Treasury Board did not say was that 
one of the features of this renewed Canada pension plan at 9.9 per 
cent of earnings is that the provinces will have the privilege of 
rolling over their debt for another 20 years. Therefore, this plan is 
not going to start getting better right away. They are going to 
postpone making it healthy or healthier for another 20 years.
<P>
	My question relates to the equity of the CPP. The President of the 
Treasury Board indicated during his comments that Canadians need 
to be fair in sharing the future. It is incumbent on the President of 
the Treasury Board, in representing the Liberal Party of Canada, 
which has been in power for at least 20 of the 30 odd years that this 
plan has been in force, to account for the mismanagement of the 
plan that got us into this mess in the first place.
<P>
	Actuaries and demographers did not just wake up overnight. The 
plan was flawed right from the beginning, but the Liberals did not 
have the strength to keep their hands off the honey pot. What 
politician does? The changes to this plan have not made it safe 
from the honey pot.
<P>
	Based on the average industrial wage of $36,000, if a young 
Canadian were to place 3 per cent of earnings over the lifespan of 
their work into an investment vehicle that has a return of a typical 
average over the last 40 years, would that Canadian have more 
money from a 3 per cent investment than they would for their 
almost 10 per cent investment in the Canada pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to underline that the 
important and real question being discussed is the reforms that 
have been made to the Canada pension plan. I understand that the 
third party, knowing that it has no real arguments about the reforms 
made and that it should instead congratulate us, has come to the 
conclusion that it should try some other subject in order to try and 
get some interest generated.
<P>
	It is clear now that after days and days of the third party trying to 
find fault with the reforms to the CPP, public opinion is saying that 
the reforms are necessary. They are saying that the reforms 
introduced by the government are excellent and taken in 
co-operation and partnership with eight of the provinces and a large 
majority of the Canadian population. They fit the bill,  remove the 
imperfections and now ensure that all Canadians will have access 
to a proper pension plan that is now properly funded. That is what 
is important.
<P>
	However, we also have to take into consideration that some of 
the colleagues of the hon. gentleman have proposed other plans for 
MPs. One of these is to double the salaries of MPs. What is the best 
route to follow?
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad I 
am in the House today. This gentleman keeps referring to salary 
and I was speaking about compensation when we were debated the 
bill in the first place.
<P>
	I think a member of Parliament deserves proper compensation, 
but it should be above board where it is visible, taxable and clear. 
When I threw a number out as to what an MP should receive it 
included taking care of all travel expenses.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Yes, it did. Go back and look at the speech.
<P>
	It included a suggestion that MPs look after their own pensions, 
which is no better than the private sector. Five per cent of that 
money should go into a pension if they choose to and five per cent 
matched by the government. It should be no better than the private 
sector. That is the pension portion of my compensation package for 
MPs. The Liberals can twist and bend all they want. If it is a choice 
it would be an investment.
<P>
	The finance minister and this minister argue that the CPP 
increase to 10 per cent is an investment. If it is compulsory by the 
government it is a tax. If the rate is set by the government it is a tax. 
In opposition they called it a payroll tax. Now they are calling it an 
investment.
<P>
	The government is very hypocritical. I question its logic on 
raising the CPP. There are concerns with the CPP. People are 
worried that money will not be there for them, but the logic is that 
the fund is $39 billion now. The deficit annually is about $1 billion 
and could go to $2 billion in any given year so the premium has to 
be raised.
<P>
	Why did they overreact? Why did they not just raise the 
premium to 7 per cent? At the same time, because payroll taxes 
cost jobs, why did they not lower the unemployment insurance 
premium from the high lofty numbers? That fund has a fat $5 
billion sitting in it which is soon to grow to $10 billion. They 
should lower the unemployment insurance premium, raise this 
other one if it is in jeopardy and keep the same two-year fund that is 
required instead of increasing it to five.
<P>
	They have overreacted. They have increased the taxes too much. 
It is too great a burden on the economy to increase the taxes by that 
much. By not reducing the unemployment fund which they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8671"> 8671 </A></B>
<P>
using to lower the  deficit they will actually kill jobs. Their strategy 
of creating jobs is sadly lacking.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for my hon. 
colleague, who has just mentioned certain facts that unfortunately 
do not correspond to reality. I would like to remind him what he 
said in April 1995 during the debate on Bill C-85. He said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We should get fair compensation, fair remuneration. It is at the 
senior executive level. Pay us $150,000 a year and we will look 
after our own pensions.
<P>
	Not all Reform MPs opted out of their pensions, notwithstanding 
what they said. We have excluded double dipping. I must say a 
number of Reform MPs from Kootenay West, 
Nanaimo-Cowichan, Saanich-Gulf Islands and Lethbridge-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Are they double dippers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> They are collecting pensions while collecting their 
salaries as MPs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Never.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> I am shocked. I cannot believe that people who are 
arguing against double dipping which we have removed from the 
act are still unfortunately continuing these practices.
<P>
	I understand why the Reform Party opts out of MPs pensions. It 
is because they have no chance of ever collecting.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When there are members from another 
party wishing to question a member the Speaker normally goes to 
the other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to bring the President of the Treasury Board 
back to the fiduciary responsibility of the government to handle 
citizen's money in the best possible manner. I draw his attention the 
Quebec pension plan, the disability payments and the way in which 
the Quebec pension plan has been administered vis-à-vis the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	Would the minister advise the House and Canadians generally 
why under the Quebec pension plan for disability take-up between 
1986 and 1994 there was a 2 per cent increase while at the same 
time in the Canada pension plan there was a 92 per cent increase?
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Would the minister also tell the House why in 1976 when there 
were 55,000 people involved in the Canada pension plan 1,219 
people came off disability, but in 1995 with 300,000 people on 
disability only 2,000 people came off disability? Is this the 
minister's indication of sound management?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately a practice the third party 
uses is to try to confuse people with figures and with questions 
unrelated to the main subject.
<P>
	What is really important is that we have made a reform that 
Canadians want. We have made it with the support of eight 
provinces representing the vast majority of Canadians. We have 
made it after public consultations that permitted all Canadians to 
express their points of view. We have finally reformed the Canada 
pension plan. We have made sure that young people like those who 
are in the gallery will be able to collect these pensions when the 
time comes.
<P>
	That is what good government is about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before discussing the pertinence of the Reform Party 
motion, it might be worthwhile to point out that the Canada 
Pension Plan does not apply in Quebec, which has a parallel plan, 
the Régime des rentes du Québec. It compares very favourably 
with the Canada Pension Plan. Moreover, the current 
recommendations by the federal government take into account the 
way the Quebec plan has been administered, and the way it ought to 
be administered in future.
<P>
	The Reform Party motion makes what seems to be a rather 
demagogic association between the Canada Pension Plan and the 
MP pension plan. If we must debate the matter of the MPs' 
pensions, fine, but these are two very different matters. What needs 
to be done in connection with the Canada Pension Plan is to assess 
whether the recommendations made by the government that are to 
be implemented are indeed necessary, pertinent and essential.
<P>
	This pension plan has not been modified for some years, and 
today it differs greatly from what it was like initially. For one thing, 
the modifications to the plan must reflect our changing 
demographics.
<P>
	Care must also be taken to ensure equity in the way the pension 
fund operates. At the moment, the plan covers the entire baby 
boom generation, those between 35 and 50 years old, like myself, 
and if nothing is done to change the plan, they will benefit from a 
far better plan than the one they have contributed to. Corrections 
are necessary. The people who are between 35 and 50 and who will 
be retiring in 10, 15 or 20 years will have to have contributed 
enough and we have to ensure, through increased contributions, 
that this is indeed the case.
<P>
	On the other hand, an aspect of the government's position should 
perhaps be corrected and it will be perhaps at the stage bills are 
considered. We could have contemplated a significant reduction in 
unemployment insurance premiums and permitted a quicker short 
term increase in Canada pension plan contributions. As the result, 
today's young people would not have to bear the burden of the need 
to refloat the plan for so long.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8672"> 8672 </A></B>
<P>
	Any reduction in unemployment insurance premiums would 
allow for an equivalent increase in Canada pension plan 
contributions. This approach would not create a negative impact 
on the total payroll or on payroll taxes, which can, as we know, 
have an effect on jobs. This morning, I read that a study by the 
Department of Finance estimates the cost at 26,000 jobs. There 
is a whole question of balance and common sense involved here. 
Demagoguery must be avoided.
<P>
	Such a pension plan must provide for intergenerational 
continuity, that is, over time, as people contribute, each generation 
must pay its fair share to avoid having the younger generation 
paying excessively for the older one.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	As you know, it is now much harder than in the past to join the 
labour force, to find a steady and well paid job. A number of 
considerations must be taken into account and, in my opinion, one 
way to make the system more equitable and to ensure that every 
age group contributes its fair share would have been to make up, in 
part or in whole, for the increase in CPP contributions by 
significantly reducing UI premiums.
<P>
	We must also determine whether the rate of return of this fund, 
the Canada Pension Plan, is adequate. The government's proposal 
seems to be a step in the right direction, because it is patterned on 
the model developed in Quebec, where the fund is invested in 
options involving various degrees of risk, making for an diversified 
portfolio and an attractive rate of return.
<P>
	By contrast, the Canada Pension Plan has been used to provide 
financial assistance to the provinces, which may be a good thing, 
but the plan's rate of return is totally unsatisfactory and partly 
explains why we currently have an inadequate reserve and why 
contributions must now be increased.
<P>
	With a better rate of return, like that of the Régie des rentes du 
Québec, the increase in contributions might have been lower, 
although the demographics would still have had to be taken into 
account. So, one cannot say that, from that perspective, the 
government did something that was inadequate or inappropriate.
<P>
	The Régie des rentes du Québec is an example which shows that, 
when Quebecers have control over their money, their investments 
and the management of their finances, they can do as well, if not 
better, than anyone else in Canada, North America or the world.
<P>
	Quebec's expertise is such that several of the amendments being 
proposed by the federal government are already implemented in the 
Quebec plan, or are the result of suggestions made during the 
consultations with Quebec regarding its Régime des rentes.
<P>
	It must be remembered that, in the 1960s, the Government of 
Quebec, which was then headed by Jean  Lesage, had a certain 
expertise in economics. Experts like Jacques Parizeau and Bernard 
Landry were there at the time to advise the government. All these 
people helped develop a system whereby Quebec was able to 
accumulate a fairly large amount of money and, more importantly, 
a system Quebecers can now be proud of, in spite of a few minor 
flaws. With this system, a number of Quebecers start receiving a 
pension at a time when they are not yet eligible for an old age 
pension, so that Quebecers in general, at the exception of women at 
home unfortunately, receive directly a decent pension.
<P>
	Quebec does have a reason to be proud. This is one system that 
can be held up as a model, and it is not the only one. The Caisse de 
dépôt et de placement, which manages these pension funds, and the 
Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs are other examples of various 
economic initiatives taken by Quebec that enable us to manage our 
money in a reasonable fashion.
<P>
	These remarks are an indication that, were the Reform motion 
votable, the Bloc Quebecois would be voting against it. It says in 
part ``that this House condemn the government for requiring 
Canadians to pay over 70 percent more in CPP premiums''. Let us 
look at the reasons for this increase. Can we afford to ignore the 
problem and not to bail out this program, if this means the program 
will run out of money 10, 15 or 20 years from now?
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I think this would be one way to go for Canadians affected by the 
plan because, as I mentioned at the start of my speech, Quebec is 
not covered by the CPP. It has its own plan, the Quebec pension 
plan. I think that, if the amount in the CPP dropped and was not 
replenished, Canadians would think that their government had 
acted irresponsibly and for this reason the measures tabled must be 
considered.
<P>
	When people say it increases the impact on payroll taxes, and I 
mentioned this earlier, yes, it is true that it will have an effect. Care 
must be taken to ensure that this effect is minimal. My proposal to 
decrease UI premiums by a corresponding amount is perhaps 
something that could be considered and included as an amendment 
to the initial government proposal, so that the negative effects of 
the plan on employment could be kept to a minimum.
<P>
	Comparing it to the MPs' pension plan begins to sound more like 
grandstanding, in my view. There is not necessarily any connection 
between the two. I think the CPP has to be looked at separately and 
care taken to ensure that it is an effective plan. In this regard, there 
are a number of points to consider.
<P>
	Let us look, for example, at the proposed measures. They say 
that none of those now in receipt of survivors' and disability 
benefits or both, nor those aged 65 and older as of December 31, 
1997 will be affected by the  proposed changes. This is to protect 
the elderly. Is it being done with an eye to the upcoming federal 
election? The government may have had this in mind, but at least it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8673"> 8673 </A></B>
<P>
ensures some security for seniors and does not change the plan to 
which they contributed. I think this is acceptable.
<P>
	In addition, they say that all CPP benefits will continue to be 
fully indexed to inflation. This is good news, because the federal 
government is following in the steps of the Quebec pension plan. 
The same is true for age of retirement. Whether it is the usual age, 
earlier or later, things will remain unchanged. Here again, they 
have followed the lead of the Quebec pension plan.
<P>
	There is another similarity with Quebec. The fund now consists 
of two years of benefits owing. They want to increase this to a 
reserve of five years. That seems reasonable to us. Contribution or 
premium levels will also rise over the next six years, to 9.9 per cent 
in 2003, after which they will remain stable. This insures the 
viability of the plan. Certainly, it is never a big thrill to have to pay 
into a plan, but when people see the advantages it can have for them 
in future, in Quebec at any rate, this is something on which there is 
going to be a consensus, I believe, and something which people are 
quite prepared to live with.
<P>
	There is, however, one aspect that is bad news and ought to be 
looked at by the government. It ought to try to find a new approach 
to this aspect, which is the new way of calculating to be applied to 
the combined pensions of people receiving both disability and 
survivor's benefits, or retirement and survivor's benefits. This is 
very bad news indeed, and I invite the government to examine it 
closely. This situation here is more or less the same as with the 
American pensions at the moment.
<P>
	I will give you the example of a lady who receives a survivor's 
benefit because her husband is deceased. She becomes disabled, 
and is eligible for disability benefits. Under the present plan, this 
lady receives two full benefits, which is understandable, since a 
person who is experiencing such difficult circumstances does not 
deserve to have them made more difficult economically. Yet the 
new rules will place a ceiling on the amount this person can 
receive. That could mean receiving benefits of $800 a month, 
instead of $1,200.
<P>
	I think this is a point on which we ought to do battle, in order to 
ensure that such an unfair situation is not created by the bill. It is 
unfair to penalize people who are victims of such misfortune in this 
way. If a person has lost his or her spouse, and then becomes 
disabled as well, I believe that he or she is entitled to a minimum of 
financial security, and cutting that person's income is not the way 
to go, in our view.
<P>
	We are also told that eligibility for disability benefits will 
require greater participation in the work force. The person will 
need to have contributed for four of the six years preceding 
application for benefits.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec the plan is a little more generous: its requirements are 
for two of the last three years or five of the last ten. I think we will 
have to wait and see what the witnesses who appear before the 
finance committee will have to say about the consequences of this 
measure. It would seem to eliminate a number of contributors who 
will get nothing in return for what they paid. We must look into 
this.
<P>
	For instance, someone who paid contributions for three years of 
the last six before his application for benefits is not eligible, which 
means he paid contributions but is not eligible for the plan's 
benefits. I think that is intolerable, and the same applies to the 
employment insurance reform the Liberals introduced.
<P>
	This reform means that people who regularly pay their 
employment insurance premiums, especially those entering the 
labour market who have worked less than 910 hours, these people, 
after paying 600, 700 or 800 hours worth of employment insurance 
premiums will not be eligible for employment insurance.
<P>
	This is intolerable, and I think that as far as the Canada pension 
plan is concerned, the government would do well to avoid making 
the same mistake.
<P>
	A good thing about the Canada pension plan is the fact that 
Canadians will receive an annual statement of their Canada pension 
plan account. I think this is a way to make people responsible. They 
can see how much money they put in, they can plan for their 
retirement and ask how much they will get in benefits, how many 
years they still have to contribute and what impact this will have on 
their budget. I think this kind of specific information will be very 
useful to the various users of the plan.
<P>
	It seems there will also be a federal-provincial review every 
three years instead of every five. This is a good thing. In fact, the 
Quebec government agrees. It means we will be able to keep a 
close watch on how the plan evolves and make adjustments as 
problems arise.
<P>
	What we learn from the history of these funds-the Quebec 
pension plan and the Canada pension plan-over the past 20 years, 
is that from year to year, from one government to the next, there 
has been a tendency to postpone any decision making. Today, we 
are forced to accept a major increase in premiums. If there had 
been the same obligation in the past to review the plan every three 
years, we might have had a chance to make adjustments more 
regularly and it might not have been necessary to make such drastic 
changes. I think it would be useful to be able to operate this way.
<P>
	The Reform Party's motion may have its merits as an attention 
getter, but it should be examined in greater detail. This is not about 
minor details. We are talking about some very important issues, 
about a pension plan that has existed for many years and will have a 
future for many more decades, about important decisions, and to  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8674"> 8674 </A></B>
<P>
associate this directly with the way members of Parliament are 
treated smacks of grandstanding, in my opinion.
<P>
	We need to turn a critical eye on the Canada pension plan. 
Among other things, we must ensure that performance is improved 
and that, if performance is improved and if the funds created 
perform well, the plan contributors benefit.
<P>
	In this regard, even though the minister assured us earlier that 
this plan accrued separately, we cannot have a surplus of billions 
and billions of dollars accumulating as in the unemployment 
insurance fund. We will end up with $12 billion, $18 billion or $20 
billion in an insurance plan where people contribute and employers 
and employees have no control over the surplus. What happens to 
the surplus? Will premiums be reduced?
<P>
	The same thing must not happen in this plan, if its economic 
situation is improved.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Canadian retirement income system has three 
pillars: the Canada pension plan, the old age security and the 
guaranteed income supplement. We have no strong reason for 
opposing the proposed reform, on the contrary, except for the 
points I mentioned earlier, including the benefits for persons on 
disability and survivors. It must complement the other pillars, like 
the guaranteed income supplement and the tax incentives for 
retirement savings.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	A person earning $100,000 and paying into an RRSP will save 
$313 in federal tax, whereas a person earning $30,000 will receive 
$175, which we do not consider much of an incentive. We proposed 
a standard tax credit of $268.
<P>
	In conclusion, the motion is not votable, but we do not think it is 
acceptable as it stands. If there had been a vote, the Bloc would 
have voted against the motion, because it lacks the sense of 
responsibility needed in the development of a plan like the Canada 
pension plan.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like the opinion of the member. He twigged something for 
me when he made a statement about ensuring that various groups 
do their fair share in contributing to a plan.
<P>
	I read one statistic in the <I>Financial Post</I> which indicated that 
today's pensioners are receiving $8 benefit for every $1 they put 
into the plan. Clearly this raises questions about what is fair and for 
whom. I will leave that very simple question and ask the member if 
he could put it in the context of his speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, with a pension plan such as the one 
before us, in order to see if it is fair we must  consider two main 
criteria, one of which is fairness, based on the type of people who 
benefit from that plan, because all kinds of situations must be 
anticipated. Some people will receive their pension benefit simply 
because they have reached pensionable age, while others will 
receive benefits because they are in a particular situation, including 
people with disabilities and surviving spouses.
<P>
	For example, when one member of a couple dies and the 
surviving member keeps the house, the costs involved are the same 
as before, even though there is only one occupant. So, there is an 
issue of fairness that must be taken into account, based on the 
social values of a country such as Canada, in Quebec or any other 
province.
<P>
	The other criterion regarding the fairness in the rate of return is 
whether or not the plan grew adequately. If people contributed to 
the plan, but the government did not manage to get optimum 
benefits from such contributions, it will not be in a position to pay 
an adequate amount. This is why sending statements to each 
contributor to the plan, so they know what is going on, and 
receiving progress reports on efficiency and profitability are part of 
the assessment process of the rate of return. The $1 to $8 ratio does 
not automatically mean the gain is satisfactory.
<P>
	It may be that better management of the plan would have 
resulted in $10 being paid to the member, instead of $8. Or was $8 
the maximum achievable? We must look at these factors.
<P>
	Fairness and efficiency are definitely the two criteria that must 
be taken into account when determining whether the plan is 
satisfactory.
<P>
	A major consideration for 1997, and for future years, is the issue 
of intergenerational fairness, of fairness of treatment between 
young people and older people. This issue involves many aspects. I 
discussed it with the hon. member for Témiscamingue, who is 
lucky enough to be part of the first group, the young people. He 
told me that, as things stand, a 25 year-old person will have to 
contribute during all his productive years at a rather high rate. That 
person will always pay a rather significant amount. However, if the 
government had reduced UI premium rates, while rapidly 
increasing contributions to the Canada pension plan, people who 
currently contribute to the plan, but who are 40, 45, 50 or 55 years 
old, would have shouldered a greater burden, because they would 
have contributed more than young people.
<P>
	So, these considerations must be looked into. We must not forget 
that those who already receive benefits under the plan will not be 
adversely affected. They are entitled to the plan, and this is fine. 
However, we could do more for young people.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am always touched by the irony when members of the 
Bloc stand up in the House of Commons and defend the right to 
take a pension from Canada, ``but by the way we want to take the 
province of Quebec out of Canada''. It may escape members of the 
Bloc but I assure you, Mr. Speaker, it does not escape the people 
where I come from.
<P>
	The point I want to make to my colleague from the Bloc is that in 
order to have the moral authority to ask other Canadians to tighten 
their belts, we as Members of Parliament must first tighten ours. 
We are asking Canadians to pay twice as much for less. Yet we 
think it is quite all right for us to go along merrily as we have in the 
past.
<P>
	My question relates to the different vision that we have of 
Canada. This does not make one right or another one wrong. It is 
just different; the collective nature of Quebec and the fact that 
Canada pension plan premium increases have not struck a resonant 
chord in Quebec. I would ask my colleague to think about the 45 
per cent of Canadian businesses, as reported by the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Businesses, that say payroll taxes are a 
major disincentive to hiring. Unemployment, particularly among 
young people, in Quebec is a disaster. What affect will this payroll 
tax increase have on employment in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say I have no problem with 
members of the Bloc Quebecois receiving a pension from Canada, 
because I was elected by the people, by 54 per cent of the voters in 
my riding. They voted for me thinking that sending me here was 
the best way to have a voice in the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	As far as I know, Quebec is a part of Canada and I have an 
employer in Canada. The plan does allow members who wish to do 
so to opt out of the plan. This is an optional plan. Therefore, I do 
not think this should be challenged.
<P>
	My first allegiance is to those who elected me, who chose to be 
represented by a member of the Bloc Quebecois. The fact that 53 or 
54 of us were elected to this place seems to indicate that things are 
not all going well in Canada. I think that it will be up to the people 
to tell us, in the next election, whether they are still happy with the 
job we are doing here. Everything is out in the open, and they will 
decide accordingly.
<P>
	To answer the second part of the question, about unemployment, 
I would like to point out to the hon. member that, in my remarks, I 
suggested that UI premiums could be reduced very quickly and this 
reduction compensated in whole or in part by an increase  in CPP 
premiums. In Quebec, choices will have to be made in that regard 
and there is a need to be able to assess the actual impact of such a 
measure, whether it will be 1 per cent, 2 per cent or 3 per cent.
<P>
	In both Quebec and Canada, one thing is sure: when people grow 
older, they want to know that they will have a decent pension and 
so will the younger generations. Younger people too want to be able 
to count on getting a pension. A balance will be struck through 
appropriate consultation. More work remains to be done, and I do 
not think it would be appropriate, at this time, to condemn the 
proposed changes. Close scrutiny is required to ensure the plan is 
the best it can be, so that 15 or 20 years down the road, we can look 
back and say that the governments acted responsibly on this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Before turning the floor over to the 
member for Edmonton Southwest, it is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are: the hon. member for 
South Shore, the economy of Atlantic Canada; the hon. member for 
St-Boniface, the CBC; the hon. member for Lambton-Middlesex, 
the Pest Management Regulatory Agency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a particularly important debate for all Canadians, 
particularly younger Canadians. During the course of the debate, I 
hope I will be able to make five points. The first point would be 
that the Canada pension plan, even as it has been restructured, 
which admittedly is better than it was, is a poor investment for all 
contributors but it is particularly poor for younger Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to make the point that payroll taxes are, in the 
words of the current Minister of Finance, a cancer on job creation. 
They are a cancer on job creation to the most vulnerable people in 
our society, the last hired and the first fired. It is a cumulative effect 
of payroll taxes. I do not care what name we use to disguise it, if it 
is a contribution or a mandatory payroll deduction it is a tax and it 
is a cancer on job creation. It is something that we, as members of 
Parliament in this legislature and all legislatures across the country, 
have to mitigate. It is our responsibility.
<P>
	I would also like to make the point that the plan continues to be 
irresponsible. It continues to be a pay as you go plan. It is a defined 
benefit plan that defines the benefit that contributors will receive 
but the benefit does not have a direct relationship to the amount 
that is paid into it.
<P>
	I would also like to make the point that unless the contributions 
to the Canada pension plan receive a substantially higher return, 
and in view of the changes to  pension planning for all seniors 
brought about by the change to the seniors benefit, the change to 
OAS and GIS, old age security and the guaranteed annual income 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8676"> 8676 </A></B>
<P>
supplement, which will now be the seniors benefit, virtually 
everyone will see half of their Canada pension plan taxed back.
<P>
	In the year 2001 when the seniors benefit takes effect all single 
seniors in our country turning age 65 will receive $11,420 per year 
tax free. However, any additional income, including pension 
income and the Canada pension plan, will be taxed back at 50 per 
cent. That means that unless pension income over the working life 
of the taxpayer generates a much better return on investment, it is 
going to be virtually totally taxed back anyway.
<P>
	The last point I want to make is there is a direct relationship 
between the pension plan for members of Parliament and the 
Canada pension plan and the increases to the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	I thought long and hard before I opted out of the MP pension 
plan. It is a very lucrative pension plan. My being here is going to 
cost me and my family down the road. However, I thought we as 
members of Parliament were in a particularly difficult time. We all 
knew it and everybody in the country knew it. It was only way that 
we could have the moral authority to say to Canadians that it is 
necessary for all of us, every single Canadian, young and old, to 
make a sacrifice because we must leave our country in better shape 
for our grandchildren than we found it.
<P>
	The only way that we could have the moral authority to do that 
would be to be the first people to take a hit. We had to demonstrate 
that we were not going to ask people to do as we say. We were 
going to demonstrate that we would ask people to do what we have 
done and to show leadership. That is what this is all about. It is not 
a question of being holier than thou and wearing a hair shirt. It is a 
question of having the moral authority to ask Canadians to tighten 
their belts because we have a responsibility in our generation to 
leave our country in better shape for our grandchildren than we 
found it.
<P>
	When our children and grandchildren have the opportunity to 
pay a Canada pension plan tax of 10 per cent of their income, they 
will at the same time, as we all know, also have the opportunity to 
pay taxes to support a $600 billion national debt.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	This is the legacy that we leave our children and our 
grandchildren. We leave an unfunded tax liability on the Canada 
pension plan of $600 billion, and the very generations of Canadians 
that put that responsibility on the shoulders of their children and 
grandchildren are also leaving future generations of Canadians 
with a $600 billion debt.
<P>
	Unemployment in our country is at historic high levels. We have 
had the highest sustained levels of unemployment since the 
depression. At the same time we are greatly increasing payroll 
taxes. Payroll taxes, by every objective standard and by every 
commentator, are acknowledged to be killers of jobs and 
employment.
<P>
	If we were to collapse the Canada pension plan today, current 
and future taxpayers would still have to pay approximately $600 
billion in accrued pension benefits which we are liable for that have 
not yet been paid. That unfunded liability is equivalent to our $600 
billion national debt. It is something that parliamentarians for the 
past 30 years have been very uncomfortable in addressing. Instead, 
we have increased the contribution rate to build up a fund over five 
years instead of two, while maintaining a pay as you go dimension 
to the plan. Pay as you go means that each succeeding generation 
will pay the benefits of the generation which preceded it.
<P>
	Somewhere down the line, at some time, someone is going to 
have to make good on these pension promises.
<P>
	We overlook the fact that in Canada, if the pension plan were to 
collapse tomorrow, annual premiums would still be required to pay 
for the $600 billion of accrued benefits. When we view a proposed 
6 per cent premium in 1997, 6.4 per cent in 1998, 7 per cent in 1999 
and 9.9 per cent in 2003, we should be aware that the promise that 
premiums will be frozen at 9.9 per cent must be considered suspect. 
After all, if full funding of the benefits of a completely collapsed 
plan would cost 8 per cent or 7 per cent annually, how can 9.9 per 
cent be viewed as stable when the unfunded liabilities will continue 
to increase?
<P>
	During question period over the last couple of weeks I have put 
that question directly to cabinet ministers. Of course the question 
has not been answered. I have asked cabinet ministers when the 
CPP premiums hit 9.9 per cent, will the government guarantee that 
there will be no further increases in pension plan premiums or 
decreases in benefits. The reason that question was not answered is 
they cannot answer it. They have no idea. I suspect, however, that 
we will see that happen.
<P>
	When the plan started in the mid-sixties the contribution rate 
was 3.5 per cent. Then it went to 5.65 per cent and it will go to 9.9 
per cent. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that rates will 
continue to increase.
<P>
	Also at issue is the timing of the increase. Is our economy 
sufficiently healthy that employers will be able to pay the increased 
premium of $1,300 and continue to increase employment? At the 
same time, the employment insurance fund has a great surplus. 
This is the link between the payroll taxes of employment insurance 
and the Canada pension plan premiums that kept Ontario out of the 
mix for so long.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8677"> 8677 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	I know the government says Ontario came on board because it 
managed to wrestle from the government a 10 cent decrease in 
unemployment insurance premiums for a corresponding $4 
increase in Canada pension plan premiums. I doubt very much 
whether that is a victory people will hear the Ontario government 
crowing about very long.
<P>
	I point out once again that this is being done at a time when one 
in 10 Canadians are unemployed, when many are under employed 
and 17 per cent of young Canadians are unemployed. They are the 
people who will be hurt most.
<P>
	Whether people call the increase in the Canada pension plan 
premiums a tax or a pension contribution, it is still a compulsory 
cost to the employer which raises the cost of creating a job.
<P>
	The government insists that the 9.9 per cent tax is not a tax but 
an investment. Therefore, the government believes it is not 
reasonable to speak of the disastrous effects the Canada pension 
plan rate increase will have on employment. I submit that it is a 
false argument.
<P>
	Unless we, as members of Parliament from all sides, are able to 
look at the problems that face the country honestly, unless we are 
able to deal with things as they are and not as we would wish them 
to be, how can we ever make them right? How can we possibly fool 
ourselves into thinking that a mandatory deduction that must be 
taken and paid by every working Canadian is not a tax?
<P>
	Only two people in the whole country believe it is not a tax. 
Unfortunately, those two people are the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance who has worked so hard at putting the changes 
to this Canada pension plan together, does not believe it is a tax 
either. I hope history will judge him fairly and with considerable 
compassion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> He will need the compassion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> He will need it. Much of the political and 
social disagreement concerning the Canada pension plan could be 
addressed through creating options. This is the area where the 
Liberal government has let us down. The government has the 
responsibility of leadership, not just patching over the cracks.
<P>
	If it took over 30 years to get where we are on this road with the 
Canada pension plan, with the $600 billion deficiency, why in the 
name of heaven would we spend another day going down that road? 
Why would we want to patch over a plan that was flawed right from 
the beginning? People knew it was flawed. Why would we not use 
our best efforts to make this plan work much better for succeeding 
generations? That has to be the  elemental question. Why put a 
band-aid on it? Why not do what needs to be done to fix it 
properly?
<P>
	I mentioned earlier in questions and comments to other speakers 
that the Canada pension plan became a honey pot of money and 
entitlement that politicians found irresistible, rather like flies to 
honey.
<P>
	The disability take up on the Canada pension plan has been 
surprisingly high over recent years. That is not terribly surprising 
because the take up rate on Canada pension plan disability has a 
direct correlation to the job market. When jobs are scarce people do 
what they have to do to survive.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	One of the things that people have done, and that is why the take 
up rate on the disability side of the Canada pension plan is so high, 
has been to use it to provide an alternate source of income. Once 
this availability was established, government cannot turn on a dime 
and tell people it is sorry but the plan is no longer available.
<P>
	Since the auditor general's report identified this as a particularly 
difficult problem for the Canada pension plan, the policing of the 
disability entitlement has been much more severe. As I mentioned 
earlier, over a 10-year period the Canada pension plan had a 92 per 
cent increase compared with the Quebec pension plan which had 
only a 2 per cent increase.
<P>
	The disability community, persons who have long term, 
systemic disability, did not want the Canada pension plan disability 
tampered with because, quite rightly, it said that it has problems 
enough protecting itself from the ravages of the cuts to the Canada 
health and social transfer. To the credit of the government, the 
report on persons with disabilities by the member from Fredericton 
addresses some of the concerns very well.
<P>
	There is a very real difference between Canadians who are in 
systemic, long term disability into which they are born or have 
suffered a tragic accident and people who take up disability 
because it is part of the pension plan privileges. We have combined 
the two. In hearings with persons with disabilities they would 
prefer not to be combined but they do not want to rock the boat 
now.
<P>
	In my view, it is our responsibility to protect persons with 
disabilities. That is part of our common wealth. That is part of our 
responsibility one to another. That is how through our own 
independence our interdependence is strengthened. However, the 
two should not be confused. Insurance is insurance. The Canada 
pension plan is a pension plan. By allowing the Canada pension 
plan to become something that it was never designed to be puts 
increasing stress on its ability to fund what it was supposed to do in 
the first place, which is to be a pension plan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8678"> 8678 </A></B>
<P>
	If, as a society, we need to look at funding persons with 
disabilities, then let us also deal with that honestly.  Let us put it on 
the table and see how it can best be done economically and ensure 
that people who must take up the provisions of disability insurance 
get into and out of the program.
<P>
	That has been duplicated already because every province has a 
workers' compensation board. The provincial and federal 
governments need to work together to ensure that every single 
citizen gets the best return on the common investment. However, 
they should not trickle down responsibilities from one order of 
government to another. Citizens should not have to shop to see 
where they can get support. They should not have to make a 
disability premium payment to an insurance company only to find 
that the insurance company will not pay until after they have been 
able to collect from the federal program.
<P>
	I anticipate some well thought and well founded questions from 
members opposite. I hope that when they ask the questions they 
will keep in mind that this is a particularly poor return on 
investment for young Canadians who must bear the burden of the 
debt that they will inherit also.
<P>
	I would ask members opposite to get their calculators out and tell 
Canadians what return would come on a 40-year investment of 
$1,000 per year at an average rate of return of the equity markets in 
Canada and tell me that is not better than the CPP deal.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Winnipeg North Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to join this debate. I have never 
seen an opposition party so willing to open up its weakest flank by 
declaring a day to debate an idea that does not actually exist. That 
is one of the great travesties in this debate.
<P>
	This is a very serious debate. Members are very concerned about 
it. One of the core issues facing our society is that of economic 
insecurity. The eight provincial governments and the federal 
government have finally answered the question of economic 
security in the Canada pension plan. It is a great achievement. Only 
three political leaders in the country would not join in: the premier 
of Saskatchewan, the premier of British Columbia and the leader of 
the third party. What a group of scoundrels. None of them are 
willing to live up to his responsibilities. What do they have in 
common? Their unwillingness to deal with the arithmetic reality 
that is involved in the reform of the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	People have begged us from the outset to please do something 
about this plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Starting in 1966 they did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Yes. Guess who was the proudest defender of the 
plan? Guess who wrote to the famous John Kroeker, who the 
member brought up in the House of Commons yesterday, to say 
this is the best thing for  Canadians? Ernest Manning wrote a 
private letter to him which said that this plan should be defended by 
Canadians, that this is the best way to protect workers in a modern 
society. It was the father of the member's leader. He should go back 
to his papers to find out where he was in 1965-66. The member 
should do his research and he will understand how this plan works. 
He should start telling Canadians that at 7 per cent, what will 
happen to that $600 billion if we do not have a Canada pension 
plan. What will they do, raise income tax? Will they put their hands 
over their eyes? What will happen to that?
<P>
	Canadians will have money for their Canada pension plan by 
keeping their contributions down to 9.9 per cent, by sharing the 
cost between the employers and the employees. Do Reformers 
mention employer contributions in their superfund? Of course they 
do not. The great travesty in this whole thing is that the workers 
pay the 10 per cent plus they pay 7 per cent for the outstanding 
obligation. For 17 per cent, what do they get? A high risk mutual 
fund run by the Reform Party. Is the member crazy? Is he nuts? I 
would like to hear a response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, allowances must be made for 
the hon. member opposite because he has had this file for the past 
year and surely must be weary of it. You can tell because of the 
cobbled together package he has brought to Canadians.
<P>
	The member opposite makes great political capital of the fact 
that the provincial premiers have joined them. Jesse James and his 
gang have come together to rob taxpayers by foisting this 
despicable, expensive program on the younger generation of 
Canadians. It is a darn good thing the Liberals foisted off the gun 
control first because there is no defence against the Liberals when 
they come charging up and start putting their hands in your 
pockets, you know they will go deep and it will hurt.
<P>
	The government has known for 30 years that the Canada pension 
plan would not work. Circumstances finally forced it to cobble 
together the unholy alliance with the provincial governments to 
continue the funding for another 20 years of moneys at the long 
bond rate, which is what it came to us with. The government 
members should be hanging their heads in well deserved shame.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being5.30 p.m., it is my duty to inform the House that proceedings on the 
motion have expired. The House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should continue and enhance 
its efforts to address the underground economy, which costs Canadians anywhere 
from $23 billion to $156 billion in lost revenue and wages, by working with other 
levels of government, industry and unions in developing a plan of action, which 
includes a national education campaign and increased enforcement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, Reformers came to this place stating 
that they would do things differently, but as we see you have to 
keep order and I thank you for it. When we do go to the trouble of 
making speeches and working hard it is nice to be able to make 
them and for our constituents to hear.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to my Motion No. 243 calling on the 
government to enhance its efforts to combat the underground 
economy. My motion asks that the government consider a plan of 
action which includes a national education campaign and increased 
enforcement.
<P>
	As part of my work as chair of the national Liberal caucus 
committee on economic development I recently chaired a 
subcommittee which studied the issue. I was pleased to have the 
opportunity to work with the hon. member for Brampton, the hon. 
member for Vaudreuil, the hon. member for St. Catharines and the 
hon. member for Lambton-Middlesex who is here and will speak 
later to the motion.
<P>
	We made a number of recommendations to the Minister of 
Finance prior to the 1997 federal budget and we entitled our report 
``Our Future at Risk''. The effects of the underground economy 
truly place our future at risk. What is perceived by some as an 
anti-GST activity is in fact costing every Canadian in lost revenues 
for social programs, deficit reduction and worker benefits.
<P>
	What is attractive to some because of what they perceive as an 
unfair tax system is unfair to the honest tax paying Canadian. The 
underground economy places our social services, our deficit 
reduction efforts and our very future at risk. It is easy therefore to 
complain about taxes and to try to avoid them. Certainly our taxes 
are high. However it is important to remember that taxes support 
health care, education, social services and public pensions.
<P>
	When we participate in the underground economy we are not 
taking money away from government. We are taking services away 
from the sick. We are taking education away from our children. We 
are taking pensions away from our elderly. Revenue Canada  
believes that the causes of the underground economy includes high 
taxation, the perception that government does not spend its money 
and efficiently, the GST, and the perception of unfairness in the 
taxation system.
<P>
	No one really knows how much the underground economy 
actually costs Canadians, although it is estimated somewhere 
between 2.9 per cent and 3.5 per cent of GDP to anywhere around 
10 per cent to 20 per cent of GDP. Whether we accept the low end 
or the high end, government must take a more active role in 
combating the underground economy.
<P>
	One of the most important efforts that can be accomplished 
immediately is education. Canadians are unaware of the actual 
costs of the underground economy. Many do not appreciate that it 
places our future at risk. Certainly no one enjoys paying taxes.
<P>
	However government must work to ensure all the money owed to 
it is collected. We could only imagine the benefit that would be 
accomplished if suddenly the money lost in the underground 
economy were used to pay down the deficit, used to fund hospitals, 
used to support post-secondary education, used for our police and 
used to support our infrastructure. That money rather than the 
irresponsible promise of tax cuts could do what we need to do 
much faster.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Combating the underground economy will ensure tax fairness. 
By offering support to the honest taxpayer it will ensure the 
preservation of our social programs. It will speed the deficit and 
debt reduction demanded by Canadians in Guelph-Wellington 
and in every other part of this great land.
<P>
	A number of federal government departments are actively 
working on the problem. I commend the work currently being 
accomplished by the Department of National Revenue under the 
leadership of the current minister and the former minister, the hon. 
member for Victoria. Eight hundred additional auditors were 
announced in the 1996 federal budget. The work of the department 
has yielded more than $1.7 billion in additional revenue for the 
government since November 1993, revenue that would have been 
lost without these efforts.
<P>
	Human Resources Development Canada has undertaken a study 
and the Department of Finance continues to look for ways to 
protect the integrity of the tax system.
<P>
	One of the most important ways we can combat the underground 
economy is through partnerships. I am fortunate to have in 
Guelph-Wellington a number of concerned individuals and 
groups, especially the building trades that are ready and able to 
work with government and others to help reduce the effects of the 
underground economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8680"> 8680 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government must work with all levels of 
government, industry, labour and others to find new and 
innovative solutions. There are, for example, a number of key 
associations that are directly affected, including the Canadian 
Jewellery Association, the Canadian Dealers Association, the trade 
unions, chambers of commerce, the Canadian Automobile Dealers 
Association, local construction associations and tourist 
associations.
<P>
	To anyone who says that the underground economy does not 
affect individuals, let them speak to people like Joe Maloney and 
Phil Benson of the building and trades department. They know that 
some of their members are unemployed as a direct result of 
underground economic activity. In these cases the underground 
economy hurts us two ways. It takes away legitimate government 
taxes and contributions for the Canada pension plan, workers' 
compensation, income taxes and employment insurance. It also 
places the worker, someone willing and able to work, on 
employment insurance, adding burden to the EI system.
<P>
	There is also the toll that a monetary value can never replace. It 
takes away the dignity of work that the individual feels when he or 
she is contributing to supporting themselves or their families.
<P>
	Every time someone paves a driveway, installs new windows, 
repairs the car or gets their hair cut through the underground 
economy they may very well be taking a job away from a friend, a 
family member or a neighbour, and a job necessary to provide 
support for a family.
<P>
	There is a human face to the underground economy and there are 
no simple solutions to ending the underground economy. No one 
has the answer that would solve this problem. Any effort requires 
teamwork. That is why I am suggesting a Team Canada approach to 
solving the problem.
<P>
	Like my community of Guelph-Wellington we have to work 
together in order to seek solutions and, most important, to find 
answers. In Guelph-Wellington our problems are solved through 
co-operation. Recently, for example, we needed a CT scanner for 
the General Hospital. It was purchased because hundreds of 
Guelph-Wellington residents, supported by the generosity of our 
corporate community, worked together to raise the necessary funds 
for equipment that will save lives.
<P>
	In Guelph-Wellington solutions are found when labour, 
industry, politicians and citizens work together to find them. There 
is no doubt that the underground economy is fuelled by a lack of 
trust for the way that governments spend money. Certainly there 
was some justification in the lack of confidence in the way 
taxpayers' dollars were managed.
<P>
	In the nine years prior to the election of the Liberal government 
Canadians watched Conservative finance ministers make 33 
projections of deficits. We also  watched them be wrong 33 out of 
33 times. Canadians watched the debt nearly triple in those nine 
years. All of that has changed. Confidence has returned. There is 
still much work to do but sanity has returned to the management of 
the federal government treasury. Canadians can be confident that 
their money is being spent on their priorities and that we are no 
longer sacrificing our future by overspending.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	The present finance minister has listened and we are now 
spending within our means. A balanced budget is in sight and the 
debate will soon change from how much is the annual deficit to 
where do we apply the surplus.
<P>
	I ask those who participate in the underground economy because 
of mismanagement to reconsider. We have turned our finances 
around. We have listened. Their money is being spent building the 
greatest country on earth.
<P>
	Combating the underground economy will require building on 
partnerships. Once Canadians realize it is in our best interest-and 
I mean each and every Canadian-to ensure tax fairness we can 
begin to eliminate the problem. Partnerships must include all levels 
of government, industry, labour, community associations and 
individual citizens.
<P>
	The industries most affected such as the building trades are the 
first to want to volunteer for any effort that will be successful in 
reducing not only the underground economy but also 
unemployment and underemployment among their members.
<P>
	Ultimately the underground economy has a human face. It 
causes hardship among hard working, able workers whose jobs are 
taken away because some Canadians choose to avoid paying taxes. 
All honest taxpayers must participate in any effort to end the 
underground economy.
<P>
	As our colleague from Hillsborough, Prince Edward Island, said 
to me in a letter as we were preparing the report of the 
subcommittee on this issue, ``we should not just increase 
enforcement but we should address the underlying causes of the 
underground economic activity''.
<P>
	The underground economy is caused by attitude as much as 
anything else. We all remember when drunk driving was either 
accepted or we chose to close our eyes to the problem. It was a slow 
process to change attitudes. Groups like Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving that has a chapter in Wellington county helped to raise 
awareness to the level where drunk driving is no longer acceptable. 
None of this happened overnight. These efforts took time but we 
are now living in a society where driving drunk is not tolerated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8681"> 8681 </A></B>
<P>
	So it is with the underground economy. Ending the problem will 
not be done overnight. Vigilance must prevail. A long term 
strategy is required. Patience is necessary.
<P>
	One of the more successful tools we have to reach out and 
inform is education. Some people may offer simple solutions. 
Certainly any promise of across the board tax cuts may be 
attractive in the short term but tremendously unrealistic in the long 
run.
<P>
	I have urged both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance 
in their roles as leaders to speak on the issue. Many Canadians are 
simply unaware of the size of the problem. Some believe their 
participation in the underground economy does not really make a 
difference because they are only one person. They fail to 
understand that when their participation is joined with that of 
others the problem becomes compounded. Others see the whole 
issue as too complex and too overwhelming to comprehend.
<P>
	Recently the government of the province of Quebec undertook a 
major education campaign. The campaign focused on the fact that 
participation in the underground economy took away from our 
children's future. In one of the television ads we see a number of 
people hunched under a table making financial transactions. At the 
end of this long table we see a child sitting alone. The message is 
simple. The child receives none of the benefits of underground 
economic activity. Simply put, it is another message that our future 
is at risk.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we need a Team Canada approach to the 
problem. Nothing could be more positive than a poster at a building 
supply depot from the Canadian Construction Association. A 
message sponsored by a local chamber of commerce or a reminder 
at a company bulletin board would have a positive effect.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Again, I ask that we remember the example I gave about drunk 
driving. It took persistence on behalf of a few to change the minds 
of many.
<P>
	I want to touch briefly on the issue of the cashless society. There 
is no doubt that our system of paying for goods and services is 
changing.
<P>
	Shop at most stores in my community and someone can probably 
pay by cash, credit card, cheque or perhaps Interac. Guelph is also 
home to Mondex, a fascinating cashless experiment. Certainly this 
will have an impact on the underground economy. Debit cards like 
Interac are traceable like a cheque. Transactions can be followed.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the cashless society, whether it be a 
Mondex system or something even more fascinating will in the 
next few years change the way we purchase goods and services. I 
urge the federal government to monitor this situation closely.
<P>
	The cashless society should benefit any effort to reduce the 
underground economy. I hope we work with those implementing 
this future technology for efforts that will discourage underground 
economic activities.
<P>
	This issue is complex. We argue over the size of the underground 
economy and we can debate over which sectors are most affected. 
We can search for solutions. However, one thing is clear. As long as 
Canadians participate in the underground economy, they place our 
future at risk. It is easy to believe that we are avoiding the GST or 
simply not giving the government more money to mismanage.
<P>
	However, participation in the underground economy does not 
hurt the government. It has a negative impact on government 
services and it increases the deficit and the debt. Participation in 
the underground economy takes beds out of hospitals, teachers out 
of schools and puts veterans' benefits in jeopardy.
<P>
	It further burdens our children whose share of the debt increases 
each time someone avoids paying taxes. It prevents governments at 
all levels from offering all the services to taxpayers that they can 
and it puts honest, hardworking men and women on the 
unemployment line or makes them turn to social assistance in order 
to feed themselves and their families.
<P>
	We must all work together to end this problem. A lack of 
confidence in government and its ability to spend money wisely 
and efficiently was perhaps a reason. We have turned the corner.
<P>
	Participation in the underground economy only makes the 
situation worse. It hurts every single Canadian, particularly those 
most vulnerable.
<P>
	Governments must reach out further to find partners, work on 
solutions and end this problem which clearly places our future at 
risk.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member for Guelph-Wellington has tabled Motion M-243, which 
reads as follows, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should continue and enhance 
its efforts to address the underground economy, which costs Canadians anywhere 
from $23 billion to $156 billion dollars in lost revenue and wages, by working with 
other levels of government, industry, and unions in developing a plan of action, 
which includes a national education campaign and increased enforcement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to begin by congratulating the hon. member on her 
initiative in calling on the federal government to step up its fight 
against the underground economy, even if it must be pointed out 
that this initiative has come on the heels of numerous requests by 
the Bloc Quebecois and of action undertaken by the Government of 
Quebec in this connection.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8682"> 8682 </A></B>
<P>
	Quebec has once again been a step ahead of the federal 
government. An education campaign is already under way in 
Quebec. Viewers will recall the television ad showing a young 
child sitting on a table while adults exchange money underneath 
it.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has often asked the federal government to 
step up its fight against the underground economy, in its analysis of 
the auditor general's reports for instance, and again quite recently 
in the paper setting out our expectations with respect to the finance 
minister's last budget.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	In this paper, we estimated that, for the federal government 
alone, the underground economy represents annual tax losses as 
high as $6 billion; this figure comes from a Statistics Canada 
estimate, and we argued that the government could easily recover 
at least $500 million by hiring more inspectors.
<P>
	The auditor general has already pointed out that his inspectors 
cost an average of $35,000 each in salary, and that each one brings 
in on average almost half a million dollars in additional tax revenue 
annually.
<P>
	Economists would advise the government that it should hire 
these workers as long as their training and salary costs are offset by 
what they bring in in additional tax revenue.
<P>
	Right now, they are bringing in ten times more than they cost, 
which suggests that the revenue minister would do well to hire 
more of them.
<P>
	It goes without saying that concerted action by the provinces, 
industry and unions has a better chance of succeeding than 
unilateral action by the federal government. We think that Quebec 
will very likely co-operate with the federal government in this 
endeavour, because this is a phenomenon that has a negative impact 
on the tax revenue of all levels of government, while there is only 
one level of taxpayer. If the federal government indeed acts along 
with the others involved, instead of harshly imposing its views and 
interests in this area, we consider this plan to be extremely viable 
and highly desirable.
<P>
	The underground economy has two components: there are 
activities which are fundamentally legal but not reported for 
taxation, like moonlighting, and then there are illegal and criminal 
activities, like drug dealing and fencing stolen cars.
<P>
	We believe that an education campaign ought to focus 
particularly on people liable to get involved in the first category of 
activities, and that increased enforcement-stricter legislation and 
inspection, for instance-need to be looked at for both categories, 
with particular attention given to controlling and eliminating the 
second category of activity.
<P>
	We fully subscribe to the notion that, in a country where the 
community decides to provide public services, crooks and 
deadbeats who deliberately avoid paying taxes, who will do 
anything to avoid paying their fare share of tax, are guilty of 
antisocial behaviour. That is why we must first of all make people 
aware of the social significance of underground activities, while at 
the same time setting up active control measures in areas where 
such activities are more frequent.
<P>
	We must, however, avoid going too far and considering everyone 
a potential crook and deadbeat. We live in a system where people 
are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, and this must 
continue. Ways must be found, however, to get at those who are 
knowingly behaving as bad citizens.
<P>
	The public must be educated and informed about what their taxes 
are used for, so that they do not get the impression that they are 
paying them for no purpose. This implies that the government must 
first and foremost set an example, and prove that this is true. The 
public needs to be convinced that the rich, and the big corporations, 
are paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	Our young people do not need the auditor general telling them 
that stock mismanagement costs them $1.25 billion, that the 
federal government spent $30,000 to move a ship in order to save 
$71 on a repair bill, that the RCMP ordered 4,000 too many hats.
<P>
	The federal government still has a lot to do in this connection. 
There are two types of approaches to eradicating moonlighting and 
tax evasion: deterrents and incentives. The main deterrents are to 
increase controls and monitoring and to increase fines and 
penalties. We believe that the federal government should stress 
incentive measures including lower taxes, deregulation, 
simplifying the task of taxpayers and government officials faced 
with the complexities of the tax system, continued improvements 
in public administration and finally, tax amnesties, which, 
however, remain an exceptional measure.
<P>
	In concluding, I believe that education is also helpful, as is the 
degree of visibility of consumer taxes and increased employment, 
which might reduce the pressure on taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	All these measures should be part of a comprehensive plan to 
fight the underground economy. Unfortunately, from what we have 
seen in recent months, including latest budget brought down by the 
Minister of Finance, there can be no doubt at all that the Liberal 
government is not really interested in fighting the underground 
economy, in spite of the efforts of the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member for 
Guelph-Wellington and her colleagues for engaging in a serious 
effort to understand the nature and the size of the underground 
economy and come up with some suggestions on how we could 
reduce the size of this unfortunate development in our economy.
<P>
	As an academic economist I have a long tradition of studying 
this subject. I have attended a number of international conferences. 
I was first attracted to it when I met a professor from the University 
of Wisconsin, Ed Feige, telling of his experience when he stayed 
with a relative who came home one evening with a brown paper 
bag. He asked him naively what was in the bag. He opened it up and 
inside was cash. That person had a small retail store and he had 
taken a lot of his profits that day home in cash. They did not go 
through the banks.
<P>
	It also brought back my own memory from childhood in 
Germany where my father had a grocery store. In the evenings he 
would draw all the shades and make sure that nobody could see in 
when he punched on the cash register a new tape reflecting a much 
lower cash receipt of the day that went into the official books. I 
know, and everybody seems to know, that these kinds of practices 
are very widespread. However, I found out at these conferences 
there is a very wide range. There was a very wide range of 
estimates of the size of the underground economy. It all depended 
on the methodology that was used by the people who studied it. On 
the one hand there was Ed Feige who said we have so much more 
cash floating around in the economy than we did before for a given 
national income that it must be used for the financing of the 
underground economy. He was driven by this example of his 
relative bringing in a brown paper bag full of cash. He estimates 
that it may be as high 15 per cent of national income, if not higher.
<P>
	However, to me the most impressive and persuasive argument 
was made by people from Statistics Canada and other national data 
keeping organizations. Let me have a quick taxonomy. There is the 
underground economy that exists of barter where a dentist in a 
small town might accept a supply of chicken for 10 weeks, one a 
week, in payment for dental services. That kind of a barter 
undoubtedly takes place. Every once in a while I run into people 
who say ``you are so naive that you did not know we were doing 
this''. But the estimate of the importance of this kind of activity, 
given the size of the economy, is trivially small.
<P>
	The second source of underground economy activity arises in the 
context of smuggling. Here the most outstanding example relates to 
goldsmith jewellery which is burdened not only with GST and PST 
but also a very unfair 10 per cent luxury surtax which is totally 
inappropriate for this age. It has created a huge underground 
economy. In the finance committee we  heard regularly pleas from 
the industry for the government to abandon this absurd tax. I hope 
the government, as soon as it has breathing room, will follow this 
advice. It might produce more revenue than is being lost because 
the return to smuggling is destroyed.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	The persuasive argument as to size came to me from national 
income accountants who said they knew from episodal evidence 
that the biggest cheating takes place in the construction industry, 
car repair, tailoring, barbers and a few other such industries.
<P>
	We have statistics on the size of those industries. They may be 
important to individuals but given the size of the economy, a 
refinery or an automobile manufacturing plant those industries are 
very small. They make up no more than 2 per cent of national 
income.
<P>
	A large proportion of those activities is undertaken by a large 
firm and a large firm that engages in car repair cannot cheat. 
Furthermore, let us look at home repairs where they might give a 
deal if they do not have to pay GST on building an addition to a 
house. Let us remember the person has to buy windows, doors and 
all materials that go into it. The addition may cost $10,000 but the 
value added by the person who does the work is probably about 
$1,500 or $2,000. GST is paid on all the inputs because the person 
cannot claim back a rebate on the input.
<P>
	I am persuaded that it is a relatively minor problem. I believe the 
hon. member for Guelph-Wellington was overstating the case 
when she said that Canada's future was in danger because we had 
an underground economy. That is a vast exaggeration of the 
problem.
<P>
	In the moments remaining to me I will talk about some possible 
solutions. The first solution would be more education. How can 
anyone be against education? How far can we go when the message 
being sent goes against individual self-interest? We know that in 
the end self-interest pays and dominates.
<P>
	We should also remember especially in those cases that it is a 
victimless crime. The victimless crime morality is very hard to 
argue. The hon. member might say that other people will have to 
pay more taxes and services are down. That is remote. The amount 
of money being cheated is so small that the average person can 
rationalize very well the effect on society as a whole of minute 
actions. Nevertheless, let us have more education by all means but 
let us not spend too much money.
<P>
	The next thing is to have more enforcement by the Department 
of National Revenue: more audits, more rat lines and all those 
kinds of things. Surely they will produce some benefit. Not only 
am I worried about the cost. I am also worried about the other side 
of the coin, that we are increasing the power of the state. We are 
letting human beings who are imperfect, who could fail  and who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8684"> 8684 </A></B>
<P>
could abuse power go out and chase down a few individuals. This 
involves a great deal of risk.
<P>
	Let us build partnerships. It is like education but I doubt that it 
will go very far. The conclusion I reached having looked at the 
subject is that the only sure way to do it is to lower the returns from 
cheating. How do we do it? It is by lowering taxes. There is a risk 
of being caught and a risk of social disapproval. The higher the rate 
of return from engaging in illegitimate activities and carrying the 
risks, the more will be undertaken. The converse is the lower the 
rate of return, the less will take place.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	That is just another argument in a long line of arguments in 
favour of lower taxes which can only be brought about by 
Canadians accepting somewhat smaller government and going 
back to self-reliance rather than on any occasion possible 
screaming ``Ottawa help me''. That is the way to deal with the 
problem the hon. member has addressed in her resolution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I begin by recognizing my hon. 
colleague from Guelph-Wellington for her work as chair of the 
subcommittee of the national Liberal caucus committee on 
economic development. In late December 1996 the subcommittee 
held hearings to examine the underground economy, taking the first 
of many important steps in the government's efforts to address the 
underground economy.
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity the motion presents to review the 
government's continuing efforts to address the underground 
economy. The issue is fundamental to the integrity of the tax 
system. The government must ensure that taxes owed are taxes paid 
so that Canadians have faith in the fundamental fairness of our tax 
system.
<P>
	The Canadian tax system is based on the principles of 
self-assessment and voluntary compliance. Most Canadians are 
honest and pay the taxes they owe. In fact about 95 per cent of tax 
revenues are collected without any direct enforcement action. 
There are areas of the economy where there is lower compliance 
and where the government has had to focus its efforts. The 
underground economy is one of those areas.
<P>
	The underground economy we are talking about are those 
transactions, often cash transactions, on which income is not 
reported or is only partially reported for tax purposes.
<P>
	There is nothing romantic or harmless about the underground 
economy. The simple fact is that all of us benefit from the 
economic and social programs funded by our governments. When 
some individuals do not pay their fair share of taxes to support 
those programs it is the rest of us who have to pay more.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The underground economy comprises business competing 
unfairly with honest firms, because they can offer consumers lower 
prices, as they pay no income tax and do not contribute to the 
Canada pension plan, the employment insurance plan or to 
workmen's compensation.
<P>
	In this context, the honest firms paying their fair share of taxes 
may be forced to accept smaller revenues, indeed to lay off 
employees and even, in some cases, to close their doors.
<P>
	Consumers themselves become part of the problem of the 
underground economy when they agree to pay cash in exchange for 
a better price, which enables the business or the tradesperson to 
hide the operation and avoid all taxes. This sort of behaviour hurts 
all consumers and all members of our society.
<P>
	In fact, lost government revenues cannot be used for essential 
services benefitting all Canadians, such as health care, education 
and other social programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The problem of the underground economy is one we cannot and 
do not ignore. Let me expand on what our government and Revenue 
Canada have done and the progress we have made since 1993.
<P>
	The action plan the government has developed and implemented 
puts heavy emphasis on voluntary compliance and the things that 
support it. It is a plan that balances partnership, education and 
service activities with enhanced enforcement. Let me emphasize 
that our strategy to deal with the underground economy is designed 
to promote the principle our tax system is based on, voluntary 
compliance.
<P>
	From an economic point of view that is a smart strategy. It costs 
the government less to obtain taxes that are paid voluntarily than it 
does for Revenue Canada to go out looking for, auditing and 
investigating those who do not comply.
<P>
	Given this context, education is a major tool in battling the 
underground economy. Through its education efforts Revenue 
Canada has raised public awareness of the consequences of the 
underground economy and tax evasion. Presentations have been 
made to local community and business organizations. Information 
sessions have been held at universities, colleges and high schools. 
Revenue Canada staff visits business people in communities across 
the country to inform them about their efforts to combat this 
problem and to encourage a level playing field for honest 
businesses.
<P>
	During these visits they provide information on departmental 
services, answer questions and provide assistance to make it easier 
for businesses to comply with the various tax regimes. Overall I am 
glad to report that during the past two years Revenue Canada staff 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8685"> 8685 </A></B>
<P>
has  visited over 100 communities and met with more than 21,000 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Another important element of Revenue Canada's action plan is 
to inform individuals what happens if they have not reported all 
their income and they want to come clean.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Revenue Canada's voluntary disclosure policy enables all those 
who take part in the underground economy and those who have not 
complied with the law to correct any omissions in the income they 
declare to the department.
<P>
	This policy is based on a simple principle: if a disclosure is made 
voluntarily, that is, before the department has begun an audit or 
taken other enforcement action, no penalty or sanction, such as 
prosecution for tax evasion, will be imposed. The individual will 
simply be required to pay the tax due plus interest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is has sometimes been suggested that a temporary tax amnesty 
would be useful in addressing the underground economy. The state 
of New York experienced some success recently with just such a 
program.
<P>
	Revenue Canada's voluntary disclosure policy is better than any 
temporary amnesty program because it is permanent. Individuals 
who are drawn into the underground economy do not have to stay in 
hiding for several years hoping and waiting for an opportunity to 
change their ways without fear of criminal prosecution for 
monetary penalties. Revenue Canada's voluntary disclosure policy 
is a responsible approach to collecting the taxes rightfully owing to 
the government and has proven to be successful in recent years, 
borne out by the fact that voluntary disclosures have tripled since 
1993. People can make voluntary disclosures by contacting any 
Revenue Canada office.
<P>
	There is no question that enforcement has to be a fundamental 
element of our fight against the underground economy. That is why 
Revenue Canada has currently dedicated over 1,200 auditors to 
strengthen its efforts to identify non-filers and GST non-registrants 
and to conduct audits of small businesses in sectors of high 
non-compliance. Special audit teams have been established to 
focus on the construction, home renovation, jewellery, auto sales 
and repairs, hospitality and other service sectors, areas that can 
lend themselves to underground tax evasion.
<P>
	Revenue Canada makes extensive use of state of the art 
technology to cross match data from numerous sources including 
municipal and provincial databanks to identify non-filers and GST 
non-residents. Last year this helped identify over 500,000 
non-filers and GST non-registrants.
<P>
	To enhance these activities the Minister of Finance announced in 
the 1996 budget that 800 more auditors would be devoted to 
Revenue Canada's audit program for unincorporated businesses 
and self-employed individuals. This will increase the audit 
coverage rate for these groups and bring it more in line with the 
continued growth in this sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would add that this co-operative effort is not limited to audits 
for provinces that have concluded tax collection agreements. 
Quebec, for example, collects its own taxes, but we co-operate 
closely with officials in joint strategies and we co-ordinate our 
activities with their own business audit activities in the fight 
against the underground economy.
<P>
	I would also point out that Quebec has invested significant 
resources in this problem and taken a very focused approach in the 
fight against tax evasion and the underground economy. These are 
positive measures that will add to our strategy in the fight against 
the underground economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What about the bottom line of our enforcement initiatives? I am 
glad to report that since 1993 our enforcement efforts have yielded 
more than $1.7 billion of additional revenue for the government.
<P>
	Another important facet of Revenue Canada's audit activities is 
the information it gets from other federal departments and from the 
provinces and territories. Statistics Canada, Transport Canada, 
Public Works and Government Services Canada provide important 
information that facilitates audit selection and enforcement. 
Human Resources Development Canada works closely with 
Revenue Canada to identify links between employment insurance 
fraud and tax evasion. Revenue Canada also has an extensive 
network of provincial co-operation agreements that provide for 
information exchanges, joint enforcement action, shared 
experience and compliance.
<P>
	These co-operative agreements are not limited to the public 
sector. During the past few years Revenue Canada has consulted 
with over 400 national and local industry groups and professional 
associations. These consultations are extremely effective in 
providing a common understanding of issues and obtaining private 
sector co-operation. These groups and associations include 
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Canadian 
Construction Association, the Canadian Home Builders 
Association, the Canadian Jewellers Association and others. Each 
industry has its own unique character and issues. For that reason 
Revenue Canada is not applying blanket solutions. Instead, the 
department is working with industries on an individual basis to 
develop workable solutions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8686"> 8686 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	One result of these partnerships was the announcement by the 
Minister of Finance in the 1996 budget of a new contract payment 
reporting system for the construction and home building industry.
<P>
	Key industry groups and various trade unions are working in 
partnership with Revenue Canada to encourage these businesses to 
voluntarily report all payments made to contractors and to 
subcontractors.
<P>
	For the small percentage of Canadians who feel they are above 
the law, Revenue Canada uses another effective tool, the 
widespread publication of successful prosecutions.
<P>
	Bringing this information to the general public's attention has a 
major impact on the number of leads of potential tax fraud that the 
department has received. Since 1993, these have increased 
substantially to more than $28,000 annually.
<P>
	Revenue Canada is taking an analytical approach to identifying 
and addressing non-compliance issues to ensure enforcement 
resources are used efficiently and effectively. The department is 
using technology to analyse data and assess the risk of 
non-compliance in specific sectors. Audits are then directed to 
those areas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go. 
Revenue Canada has developed a long term strategy for the fight 
against the underground economy, which strikes a fair balance 
between measures promoting voluntary compliance and 
enforcement action.
<P>
	Certain elements are essential to the success of this strategy. We 
must make the public aware. We must work with industry and other 
levels of government. We must take effective enforcement action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must ensure that every Canadian understands the 
underground economy threatens government services and 
programs. It imposes an unfair burden on honest taxpayers.
<P>
	In conclusion, I commend the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington for bringing this matter once again to the 
floor of this House, supporting the government in its efforts to 
address the underground economy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to take part in today's debate on Motion 
No. 243, sponsored by my friend and hardworking colleague, the 
member for Guelph-Wellington, which calls on the government 
to develop a plan of action to counter the underground economy in 
Canada.
<P>
	Participation in the underground economy and tax evasion 
represent significant loss of revenues to both federal and provincial 
governments. A precise estimate of the underground economy is 
not possible.
<P>
	However, the most commonly accepted estimates of the size of 
the underground economy place it in a range of 10 per cent to 20 
per cent of the GDP. That implies an economy of illegally hidden 
activities that is larger than the entire economy of Alberta and 
places the size of Canada's underground economy in a range of $75 
billion to more than $150 billion.
<P>
	Since taxes of all types represent nearly half of Canada's 
reported economy, this could represent a loss of anywhere from 
$35 billion to $75 billion every year. It also poses a serious threat to 
Canada's tax system which is based on self-assessment and 
voluntary compliance. This is not a victimless crime.
<P>
	According to Revenue Canada, some of the causes of 
underground activity are recession, high tax levels, perception that 
government squanders tax dollars, perception of unfairness, high 
regulatory burdens, particularly for small business, perception that 
there is a low risk of being cause, perceived high cost of 
compliance and declining real incomes.
<P>
	While too many Canadians will continue to view any of the 
above as legitimate reasons to continue operating in the 
underground economy, the fact remains we all need to be reminded 
of the implications of the underground economy to the country and 
to the Canadian way of live.
<P>
	Huge revenue losses have many long reaching effects on the 
systems and programs that we take for granted. For example, 
essential programs and services are at risk. An unfair burden is 
placed on honest Canadians. Unfair competition occurs. Unfair 
access to tax credits and other social programs takes place and we 
are left with a legacy of higher deficit and a larger debt.
<P>
	In November 1993 Revenue Canada concluded that the problem 
of the underground economy was so severe that its approach to 
solving the problem at hand must be different from the methods 
that have been historically employed.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	In launching its underground economy initiative, the department 
chose to concentrate on the following three strategies: 
encouragement through education efforts of the underground 
economy to rejoin the legitimate economy, promoting voluntary 
compliance, and taking responsible enforcement action.
<P>
	Under this strategy the department has been conducting a risk 
assessment to target its enforcement activities on identified areas 
of non-compliance and on files that are identified as high risk.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8687"> 8687 </A></B>
<P>
	The department has also entered into co-operation agreements 
with all the provinces to exchange information, share audit 
strategies and co-ordinate audit and enforcement activities.
<P>
	As part of its efforts to rehabilitate sectors that it has targeted as 
prone to non-compliance, Revenue Canada has consulted with 
more than 240 industry and professional groups to seek input from 
those concerned about underground economic activity.
<P>
	While no single action is likely to markedly reduce the size of 
the underground economy in Canada, a series of actions to 
accompany Revenue Canada's initiative might prove to be more 
helpful.
<P>
	For example, I believe we must attempt to link taxes more 
closely with the actual benefits enjoyed by taxpayers, who are more 
likely to comply when they can readily identify the direct benefit to 
them of the tax.
<P>
	There is also much evidence that compliance, particularly for the 
small business sector, needs to be kept as simple as possible. This 
is a major issue for the GST and is related in part to a narrower base 
for the tax, a base which excludes some items and includes others.
<P>
	This issue is even more important in provinces which have 
maintained a PST base that differs from that of the GST. The April 
23, 1996 harmonization memorandum of understanding between 
the federal government and New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland suggests that we can make real progress in this area, 
but there still is work ahead before we can ever claim to have a 
truly harmonized tax system in Canada from coast to coast.
<P>
	There is fairly good evidence that the underground economy in 
Canada has grown considerably in absolute size and relative to 
total economic activity. With this in mind, there is also a very good 
argument to devote more resources to the task of obtaining a better 
understanding of the underground economy's role in this country 
and the factors contributing to its growth.
<P>
	I believe it is crucial that we not expend all our energies in 
merely attacking the symptoms of this very serious problem. To 
ensure success we must use creativity in addressing its underlying 
causes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There being no 
further members rising for debate and the motion not being 
designated a votable item, the time provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
	Does the House give its unanimous consent to call it 6.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ATLANTICECONOMY">ATLANTIC ECONOMY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to rise again in the House to speak 
about cost recovery as it affects the fishing, fish processing and 
aquaculture industries of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	On every possible occasion I have drawn attention to the vital 
role of the fishery in the region's economy and especially in my 
riding of South Shore. In Shelburne County, for example, the 
fishery directly or indirectly employs 80 per cent of the workforce.
<P>
	I meet regularly with the fishing industry leaders and their 
organizations. Cost recovery has been a recurring topic for nearly 
two years. We have worked hard to document the impact of new 
and increased fees charged by government departments and 
agencies for different industry services. We have identified 14 
categories of fees which directly affect the bottom line of fishing 
enterprises.
<P>
	I have been asking for a cumulative impact study to analyse the 
combined and overall effects of these fees.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	We have a fairly comprehensive picture of the impact of cost 
recovery at enterprise levels but we lack information about the 
combined or cumulative impact of fees at community or regional 
levels.
<P>
	Last month the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans 
heard testimony about cost recovery from fish harvesters and fish 
processors. Representatives from Treasury Board attended these 
sessions and we understood they took a very strong message back 
to the minister that cost recovery, if allowed to proceed unchecked 
and without a cap or ceiling, will have significant impacts on 
business competitiveness and the entire economy of Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	I am confident the fisheries committee will be recommending, as 
I have, that a detailed study of the cumulative impact of cost 
recovery on the fishing industry be carried out and that no new fees 
or any increases to existing fees be imposed.
<P>
	I also hope that serious consideration be given to scaling back 
fees in circumstances where it can be demonstrated that they 
represent an excessive burden on either the fishing enterprise or the 
community.
<P>
	I commend the paper tabled in this House on February 20, 1997 
called ``Getting Government Right: Governing for Canadians''. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8688"> 8688 </A></B>
<P>
This document states  unequivocally that those who pay for 
services must have an effective voice in service design and 
delivery.
<P>
	To date information sessions and consultations between fisheries 
and oceans and its principal clients have taken place, but 
opportunities to roll up the sleeves and work together to decide on 
essential services and program delivery have not materialized.
<P>
	``Getting Government Right'' also talks about a process which is 
available to mediate in situations where clients believe 
departments and agencies have not followed the mandate to work 
in co-operation with stakeholders. It has become increasingly clear 
that mediation between the fishing industry and the federal 
government is a real and very urgent requirement.
<P>
	I hope and request that the new guidelines to be announced by 
the President of the Treasury Board will recognize the concerns 
that I have been expressing over the last number of months: 
requiring the department to hold meaningful consultations with 
industry; adopting the user pay, user say concept; providing a 
process which would allow industry to appeal the imposition of any 
new fees; requiring government departments to disclose their own 
costs to those who are being asked to contribute to those costs.
<P>
	We need the commitment. We need the guidelines. We need the 
assurances that the guidelines will be followed and that what 
industry has endured over the last two years will not be repeated.
<P>
	On behalf of my South Shore constituents and their counterparts 
from every other region of Nova Scotia and of Canada, I am today 
asking the President of the Treasury Board to say ``yes, we 
recognize a problem with cost recovery and action must be taken to 
ensure the long term sustainability of Canada's fishing industry''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, Treasury Board is responsible for 
establishing the overall policy and for providing general guidance 
to departments in its implementation. This includes the need for 
them to be sensitive to the cumulative impact of fees on their 
clients.
<P>
	We view the assessment of cumulative impacts as a very 
important issue with respect to the introduction or amendment of 
user charges. Officials of the Treasury Board secretariat assemble 
an advisory committee of businesses and consumer groups to help 
them draft a revised set of cost recovery policy guidelines. We see 
this policy development as a first and important step toward 
ensuring that all departments and agencies work toward the same 
goals when they introduce or amend fees.
<P>
	Program review has changed the way government conducts 
business. Many activities are being totally re-engineered to ensure 
Canadians get the best value for money spent. Scarce tax dollars 
cannot continue to be used to fund programs that provide specific 
benefits to  clients which are over and above those provided to the 
general taxpayer.
<P>
	In our efforts to improve the focus of government spending we 
are paying more attention to who receives benefits from 
government activities. Unfortunately shifting such costs to those 
who benefit will necessary involve fee introductions or increases in 
those areas which seem large when viewed outside this context. We 
all know nobody objects to paying their fair share, but those 
impacted by these changes want and deserve a voice in what 
happens. Departments and agencies must give clients an 
opportunity to provide input as to how services for which they have 
to pay can be improved.
<P>
	However, this is not a one way street. Departments and agencies 
must keep an eye on their overriding policy objectives as they work 
with suggestions for change. The Treasury Board will not impose a 
ceiling on charges. However, it wants to ensure that departments 
carefully assess how such fees affect clients before they are put in 
place. Ministers of line departments are responsible for 
implementing cost recovery for programs under their area of 
responsibility and for assessing the economic impacts of specific 
initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I cannot over-emphasize the role that clients will have to play in 
any such exercise. The specific impact of user charges will vary 
greatly across clients, depending on their particular circumstances. 
Therefore, open dialogue between clients and departments is 
crucial to understanding and resolving inequitable situations which 
may arise.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
again, the question I asked on February 11 was the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What will the Minister of Canadian Heritage do to counteract budget cuts such as 
those made at Radio-Canada and more specifically those affecting the news program 
<I>Ce soir</I>. Could she expand on that?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister's response was, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-Radio-Canada has decided to reconsider its decision to terminate programming 
of <I>Ce soir</I>. In fact, programming in Saskatchewan and Alberta would be maintained.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hope that, after the government, or Radio-Canada in this case, 
has been persuaded to change its mind, the principle will have been 
established that, when a decision is made by an organization, this 
decision can always be overturned, reviewed, reconsidered if 
necessary.
<P>
	This point of principle I just raised is an important point because 
the decision in question has widespread implications in terms of 
the services provided to francophone minorities outside Quebec 
and particularly in western Canada. In spite of the protection they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8689"> 8689 </A></B>
<P>
are  afforded, these communities always have to fight for their 
basic rights, in this case, access to news in French. That is unfair.
<P>
	I am very happy for francophone communities in western 
Canada that Radio-Canada decided not to terminate programming 
of <I>Ce Soir</I>. There is a need, however, for the government and 
Radio-Canada to understand their respective role, which is 
essential to Canadian unity. Radio-Canada is essential to the 
continued existence of the French language as a living language, 
spoken and written in western Canada and, to this end, it must do 
everything in its power to provide local programming and access to 
news programming to francophones across the country.
<P>
	Does the federal government have a role to play in ensuring that 
Radio-Canada can go on producing quality programs in French? I 
think so. In fact, I am convinced that it does. I might add that, in my 
view, the government should provide the necessary financial 
support to its minorities, be it for television or radio programming, 
education, or whatever else is required to improve their well-being.
<P>
	I do not want the government to save money at the expense of 
our French language institutions any more, those institutions that 
provide us with the infrastructure we need in order to be able to live 
and prosper in French. The government has a duty to make sure the 
necessary tools are in place so that our communities can not only 
live in French but also improve their quality of life. That is what I 
expect from the government this evening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage mentioned, the CBC makes all the decisions concerning 
its programming and its daily operations. This includes the 
decisions concerning French language television programming.
<P>
	That having been said, I am pleased to provide details to the hon. 
member regarding the measures announced by the CBC on January 
30, regarding its French language radio and television. These 
initiatives will improve services provided by Radio-Canada to 
French speaking communities outside Quebec.
<P>
	According to the CBC news release:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The half-hour French language news bulletin <I>Ce soir</I>, which is aired at dinner 
time, will be maintained in the four western provinces, and will have a new format as 
of this spring.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As for other programs from western stations, services will remain essentially the 
same and regional teams will continue to produce news stories and information 
programs that will be broadcasted by Radio-Canada and RDI.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The French language radio will provide $500,000 in additional support to the 
stations most affected, namely Regina, Edmonton, Vancouver and Windsor, to focus 
on regional and local programming.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Except in Vancouver, there will be at least 36 hours per week of French language 
radio programs. Regional programming on the national network will be maintained 
and, in some cases, increased.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In Acadia, special arrangements will allow the Moncton station to maintain 
infrastructures to preserve regional and network programming. These infrastructures 
will also be made available to independent producers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Radio-Canada has been present for a long time in Canada's 
regions, and it is an integral part of the communities that it serves. 
These measures reflect the public broadcaster's determination to 
provide regional programming and, particularly, to meet the needs 
of minority French language communities outside Quebec.
<P>
	On February 11, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced 
that, as of April, annual additional funding of $10 million would be 
provided to CBC's French and English language radio, as well as 
stable multiyear funding.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in the January 11 edition of the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, Part I, the 
Pest Management Regulatory Agency, PMRA, of Health Canada 
published its proposals on cost recovery which are part of the 
current review of Canada's pesticide registration system.
<P>
	Since that time, I have received at least 50 copies of responses to 
the PMRA proposals by individual farmers and agricultural 
organizations. Not one of these responses has been favourable.
<P>
	On February 21 I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Health if the minister was prepared to revisit the many 
concerns voiced by Canada's farmers and farm organizations and 
make further changes to cost recovery and the PMRA proposals.
<P>
	By and large, the main concern which has been conveyed to me 
is that the PMRA is not taking into consideration the cumulative 
effect its proposals will have on producers.
<P>
	A constructive environment where there is a will to collaborate, 
revise and improve must prevail by all participants before any 
progress can be made on PMRA efficiencies. Regardless of the 
particular suggestions put forward, it must be understood that such 
advice is given by Canada's farm organizations in the spirit of 
making things better.
<P>
	For years now, farm organizations have been telling the PMRA 
that it has overestimated the number of product registrations. This 
means that the overall budget is still too high. The PMRA's budget 
forecast for five years does not reflect the full potential for

nological innovation. In other words, the PMRA's proposed budget 
contradicts federal government policies such as program review to 
do more with less.
<P>
	Because Canada is not normally the first market for pesticide 
products, the PMRA could have substantially reduced costs and 
speeded up approval times by better utilizing information gained 
through the approval process in other countries. Despite repeated 
urging from farm organizations across the country, the PMRA 
chose not to follow this route.
<P>
	Despite Health Canada's 40 per cent reduction in the original fee 
structure, the current cost recovery target of $12.3 million still puts 
the international competitiveness of Canada's pesticide producers 
and users, who are primarily Canada's farmers, at stake. This is 
because the proposed fees are still not substantial, given the high 
level of fees and the relatively small size of the Canadian market. 
Canada's farmers and farm organizations predict that these fees 
will lead to significant product withdrawals and will reduce the 
ability of Canada's farmers to compete internationally.
<P>
	When PMRA's cost recovery target is compared with other 
Health Canada initiatives, it becomes readily apparent that this 
target is still too high. For example, the drugs directorate cost 
recovers is 28 per cent of its total budget and the medical devices 
program cost recovers only 14 per cent of its total budget. Yet the 
PMRA is asking industry to pay 45 per cent of its total budget. 
Obviously this places the international competitiveness of the 
Canadian farmer at risk.
<P>
	According to the PMRA proposals industry will be charged 
$2,690 a year to maintain each product registration on file. Even at 
this point in time it is still unclear what services industry is actually 
paying for here.
<P>
	I have seen studies which show a high level of price sensitivity to 
maintenance levels, particularly for pesticides with low volume 
sales that cater to what is commonly referred to as the niche 
markets.
<P>
	These studies suggest that the proposed maintenance fee would 
lead to a 71 per cent withdrawal rate of products with sales of less 
than $5,000. That would be a terrible blow to the niche markets I 
was referring to.
<P>
	It has also been brought to my attention that the PMRA has not 
set performance standards for other submissions such as new 
pesticide use or formulation changes. This is contrary to Treasury 
Board policy which stipulates that performance measures should be 
set and agreed to by stakeholders. This is in contrast to other 
international agencies committed to developing their performance 
times on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	The PMRA must commit to developing and meeting 
performance standards that are competitive with the best in the 
world on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	I conclude with one further observation. Unless there are 
changes to the PMRA's proposal the Canadian farming community 
will suffer enormous consequences in the global marketplace. It is 
time for the agency to move forward for the good of Canadian 
farmers and consumers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak on this 
matter. I know the member will be delighted to hear me repeat 
some positions.
<P>
	The member for Lambton-Middlesex has a concern regarding 
the PMRA. As I stated in my response to her on February 21, the 
Minister of Health has been reviewing the various proposals of 
groups interested in the matter.
<P>
	The member will no doubt be happy to learn that on February 27, 
a mere six days after my response to her query, the Minister of 
Health wrote to the president of the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture. In that letter he addressed a number of issues. I will be 
happy to table a copy of the letter for the member and for the 
House.
<P>
	The member will see from the letter that the PMRA will be 
co-operating with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture on a 
post-implementation impact analysis. This would monitor prices 
and product withdrawals and assess the impact of the two factors 
on competitiveness.
<P>
	The PMRA has actively participated in the pesticide program of 
the OECD which is working toward global harmonization of test 
protocols and data requirements leading to reduction in industry 
costs.
<P>
	The minister also indicated in his letter that the PMRA has no 
intention of re-evaluating all the products every three to five years, 
nor of re-evaluating products that have acceptable data bases to 
support their safety and effectiveness. The purpose of re-evaluation 
is to bring older databases up to modern standards, identify and 
examine human safety and environmental concerns, and ensure 
continued efficacy. I am certain the member will and does support 
these goals.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the PMRA has made significant 
improvements to the review process for new submissions. Based on 
these improvements the PMRA has projected a 40 per cent 
reduction in costs for reviewing new product submissions over the 
next six years and has already built this into its proposed fee 
schedule.
<P>
	There are other issues addressed in the letter. The member for 
Lambton-Middlesex has been aggressive, insistent and persistent 
on the matter. Others who like her have an interest in the issue 
should review the correspondence. I think they will find it to their 
satisfaction.
<P>
