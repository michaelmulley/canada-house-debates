pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in

I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the point of order being raised by the 
Bloc Quebecois whip related to the motion put by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point of order was prior 
to that.  In fact, I have been on my feet ever since prayers, 
waiting to be recognized.  You recognized the parliamentary 
secretary first, and what I simply wished, Mr. 
Speaker, further to the Prime Minister's announcement that he 
wants to introduce a bill denying Quebecers their fundamental 
rights— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. 
There is a problem. I indicated that the House would 
proceed to tabling of documents and recognized the hon. 
parliamentary secretary.  I heard nothing of a point of order at 
that time.  I shall therefore propose the motion to the House at 
this time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> If I sat down, it was because it is your 
duty to ensure that my right to speak is protected in this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would like to assure the hon. member for 
Roberval that I can hear him. Had I thought it was impossible to 
do so I would certainly have taken action.  I can indeed hear 
him and I would ask him to speak directly to his point of order 
so that I may give a ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, a while ago we had a 
conversation outside the House to discuss a problem, that of 
being unable to hear my colleague, the Bloc Quebecois whip. 
Somehow you can hear me in all this noise when I cannot hear 
myself for the racket from the other side.  That is what I 
wished to tell you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that they have settled down a bit, I simply wish to tell you— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Now that they have settled down a bit, I 
simply wish to tell you that members on this side, regardless— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B>—of members from Quebec on the other side 
who are put out, are perfectly entitled to seek your attention, 
to raise a point of order, to suggest that material relevant to 
the debate we are now having be read or considered.  That is our 
perfect right and I call on you to observe the Standing Orders, 
to protect the right to speak of members in this House, and to 
ask the members of the government party to be quiet, whether 
they like it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
does seem to me to be perfectly logical that the Bloc members 
want to table documents. I have no problem with that. 
However, it would not hurt to have a little debate before they 
head off in the direction they are going in now.  Why do we not 
enter into the debate and afterward, if they want to make 
dilatory motions and so on, let us have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is cognizant of the fact 
that sometimes there is some noise in the Chamber, not all on one 
side, I may say.  The Chair cannot stop members from yelling but 
the Chair does try to encourage order in the debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair has an obligation to ensure that each member has the 
right to express his or her views in the House and I would 
always wish to protect this right, even those of the hon. member 
for Roberval, when other members have something to say.  I am 
here to rule on a point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. Before the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs sees fit to address in this House the 
bill denying the basic rights of Quebecers, I would like to 
table a speech made by the Prime Minister of Canada on November 
28, 1999, where he said— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the hon. 
member to table this document? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are not letting me 
finish. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. Before the House begins consideration of the bill, I 
would like to table in the House a study released by the Library 
of Parliament on the basic rights of Canadians and Quebecers. 
The study was carried out in 1984 and revised in— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the hon. 
member to table this document? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order. 
Further to the announcement by the Prime Minister that he 
intends to introduce a bill denying the fundamental rights of 
Quebecers, I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House to 
table a document that could enlighten the House. It is an 
article from <I>La Presse</I> that clearly indicates to what extent— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the hon.

that you always strive to serve the House well and I realize 
that there is a fundamental right at stake here, the right of 
all parliamentarians to express their points of view and not 
only to say what they have to say, but also to get fair and 
relevant information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, I would ask for the democratic, 
unanimous and informed consent of the House to table a document, 
further to the announcement by the government that it intends to 
introduce a bill that shamelessly changes the referendum rules 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for the consent of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?

<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
as a question of privilege, I would like to point out that 
before asking if there is unanimous consent of the House, it 
would be important for the House to hear the member who is 
seeking such consent explain what he or she is asking for 
exactly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> In my case, I have here an excerpt from 
the referendum act of Nebraska, in the United States. I ask for 
the unanimous consent of the House to table this document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Portneuf has a point, but I 
must say that points of order should not give members the 
opportunity to make a speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members rise on a point of order, they must say 
specifically what their point of order is about. After that, if 
they have indicated that they want to table a document, I think 
it is the duty of the Chair to put the question to the House, 
and that is all I am doing. I do not have to give each member 
the opportunity to explain the whole content of the document. 
That is not what I am supposed to do.

has taken into consideration the fact that all the points of 
order that have been heard today, and it was also the case 
yesterday, dealt with the same point. It is a point of order 
asking permission to table a document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the Chair is entitled to proceed with the business of 
the House. Yesterday, during the submissions, the Speaker ruled 
on that point. He said that one submission per day per member 
would be enough. I believe that the situation is the same today. 
There is no difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to continue with the other members, but I think 
the ruling handed down yesterday was fair for all the members in 
the House. I think it is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no precise rule on this point, but the Speaker's ruling

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AN ACT TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AS SET 
OUT IN THE OPINION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN THE QUEBEC 
SECESSION REFERENCE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK52">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-20, an act to give effect to the requirement for 
clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada 
in the Quebec Secession Reference, be now read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill on clarity, that I have the 
honour of discussing today at second reading, clarifies the 
circumstances in which this House would declare whether the 
Government of Canada would be obliged to enter into negotiations 
on the separation of a province from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An eventual break-up of our country is a serious and sad matter. 
But, paradoxically, it reveals how much Canada is a real 
country.  It is because the ties that unite us have been so 
closely knit over the years that endless precautions would need 
to be taken, should we, unfortunately, one day undertake to 
break up our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is in keeping with the supreme court's opinion of 
August 20, 1998 and gives effect to it. 
It defines the unavoidable responsibilities of the Government of 
Canada and the House of Commons, while respecting the 
prerogatives of the Government and National Assembly of Quebec 
and all other political actors in our federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the population of a province clearly expressed its will to 
secede from Canada, the Government of Canada would have to 
undertake negotiations on secession.  But in the absence of that 
clear will, the Government of Canada ought not undertake such 
negotiations.  This is the Government of Canada's position.  It 
is reasonable.  It just makes good sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it is good sense that has guided the Government of Canada in 
the past, in 1980 as well as in 1995.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with the confusing question of the 1980 referendum, the 
then Prime Minister stated on May 14, 1980 that, if the yes side 
obtained a majority, he would say to the then Premier of 
Quebec—and I am quoting the Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau—“If you knock on the sovereignty-association door, 
there is no negotiation possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, 1995, the Prime Minister of Canada stated in 
this House, and I quote: “For months and months I have asked the 
Government of Quebec to ask a clear question.  It is asking an 
ambiguous question”.  The Prime Minister of Canada also declared 
that a majority of 50% plus one was not enough to break up 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day after the referendum, on November 1, 1995, the Leader of 
the Official Opposition, who is now the Premier of Quebec, took 
note of the Prime Minister of Canada's position.  The former 
Leader of the Official Opposition said as follows:  “We will 
recall that [the Prime Minister of Canada] said in this House he 
reserved the right not to honour a narrow yes majority in favour 
of sovereignty”.  I would ask the present Premier of Quebec to 
remember what he said back then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 27, 1996, two days after I was sworn in as minister, 
I was quoted in <I>Le Soleil</I>, Quebec City as saying “In the 
unfortunate eventuality that a strong majority in Quebec were to 
vote on a clear question in favour of secession, I believe that 
the rest of Canada would have a moral obligation to discuss the 
division of the country”.  I believe that the supreme court had 
something similar to say. 
I have reiterated that position in open letters to the Premier 
of Quebec and his ministers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Attorney General of Canada also said in announcing the 
supreme court reference in September 1996 “in the unlikely event 
that the population of Quebec were to decide that they do not 
want to remain in Canada, we will be negotiating”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the supreme court said in its opinion 
issued two years later on August 20, 1998.  The court wrote that 
we are obliged to negotiate secession if things are clear.  The 
court assigned to the political actors the responsibility of 
determining what constitutes a clear question in a referendum on 
secession and what constitutes a clear majority. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To negotiate secession where there is clarity, and not to 
negotiate where there is not: this has been the Government of 
Canada's position in the past, this is what the supreme court's 
opinion enjoins it to do, and this is what it says in the bill 
on clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill specifies the unavoidable responsibilities of the 
Government of Canada and the House of Commons.  At the same time 
it fully respects the prerogatives of the government and 
the National Assembly of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec can ask Quebec voters the question of 
its choice.  But the Government of Canada and the House of 
Commons, as political actors, have a duty to make their own 
assessment of whether the question and the majority indicate a 
clear support for secession before concluding that the 
Government of Canada is bound to enter into negotiations on the 
breakup of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is self-evident that the House of Commons would be duty-bound 
to evaluate the clarity of support for secession before the 
Government of Canada could undertake to negotiate secession, 
because the negotiations would aim to terminate all the 
responsibilities, those of the House of Commons as well as those 
of the Government of Canada, toward part of the Canadian 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Bloc's intergovernmental affairs critic and his leader 
have agreed with that. 
In fact, on December 8, the Bloc's critic and MP for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry said “According to the court's 
opinion, if there is a justifiable role for the federal 
government it is after the referendum, in determining the 
clarity of the question and the majority required, so as to 
conclude whether there is an obligation to negotiate”.  We 
are not that far apart, really.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision that the Government of Canada must undertake 
negotiations on secession would be a major one for the House.  It 
could not ignore the enormous consequences for Canada's 
population as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A referendum on secession is not just an ordinary election. 
Voters will not have the opportunity to review their choice four 
years later.  Negotiating the dismantling of a modern democratic 
country is an enormous, unprecedented task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of difficult and complex questions would be raised 
affecting the rights and interests of all the country's citizens. 
The House could not conclude that the Government of Canada could 
impose such an ordeal on Canadians unless there is a clear will 
in favour of breaking up. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Quebecers have the same rights as other Canadians to have 
our two constitutionally authorized governments, our provincial 
government and our federal government, fully respect our right 
to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In tangible terms, this means that if we clearly indicated in a 
referendum that we wished to stop being part of Canada in order 
to make Quebec an independent country, our federal government 
would have an obligation to undertake negotiations to terminate 
our belonging to Canada, to terminate its constitutional 
responsibilities toward us.  But in the absence of this clear 
desire for secession, our federal government has the opposite 
obligation: the obligation to maintain peacefully the 
constitutional responsibilities it has toward us, and to 
safeguard all our prerogatives as Canadians, in Quebec, 
throughout Canada and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our right to Canada.  For its part, the Government of 
Canada intends to respect that right of Quebecers.  That is the 
reason for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can seriously maintain that the Government of Canada 
would be obliged to negotiate no matter what the question was. 
The question must clearly be about secession.  A confusing 
question would make negotiations impossible.  It is only 
reasonable that, to trigger negotiations on secession, you need 
a clear question on secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question would have to state clearly that the province would 
cease to be part of Canada and would become an independent 
state.  That is what the bill stipulates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of the will to effect secession is essential.  The 
supreme court speaks of “no longer wishing to remain in Canada”. 
It does not speak of the will to confer a mandate to negotiate. 
It speaks of no longer wishing to remain in Canada.  One 
undertakes negotiations on secession because one wants to 
secede, not to find out whether that might be what one wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill indicates that a clear question must address secession 
exclusively.  That is obvious.  Introducing other elements would 
make it impossible to know whether voters really want secession 
or not.  No negotiations could result from a question such as 
the one in 1980 or 1995, referring to the notions of association 
or an offer of partnership with Canada, because it would be 
impossible to know if the yes supporters really wanted to secede 
from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the clarity of the majority.  Under both Quebec law 
and Canadian federal law, a referendum is a consultation.  The 
political authorities assess the importance of such a 
consultation on the basis of, among other things, the clarity of 
the question and the clarity of the result. 
Accordingly, Quebec's Referendum Act sets no threshold, be it 
50% plus one or anything else, so we might perhaps ask the 
Government of Quebec and Bloc Quebecois members to respect 
Quebec's Referendum Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The white paper on referenda stated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that referenda are a consultation makes it unnecessary 
to include provisions about a required majority of a level of 
voter participation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is customary in democracy to require a clear referendum 
majority before proceeding with a radical change whose 
consequences would be virtually irreversible. This is the case 
with a vote that could lead to negotiations on secession. 
Such negotiations should never be undertaken on the basis on an 
uncertain majority that might not hold firm in the face of the 
inevitable difficulties engendered by the breakup of a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not worth imposing that risk on everyone, because the 
chances that such an attempt at secession will succeed are slim 
to none in the absence of a clear majority. That is accepted in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not break up a country with support of 50% plus one. 
That has just never happened. On the contrary, outside the 
colonial context, referenda held as part of a successful process 
of secession have always garnered majorities of over 70%. 
Separatist leaders around the world say “Let my people vote 
under fair conditions and you will see that they want to 
separate”. They are not saying “Half of my people want to 
separate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers have already said no twice to secession even when they 
were asked questions designed to artificially boost support for 
the yes side. And each time the PQ government promised it would 
be back with another referendum. It said “See you soon”, “See 
you next time”, instead of taking into account the will of the 
voters. The PQ government has indicated that it wants to hold a 
third referendum on secession by the end of its current mandate. 
And it is not saying it will accept “three strikes, you are 
out” either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the Quebec population answers no, the separatist 
leaders intend to keep proposing their secession plan. But if 
they ever chanced to get a yes, no matter how slim, they would 
try to effect secession. That would have irreversible 
consequences, because it is almost impossible to rebuild a 
country after breaking it up. The no supporters would have no 
opportunity to say “See you soon” or “See you next time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of saying yes to secession are very 
different from the consequences of saying no. No means not now, 
but yes means forever. Only a yes can give rise to an 
irreversible change that is binding on future generations. There 
must be a clear majority before negotiations are undertaken on 
the possibility of effecting such a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we have no choice. The supreme court requires the 
political actors to assess the clarity of any future majority in 
favour of secession. It used the expression “clear majority” no 
fewer than 13 times in its opinion. The qualifier “clear” means 
that more than a slim majority is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the court also added that there is a qualitative dimension 
to assessing clarity, requiring a political evaluation and a 
full understanding of the actual circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore impossible to determine what constitutes that 
clear majority at this time, in the calm atmosphere of a united 
Canada, outside the turbulence of a referendum, because the 
circumstances in which that political assessment would have to 
be made are unknown to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the province would first, following a 
referendum in which a clear question had been asked, need to 
seek to enter into negotiations on secession. It is conceivable 
that, faced with a majority that was not clear, the government 
itself would conclude that it was better not to proceed. It 
would be ridiculous, for example, to have such a grave decision 
hinge on a judicial recount. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in the eventuality that the Government of Canada was called 
on to negotiate, the House of Commons would proceed to consider 
and, by resolution, set out its determination as to whether in 
the circumstances a clear majority had expressed itself in favour 
of secession, again taking into account the other points of view 
that would be expressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The final subsection of the bill stipulates that no minister of 
the crown can propose a constitutional amendment to effect the 
secession of a province from Canada unless the Government of 
Canada has addressed in the framework of negotiations the terms 
of secession expressly mentioned by the court, such as the 
division of assets and liabilities, any changes to the borders of 
the province, the rights, interests and territorial claims of 
aboriginal peoples of Canada, and the protection of minority 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the court requires the parties to such possible future 
negotiations to address these issues, the court also requires 
them not to determine any results in advance.  Here again the 
clarity bill respects the supreme court's opinion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to borders, for example, the supreme court had this 
to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody seriously suggests that our national existence, seamless 
in so many aspects, could be effortlessly separated along what 
are now the provincial boundaries of Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Borders could be subject to negotiation. 
To be sure, under Canada's constitution, a province's borders 
cannot be modified without the agreement of the province's 
legislative assembly. It may be, however, that democracy and a 
sincere quest for justice for all would make an agreement on 
separation contingent on modifying the borders. But the bill 
provides no certainty about that, to any party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not reiterate the position once advanced by the 
Bloc's intergovernmental affairs critic to the effect that the 
aboriginal peoples living in Quebec would have the right to 
continue to remain in Canada in the event of the province's 
secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal populations in Quebec have twice demonstrated through 
referenda, in 1980 and 1995, their clear will to stay in Canada. 
If aboriginals were to express such a clear will once again, the 
Government of Canada could not guarantee in advance what fate would 
await them, but it is committed to taking that factor into 
account during negotiations on secession. The government would 
have all of its responsibilities to all Canadians at heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons, every member of this House, would have the 
opportunity to assess the way in which the government conducted 
these infinitely painful, serious and difficult negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is reasonable, and is in everybody's interest, 
including that of my fellow Quebecers who desire Quebec 
independence. They can and must acknowledge that their plans for 
political independence can only be realized in clarity and 
legality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To act otherwise, to try to reach independence through 
ambiguity, with no legal safety net, is to show disrespect for 
Quebecers and to doom the independence initiative to failure, to 
an impasse that would be disappointing and costly for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this matter the separatist leaders do not defend the rights 
of Quebecers. None of our rights as Quebecers is threatened. No 
one in this country wants to hold back Quebecers against their 
will. No, what the separatist leaders defend is their capacity 
to maintain confusion on their project. They are upholding their 
so-called right to confusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the Government of Quebec has reacted to the announcement 
of this bill with a most regrettable display of polemic frenzy. 
Among other niceties it has said that the bill is of Soviet 
inspiration, designed to turn Canada into a prison, and that it 
dishonoures Canada in the eyes of other democracies. 
If Canada is to be described as a “prison” for not 
contemplating its own divisibility other than through legality 
and clarity, just how would we describe all those democratic 
countries that declare themselves to be indivisible, starting 
with the United States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois should stop asking its researchers to swarm 
the library of the House of Commons to try to find out about the 
referendum acts of American states. The United States' 
constitution provides that the country is indivisible. The same 
goes for France, Italy, Spain and Australia. And how should we 
describe the indivisible country into which the separatist 
leaders want to transform Quebec? A prison? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that by obliging itself in law to negotiate 
secession under circumstances of clarity Canada is displaying 
unprecedented openness in the democratic world in the face of 
the secessionist phenomenon. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, for my many fellow citizens who have Canadian unity 
at heart and who will thus be saddened to see their parliament 
pass legislation that contemplates the possible breakup of 
Canada, they may rest assured that their federal government is 
firmly convinced that if things are clear Quebecers will never 
renounce their full-fledged Canadian support. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is convinced that Quebecers will always 
choose to stay in Canada, will always work from the inside to 
make Canada better, will always accept a helping hand from their 
fellow Canadians, and in return will never deprive them of the 
remarkable contribution of Quebec's culture and vitality. As 
Quebecers, we will never want to deprive anyone, be it ourselves 
or our fellow human beings, of the benefits of Canadian unity, 
here at home and throughout the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the unity 
debate in Canada has surfaced again with a vengeance.  Most 
Canadians are neither keen to open this subject nor ready for the 
arguments that follow.  I feel the country has referendum or 
unity fatigue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Prime Minister has decided that there is no better 
time than now to clarify referendum rules so I will speak to the 
bill in the following way.  First, I will speak to why the 
official opposition supports the basic principles behind the 
bill.  Second, I will present some suggested changes.  Third, I 
will suggest that there is a major missing component to the bill. 
Fourth, I will review the history to show how visionary the 
official opposition leader has been on unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform, as the official opposition, supports the bill because it 
does improve the chances that a referendum on secession by any 
province will be conducted fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill lays out specific criteria for Canada's elected 
representatives to respect the principle of clarity.  Is it 
reasonable to expect the question on such a serious matter as 
secession to deal with only that topic?  I think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it reasonable for the question to specifically refer to a 
province “ceasing to be a part of Canada”? I think so as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These ideas are fundamentally fair.  A province may ask any 
question of its population, but to be clear enough to divide a 
country the question cannot be ambiguous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to state that the province must propose the 
question and only the province can do that under our referendum 
law.  No one else can provide the wording, but to have legitimacy 
everyone should be able to accept the result of a question posed 
that cannot be misunderstood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear majority has also been referred to in the bill.  On this 
point I also concur.  I feel that a clear majority should be 
defined in such a way that no one could misunderstand exactly 
what that means.  I will return to that point later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now reflect on the changes that I think would improve the 
bill. First, there is the issue of a clear question.  Since the 
subject is open to debate, I believe it would be wise to place a 
sample question in the bill as a suggestion to a province 
intending to hold a secession referendum.  I stress the word 
suggestion.  The following is the official opposition's sample 
question that meets our personal test of clarity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Should—the name of the province—separate from Canada 
and become an independent country with no special legal ties to 
Canada, yes or no?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only a proposal. Why should sovereigntists oppose such a 
question?

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now to the somewhat more complex issue of the clear majority. 
The government treats this issue a bit like a poker game. 
Both the Prime Minister and the intergovernmental affairs 
minister have said that 50% plus one is not good enough.  They 
then, however, hold their cards close to the vest and refuse to 
say what is good enough.  I listened carefully to the arguments 
that state that this cannot be defined.  However, this issue is 
not some tactical battle.  It is not a poker game.  It is an 
issue that involves millions of Canadians.  I believe that the 
plain truth is always better than tactical strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use a hockey analogy to show how I feel changing the 
rules can backfire and fail.  In 1955 the Montreal Canadiens won 
the Stanley Cup.  What a team it was, so fast, so difficult to 
check.  Jean Béliveau scored three goals during one penalty and 
it was determined that was too big an advantage.  In 45 seconds 
there were three goals, a hat trick.  That summer the rules of 
hockey were changed.  A minor penalty was now to be terminated as 
soon as a goal was scored.  This rule was changed for but one 
reason: to slow down this fast skating team from Montreal.  The 
rule change failed.  An even more determined Canadiens team went 
on to win four more consecutive Stanley Cups. The rule change 
backfired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us fast forward to 1984.  The Edmonton Oilers were then the 
dominant force, another fast, offensive oriented team. 
Coincidental minor penalties for four on four gave them an 
advantage.  Four on three was even more of an advantage.  They 
won the Stanley Cup in 1983-84.  The rules were changed that 
summer so that coincidental minor penalties gave no advantage to 
this fast skating team.  The rule change failed again.  They went 
on to win three of the next four Stanley Cups, even more 
determined than before to overcome the rule change.  Again the 
rule change backfired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe changing the rules on a suitable majority could 
backfire as well.  The last two referendums were run under 50% 
plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No, they were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  The intergovernmental affairs minister 
says “no”.  Let me simply say that when the Prime Minister said 
that this issue would be irreversible, and when the Prime 
Minister, right after the referendum, said “We won”, he in fact 
said that this rule was the one we expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully because I said this was debatable.  I 
say to my colleagues across the way that they should bring 
forward the powerful arguments they have to make this debate 
clear to every Canadian.  I simply ask for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform supports and argues for 50% plus one of all the ballots 
cast, including spoiled and rejected ballots.  That would prevent 
electoral shenanigans from affecting the result.  We also 
believe—and this is the flip side of that coin—that 50% plus 
one is a powerful deterrent.  If 50% plus one could divide Canada, 50% 
plus one could also divide Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have laid out and, if an unclear question were asked under a 
provincial secession referendum attempt, we propose a two pronged 
question.  I will shorten the question.  First prong, “Should—a 
province—separate from Canada, yes or no?”  Second prong, 
“If—the province—separates from Canada should your community remain 
a part of Canada, yes or no?”  What a mess.  What chaos.  Who 
would enter such a disaster knowingly? 
One other issue that could and should be improved in the bill is 
the level of public consultation.  The government rightly notes 
that this is not just an issue for the province wishing to 
secede, but neither is this just an issue for politicians nor 
just for journalists and professional commentators.  This issue 
cries out for public consultation, public hearings and vigorous 
debate.  The debate should not be conducted behind closed doors. 
It should be conducted around the kitchen tables of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has highlighted some problems with secession that would 
need to be negotiated, namely the division of assets and 
liabilities, any changes to the boundaries of a province, 
aboriginal claims and the protection of minority rights.  This 
list is not exhaustive.  I might suggest that the bill could also 
mention citizenship, passports, pensions, creditor confidence, 
the Canadian dollar, international agreements, an access corridor 
if the province is in the centre of Canada, defence issues, 
military assets and a potential rejoining of Canada.  All these 
issues make separation chaotic and very unappealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the official opposition put forward its ideas for improving 
the federation and laying the clear rules for secession, we made 
it plain that the secession rules would be debated and passed in 
parliament but never proclaimed unless a secession attempt were 
made.  That was in the hope and belief that positive changes to 
the federation would make this legislation unnecessary.  I 
suggest the bill before us could well be improved by exactly the 
same proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now to the gaping hole in the bill.  It may be unfair to call 
this a hole in the bill, but along with this bill we believe 
there should be specific measures to improve our federation. When 
this issue is raised in questions to the government, we hear that 
the government has actually made significant changes.  I hear 
that the recognition of distinct society, a regional veto and the 
social union are evidence of those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these are not the sorts of changes that I think 
Quebecers and other Canadians want.  Once again the official 
opposition has put its significant changes to paper in “Loi

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition in chapter 17 of his book <I>The 
New Canada,</I> and I ask my colleagues to read chapter 17, laid 
out with a clarity of vision the unity issue and foresaw exactly 
where we are today.  I invite any student of Canadian history to 
look at the copyright date, which is 1992. This is a short 
quotation from the book: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This revival of the concept of Canada as an equal partnership 
between founding races was doomed from the start.  Even in the 
1960s it was profoundly out of step with the times.  The 
Québécois wanted to be “maître chez nous”....  Federal 
politicians responded by trying to bolster a national duality 
that had been in decline for ninety years.  The cultural 
backgrounds of people in English-speaking Canada were becoming 
more and more varied. Quebeckers were calling for less 
bilingualism, not more bilingualism, in their own province and in 
the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most importantly, Canadians outside Ontario and Quebec were 
beginning to realize fully the real significance of the “two 
nations” theory of Canada.  A Canada built on a union of the 
French and the English is a country built on the union of Quebec 
and Ontario in which the other provinces are little more than 
extensions of Ontario.  Moreover, arrangements giving special 
constitutional status to the French and the English as “founding 
peoples” relegate the twelve million Canadians who are of 
neither French nor English extraction (including aboriginal 
peoples) to the status of second-class citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say that this history describes the constitutional 
road that federal politicians and their predecessors have 
travelled for a very long time.  It is a road marked by signs in 
both official languages that say things as equal partnership 
between French and English, founding races, languages and 
cultures, and special status based on race.  It largely bypasses 
the constitutional concerns of Atlantic Canada, western Canada, 
northern Canada, aboriginals and the 12 million other Canadians 
who are of neither French nor English extraction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, this road leads to an unbalanced federation of 
racial and ethnic groups distinguished by constitutional 
wrangling, deadlock, regional imbalance and a fixation with 
unworkable linguistic and cultural policies to the neglect of 
weightier matters such as the environment, the economy and 
international competitiveness. That was in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 9, 1994 the Leader of the Official Opposition published 
an open letter to the Prime Minister asking him to bring clarity 
to the issues of a secession referendum.  He asked the Prime 
Minister: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister, we cannot stand by passively and allow Quebec 
voters to make the decision—separation or Canada—without 
offering them a vigorous defence of Canada, including a positive 
federalist alternative to the status quo.  And we cannot let them 
make their decision without disputing the separatist contention 
that separation will be a relatively uncomplicated and painless 
process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was in 1994 before the last referendum.  He went on to lay 
out 20 issues that would need to be negotiated, including 
division of assets and liabilities, boundaries, native rights and 
minority rights.  Does that sound familiar? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in the spring of 1996 we brought out our 20:20 vision for a 
new Canada: 20 proposals for a new confederation; 20 realities of 
secession.  That was clear as a bell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-341 was given first reading October 30, 1996.  That bill 
was Stephen Harper's act to establish the terms and conditions 
that must apply to a referendum relating to the separation of 
Quebec from Canada before it may be recognized as a proper 
expression of the will of the people of Quebec.  It set out the 
ground rules for a clear question. 
Does that sound familiar?

laying out ways to rethink the Canadian federation and improve 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 20, 1998 there was the supreme court reference, which 
we supported alone among the parties opposite the government, the 
government having asked for it.  We asked for two things: 
clarification on secession rules and new partnership rules to 
make Canada work better.

taking into consideration the Prime Minister's wish to finally 
clarify the secession rules.

everyone in Canada will know that the Leader of the Official 
Opposition has ploughed this ground before.

a question that could result in separation.  It leaves undefined 
the issue of what would be a suitable majority and I repeat, I

positive changes to the federation that will truly put the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today is a very sad day indeed as the House of Commons prepares 
to deny the legitimacy of the national assembly to trample upon 
democracy in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to have a proper understanding of what is going on, we 
must go back over history to learn from it and to identify the 
key figures of yesterday and of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec people, who were then called Canadiens or even 
Canayens, were conquered by the British in 1760.  This was a 
victory for one side and a defeat for the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then Quebec has had no desire for revenge.  In fact there 
have instead been several attempts to reach an agreement between 
the two peoples.  The Canadiens of the time, who later became 
French Canadians, and still later Quebecers, invested all of 
their imagination, their goodwill, in getting along with 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, one fundamental and undeniable requirement 
for this: recognition of what we are, a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That objective has not been attained, despite much effort. 
Throughout history democrats in Canada have stood up to open 
their arms to Quebec, but their point of view has never won out. 
This, unfortunately, has been the case for a number of peoples. 
Some Canadiens, later French Canadians and still later 
Quebecers, offered their services to the conqueror, and now to 
the rest of Canada, in order to put the people of Quebec in 
their place, to do a number on their fellow Quebecers, which 
they could do a far better job at than their masters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History is replete with individuals for whom principles and the 
defence of their own people are of very little importance 
compared to the power they can gain, the kudos they get from it, 
and the perks of all kinds that are forthcoming to those who do 
the dirty work for others, who are only too pleased not to have 
to do it themselves.  That held true yesterday, and holds 
equally true today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout its history the Quebec people have resisted, have 
fought for their rights and have obtained some, even in 1774 with 
the Quebec Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There people, by their resistance fighting, got one of the first 
parliaments in the world, the parliament in Quebec City in 
1791. Our democratic roots go a long way back. In Quebec we 
have a long tradition of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1791 parliament did not really have much power, no more than 
the modern parliament in Quebec has every power, as it is not 
sovereign. The people were denied power then and will again be 
denied power now, 200 years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec are a tolerant and peaceful people, but 
they will not live on its knees or let others decide on their behalf. 
This is as true today as it was then. Men and women rebelled 
against the uncompromising attitude of the British back then. 
They were called the Patriotes. Our ancestors are a true 
inspiration to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were definitely ahead of their time. Forerunners of the 
modern Quebec, they fought for their people, not for an 
ethnic group. Among them were men like Robert Nelson and Wilfred 
Nelson. They recognized native rights. It took 150 years for 
another Patriot, René Lévesque, to rise in 1985 and recognize, 
before any other Canadian province and the Canadian government 
itself, the first nations' right to self-government, as provided 
for in the motion of the national assembly that was not 
unanimously accepted because Quebec Liberals voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Patriotes fought along with the Upper Canada Patriots, the 
democrats of the time, against the family compact or la clique 
du château, laying the foundations of the kind of co-operation 
that is needed between democratic neighbours and treating each 
other as equals. This was long before sovereignists started to 
talk about this. These were the first steps in what we now call 
a partnership between equals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Patriotes were crushed, as we know, but their legacy is 
still alive. At the time, however, the authorities did not learn 
anything from these rebellions.  They responded with the Durham 
report, which said that the people of Quebec, the people of 
Lower Canada, were a people with no history and no culture. 
Today, 160 years later, this government denies the existence of 
the people of Quebec, makes Quebec culture a regional component 
of the Canadian culture and is trying to undermine our 
democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Durham laid the foundations of the union of the two Canadas, the 
Province of Canada, the plan for a single Canada that now has a 
much more subtle, pernicious and dangerous look. This plan was 
based on equal representation in parliament, even though the 
population of Lower Canada was significantly larger than the one 
of Upper Canada. Today we are told that all provinces are 
equal, Quebec only being a province like the others, no more no 
less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only official language of the parliament of the time was 
English. Today Ottawa, the federal capital of this supposedly 
bilingual country, is not even bilingual. And this is what the 
government wants to hold up as an example. How history repeats 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower Canada paid for the debt of Upper Canada, which did not 
have debt. Today we are told about the great generosity of the 
federal government, which paid off its deficit on the backs of 
the provinces, knowing full well that the one who has the money is 
the one who sets the rules. 
This was once called fair play, and still is. In my view, this 
was once hypocrisy, and still is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who wielded power at the time even went so far as to burn 
down the parliament  building in Montreal. Today their heirs 
want to give us lessons in democracy. Let us talk about 
democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the men known as the Fathers of Confederation signed the 
1867 pact, they did not allow the people of Lower Canada to hold 
a referendum. They were satisfied with the votes of a few 
parliamentarians, as was the case in 1982 for the patriation of 
the constitution. The assemblies of the other provinces and the 
House here made the decision without ever consulting the people 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when a whole series of attacks began against 
French-speaking Canadians from coast to coast. Now the House is 
paying tribute to Riel, who was hanged. But the problems that 
gave rise to the situation with Riel were never resolved. 
The Metis and the natives are second-class citizens in Canada. 
Francophones in the other provinces are more than ever in danger 
of becoming assimilated, despite the laudable efforts they are 
making across Canada to resist assimilation. The figures do not 
lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation was passed in Manitoba and Ontario on behalf of the 
majority and for the sake of fair play to hinder the development 
of francophone minorities. That is what I call hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the French Canadians who believed they were one of the 
founding nations of this country never gave up. I am thinking, 
for instance, of people like Bourassa. Hon. members from the 
province of Quebec have always been asked to help Canada put 
Quebec in its proper place. It happened before, and it is 
happening again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members from Quebec in this House whose ultimate job 
is to put Quebec in its place. 
As time went by, as Canada developed as a country, the 
consolidation of Hugh McLennan's two solitudes became more and 
more obvious. We can think of the conscription in World War I, 
where the militia even went as far as opening fire on people in 
Quebec City, killing a few protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anglophone majority was counting on its parliament in Ottawa 
and on London to put Quebec in its place. It did happen in 1927, 
with the privy council's decision concerning Labrador, but 
French Canadians kept trying to make Canada their country, and 
they were consistently deceived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promises concerning conscription were broken in World War II. 
Today the government would have us believe that by not 
determining what would be an acceptable majority in a Quebec 
referendum it will keep its promise. We have heard that before. 
The federation became increasingly centralized with the creation 
of the unemployment insurance program in Ottawa and the 
introduction of income tax for the duration of the war, or so 
they said at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>French Canadians continued to fight. We were patient. Then 
came a great awakening, the quiet revolution, when Quebec 
discovered itself while discovering the world. “Masters in our 
own home”, said Lesage. Our own home meant Quebec. It could no 
longer be anything else. At that time only Quebec was 
considered home by all Quebecers. It was true then, it is true 
now, and it will still be true tomorrow. “A mari usque ad mare” 
was a dream, and it became an illusion. The quiet revolution 
marked the start of an overwhelming impulse, with Quebecers 
moving from resistance to affirmation. 
The Quebec culture was flourishing like never before. Quebecers 
were taking control over their own affairs and penetrating the 
business world. We were being told that we were not able, that 
we could not create Hydro Quebec. It was always the others, 
always the same who were telling us “You cannot do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember this beautiful slogan, popular in 1966, “We can do 
it”. We were told “You are not good at business”. We certainly had 
enough blows. Ottawa reacted by establishing the Royal 
Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. In 1963 we found 
out that, on average, Quebecers had a grade nine education. 
Enough to be water boys but not nation builders. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec then focused on education. It took control over its 
destiny. Quebecers developed a taste for freedom, and we all 
know that those who get a taste for it never have enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is when the sovereignist movement appeared in all its 
modernity. It provoked reactions in Canada. I think of Lester B. 
Pearson who spoke of “a nation within a nation”, and of Robert 
Stanfield who referred to “two nations”. Some people were 
starting to see us for what we were, for what we are, a distinct 
people, a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came out of Quebec a French Canadian who was ready to play 
the role that Canada generally assigns to those who agree to put 
Quebec in its place. Pierre Elliott Trudeau did not miss a 
chance to criticize Quebec's modern nationalism. 
According to him, nationalism was a good thing for all other 
peoples around the world. It was good for Canadians, but a 
shameful disease for Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then a real nation building effort started, the Canadian nation 
building, in which Quebec never had its place, still has no 
place and will never have a place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet Quebec persevered. We have great patience. Daniel Johnson Sr. 
put forward the concept of equality or independence. 
Nobody listened. He was even rebuffed by Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
We understood then that there could never be equality without 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the great hope, the blueprint for the future that was 
put forward by the Parti Quebecois, a resolutely modern and 
democratic party, the bearer of a project of hope, a 
contemporary and modern project that finds its inspiration in 
Europe, where various sovereign countries are getting together 
into larger entities such as the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federalists have denounced this project; they would have had 
the people believe, back then as today, that Europe was taking 
Canada as a model. How I would like to see the Prime Minister go 
to the national assembly of France and predict to its members 
and senators that within 15 to 20 years France will no longer be 
a sovereign country. How I would like to see the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs go to Westminster and announce to the 
British people that within 15 to 20 years Great Britain will 
disappear into a large European entity, having lost its status 
as a sovereign country. And while we are at it, why not have the 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport go to the Bundestag in 
Berlin and bring the good news to the Germans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a modern project we are proposing. 
Ottawa's answer to this modern plan was scaremongering, a 
favourite tactic on the part of those who have nothing to 
offer. Then came the Brinks affair, and the War Measures Act 
whereby hundreds of innocent people were thrown in jail. We can 
already see the hand of today's Prime Minister in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was so sure he had succeeded that in August 1976 Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau turned prophet: “Separatism is dead in Quebec.” 
Three months later, René Lévesque and the Parti Quebecois formed 
the first sovereignist government in Quebec's modern history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec witnessed then a tremendous momentum. It was the scene of 
many achievements in the area of democracy, opening up to 
others, to Canada, to the world. René Lévesque offered a policy 
of reciprocity regarding Quebec's anglophone minorities and 
Canada's francophone minorities, which are supposedly a concern 
of this legislation. The Canadian provinces turned him down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the hypocrisy of some people, such as the hon. member 
for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, who says that anglophones in Quebec 
are being discriminated against. Let us look at the facts. 
Anglophones in Quebec have access to a state-of-the-art hospital 
network while, right here in Ottawa, the only francophone 
hospital in Ontario, the Monfort hospital, has to repeatedly 
fight for its life before the supreme court. There is no 
comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's anglophones have access to a school network ranging 
from elementary school to high school to college, with three 
universities of their own, McGill, Bishop and Concordia. They 
have rights and so they should. Look at the painful situation of 
francophones outside Quebec. They have their own social and 
cultural institutions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compare this to an assimilation rate of 70% in British Columbia, 
over 60% in the prairies, 40% in Ontario, and even 8% in Acadia 
where the francophones, a courageous breed, the Acadians, are 
fighting with all their might and are dreaming of enjoying the 
same living conditions as anglophones in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parti Quebecois government proposed a referendum that would 
provide it with the mandate to negotiate a new framework for 
Quebec's relationship with Canada, the kind of relationship 
between two sovereign nations, and the kind of modern 
association that can exist between two sovereign nations. That 
was a project based on the European model a project, I repeat, 
which was promising. 
Was it not the U.S. president himself, Bill Clinton, who in 
Mont-Tremblant used the evolution of the European Union as an 
example of federalism development in the future? How is it that, 
if it is so promising for Europe, it could be so bad for Quebec 
and Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response of the federal government was to try to scare 
Quebecers in the 1980 referendum, telling them that they would 
lose their old age pension, showing no respect for Quebec's 
democratic referendum process, spending federal funds to 
interfere in that process without any consideration for the 
Quebec referendum legislation and promising change, sticking its 
neck out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec got scared. It believed in change one more time, but the 
disappointment was huge. 
We then saw the patriation of the constitution, following the 
night of the long knives, in which, once again, the present 
Prime Minister took part. This is one thing that has remained 
constant in our history over the last 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution was patriated despite a very large consensus 
in Quebec among all parties represented in the national 
assembly. Not one Quebec premier, federalist or sovereignist, 
from Lévesque to Ryan, leader of the opposition, to Robert 
Bourassa, to Daniel Johnson Jr., to Pierre-Marc Johnson, to 
Jacques Parizeau to Lucien Bouchard, signed the constitution, 
and Jean Charest would not sign it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was done to Quebec at that time would have never been done 
to Ontario or even to Prince Edward Island. And it was done 
without a referendum. That insult, that injustice, did not bring 
Quebec to capitulate. It continued to fight and tried to work 
toward a reconciliation. 
This was the “beau risque”, which paved the way to the Meech 
Lake accord. Once again Quebec was isolated and once again we 
saw the current Prime Minister say “Thank you, Clyde” for a job 
well done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point, Robert Bourassa said that English Canada must 
clearly understand that whatever happens and whatever is done, 
Quebec is and always will be a distinct society, one that is 
free and quite capable of taking charge of its own destiny and 
development. 
He created the Bélanger-Campeau commission that carried out broad 
democratic consultations and recommended that a referendum on 
sovereignty be held if renewed federalism were to fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers tried to figure out what they would do either within 
Canada or as a sovereign nation and they examined the pros and cons. 
It may be about time for Canadians to ask themselves the same 
question. How do they see Canada with Quebec and how do they 
imagine Canada without Quebec. They should address this issue. 
It would be the responsible thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Mr. Bourassa lacked confidence in his fellow Quebecers 
and backed down. He signed an agreement that had yet to be 
drafted—talk about clarity—an agreement based on legal documents 
that had yet to be drafted, an agreement that would never have 
been distributed to the population were it not for the 
opposition party. The agreement fully embodied the two 
solitudes. Both sides voted no, but for very different reasons: 
the agreement was not enough for Quebec and too much for the 
rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new government was elected in Quebec, a sovereignist 
government that submitted for a second time to Quebecers a 
sovereignty project along with a new partnership proposal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was clear. Nowhere in the opinion of the supreme 
court does it say that the question was not clear. Nothing in it 
excludes a partnership proposal with some federal or confederal 
bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Ottawa, there is only one kind of federalism on this earth 
and it is the one in existence in Canada. There is only one kind 
of relationship, one kind of collaboration possible, and it is 
what we have now in Canada. For Ottawa, the rest of the world 
does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I remember, during the referendum campaign the Prime 
Minister very eloquently predicted that we were going to get it, 
that we were going to get under 40% of the votes. We know what 
the results were, even after the love-in that was held, with 
total disregard for the 
Quebec referendum legislation, where people came to tell us that 
they love us when we are subservient, when we are pliant, when 
we are down on our knees and when we are Liberal. More promises 
were made after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distinct society motion had no substance at all. We were 
told that “The motion would impact on all the bills passed in 
the House”. However, take the Young Offenders Act. All of the 
political parties represented in Quebec's national assembly as 
well as all the lawyers, judges, social workers and even police 
officers have stated “We do not want this new bill. Let us keep 
the system we have in Quebec, which has given us the best 
results possible in this area”. What impact did the distinct 
society motion have on the recognition of this consensus? None, 
none at all. It had no substance at all. We knew it and we see 
it once again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A so-called veto was also given to all of the regions. This led 
to total paralysis, as we saw with the Meech Lake accord, where 
not only a province or a territory, but a single individual was 
able to block what Quebec wanted. To top it off, we were offered 
a social union. There were two distinct views: one in favour in 
Canada and one opposed in Quebec. The Liberal members in this 
House, a minority here, we remind them, once again supported the 
Canadian view, ignoring the view in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This belittling of Quebec is a true obsession with the Prime 
Minister. Inspired by his muse, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, he is now going after the powers of 
the national assembly. He would like to impose the wording of 
the question on the national assembly. 
Yet, in 1994, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said 
that the words secession, separation, sovereignty and 
independence all meant the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently, this is no longer the case.  He has changed his 
mind. I suppose he would also say that Quebecers are not 
intelligent enough to decide if a question is clear;  the folks 
in Vancouver, Moose Jaw, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, who know 
all about clarity, must be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tells us that elected representatives in the national 
assembly are incapable of clarity, as are the federal members 
from Quebec in the House of Commons, the 44 Bloc Quebecois 
members in Ottawa and the four members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party who are not in agreement with the bill. The 
Liberal members from Quebec are in the minority, but we would 
not understand.  The 26 Liberal members from Quebec know what is 
best. 
This is nothing more than contempt and arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same bill questions the rule of 50% plus one.  Let us 
consider Newfoundland.  Why?  Two referendums.  Why did 50% plus 
one apply in the case of Newfoundland?  Why was Quebec never 
consulted when Newfoundland joined confederation in 
1949?  Why this double standard?  Why did the government not set 
figures, rules, percentages and thresholds in its legislation? 
Undoubtedly because it was afraid of being challenged 
internationally or in the courts.

it any less so to set one once the results are in?  How can 
Ottawa be judge and judged?  What are these relevant conditions 
for setting the percentage?  Again, Ottawa will decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the federal government, the Liberal party, essentially the 
sole bearer of the truth, the whole truth?  By raising the issue 
of partition in this bill, is the government not going back on 
all its positions with respect to maintaining the borders of new 
countries, such as the Baltic countries, the Ukraine, the 
federated republics of the former Yugoslavia?  How can it take 
one stand internationally outside the country and another here 
in the House for Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They who have so much to say about consensus and clarity, do 
they not see a great consensus in Quebec within our civil 
society, among all parties represented in the Quebec national 
assembly, even federalist parties, among the vast majority of 
members from Quebec who were democratically elected to this 
House, within the Progressive Conservative Party, I suppose, and 
I hope within the NDP, which recognized Quebec's right to 
self-determination? Those are the ones who are on the side of 
democracy, but this government just ignores them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who do we find on the other side, on the side of the Prime 
Minister's Liberals? The Reform Party, which has a great 
presence in Quebec and a good understanding of Quebecers, Guy 
Bertrand, Bill Johnson, Keith Anderson, Howard Galganov. Is that 
the Liberal consensus in Quebec? Is that their great consensus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we get to this point? Because support for sovereignty 
went from 8% in the 1960s to 49.6% in 1995. In his 35 year 
career the Prime Minister will have seen sovereignty surge like 
never before in our history. Seeing this incredible surge and 
unable to propose anything to Quebec, he thinks the best thing 
to do is to prevent Quebecers from making a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing can resist the will of the people. Quebecers will 
not give in to Ottawa and will remain masters of their own 
destiny. Someday we will see two peoples who respect each 
other, who appreciate each other and who do not prevent each 
other from going forward in the direction they each want to 
follow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege today to rise to participate in a remarkable debate in 
the history of our country.  Today we speak frankly and openly 
about how our country might break up through legal and democratic 
means.  That this is a debate that arouses great passion should 
surprise no one, great passion among parliamentarians and among 
Canadians in general. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are talking frankly and openly about a sensitive 
issue: how to legally and democratically break up our country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every federalist who participates in this debate must do so with 
the determination to make sure that possibility never happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly outline some recent efforts of the federal New 
Democratic Party to do just that.  I will share the basis of my 
optimism that if we proceed with appropriate sensitivity, with 
careful deliberation and mutual respect, we can succeed and we 
can emerge a united, strengthened Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately after the 1997 federal election the New Democratic 
Party launched its social democratic forum on the future of 
Canada, a party task force that undertook a thorough study and 
broad consultation on possibilities for improving the way Canada 
works for all of its citizens.  Over the subsequent two years we 
held literally dozens and dozens of meetings in every corner of 
Canada.  We talked to ordinary Canadians and representatives of 
organizations who are earnestly engaged in the work of trying to 
make Canada work better for all of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we learn from those meetings and those discussions over 
the past two years?  We learned that there is a real appetite to 
make Canada work more effectively and that there are a lot of 
good practical ideas about how we can accomplish that.  We found 
that vast numbers of Canadians remain committed to doing the work 
that is needed to make our federalism more responsive to a rich 
diversity, the rich diversity which is Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They remain committed to making it a responsive federalism, a 
federalism presenting all the advantages of a common citizenship 
and preserving all the rights inherent with that citizenship, 
and a federalism reflecting the many regional, linguistic and 
cultural differences which make Canada the country that it is. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main pillars of responsive federalism must be an 
effective social union.  In the framework we advocate, social 
programs would have enforceable Canada-wide standards as a right 
of citizenship, but those standards and mechanisms would be 
co-decided between the federal and provincial governments acting 
as genuine partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the social union to work and for the unity of this country 
to be strengthened, provinces must have the flexibility to 
respond to local conditions effectively, and the federal 
government must be a reliable fiscal partner.  If there is one 
thing this government has not been in recent years it is a 
reliable fiscal partner with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To strengthen Canadian federalism, the number one thing the 
government must do is to undo the damage it has inflicted on our 
health care system, post-secondary education programs and 
critically important social welfare programs administered by the 
provinces.  Through careful investment of the surplus the 
government can improve the quality of life of individual 
Canadians and strengthen the bonds of federalism at the same 
time.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another quality of responsive federalism is to craft federal 
institutions and relationships that accurately reflect the unique 
position of particular cultural and linguistic communities in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the quiet revolution in Quebec the country has been 
grappling with exactly how to recognize Quebec's unique character 
both in terms of constitutional language that accurately and 
symbolically describes that uniqueness and in terms of particular 
federal arrangements that practically recognize that unique 
character. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That project failed, but we have to find a way to cut the 
Gordian knot if we do not want another referendum to be held in 
Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's aboriginal people represent another community whose unique 
place in Canadian society cries out for action.  Recommendations 
of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples have still not 
been implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats joined with others in celebrating the passage 
yesterday of the Nisga'a treaty legislation.  However let us make 
no mistake about it.  The work of attaining justice for our 
aboriginal people is only just beginning.  If we are sincere 
about national unity we must redouble our efforts to pursue the 
simple, positive project of making Canada a better place to live 
for all its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, and let me make it very clear, discussion of the 
legislation before the House today can never be a substitute for 
improving the Canadian federation to prevent a future referendum 
that would result in the breakup of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are debating had its origins in the opinion of the 
Supreme Court of Canada on questions relating to the right of 
Quebec to secede from Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of that opinion was that Quebec could legitimately 
separate from Canada if a clear majority of Quebecers answered 
yes to a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court also said that negotiations on the secession 
should be held in accordance with the principles of federalism, 
democracy, the constitution and the rule of law, and in a context 
of respect for minorities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This opinion establishes two essential things about the way a 
future referendum should be handled within the framework of 
Canadian democracy and federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that Quebec under certain conditions could 
legitimately secede from Canada. In the words of the court, “the 
continued existence and operation of the Canadian constitutional 
order could not be indifferent to a clear expression of a clear 
majority of Quebecers that they no longer wish to remain in 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a party that supports and has always supported Quebec's 
democratic right to self-determination, New Democrats welcome 
that confirmation of Quebecers' democratic values and 
perspectives on the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In setting out that the rest of Canada would be obliged to 
negotiate secession with Quebec only on the basis of a clear 
majority on a clear question, the supreme court also established 
that the elected representatives of Canadians would have a 
legitimate circumscribed role to play in a future referendum.  As 
committed federalists and democrats, New Democrats also support 
this principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is an attempt to set out a framework 
for the response of this parliament to a future referendum 
according to the supreme court ruling about the role of 
parliament.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think this is an exact reflection of the supreme court 
opinion, and there are many complex elements both in the opinion 
and in this bill which require a more thorough examination. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes in the bill are advisable.  There is work to be done, 
but New Democrats will be supporting the bill in principle at 
second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure all Canadians that we take very seriously our 
responsibility to play a constructive role in working out a 
framework for an appropriate federal role in a future referendum 
that lives up to the supreme court decision.  We intend to play 
that constructive role.  We take it seriously.  We invite all 
Canadians to draw inspiration from the supreme court ruling where 
it underscores that “a functioning democracy requires a 
continuous process of discussion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I implore the Prime Minister in particular to listen to 
the court's urgings.  Regrettably there is no evidence so far to 
suggest that the Prime Minister is willing to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, the Prime Minister could have taken a number of 
initiatives to discuss this issue and consult all interested 
parties in order to determine how we could discharge the 
obligations set out in the supreme court opinion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister could have referred the supreme court 
decision to a parliamentary committee to offer suggestions but he 
chose not to do so.  The Prime Minister could have held a first 
ministers conference to consider the question but he chose not to 
do so.  He could have initiated a dialogue between the House of 
Commons and the Quebec national assembly to see if there were 
some common ground but he chose not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, he could have acted responsibly and democratically in 
the spirit of the court's opinion and reflected the longing of 
Canadians for constructive nation building, but to date he has 
chosen not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the moment the Prime Minister began weeks ago issuing 
mysterious statements about his intentions, escalating the 
insulting and disrespectful rhetoric toward the Quebec people, 
and challenging other federalists to agree with a position which 
he refused to clarify, he defiantly set out to antagonize other 
federalists, other federalists in the House, federalists in 
Quebec and a good many federalists across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a transparent and shameless attempt to play politics with 
the future of the country.  It is a deliberate ploy to distract 
the public from the pressing responsibilities and many failures 
of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Prime Minister chose to announce his 
intentions literally hours before the 10th anniversary of the 
pledge of the House to eradicate child poverty in the country 
speaks volumes.  The Prime Minister wants to play politics with 
this important question.  His actions over the past couple of 
weeks have made that clear, but we cannot and we will not let 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today New Democrats pledge our willingness to offer a 
constructive contribution to the study and the improvement of the 
bill in committee.  We want to make sure that the bill reflects 
as closely as possible the democratic responsibilities set out by 
the supreme court.  We will be proposing amendments that we 
believe are necessary to achieve that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section of the bill dealing with the clarity of the majority 
sets out a framework where the rules of the game would not 
effectively be set until after a secession vote is held. Fears 
have understandably been aroused about the potential for abuse by 
the House of Commons in arbitrarily rejecting a clear majority 
after the fact.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes out of its way to say that the views of the Senate 
should be taken into account in the deliberations on the clarity 
of the question and the majority.  Surely this is an absurd 
notion for a bill that is supposed to live up to a democratic 
ideal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that I was astonished that the Conservative Party 
had taken the position that the Senate deserves an even greater 
role than the one set out for it in the bill.  In the entire 
process of consideration and negotiation the role of first 
nations also needs to be carefully considered if the bill is to 
truly reflect Canadian reality and Canada's obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I look forward to considering these as well as 
other issues raised by Canadians in the process of studying the 
bill.  We urge the government to take a similar approach of being 
open to amendments in its work at committee.  Indeed the way 
the government treats the committee process and its openness to 
amendments will be the test of the Prime Minister's true motives. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister really want a bill that is a true 
reflection of the supreme court opinion, or does he want to go 
on playing little games that are dangerous for the future of our 
country? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the debate we will be seeking a truly democratic and 
constructive process, one that can open the door to all 
federalists.  In some cases that means reopening the door to some 
federalists so that they can all work constructively on building 
a united Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of all, I hope the work on the bill does not distract the 
Prime Minister or parliament from the critically important task 
of building a better Canada, one that meets the hopes, dreams, 
needs and aspirations of all our citizens so that the legislation 
that we are debating today will never be required.

question for the leader of the New Democratic Party is very 
simple.  She listed a number of very convincing arguments on why 
this is bad legislation and why the government is playing 
meanspirited politics with the national unity issue to advance 
its own short term goals at the expense of the long term interest 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having articulated so forcefully why this is bad legislation, 
how could she possibly be supporting the legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raises a 
very understandable question.  Given how very distressed we have 
been and remain about the actions of the Prime Minister, about 
the cynicism and the crass political manoeuvring that preceded 
the introduction of the bill, why would we be willing to consider 
it in good faith?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will answer the question.  We are prepared to look at the bill 
on its merits and to consider it in good faith because that is 
the job that is required of us as parliamentarians.  We must try 
to make a distinction between whatever the political motives may 
be or whatever the political manoeuvring of the party in power 
may be.  I think we all have some pretty big suspicions about 
that.  I have outlined some of them today.  We have to separate 
that from what is truly in the interests of Canada and what is 
truly the route to a strengthened united Canada that is going to 
work better for all of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, there are improvements needed.  The manner in 
which government members and the Prime Minister participate in 
that process will indicate whether this is a project worthy of 
support and whether the final results can indeed advance a 
stronger united Canada.  We are prepared to take our 
responsibility as parliamentarians to play a constructive role in 
that process.

on the government bench takes under serious advisement our urging 
that government members come to the committee process and 
participate in this debate in a way that is absolutely respectful 
to the rights and interests of all people of Quebec.  They must 
be sensitive to the fact that there obligations upon all of us to 
understand that we have to find new ways to create a more 
flexible federalism that will respond to the particular 
conditions of Quebec, just as we need to do the same as it 
relates to aboriginal Canadians.  If government members are 
prepared to do that, then I think we will all discharge our 
responsibilities as representatives of the interests of all 
Canadians within Quebec and across this great country of ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I very much welcome 
that question.  I am not sure whether the member was listening to 
my comments, but that is precisely why I opened my discussions of 
the New Democratic Party position on this debate with a proud 
reference to the social democratic forum and the recommendations 
that were endorsed overwhelmingly at our federal convention in

that the people of Quebec want to separate from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court decision that is reflected in the legislation 
now before us acknowledges exactly that right.  It also makes it 
clear that it is not possible to take the view that there is no 
other impact, that there are no other implications for the rest 
of Canadians. Therefore it acknowledges both a right and a 
responsibility, a circumscribed, very particular, limited role on 
the part of the federal government. It is around our doing the 
most careful and sensitive job possible of defining what that 
role is in which the Parliament of Canada is now engaged.

expect that members listened to my comments over the last half

no intention of allowing the government to use the bill as an 
excuse for not dealing with the critical problems of child 
poverty and homelessness, with the worst agricultural crisis in 
this country since the great depression, with the deterioration 
of our health care system and with the access barriers to 
post-secondary education that have been erected for our young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in total agreement and so are my colleagues that those are 
the priority issues.  That is why we implore members on the

Nevertheless, our party's line is clear: we will fiercely oppose 
the Liberal government's initiative.

us how to break up our country and, in the meantime, how to 
shatter the common interests that parliamentarians share in the 
hope of eradicating poverty. Why not try to build something 
positive to solve this problem? Instead we are given 
the instructions on how to break up a country. We are told how 
to destroy parliament. We are told how to drive a wedge between 
family members, individuals and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the provinces. The supreme court has always 
referred to the politicians. The federal government has decided 
to act on its own and ignore the provinces. How many provinces 
today have stated that they agree with the federal government? 
They are divided. Is that what the federal government's strategy 
is all about? This is pure machiavellianism. It is more than

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Where does Ontario stand on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B> Four out of four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> They are divided, that is true. Is that the 
kind of country you want? Not me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important here, and it is even mentioned in the bill, is 
that the role of the provinces is a residual one. It is subject 
to the federal role. Even though Quebec and Ontario are the two 
main trade patterns, Ontario has officially no say in this. 
Nowhere does the opinion of the supreme court give the federal 
government an additional role compared to the provinces. 
However, the federal government has decided to negotiate on 
behalf of the provinces and to take into consideration their 
points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take into consideration? Did it consult the other provinces 
about this? Did the provinces introduce a bill like this one? 
Did they give to the great federal government the authority to 
negotiate secession on their behalf? I am not sure that 
Albertans would agree to that. I am sure that Ontarians would 
disagree. I am not sure the maritime provinces would support the 
Liberal government and say “Yes, if Quebec separates, go ahead 
and negotiate on behalf of maritimers. You have the 
authority to do it. We rely on Ottawa to negotiate on our behalf 
and on behalf of western Canada”. This is hogwash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more. In addition to excluding the provinces from the 
negotiations following the secession of a part of Canada, there 
is talk of excluding the opposition here. There are speeches 
about uniting during the Christmas holidays. But here we are 
talking about dividing as a country before the Christmas 
holidays. But that is another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I had forgotten to tell you something. First, I 
really appreciate having you as a Speaker and, second, I will 
divide my time with the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill, the government, in addition to excluding the 
provinces, is technically excluding the four opposition parties 
here. Why? Because it talks about the House of Commons. It says 
the House of Commons will analyze all this. Looking at the way 
the Liberals have been conducting their business since 1993, we 
see that it is the PMO that makes the decisions. However, the 
PMO, the Prime Minister's Office, is not Canada. Is it clear 
enough? The decisions should be made by all parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government bill is silent. The government talks about 
negotiating sovereignty, secession, and says that parliamentary 
rules will remain the same. It does not even talk about free 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking with the hon. member for Tobique—Mactaquac this 
morning. 
I asked “Why not have a free vote on that?” He said “Why 
not?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But they are not saying what we will be voting on. We do not 
even have a resolution. There is no analysis of what a clear 
question is. We do not even know if our negotiations in this 
House are clear.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What percentage will be needed for the House to say that there 
is a clear majority? What percentage of the votes cast? Will we 
use the parliamentary rule which requires 50% of the votes plus 
one? Will the governor in council or the Prime Minister's office 
decide if the question and the majority are clear? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not say in the bill that members of parliament will be more 
involved and, above all, that provinces and regions of Canada 
will be involved? There is nothing like that. It is the silence 
of the lambs. There is absolutely nothing to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only one who is given a role is the Prime Minister, so that 
he can say that the question is not clear and that the majority 
is not clear. 
There will be a short debate in parliament, but, knowing the 
parliamentary process as we know it, we can anticipate a closure 
motion and the debate will be cut short. We will be told “Enough 
talking. We find that it is not clear enough”. The provinces 
will be told “You can write a letter if you want and tell us 
what you think, but we will make the decision”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what the supreme court said. The bill was introduced 
last Friday thanks to a little trick. They used to accuse the 
former premier of Quebec, Mr. Parizeau, of trickery. However, 
promises were made and agreements were concluded with the House 
leaders. They were told “This is an important bill, an important 
draft bill. We will wait for everybody to recover from the 
madness the Reform Party put us through, and we will come back 
with it next week, when everybody is rested”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no, the draft bill was tabled. What is going on? What a 
great beginning for negotiations. 
If the government is not even capable of treating 
parliamentarians with respect, imagine the provinces, imagine 
Quebec.  This is nothing to be proud of.  It is not just the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, I realize, there is a 
little gang of people controlling the procedural aspects of the 
government. This is a slap in the face of democracy.  They could 
have waited until Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened is that he introduced it and then he took off. 
After that, out came the ministers, one after another.  The 
Minister of Finance came out first of all with his “Hi there, 
how are you?  I am in agreement with it”.  Then, two minutes 
later, the Minister for International Trade said “Oh yes, we 
are fine with it”.  That is the way it was done.  All the people 
who had nothing to say on the matter, who remained silent, were 
anxiously waiting to be told “Go out there, we will be timing 
you”.  That is the way it went—a lovely sight to behold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was off in my riding, settling some real business, like making 
sure some people on unemployment would at least get a cheque for 
Christmas, because they have children too. It is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were the ministers all saying, one after another “Oh yes, 
it is reasonable”.  But at that time no one had seen the bill. 
Many MPs were off in their ridings.  There were the initial 
reactions.  Mr. Clark put it very well, borrowing a quote from 
Robert Stanfield “Nothing is easier to do than to turn the 
majority in a country against a minority”.  Nothing is easier to 
do than to divide this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a bill.  Hooray.  We are one of the few countries in 
the world that now has such a thing.  We have a recipe book. 
The finest country, the best place to live, now has a recipe 
book on how to break up.  That is really something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is nearly up. 
I can get emotional.  When Quebec is being discussed, it affects 
me.  When they come up with such a piece of legislation, when I 
am taken for a fool, it affects me.  It upsets and offends me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it true that one of the winning conditions for the 
separatists would be to have as prime minister a party leader 
like Joe Clark, since Mr. Joe Who likes to be chummy with the 
separatists? If we had not a clear question, everything would be 
lost with Mr. Clark as prime minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke 
is part of a political party that will go down in history as one 
that always went around major constitutional conferences to find 
a solution with long knives. Thus I do not need him to give me any 
lessons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Mr. Clark, the hon. member should come to Quebec to 
see how well Mr. Clark is, a priori, appreciated and respected by 
Quebecers. This morning the newspapers were saying that 
Mr. Clark is consistent. So, on that score, the Liberals have 
nothing to say to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many parties in the House that are flip-flopping. 
First, there is the government party that is flip-flopping on the 
issue, to an unbelievable extent. It was against the Meech Lake 
accord, against the Charlottetown accord. It centralizes 
everything in the Prime Minister's office. It gives nothing to 
the provinces. And now it has decided to deal with national 
unity. Reform flip-flops. The NDP members are also flip-flopping. 
It is unfortunate, but I must say that we are the only 
federalist party which still believes in Canada and which is 
against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy for Mr. Clark. However, if they think that Mr. 
Clark is a winning condition for sovereigntists, they are wrong 
because he is a winning condition for the country, including 
Quebecers. When the time comes, Quebecers will decide what their 
future will be. 
Once they decide to vote for the Progressive Conservative Party, 
they will do it. It is as simple as that, and we have no lesson 
to learn form them, particularly from the Liberal Party. The 
Right Hon. Joe Clark is taking a stand, and it is not easy 
because he is faced with quite a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, everybody agrees on certain elements of the secession 
process. By the way, we use words like secession, sovereignty, 
independence, sovereign country interchangeably. Secession is a 
process; the result is sovereignty or independence. If Mr. 
Clark, the Right Hon. Joe Clark, comes to power, unlike the 
present Prime Minister, who feeds on the sovereignty movement, 
he will put a stop to that, he will find a way to co-operate in a 
completely different way and as fast as possible, I hope. I 
think it is high time we stopped working ourselves into a state 
over all this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
outset of his speech the member said that this bill is an 
admission of failure by Canada because the government, whether 
it is Liberal or Conservative, cannot succeed in improving the 
constitution nor the country to accommodate Quebec and to do 
what Quebec has always requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed an admission of failure. Obviously, the federal 
government wants to reject Quebec and to treat it like any other 
minority instead of recognizing that Quebecers really form a 
single people. It is an admission of failure, and I must say to 
the Conservative Party member that it does not matter whether 
the government is Liberal or Conservative, because Canada does 
not accept Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I mentioned earlier people who 
are working themselves into a state and the problems of the 
ultra federalists and of the ultra separatists, who both exist 
and need each other to live. What is clear is that when I 
mention the admission of failure, it is the failure of this 
government I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the Conservative Party has a completely different 
vision of the way our federation should work and of the respect 
that should be shown for the regions and the provinces. It is 
that spirit that has to be developed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to prove to me that a man like Mr. Clark tricked 
Quebec. I know that is impossible to prove. Our party did not 
trick Quebec. There were hard times in the history of our 
country, but I can assure members that the Conservative Party 
gives Quebec the recognition it deserves and that it also gives 
Canada the recognition it deserves, that of a country where 
Quebec has its place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I commend my dear colleague for Richmond—Arthabaska. 
Unfortunately, I cannot express myself in the other official 
language of Canada, but my passion for the French language, for 
Quebec and for the country is as great as his. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has been very kind to this country.  We have enjoyed a 
great deal.  We have enjoyed freedoms, bountiful gifts of natural 
resources, prosperity and peace for much of our history. 
However, we continue to struggle with national unity. 
Although our country was forged from the fire of two warring 
nations on this continent, we continue to be engaged in some form 
of warfare.  That is not the wish of the Conservative Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little that is certain about the aftermath of this 
debate, but one thing can be sure:  passions will be inflamed and 
emotions will run high.  This bill makes secession respectable 
and more accessible.  This bill is not about clarity; it is about 
confusion.  It will not lead to a conclusion, but more confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ill-timed to introduce this legislation before the 
country.  The national agenda has been hijacked and it will cause 
contentious debate to erupt at a time when the focus should be 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fear is that the Liberal definition of clarity will give 
separatists the winning condition which they have sought.  A red 
flag has been waved.  We question, as Conservatives, the process 
and the timing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strategically, the Prime Minister has brought this legislation 
before the House immediately prior to the holidays, ensuring that 
this debate will continue without opposition.  We understand that 
this was done over the protestations of senior cabinet ministers, 
caucus colleagues and many advisers within the province of 
Quebec.  As before, Canadians will once again embark on this 
divisive, destructive debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is not a positive framework for negotiation. It 
is in fact a provocative and threatening attempt at undermining a 
lasting relationship that we have enjoyed in this country. 
Instead of drawing Canadians together, this legislation provides 
a road map to secession.  It codifies a process to permit a 
province to leave confederation and it says nothing of actions to 
create a common purpose, but it will bring about fear and 
loathing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not progress for Canada.  It is not leadership.  It is 
not the leadership that we should expect from a government and 
from a prime minister.  We have already received an opinion from 
the Supreme Court of Canada which clearly recognizes the 
requirement of a clear question.  No one is against clarity.  Why 
is it necessary to repeat this in legislation?  It becomes a 
classic double-edged sword. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will allow or be perceived to allow the federalists the power 
to cut off disingenuous separatist tactics.  Premier Bouchard is 
once again going to be elevated into his rhetorical and lofty 
debate over self-determination.  He will tell Quebecois that English 
Canada has abandoned them and in the end it will be 
imposing its will over Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we allowing this to happen at this time?  This issue 
detracts from many important issues:  health care, unemployment, 
education, brain drain, agriculture, fisheries and, of 
course, poverty.  All of these issues are real issues, real 
issues that face Quebecers and all Canadians.  These are some of 
the pressing issues that we should be debating at this time. 
Positive efforts to address them are being delayed by this 
ill-timed, ill-conceived initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government efforts should clearly be focused elsewhere.  We 
should be convincing Quebecers to stay rather than making 
provocative threats.  Like the sword of Damocles, this 
legislation will hang precariously over the heads of Quebecers 
from a thread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are left to believe that the Prime Minister is embarking on a 
legacy building attempt.  Running roughshod over the objections 
of others, he calls this nation building.  We know the often 
quoted phrase that patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. 
Canadians should not forget about the Prime Minister's 
participation in flawed constitutional repatriation attempts or 
how he helped cynically to torpedo past attempts at putting the 
country's contentious unity debate to rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will, of course, recall how he disappeared in the 1995 
referendum campaign.  What confidence should Canadians and the 
provinces have that the Prime Minister will do their bidding?  He 
has clearly demonstrated in the past that he does not understand 
nor respect Quebec.  He appears as the Prime Minister who is 
trying to define or defend his legacy with the imposition of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should not be put in jeopardy to appease the Prime 
Minister's ego or afflict his legacy in envy on the rest of the 
country.  This is a personal, meanspirited and divisive process 
meant to provoke Mr. Bouchard and Quebec at a time when the 
Quebec premier is mired in real issues, issues such as labour 
unrest, high unemployment and financial problems in health care 
and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are going to try to capitalize on what they 
perceive as a vulnerable period in the life of the Pequiste 
government.  The Bloc, the Pequiste and Mr. Bouchard appear to be 
at their lowest level of popularity, but this issue, make no 
mistake about it, will breathe new life into the debate of 
separatism.  The smiles on the faces of our Bloc colleagues here, 
members of the House, signal that this has begun. 
The war has begun.  The Bloc and Bouchard will reload and get 
ready for this divisive debate.  Obviously the Conservative Party 
opposes this legislation for reasons much different than the 
Bloc.  The Liberals will carefully word their press releases and 
try to spin it that somehow we are cozying up to this movement. 
Let us make it very clear that is not the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party has always stood proudly for a united 
country.  Our party has always sided with history on nation 
building from Macdonald to Clark.  Make no mistake about the love 
of this party for our whole country.  It is a birthright that we 
will not neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possibility of an early referendum and an early election is 
signalled by the introduction of this legislation.  Let us be 
clear on one thing.  The timing, the wording and the method all 
indicate that this legislation is about crass politics, putting 
Liberal electoral fortunes ahead of the long term fortunes of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has proven time and time again that he is a 
ruthless, reckless partisan.  This is a very dangerous game. 
While it is politically clever, it ensures Bloc seats, helps the 
Reform Party, keeps the country polarized and the implications 
for Canada are grave. The potential backfire of this manoeuvre 
could cost us dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the Reform Party has aligned itself with the 
Liberal government.  This is the same party we all recall that 
ran ads with red slashes through the faces of Quebec leaders in 
the 1997 general election, and yet it purports to understand 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard from the NDP leader who spoke adamantly against 
the bill, railed against the politics of the Prime Minister's 
move, and yet she stated that her party will support it, a weak 
and submissive move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is currently no provision in our constitution for a 
province to secede.  However, for the first time in our history, 
this bill would have Ottawa spell out the steps for separation. 
The legislation will now give Canadians an entrenched plan 
through legislation to dismantle the country.  It legitimizes the 
separatist movement.  It is not necessary but it is temporarily 
politically popular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I am wrong in my prediction of an early referendum, but I 
suspect we will see an unclear question, not about separation but 
about the right of self determination, which sadly the 
separatists could win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and its brand of federalism is autocratic 
and insulting.  The Prime Minister and his government are acting 
like bullies.  Co-operation and compromise, the essence of 
federalism that built this country, are put aside.  Parliament is 
ignored,  the caucus that the government has brought together has 
been brought in line and some cabinet ministers have been 
silenced. That is not democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Charest, who went to Quebec for the right reasons, is 
finding that now he has to fight a prime minister as much as he 
has to fight the separatists.  The federal Liberals continue to 
wound the man who has preserved stability in Quebec.  As he has 
done on many occasions in the past, the Prime Minister has 
directly undercut Mr. Charest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial premiers will wait to see how this plays out but 
there is certainly unease.  No real discussion or consultation 
took place, just perfunctory calls informing them of the 
legislation.  They were not given the opportunity for input or 
opinion.  Instead, they were dictated to.  The responses from the 
premiers have been less than enthusiastic.  We have seen from the 
provinces of Ontario, Alberta and certainly New Brunswick that 
there is increasing discomfort with the Prime Minister's 
pre-emptive move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lukewarm support is not going to help the country at this time. 
All parts of the country will be affected.  My home area of the 
maritimes is certainly very much in jeopardy as a result of what 
has occurred.  It will not be clarity.  There will be a profound 
negative effect if the government continues on this line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is silent on the issue of 50% plus one.  We know 
that 50% plus one in this House will defeat a bill or will defeat 
a government.  The Prime Minister himself received the electoral 
support of only 38% of the Canadian population, so he is very 
unclear on this particular aspect of the legislation.  It is 
contrary to democracy to suggest that anything other than 50% 
plus one is to be accepted.  This is a hasty and poorly drafted 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has always endorsed the 
approach of co-operative federalism.  We have often liberated the 
country from the straitjacket of false federalism of the Liberal 
Party of Canada.  Currently, we are involved in national 
grassroots policy consultation to best determine how Canadians 
would make this legislation acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the season of goodwill and reconciliation, the Prime Minister 
has chosen the opposite direction.  He has undermined the 
historic partnership and widened the two solitudes.  We hope to 
be able to introduce some useful amendments that would at least 
enhance the legislation.  We will wait to see, with anxious 
hearts, how the Liberal government will react to those 
legislative changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is an experienced orator and debater.  I 
take it he can confirm that the position of his entire party, the 
Conservative Party of Canada, is that a 50% plus one vote of 
those who vote will dismantle the country.  If that is the case, 
how is it that we cannot change our own constitution on 50% 
plus one? Why is it that we need to have a much greater and 
clearer majority to change our constitution than Mr. Clark 
appears to want to have to permit the breakup of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, who is also a barrister and solicitor, if we 
are to take it that Mr. Clark disagrees with the Supreme Court of 
Canada that a clear majority is not required and that 50% plus 
one is all it takes to destroy Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the hon. member 
has not stated the position of the Conservative Party or Mr. 
Clark at all.  We very clearly said that the issue of 50% plus 
one is completely absent from the legislation.  It is a very 
reckless piece of legislation in the sense that it puts forward 
just part of the equation.  Fifty per cent plus one is the rule 
of democracy and it has always been that way.  It is how 
elections are decided. It is the democratic principle the world 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, we have never been faced with that situation nor do 
I suggest we would ever be faced with one person deciding the 
breakup of the country.  This legislation does not speak to that 
issue nor does the Supreme Court of Canada clearly pronounce 
itself on what 50% plus one would do if the situation ever arose.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
thank my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party for 
supporting us in the debate on this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like his opinion on this: When the government speaks of 
self-determination, what does that mean for him? Does it mean the 
same thing for him as for the Liberal Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party says “Quebec has full entitlement to 
self-determination”, except that the Canadian government wants to 
tell Quebec how self-determination is to be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before the process is under way, the Canadian government, 
through the Liberal Party, will tell Quebecers how they must 
move toward self-determination to be recognized by the Canadian 
government. We know very well that, no matter how clear the 
question, the Liberal government will never recognize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1993 election campaign the Liberals promised the 
taxpayers “If we are elected, we will scrap the GST, we will put 
an end to the GST, we will tear up NAFTA.” Could something be 
clearer than that? People believed them and elected them, but 
they never kept their promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we believe them when they say “If the question is clear, we 
will be ready to negotiate”? In their minds, clarity has nothing 
to do with the facts. They will go on doing as they please.

bat that we are not supporting the Bloc position on this.  We are 
clearly opposing this for very different reasons, reasons that 
pertain to national unity as opposed to setting up a plan for 
dismantling the country as this bill will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has very articulately and clearly set out a less 
than proud record that the Liberal government has amassed. He has 
chronicled some of the reversal of unfortunate positions that the 
government has engaged in over the last 50 years.  It has 
occurred on wage and price control and on the price of gasoline. 
It occurred on the GST.  It occurred on free trade.  The list 
goes on and on.

Canadians in the past to trust it and upon being elected has 
simply done the opposite.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Cohen was both an esteemed writer and a neighbour.  He 
contributed significantly to the Canadian literary scene.  It was 
in 1969, at the age of 26, that Mr. Cohen published his first 
novel, entitled <I>Korsoniloff</I>.  From then, he was involved in 
30 books, including novels, Quebecois translations, children's 
books, short story collections and books of poetry.  It was for 
his novel, <I>Elizabeth and After</I>, that he recently received 
the Governor General's Literary Award for fiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Cohen pushed for the right for writers to be able to receive 
payment for the library use of their works.  Mr. Cohen kept 
writing even through his illness. Therefore, even as we mourn his 
loss, we can anticipate a book of his short stories that will be 
published by Knopf Canada next spring; his last gift to 
Canadians.

8,000 tonnes of industrial chemicals were flushed into sewers.

of cancer causing industrial waste, of which approximately 81% 
ended up in the air, 18% in landfills and 1% in water. These 
figures are incomplete because resource extraction industries are 
not required to report in the inventory, and not every pollutant 
must be reported.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a well known fact that we in western Canada love our 
pickup trucks.  Mike Nickerson was visiting Texas when he saw 
every cowboy's dream, a stretch limousine pickup truck. Realizing 
a market exists for such a truck in Calgary, he mortgaged his 
farm and risked his life savings to purchase the $200,000 
vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truck passed Alberta safety regulations with flying colours 
and business was booming.  Even Tom Selleck hired the longhorn 
limo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alas, enter bonehead Boily who called Nickerson stupid for 
thinking a stretch pickup would be allowed in Canada.  Then 
without even looking at the vehicle, he declared it unsafe and 
seized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Boily, if Mr. Nickerson wants his truck declared 
street legal, all he has to do is crash it into a wall and set it 
on fire to see if it is safe.  And he calls Nickerson stupid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe Boily's boss, the Minister of Transport, should volunteer 
to be the crash test dummy.  Maybe then Mr. Nickerson might agree

as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in agreement with our government's passing a bill on 
the question.  I do not believe it is up to Ottawa to dictate to 
Quebec the procedure it must follow.

disagree.  Having revealed his thoughts, however, and led people 
to believe he was opposed, the member for Abitibi—Baie 
James—Nunavik hastens to add that he will be voting with his 
government.  This is a clear illustration of how brave the 
Quebec Liberal MPs are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate, the masks are off.  The choice between their 
personal future in politics and the interests of their 
constituents is clear: a good little Liberal looks after his

continuing to be yes-men.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the solicitor general is spending $2.5 million in his own riding 
to research drugs in prisons.  The only problem is that there are 
no federal prisons anywhere on Prince Edward Island.  There is 
already an addiction research centre in Ottawa.  One would think 
that would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drugs in prisons are a serious problem, but pork barrelling will 
surely not fix it.  Why does the rest of the country have to pay 
for the solicitor general's multimillion dollar vote grab? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that my hon. colleague 
does not really understand the problems in our prison system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was appointed solicitor general and realized that 70% of 
the people who enter our federal institutions either have alcohol 
or other drug problems, I indicated a number of times in the 
House that is where we should start, and that is where the 
government is going. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think all of us in this place understand that there is a drug 
problem in prisons, but there are far more suitable places to do 
that research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just said that there is a place already in Ottawa.  There are 
lots of empty buildings just down the road at CFB Summerside. 
Those places are empty; they are up for grabs.  Why does the

drug problem? 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if everything were so simple it would be 
wonderful.  What happens with these problems is that I ask the 
department to evaluate where this institution should go.  The 
director of Correctional Service Canada indicated that this was 
an appropriate place to build the building.  That is why this 
building will be constructed where it is to be constructed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps it does look like everything is so simple.  It is a 
special kind of logic that allows him to justify a prison 
research centre in a province with no prisons.  It is a bit like 
studying rainfall in the Sahara.  It is pretty dry over there; 
they are getting ready for Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want the government to fight drugs in our prisons. 
That is not the issue.  However the solicitor general belittles

alcohol and drug abuse in our penal institutions.

it is a wonder that was imposed on Quebec against the will of 
its national assembly, a wonder that even tired old federalists

that, overall, that document is beneficial to Quebecers in many 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these benefits are a Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms that is popular everywhere in the country, including in 
Quebec; the entrenchment of the principle of equalization in the 
constitution which, as we know, benefits Quebec; the 
strengthening of the rights of language minority communities 
across the country, and we know that Quebecers care about the 
future of francophones. Also, we would like this city, Ottawa, 
to be bilingual. Incidentally, I dare say—

that Mr. Ryan never became Premier of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1982 constitution leaves Quebec bound and gagged. Now the

the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs justifies his bill on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

to set a framework whereby the Government of Canada must 
negotiate if the process is clear and must not negotiate if it 
is not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this bill follows up on the supreme court opinion, which 
uses the word secession, which is the legal term to describe the 
act of separating from a country to create a new one.

are serious offenders.  This disgraceful record emphasizes the

here is an interesting one.  The RCMP headquarters has directed

duties from the import of grey market equipment.  People are 
taxed on the way in and then they are charged for possession, all 
because the government wants to know what they are watching on 
TV.

this question is for the Minister of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act was passed by 
this House it included a requirement for a five year review. Will 
the minister tell us what he plans to do with regard to the 
review and will he specify the timeline for the review? 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is correct.  After five years of 
operation it is time to have a review of the act to see if it can 
be improved.  That will take place starting now and for the next 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be an interactive website, which will allow rural 
Canadians in particular to take part, and there will be some 17 
meetings at urban centres across the country.  I trust that 
within a year it will be possible to report to the hon. member 
and to the House the results of that review.

Speaker, through access to information I learned that the RCMP 
now employs 391 paper pushers on the government's fatally flawed

leaves the RCMP desperately short of police on the street. In 
B.C., for example, there are 300 full time vacancies and 200 
temporary vacancies.

law enforcement.  That is why $10 million of extra money was 
allocated to the E-Division in British Columbia.  That is why 
Treasury Board, along with the RCMP and my department, are 
evaluating the situation.  That is why it was indicated in the 
Speech from the Throne that this government has a commitment to 
law enforcement in the country.  This government will make sure 
that public safety is always the number one issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a question of privilege.  On June 3, 1998, I introduced 
Motion No. P-24 for the production of papers.  I resubmitted it 
in this session and it is now called Motion No. P-11 and states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, a humble address be presented to Her Excellency praying 
that she will cause to be laid before this House copies of all 
documents, reports, minutes of meetings, notes, correspondence 
relating, prosecutions and issues related to extradition 
concerning the bombing of Air India flight 182 in 1985.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am arguing that a response with the information, the papers I 
requested, was deliberately delayed and there was an attempt to 
deliberately mislead me into believing that there were no papers 
when it is well known that there are papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I must have misunderstood. 
Did the hon. member accuse another hon. member of deliberately 
misleading him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker.  I am not accusing 
anyone of deliberately misleading me.  I would like to explain 
the process that misled me to believe, which will become very 
clear in my following sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have waited 18 months for a response.  The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons 
told me to withdraw Motion No. P-11.  He showed me a return from 
the justice minister that was the response to Motion No. P-11 saying 
that there are no papers.  The return has not been tabled and the 
table clerks do not have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a November 22, 1999 memo from the parliamentary secretary 
to the government House leader asking me to withdraw my motion. I 
regret to conclude that it seems there is a deliberate delay of 
the response to my request.  I have been waiting since 1998.  If 
there was a problem with the reading of my motion, I should have 
been told long ago.  However the motion is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, I am seeking your assistance, Mr. Speaker, to dispel my 
conclusion that I have been misled.  Everyone knows there are 
papers.  Why am I the only one, except the parliamentary 
secretary, to have seen the ministerial return, the response to 
my motion, indicating that there are no papers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the appropriate citations referring to contempt if you 
wish me to continue, Mr. Speaker.  May I continue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. member for Surrey Central to 
wrap it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. I 
will quote from Erskine May, which describes contempt.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as contempt, 
even though there is no precedent for the offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's sixth edition, page 27, citation 97 states— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am aware of the citations without your 
reading them and of course I am taking them into consideration. 
On this particular matter I see the parliamentary secretary 
rising to his feet.  Perhaps he could provide some kind of 
explanation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not think we want to take up too much of the time of the House on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made a Motion for Papers many months ago.  He appears 
to have been the author of his own misfortune by withdrawing his 
notice of motion at the time.  As I understand it, he was not 
aware that he was withdrawing his motion at the time. 
Regrettably some months passed before he realized he had 
withdrawn his motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this parliament he reintroduced a motion which when read in 
the English language clearly requests information related to 
prosecutions arising out of the Air India tragedy.  As you will 
know, Mr. Speaker, there were no prosecutions arising out of that 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has urged upon the government another interpretation 
of the English words that he used in his notice of motion.  As a 
result if one were to accept that I am sure, as the member has 
already admitted, it would take a couple of truckloads to deal 
with the amount of paper he has requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day I was not aware that the member was about 
to rise.  I assumed that further discussions would be had in 
relation to the volume of paperwork he was seeking.  I suggest 
there is absolutely no contempt here at all.  There were ongoing 
discussions until a week or so ago.  The member is at least in 
part misinformed by himself and misrepresented by his own 
language in his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would wish to make every attempt in good faith to 
respond to his need for papers.  I am certainly ready to continue 
with that at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will rule that what we have here is 
not a contempt of the House.  I would invite the hon. member to 
do two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there has been an open invitation to more consultations. 
He might consider that.  However, if he wishes to go another 
route, I suggest he consult the table officers and he will find 
there are other avenues open to him to get this type of 
information.

SECESSION REFERENCE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK214">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-20, an 
act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in 
the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
Secession Reference, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Sudbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Brossard—La Prairie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to speak today to Bill C-20 since this debate is very 
important to me. In addition to the issue of the majority and 
the clarity of the question, this debate deals with a 
particularly important point, namely what would be at stake 
should there be a referendum, namely the breakup of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put forward this legislation because the choice the 
people of Quebec would have to make for the third time in 20 
years is fundamental. We have to make sure our democratic ideal 
remains untarnished. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing what we are doing because we owe it to all 
Canadians.  In a word, we owe it to Canada.  When our country is 
envied around the world, the world can expect no less than that 
we ensure the transparency of the referendum process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to determine the question because that is the job 
of the national assembly, but we have the responsibility and the 
duty to ensure that the process does not give rise to the 
underhandedness we saw in 1980 and in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to set the criteria that will guide the conduct of the 
House of Commons and the Government of Canada in determining what 
constitutes a clear question and majority.  That is our duty as 
Canadian parliamentarians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec have the right to determine their own 
political future. Nobody on this side of the House is denying 
it. All we want to do is ensure the choice they would make 
through a referendum is a fully informed one, which means the 
question must be clear.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is for their choice to be shared by a sufficient 
number of supporters, and for it to be the unequivocal 
expression of the will of the people, which implies a clear 
majority. It is not surprising that under such conditions the 
supreme court in its opinion insisted to such an extent on the 
concept of clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our determination to act is based on the parameters set by the 
supreme court with regard to the referendum process. We have 
been blamed countless times for having asked the supreme court 
to clarify certain aspects of the referendum question. We did 
it, fully aware that some people would not be pleased. 
We decided to do it anyway because we do not see democracy as a 
toy or as a credit card one can use as one pleases without being 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy finds its true meaning when it allows people to have 
real influence on their future. That must be the objective 
pursued in any referendum. Was it the objective pursued by the 
PQ government in the 1980 and 1995 referendums? We all know the 
answer to that is no. The objective was to find a question that 
would allow the PQ government to get as many votes as possible. 
That is why we have no choice but to step in to ensure that the 
basic requirements of democracy will be met in a possible third 
referendum. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be lying if I said we get any pleasure in doing what we 
are doing today.  Canada is a country that works well, but it is 
also a demanding country to govern.  It faces many challenges at 
the dawn of the new millennium.  We would far prefer to devote 
all of our efforts to the substantial challenges of economic 
growth and jobs but we would be derelict in our duty to Canadians 
if we did not deal with this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy consists of giving the people a voice, but in a 
referendum on secession everything has to proceed in a context 
of clarity with a clear question and a clear majority.  All of 
the trumped up precedents and arguments used by the separatist 
leaders to advance their cause are now coming home to roost 
because their initiatives have been based on ambiguous and 
misleading questions.  That is what has to change if the Bouchard 
government, which certainly has no lack of other issues to deal 
with, goes ahead with its plan to hold another referendum during 
its current mandate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate could have taken a totally different turn had Mr. 
Bouchard responded positively to the Prime Minister's proposal. 
What was that proposal? The Prime Minister of Canada proposed in 
good faith to set aside the referendum debate and to work 
together toward solving the problems that really concern 
Canadians. What was the answer given by the Premier of Quebec? 
True to form, he said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we be surprised? No. Mr. Bouchard is a prisoner of his 
option. He is a prisoner of his party, which wants a third 
referendum at all costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot accept the breakup of my country, of our country. We 
are all Canadians. 
We are part of a large family, and it is our ancestors, mine and 
those of the members over there who are trying to break up our 
country, who helped to build this great country.

<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech by the 
hon. member, who pointed out that three referendums were held on 
this issue in the last 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that the 1992 referendum was held at the 
request of the federal government in an attempt to renew the 
federal system, and it did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1980 and 1995 referendums were held by governments that had 
received a mandate to do so, and every time they acted they had 
the support of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois members sitting in this House were elected in 
1997 and make up the majority of elected representatives from 
Quebec. They received their mandates after the 1995 referendum. 
The current Quebec government was elected last year, just a year 
ago, and clearly stated its determination to have a referendum 
on sovereignty, because it is the only way for Quebec to sort 
out its relationship with the rest of Canada and to break out 
from under the yoke of the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member not aware that the will of Quebecers is being 
systematically ignored by the federal government, which is 
making no attempt to find some way to keep Quebec within 
the federation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is making no effort toward this end. It 
only tries to confine Quebec in a neat little box, which 
explains why all Quebecers are expressing their dissatisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member have to say to Quebecers about this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I am really saddened by the 
remarks of the hon. member from Kamouraska. I gather from what 
he said that Quebecers never got anything out of Canada and are 
denied prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly painful for me to listen to that, because my 
own ancestor landed in Kamouraska in the mid-1600s, around 1642 
or 1652. He founded a family, the members of which settled in 
all parts of the country, not only in the Kamouraska and 
Rivière-du-Loup area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am a Franco-Ontarian member of parliament, and I am 
proud of the work my ancestors did. We share the same ancestors. 
They were the founders of a great region of this country. The 
hon. member's remarks are unfortunate, because, to us, a country 
is something very important. We should not take lightly the 
breakup of a country. And we do respect democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many referendums shall we have? Quebecers have said no twice 
already. This is hardly respect for democracy. But since the 
Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois have decided to keep 
talking about referendums, we have a duty to put forward clear 
rules in order to protect democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The ex-minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> That is right. The ex-minister. If the 
promotion of the French cause was so important for her, why did 
she pick an unilingual anglophone as her chief of staff? She 
also chose to receive her correspondence in English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor does she mention the assimilation of francophones. In the 
city of Hamilton, which the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
represents, there was, according to Statistics Canada, an 80% 
assimilation rate. 
When she talks about the great French Canadian family, I would 
like to remind her that her predecessors at the Association des 
francophones hors Québec, representing francophones from the 
rest of Canada, supported the yes side during the 1980 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau:</B> Madam Speaker, we have to stop playing

</I></B></P><P align=left>My own included the following: first, as a Quebecer I believe in 
Canada; second, as a Quebecer I believe in its democracy; third, 
as a Quebecer I believe in its future; fourth, I believe that in 
spite of all the flaws that our country may have, these flaws 
should not affect our future prospects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the convictions that I expressed to the voters of 
Brossard—La Prairie, and they gave me the mandate to promote 
these convictions, because they share them. 
This is why day after day, if not hour after hour, I strive to 
fulfil my responsibilities with integrity, decency and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that context that I rise today to support the clarity 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly explain how I view the role of the Canadian 
parliament in this regard, a role in which parliament must 
respect the Quebec national assembly as much as it must respect 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec Referendum Act passed by the national assembly in 
December 1977 allows a government—in this case the Quebec 
national assembly—to consult the population on a specific 
issue. The national assembly has an indisputable and essential 
right in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can, very legitimately, decide alone to hold a referendum. 
It can, very legitimately, decide alone which question it will 
ask. It can, very legitimately, note the results of that 
consultation. However, after that public consultation the 
Quebec national assembly must make a political decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the consultation a political decision must be made. Under 
the circumstances, the issue for the Quebec government then 
becomes the following: on the basis of the public vote on the 
question that was asked, can we legitimately undertake 
negotiations on the secession of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate my point, let me quote Robert Burns, who was a 
minister in the government of Mr. Lévesque in 1977. He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, in the current situation, a referendum can only 
have a consultative value, even if this consultative value does 
not diminish in any way the moral value of a referendum with the 
government, which will not, I believe, override with impunity 
the clearly and widely expressed will of the people. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what the Parliament of Canada is doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We, like Mr. Burns at the time, make a connection between the 
“clearly and widely expressed will of the people” to the 
legitimacy of our decision, as political actors, to enter into 
negotiations for Quebec secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, it is clear that this bill does not aim in any way 
at giving a framework to the national assembly. It aims at 
giving a framework to our role, as the federal parliament, in 
case these conditions on clarity are fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has some institutions, laws and processes to allow it to 
fully assume its rights and responsibilities. 
These are exactly the same rights and responsibilities that I am 
claiming on behalf of the Parliament of Canada, the right to 
interpret the legitimacy of the political approach as a 
political actor having responsibility for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, it is the same voters who elect Quebec members to the 
national assembly and  to the House of Commons. Voters have 
given to all of their elected people different but complementary 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am taking the responsibilities given to me by my 
constituents. I am taking them by supporting a bill that is 
necessary today, but which I hope will never be used. Let us 
never again remain silent when myths are spread around. Let us 
never again remain silent in the face of what I perceive as 
manipulation. Let us never again remain silent in the face of 
what I perceive as exclusion policies.

all due respect for members opposite, I think the speech we just 
heard is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, most members present in the House today know that, 
whatever manipulation there is, is coming from that side. It 
takes quite a nerve to rise in the House, claim to be a Quebecer 
and say that the national assembly manipulated people, because 
that is what our colleague said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We represent those who are for democracy. No member on this side 
has any fears about our project. What we want is for Quebecers 
and Quebecers alone to decide on the question and to determine 
their own future. That is what is at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member quoted Robert Burns. 
I happen to be the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve and I want 
everyone to know that each time the people of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve 
had a chance, they always voted for sovereignty, and I am proud 
of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is a sad day for democracy. I hope the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs is not very proud of himself. One can 
be a federalist. There is no question about that. Of course, 
Liberal members from Quebec are elected just as we are, but what 
is not on is suggesting that Quebecers cannot by themselves 
decide on the clarity and the legitimacy of the question. Let 
there be no mistake, there is not a single Bloc member who will 
agree to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely saddened by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs' speech, because convictions are not at issue here. We 
are speaking of people who are against democracy. Today, when 
the minister rose and when our hon. colleague rose a moment ago, 
they said they were not democrats. They are not democrats, 
because if they were, they would recognize the integrity, the 
legitimacy and the validity of the referendum process.

Quebecers sitting in the national assembly and those who will 
vote on this question are the only ones who can decide the 
clarity of the referendum question? Is he going to say that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, first, I noticed that, as the 
hon. member for Québec did informally yesterday, it is very 
difficult for my colleague not to hesitate to consider me a 
Quebecer. I have a lot of problems with that, in terms of 
democracy, since I took the initiative to come here, live here 
and do my part for society here. I have a lot of problems with 
that. Second— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I never 
said that our colleague is not a Quebecer. He is misleading the 
House— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> This is not a point of order 
but a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, through his question my 
colleague spoke to me— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> I suppose this is what they call democracy 
and respect for the right to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague spoke about our right to be federalists. I am happy 
to know that. However, how can he reconcile this statement with 
the refusal, clearly expressed by a majority of Quebecers on two 
occasions, of the option to make me lose my Canadian identity, 
and come back again with this same question? There is an 
inconsistency here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, my colleague talks a lot about the legitimacy and 
integrity of the national assembly. I would like to mention to 
him that my speech was mainly concerned with the fundamental 
right to recognize this essential quality of the national 
assembly. According to me, the House of Commons must have for 
the whole country the same powers and the same rights as those 
exercised by the National Assembly of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is with great respect for the debate 
that we are having here this afternoon that I am honoured to 
partake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in the House just how emotional this issue is, not 
only for the people who live in the province of Quebec, but for 
all Canadians who have lived in harmony for over 130 years, 
trying to resolve through the democratic process the differences 
which the provinces have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been faced more than once with a province which has 
addressed the issue of separation to leave the country we know as 
Canada.  I do not for a minute think that this will not occur 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In anticipation, the government took the issue to the supreme 
court and asked it to make a decision as to whether a province 
could unilaterally leave the country.  The supreme court was very 
clear that it is the democratic right of provinces to address the 
issue of separation, but that it could not be done unilaterally. 
It was quite clear that the court felt that if there was a clear 
question and a clear majority the federal government and the 
other provinces would have a responsibility to negotiate with 
that province which chooses to leave the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings us to the bill which was introduced by the 
government yesterday.  It is a bill which, I presume, tries to 
strike clarity. It may strike a degree of clarity when it 
addresses the question, in that it outlines a question that would 
be considered clear; however, what it does not outline, and 
perhaps should, is what is a clear majority.  It is very hard to 
play a game, it is very hard to be in a game of this nature, when 
we do not know where the goal post is.  We only find out after 
the game is finished where the goal post is.  Therefore, I would 
suggest that the government, in looking at this legislation, 
attempt to reach some clarity as to what is a clear majority. 
If the government feels that a clear majority of 50% plus one is 
not good enough to leave the country, then it should state what 
it considers to be a good enough majority.  I think it is unfair 
to continue this process without that clarity, without the rules 
of the game being known before the game is played.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is anybody in the country who does not 
agree that the rules of the game have to be laid out in the 
beginning.  The Reform Party tried to lay out some rules with the 
20/20 discussion paper of 1994.  We took a lot of heat as a party 
for bringing clarity to what the understanding of Canadians was 
when we talked of separation.  We took a lot of heat for raising 
the issue at that time.  I find it a little ironic that we raised 
the issue when the debate was hot and heavy and the government 
waited until everything had quieted down and the separatists were 
busy trying to run a province, rather than a referendum, to 
revisit the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could question the timing, but I do not think one could 
question the need for establishing clear rules to the game so 
that there is clarity in the question that is asked and there is 
clarity in the result that is delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern that I have is that the federal government in 
the process, for whatever reason, seems to have walked away from 
plan A; plan A being the reasons that we would give to the people 
of Quebec to choose to stay in Canada, developing a new 
relationship between the federal government and the provinces 
which would enable them to have more control and a greater 
ability to define what the future of the provinces would be, 
based primarily on those jurisdictions that were given to them at 
the time of Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had an opportunity with the social union. 
I would argue, and I know it is debatable, that the federal 
government blew it.  It had an opportunity at that time to show 
Quebec how we could change the federation to allow the provinces 
to have greater certainty and greater control over the delivery 
of social programs without the intrusion of the federal 
government in provincial jurisdiction through its spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union, originally developed by the premiers, 
developed some controls or guidelines with which they could all 
agree, a dispute mechanism and an understanding that if a 
province wanted to withdraw or not take part in an agreed 
program, it would have the right to do so and still get the 
dollars that should go to the people of that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For whatever reason, the federal government felt that allowing 
this change in the relationship between the federal government 
and the provinces was not okay, that it was more important that 
the federal government retain its control and its power over 
provincial jurisdictions, primarily through its spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I think the federal government blew it.  I 
think that it walked away from a prime opportunity to show the 
province of Quebec that it would be much better to remain in 
Canada and that in working with other provinces Quebec could 
achieve the best that is possible for that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, again for whatever reason, walked away from 
developing this new relationship with the provinces.  Instead it 
decided to come down heavy with plan B.  The timing is confusing 
to me.  I am not sure this is the time one wants to confront the 
issue.  I would have thought this would have been a more 
appropriate time to talk to Quebec about the division of powers, 
about respecting what is the federal government's responsibility 
and respecting what is the provincial government's 
responsibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even suggest that it is time to introduce a new concept. 
There are some grey areas where neither the federal government 
nor the provincial governments have been given the jurisdiction, 
and where there is a real need to collaborate and negotiate to 
come up with some means of working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area is national standards.  It is not right for a federal 
government to impose national standards on the provinces.  What 
is more appropriate is for the provinces to negotiate with the 
federal government and with each other to come up with those 
standards they feel are appropriate for all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interprovincial trade is another example of the need for 
provinces to work together with the federal government to 
overcome the barriers.  Because it is province to province the 
federal government has to be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are laws like the criminal code which is a federal act and 
jurisdiction but it is applied through the provincial 
governments.  The provincial governments are the ones that apply 
the criminal code to their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me that rather than confront the province of 
Quebec, the federal government should have put more time and 
energy into trying to find new and better ways of working with 
the province.  But the government decided to go to plan <I>B</I>. 
Having its concept of plan <I>B</I> of clarity before us, we have 
to debate whether or not this piece of legislation is going to 
make it clear to the people of Quebec that if they decide to 
leave Canada, there will be some consequences in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1995 referendum I was amazed to see that poll results 
showed that 25% of Quebecers thought that they would still send 
representatives to the House of Commons in Ottawa and that there 
would not be any change in representatives sitting in the House 
of Commons.  Over half of Quebecers thought that they would still 
maintain their Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be very clear to the people who will vote on whether 
or not to leave Canada just what in fact they are leaving.  The 
Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois owe it to the citizens of 
Quebec to be honest and up front with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having sat in the transport committee and having listened to the 
debate in the House and in the committee, it was interesting to 
see how the Bloc represented the debate on restructuring the 
Canadian airline industry.  Canadians have indicated a bit of 
concern that Air Canada's headquarters by legislation are located 
in Montreal. It was interesting to see that the Bloc Quebecois 
wanted to protect that.  It wanted to protect the 10% ownership 
in Air Canada and leave the foreign ownership at 25% in the 
airline industry.  I do not know if the Bloc Quebecois 
understands that if Quebec leaves Canada, then any shareholders 
who own shares in Air Canada in Quebec become foreigners and 
would be limited to the 25% that it was arguing for.  I do not 
know if the people in Quebec understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the illusion the Bloc members are creating 
in Quebec that the separation will be like a velvet glove, that 
there will be no upset and that there will be no extreme changes 
to the way they deal with Canada is a fallacy. 
If Bloc members honestly feel that the rest of the country will 
allow Quebec to leave without any kind of consequences, they are 
fooling themselves.  And they are certainly not doing anything 
positive for the people of Quebec who have to make that choice.

understand how the rest of the country feels about their intent 
on removing Quebec from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent three months travelling in the province of British 
Columbia listening to how concerned the people of B.C. were that 
Quebec was thinking of leaving the country.  It is not too much 
to ask that the people from Quebec who are talking about taking 
Quebec out stay to hear the debate and to hear the emotion and 
the concern that the rest of Canada has that they reconsider the 
direction in which they want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those of us in this country who feel that there is a 
better federation and that we can establish better working 
relations between provinces and the federal government.  Yes, it 
may take a change in government, but it is possible for the 
provinces to find a better way of working within the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is equally important that the people of Quebec understand 
that there is no certainty of the rest of Canada that in the 
event that Quebec leaves, they cannot depend on the rest of the 
country remaining intact, they cannot depend on this nice cozy 
relationship with the rest of Canada.  They cannot depend on the 
75% of Canadians who live outside Quebec treating them as equals. 
If they honestly believe that, they are fooling themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that they take reality checks to the province of 
Quebec so that the people who have to vote on a clear question 
and the people who have to make up the clear majority, whatever 
that might be, clearly understand the repercussions of deciding 
to leave the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that the Bloc members have been honest with the 
people of Quebec.  I do not think that their intent is to be 
honest to the people of Quebec, because I do not think the people 
of Quebec would accept the reality that a clear question would 
put them in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not think it is up 
to the government to tell the people of Quebec what it is 
planning to do.  The Prime Minister has laid out in the 
legislation the expectations of a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc should, through a clear question put by the Parti 
Quebecois, the Government of Quebec, ask the people of Quebec 
whether they wish to leave Canada and start a new country. 
Instead of playing around with the business of sovereignty 
association and the warm and fuzzy relationship with the rest of 
Canada, it is not being clear.  The issue is about putting the 
question clearly to the people of Quebec and letting them decide. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this is 
totally unbelievable. How could the Liberal members, English 
speaking Canadians for the most part who do not read Quebec's 
French newspapers, who do not watch Quebec's French television 
or listen to Quebec's French radio stations, manage to 
understand the question better than the people who live in 
Quebec, who watch television every day, read the papers, listen 
to the radio and have followed this debate for many generations 
now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the people in the rest of Canada have the gall to 
believe that they are smarter than the average Quebecer and are 
in a better position to interpret and understand the meaning of 
a question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they consider the people of Quebec to be idiots who are 
unable to understand the meaning of a question? Should we have 
to answer on the ballot the question “Do you understand the 
question you have just answered, yes or no?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what the people across the way want us to do. 
After the referendum, they are going to try to determine if the 
average Quebecer knew what he or she was doing when answering 
the question. Do they think we are stupid or what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should think it over for a moment. This is not a clarity 
bill, it is a bad faith bill, and I would like the Reform member 
to tell us how she reacts to the fact that this bill makes me 
feel isolated from the rest of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, alienation from the rest 
of Canada is not unique to Quebec.  The hon. member should try 
living in British Columbia on the other side of the Rockies to 
know what real alienation is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Bloc members feel so strongly about the people of Quebec 
knowing what the issue is, why would they argue about putting a 
clear question before the people? 
Why would they feel that there is something wrong with saying to 
the people of Quebec “Do you want to leave Canada or do you want 
to stay in Canada?”  If they do not have a problem with the 
discussion they are having with the people of Quebec, then why 
not put a clear question that everybody can live with?

BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am a bit, quite a bit, astonished, 
surprised, shocked—I am not sure what—when we are told that 
Quebecers are not capable of understanding a question, when we 
are told that the questions they were asked on two occasions, to 
which they replied in very great numbers, 93% in the 1995 
referendum, were not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the rest of Canada be allowed to say that it will show 
us what a clear question is, that it will explain it to us 
because we are unable to understand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do people realize where this view of society can be found? It 
can be found in Alfred Memmi's <I>Portrait d'un colonisé</I>.  What I 
have against all the federalist members here is that they think 
they can ask the questions, define the debate and set all the 
borders, and determine how things should be done for Quebec's 
native peoples.  They are saying that they will set the 
conditions for Quebecers and that we will not be allowed to 
decide on the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is not an easy one.  Quebecers have to come up with 
a blueprint for a country, a society, that may include an offer 
of partnership with the rest of Canada.  We must set out a 
course of action so that we can finally leave this 
constitutional debate behind, and Quebec and Canada can live 
side by side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present federal government is proposing to limit us to one 
vision:  the status quo or this unhealthy obsession with 
separation, as the Prime Minister of Canada sees it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the members of other parties not understand that Quebecers 
are adults and are able, through their national assembly, to put 
an intelligent and carefully considered question on the table? 
This question will resolve the constitutional problem in Canada 
and will allow Quebecers, as a founding people, to become a 
nation. They are fully capable of making their own decisions. 
They possess the intelligence required to do all these things.  In no 
way do they need a framework from the outside created by people 
who are dead set against letting them leave Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not think the 
proposed legislation is imposing a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that the province of Quebec can place a 
question on a ballot.  The question this deals with is whether or 
not negotiations will follow the question and the referendum.  I 
believe it has to be clearly stated as to what question is 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the courts have said a clear question and a clear majority, 
then we have to determine in advance what a clear question is. It 
is based on the supreme court decision of a clear question that 
negotiations would begin with the rest of Canada and the province 
of Quebec or any province that chooses to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, to my understanding, does not prevent the 
province of Quebec from drafting its own question.  It is a 
question of whether it will be clear about the question it puts 
before—

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am glad 
to intervene in this debate on the bill that would give effect 
to the principle of clarity described by the supreme court in 
the reference regarding Quebec's right to secede because I 
want to talk about the clarity of the principles described in 
this bill. I will try to deal with five or six of these 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle is the following: Mr. Bouchard says, and I 
agree with him, that it is the prerogative of the national 
assembly to prepare the referendum question and to decide on it. 
The prerogatives of the national assembly must be respected. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that referendum question must also respect the 
principle of clarity, that there must be a clear question on 
secession. 
In other words, constitutional rights carry with them 
constitutional responsibilities.  Nor is the principle of clarity 
a matter of constitutional law theory or a narrow technical 
requirement. Rather, it is a principle that goes to the core of 
the rule of law.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the principle of the rule of law that has to be respected. 
He was saying, and I quote “I am all for the principle of the 
rule of law. Rights must be respected”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarity of the question is a condition of due process of 
procedural and substantive justice necessary for the referendum 
process and without which the referendum process would itself 
lack basic legitimacy.  And more, the principle of clarity is at 
the core of the democratic principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the question is clear, the people of Quebec cannot give 
authentic expression to their democratic will.  Unless the 
question is clear, the people of Quebec cannot give expression to 
their right to self-determination.  Unless the question is clear, 
the people of Quebec are denied the right to pronounce themselves 
on this most existential of concerns. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Bouchard said, and I quote “The question must be clear so 
that we receive a clear answer, a significant answer. I do not 
like the idea of an ambiguous response to an ambiguous question, 
which would lead to a new debate on the meaning of the answer”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national assembly has the constitutional right to frame the 
referendum question, but it also has a constitutional 
responsibility to respect the principle of clarity.  The litmus 
test of democracy will be determined by whether Quebecers will 
have a right to express their democratic will on a clear question 
of secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle:  Mr. Lucien Bouchard has said, and I 
agree, that as a result of the supreme court reference, “there 
is a duty on the federal government to negotiate secession, and 
that duty has constitutional status”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that duty to negotiate has constitutional status only 
because the judgment of the supreme court as a whole has 
constitutional status.  That judgment stated unanimously that the 
duty to negotiate presupposes that two conditions of 
constitutional obligations have been satisfied: one, that there 
is a clear question on secession; and two, that there is a clear 
majority in favour of a clear question on secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the supreme court put it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendum process, if it is to be taken as an expression of 
the democratic will, must be free of ambiguity in terms of the 
question asked and in terms of the support it received. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This projet de loi du gouvernement fédéral is nothing more and 
nothing less than an attempt to give effect to the supreme court 
judgment, to the principle of clarity, to the rule of law, to the 
democratic principle.  For Mr. Bouchard or anyone else to call 
this projet de loi “an affront to democracy” has the effect of 
impugning the very supreme court decision which Mr. Bouchard has 
rightly said has constitutional status and should be respected. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle is as follows. Mr. Bouchard said, and I 
quote “that the doors will be wide open for a unilateral 
declaration of independence, based on the authority of the 
supreme court”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that there is no support in the supreme court 
decision for any unilateral declaration of independence.  On the 
contrary, the supreme court has said, unequivocally and 
unanimously, that there is no right to a unilateral declaration 
of independence either under Canadian constitutional law or under 
international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, even if the two principles and conditions of 
clarity and democracy are met, this does not authorize or 
legitimize a unilateral declaration of independence. What is 
affected by respecting the principle of clarity is the right of 
the secessionist party, whatever it may be, to negotiate terms of 
secession but not to treat secession as if it is already a matter 
of fact and a matter of law.  Secession is not self-executing. 
A clear majority in support of a clear question on secession 
triggers a right to negotiate and a duty to negotiate, a duty 
that the federal government has said it will respect if the 
principle of clarity is respected, both in the question put and 
in the majority secured.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth principle is that Quebecers may be said to constitute 
a people historically, culturally, politically.  As a people 
Quebecers have a right to self-determination, but that right to 
self-determination, as the supreme court put it, does not include 
a right to secession under international law unless there exists, 
also as the court put it, a situation of colonial domination or 
gross violations of the rights of Quebecers, something that the 
Supreme Court of Canada and Mr. Bouchard himself have 
acknowledged is not the Quebec reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, where there exists a free and democratic 
society like Canada, albeit with its imperfections, albeit with 
its inequities, the international law principle, as the court put 
it, is organized around the protection of territorial integrity, 
not its dismemberment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has emerged not only as a foundational principle of public 
international law but of international human rights law in 
particular.  Indeed, not only does international human rights law 
not authorize secession in the absence of a state of colonialism 
or repression of fundamental rights, but it considers that 
secession from an existing free and democratic society may itself 
breach the foundational principle of our constitution, the 
principle of the rights of minorities and in particular the 
rights of aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth principle is that if the Quebec people are permitted 
to democratically give expression to their will and if there is a 
clear majority in favour of secession, that will give rise to a 
right to negotiate and to a corresponding duty on behalf of the 
federal government to negotiate.  However, that negotiating 
process as the supreme court put it, and as it appears to be 
forgotten in this debate, will be governed by four basic 
principles. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue will be settled by the four basic principles. These 
principles are: federalism, democracy, constitutionality and the 
rule of law, and protection of minorities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, secession is not self-executing.  The negotiating 
process, if it even gets to that, will not only be governed by 
these four foundational principles but it will involve protracted 
and painful discussion of final status questions:  borders, the 
debt, assets, the rights of minorities, the rights of aboriginal 
peoples, and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth and final principle, as the supreme court put it, is 
“any attempt to effect the secession of a province from Canada 
must be undertaken pursuant to the constitution of Canada or else 
violate the Canadian legal order”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, the right road to secession presupposes that a 
legitimate, democratic, constitutional referendum process has 
taken place as follows: first, that the right of the national 
assembly to formulate the referendum question is respected; 
second, that the referendum question respects the principles of 
clarity enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada; third, that 
the Quebec national assembly respects the constitutional role as 
authorized by the supreme court of other political actors just as 
other political actors must respect the rights of the National 
Assembly of Quebec; fourth, that constitutional rights come with 
constitutional duties; fifth, that, as the supreme court put it, 
there is no right to unilateral secession either in domestic or 
international law; and, sixth, that if there is a clear majority 
in support of a clear question on secession that gives rise only 
to a right to negotiate pursuant to the four fundamental 
principles I enunciated earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secessionist outcome can only be reached, if it is indeed 
reachable at all, after a protracted and difficult process in 
juridical terms and a painful and wrenching process in human 
terms.  If the threads of a thousand acts of accommodation are 
the fabric of a nation, it would take a thousand cuts to 
dismember it.  Accordingly, Quebecers and Canadians are entitled, 
if the referendum process proceeds, to express their will on a 
clear question on secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the principles of la primauté de droits, la justice 
fondamentale et la démocratie as enunciated by the Supreme Court 
of Canada require.  This is what is required for the authentic 
expression of the democratic will of Quebecers.

some of his notes recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three brief  questions for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize, as all of my colleagues do, that the federalist option 
is a legitimate one.  My problem is, and I would like the member 
to be quite clear on this point, I wonder if he is concerned 
about the way we treat our minorities and the way we will treat 
our minorities in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he acknowledge that the Taylors, the Smiths and the English 
speaking community are part of the history of Quebec and that we 
stated in the 1995 agreement that we would recognize them as a 
founding minority, give them all the rights they enjoy now and 
continue to grant them, in a sovereign Quebec, the status of a 
national minority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a democrat well versed in law and history, does the hon. 
member recognize that, on this planet Earth, Quebec is among the 
communities that have every reason to be proud of the way they 
treat their minority?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member is wrong to be concerned about the role 
we want to give our native fellow citizens. 
Can he also recognize, as a democrat and a jurist, that there 
was in the history of our province a remarkable man, René 
Lévesque, who rose in the national assembly—he was among the 
first to do so in America—to recognize not only the natives' 
right to self-government but also the fact that they are, based 
on a number of clear principles, a people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to act in good faith and recognize 
that the sovereignist option is just as legitimate as the 
federalist one. Also, those who are concerned about the future 
only have to look at how we have treated our minorities so far. 
The conduct of the sovereignists in this regard is beyond 
reproach.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the issue of the minority rights and status after 
secession, I am only saying that minorities in Quebec have a 
right to a clear question on secession just like the other 
citizens of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the relations between René Lévesque and aboriginal 
peoples, like all Quebecers I have much respect for Mr. 
Lévesque and his approach to aboriginal peoples. At the same 
time, I must repeat that the question is this: Will Quebecers 
get to answer a clear question on secession?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, this debate is a matter of concern for all Canada and 
not simply a dispute or discussion between Quebec and Ottawa.  It 
is in this larger optic, because many people in western Canada 
are also following the debate, that I intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question itself involves a mixture, sometimes not clearly 
defined, of constitutional law, international law and politics. 
In the straight limited issue of the constitutional power I did 
give the opinion in 1980 as an a priori abstract legal question 
that the issue of holding a referendum on secession from a 
federal country, the issue of the nature of the referendum 
question, the content and the timing, was a question of plenary 
federal powers, not of provincial powers.  In this context a 
federal government would have the right to disallow or bar 
constitutionally the holding of a referendum, or even to 
interpose its own referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a statement of the law, but I also said at the time 
that it was a political decision whether and to what extent to 
use legal powers.  The House remembers in the context in 1980 
that the then prime minister decided not to exercise his constitutional 
options but to meet the challenge politically to enter the 
referendum debate and to win it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the particular situation we are facing today, in 1994 I 
repeated the views that I had expressed in 1980.  I repeated them 
one year before the second Quebec referendum in an article in the 
autumn 1994 edition of <I>Canadian Parliamentary Review</I>. I note 
simply that it was adopted by the Reform Party.  The best and 
brightest of the Reform Party spokesmen on constitutional 
questions, the member for Calgary West, Stephen Harper, picked 
them up in interventions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I do not see a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> There is a quorum. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I mention this simply 
because Reform Party members in interventions in the House on 
October 17, 1994 and May 13, 1996, as reported in <I>Hansard</I>, 
repeated my constitutional positions as their own but without 
adding the political limitation that I had applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me state what is clear on reading the bill.  It is a very 
modest law.  It is facultative in legal terms, not coercive.  It 
reflects the obvious political fact of life that any breakaway 
from an existing multinational or constitutionally plural state, 
unless it is to be determined by force majeure, by force of arms 
as in many cases it has been, must be consensual.   This is a 
position reflected in the United Nations General Assembly 
declaration on friendly relations and co-operation among states 
of 1970.  It is even reflected in terms in the famous UN General 
Assembly resolution of 1960 on independence for colonial peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the emphasis is on consensus.  This is what this law 
says.  In the words of the popular tango, it takes two to tango. 
If you are going to break away you cannot do it unilaterally. You 
have to get consensus.  The federal government says if you wish 
to have a referendum on secession and you wish it to be taken 
positively in its result by the federal government, if you want 
the federal government to negotiate in good faith in response to 
it, then you must be able to demonstrate that it is a proposal 
that has been arrived at in its result by what we may call 
constitutional due process, fair and open means which genuinely 
reflect Quebec public opinion. 
I think this law states that, no more and no less.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it difficult to see how any good constitutionalist could 
object to this prescription because it goes to the foundations of 
the open society upon which Canada is based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would cite what is I think the most remarkable feature of this 
law.  It is not like the Stalin constitution of 1936, which said 
that any state may secede from the Soviet Union.  Everybody knew 
that the cynical Mr. Vyshinsky had written it and he did not mean 
a word of it, and neither did Stalin.  It stated for the first 
time in a democratic society that one part had the right to break 
away, provided it achieved an expression of opinion which 
conformed to the due process of law, with proper consultation on 
a representative basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government in this bill does not stipulate a 
particular content, of whatever nature, for any future Quebec 
referendum question.  It does not even try to impose a particular 
majority.  These are questions which, following Kelsen and the 
pure theory of law, a good jurist would say are metalegal in 
character.  In more popular terms, one might say it was like King 
Canute trying to legislate the impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union, in a cognate situation trying to establish 
ground rules for recognition of new states, wisely limits itself 
to what it calls the normal standards of international practice 
and the political realities of each case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of the present bill goes on to list elements that would 
be relevant in any post-referendum federal-provincial 
negotiations on a possible secession.  These correspond to 
classical international law prescriptions for state sucession and 
would be determined at any such ensuing negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a continuance of that opening to 
participatory democracy which began when Prime Minister Trudeau 
opted not to use his constitutional choices to bar a referendum 
but to enter into the political debate in the political arenas. 
This is the situation.  If these conditions, conformably to what 
the supreme court has laid down and established in the federal 
law, are met then it would be possible to obtain that genuine 
nationwide consensus that is a necessary precondition to 
effectuation of any political secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive thing is that the Government of Canada has taken 
the forward step of saying “Yes, we would regret anybody going, 
but if they go let us be sure that there was a clear question, 
honestly expressed and honestly presented and accepted by a 
fair majority of the population concerned”.  That is an opening 
to democracy.  It is not coercion.  It is facultative in its 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several conditions.  If a result were to be obtained 
in which those conditions were met, I think I could persuade my 
colleagues in my part of the country to accept it in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an invitation to members of the opposition to meet the 
spirit of the law.  It is not a coercive law; it is a facultative 
law.  It opens the way to constitutional due process, to a 
measured approach in good faith to effectuation of popular will 
when that is determined.

Speaker, I was listening very attentively to the words of my hon. 
friend from the Liberal Party, for whom I have the greatest 
respect.  If the hon. member believes in this bill so much, would 
he be willing when his boss, the Prime Minister, decides that 
the House of Commons will vote on it to say that on the Liberal 
side a free vote should be allowed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, as a freely elected 
member of parliament, I can speak only for myself.  I have 
studied the bill.  I am satisfied that it conforms to the basic

it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, when we 
talk about a clear question, we presume that those who will have 
to answer it will understand not only the question, but also the 
stakes involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It so happens that the stakes will be refined during the debate. 
I will give a relatively simple example. Let us say that someone 
who is renting an apartment in a building is considering moving 
and buying a house. The question that person will ask is “Do I 
want to buy a new house?” This is a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in order to decide whether to do it or not, that person will 
have to weigh the pros and the cons of each alternative. “What 
are the pros and the cons if I remain a tenant, and what are 
they if I become the owner of my home?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the process that concerns us, there is a fundamental aspect 
that is mentioned nowhere in this bill: the arguments of the 
manager of the building. You see, the last time, the question 
was clear. But how many persons voted against it because the 
manager of the building promised to give them a new paint job 
and to make the place comfortable so that they could enjoy a 
good quality of life and feel at home? The manager did not 
deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us does not mention this aspect. 
Consequently, if the question is clear, it should also involve 
clear commitments, commitments which will be met and not broken, 
commitments which will not trick the people. Obviously, this bill cannot be 
honest if it does not address these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree with me that this bill is incomplete 
because it does not deal with the basis of the  democratic 
debate which is supposed to follow, the democratic debate where 
the real issues are explained by both sides so that the promises 
can be met? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will return to a time 
when I was a trusted constitutional adviser to several successive 
Quebec premiers of different parties.  I am very familiar with 
the actors in previous referenda debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in 1980 that the actual question was preceded by a 
poll conducted by the minister in charge, Claude Morin, who was a 
very brilliant man.  I think there were no less than seven 
questions put as likely to get the best majority.  It is that 
sort of action that I would have great difficulty in selling to 
my electors in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On an issue like this we have to have a nationwide consensus to 
allow negotiations to take place.  If the secession vote allowed it 
to be accepted, I could not sell what I would call clever action 
by a governmental minister in charge.  What is the problem with 
Quebec presenting a clear question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law makes very clear that Quebec can vote on any question it 
likes, but if it is to be taken seriously in the rest of the 
country, and that is the necessary action to trigger a favourable 
response to be legally enacted, it has to be one that people are 
satisfied is a fair question.

pleased to rise in the House today. I originally decided to seek 
a seat in this House to come face to face, in this democratic 
forum, with opponents of sovereignty, opponents I respect and 
will continue to respect because, in my view, the real opponents 
of sovereignty are to be found in this House. They are those who 
have a different plan for Quebecers, who claim too often they 
have fulfilled their promises regarding renewed federalism, and 
who have trouble convincing Quebecers they fulfilled their 
promises in this respect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not think when I came to this House that I would have to 
fight against enemies of democracy; enemies of Quebec's 
democracy, a democracy which was built and is still based on a 
parliament, a national assembly we are very proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A senator told me some time ago that it was the Westminster-style 
parliamentary institution in Canada that had evolved the best, 
modernized its practices, and resolutely entered into the modern 
age while other houses, this one included, revel in traditions 
that ought to be inspired by the new traditions created by 
Quebec's national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a government that has transformed Quebec, bringing it out 
of a great darkness, built an effective and competent public 
service, provided Quebec with progressive laws, laws we are very 
proud of; courts which apply the rule of law, making Quebec a 
constitutional state we are also very proud of; courts that in 
part are outside the jurisdiction of Quebec, its assembly and 
its government because, in some cases, and in most cases in 
Quebec's superior courts, judges are still appointed by the 
federal government, which is contrary to the federal principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a democracy based on a charter of rights and freedoms 
under which everybody has an equal vote in elections as well as 
in referendums and on a referendum act that was adopted in 1979 
to give Quebecers a say on important issues, including issues 
relating to their political status. Three referendums were held 
to date under the Quebec Referendum Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strong criticism I address today to those who choose to 
support the government with regard to Bill C-20 has nothing to do 
with a lack of respect on my part for those who want to change 
the federation, but I can tell the proponents of this bill—with 
all due respect for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, a 
professor at the University of Montreal—that it has to do with 
the fact that I think that, far from recognizing the right of 
Quebec to become a country, far from recognizing, as was said 
many times today, the right to secede, to use the same 
expression used by the supreme court, this legislation will 
prevent Quebec from choosing to become a country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week a commentator wrote: “If we are now bold enough to 
rule out secession in practice, why must we pretend to allow it 
in principle?” 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it is all about. This bill suggests that it would 
respect the will of Quebecers to build a country, but in fact it 
wants to deny them the right to choose that option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this legislation, which, according to its proponents, is 
based on the opinion issued by the supreme court on August 20, 
1998, does not respect the main requirements of that opinion. We 
believe that opinion has been misinterpreted in many ways.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Absolutely nowhere in the supreme court's opinion could we find 
the basis for the authority given to the House of Commons to 
determine how clear the question is and how clear the majority 
is. One wonders why the government wanted to give the House of 
Commons authority in this area, whereas the supreme court 
recognized no such authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few weeks we have set out the views of several 
famous jurists, such as Professor Henri Brun from Laval 
University and Professor Andrée Lajoie from the University of 
Montreal. 
Only a few minutes ago I cited the opinion by Alain Pellet, 
professor at the University of Paris-Nanterre and a member of the 
International Law Commission. They are all of the opinion that 
the government is on the wrong track when it claims it has found 
in the supreme court's opinion some comfort and some 
justification for the provisions in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite hon. members to look particularly at Mr. Pellet's 
opinion, which is probably one of the first comments on the 
draft bill, and Bill C-20 as it is now, since he feels that 
Bill C-20 gives the federal government a triple veto with regard 
to the future of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, I want to comment on the three clauses of this bill which 
give this veto to the Canadian government and to those who will 
be consulted by the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first clause of this bill concerns the question that the 
national assembly could or would ask Quebecers about 
their political future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is peculiar, even indecent, to propose a formula that would 
allow the House of Commons to rule on the clarity of a question 
during a referendum campaign because the 30 days following the 
tabling of a question at the legislature of a province would, in 
Quebec, cause the debate on the clarity of the question to occur 
during the referendum campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides this intrusion, this involvement of the House of Commons 
in the referendum campaign itself, we cannot help but recognise that 
clause 1(4) of the bill limits the jurisdiction of the national 
assembly when it comes to determining the question to be asked 
Quebecers, since it excludes any mandate to negotiate or any 
reference to an economic or political agreement or partnership 
of any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not limiting the jurisdiction of the assembly or 
dictating the phrasing of the referendum question, I do not know 
what is, or what this clause means. To say that with this act 
the Canadian parliament would be respecting the autonomy of the 
national assembly in this respect is totally inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second clause, concerning the majority, is probably the one 
which poses the greatest threat to democracy in Quebec. 
It is a weapon handed to the Parliament of Canada and especially 
the House of Commons to veto the referendum results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I feel that in many ways this bill brings back the 
veto. What is the power to veto a question because in the 
opinion of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Canada it 
is not clear and what is the power to veto the results because 
it is felt that a clear majority was not reached if not a new 
veto granted to the federal parliament?

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment further on these provisions in the weeks and 
months to come. Last, I want to point out briefly that 
clause 3, which refers to the matters that could be negotiated, 
implies that some issues like borders will be subject to 
negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was glad when the minister told us today—and it was duly 
noted—that he thinks this provision does not deal with the 
partition of Quebec, but that it could include changes to 
borders, like what was done in Lithuania and Czechoslovakia, 
according to the example the minister gave us yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by reminding hon. members that the debate we are 
beginning today is an important one in the political history of 
Canada and of Quebec. It deals with the way we view democracy in 
a democratic country and the way we review it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the revision the government is proposing with Bill C-20 
ends up telling Canadians and Quebecers that there is a higher 
authority in this country, a supreme authority, which is the 
House of Commons. The House of Commons can veto a question 
approved by what we call a national assembly, and what the 
Calgary declaration only called a legislative assembly, by what 
is considered an inferior assembly, since the question can be 
vetoed by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question could be rejected by this House where there are 75 
members from Quebec who have a legitimate voice here, as 
recognized by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
However, among those 75 members from Quebec, there are 44 
members of the Bloc Quebecois, one independent member who will 
certainly vote against this bill and four Conservative members who 
will also vote against this bill, as they said they would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a House of Commons that, when it rises to pass this bill, 
although we hope that, in the course of this debate, the 
government will realize it is making a mistake and should 
withdraw the bill, will once again seek to base its authority on 
members who should not have a veto over Quebec's political 
future before a referendum is held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the weeks and months to come we will see Quebecers tell 
those who want to have this bill passed that it is out of order, 
that it is a rejection of our institutions and our democratic 
practices in Quebec, that parliament, that the House of Commons 
of Canada does not have precedence over the National Assembly of 
Quebec on issues relating to Quebec's political and 
constitutional future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of the national assembly, members of this House 
from Quebec, civil society and the other political actors in 
Quebec decide that this initiative is out of order, our friends 
opposite will certainly realize that they were wrong, that they 
made a bad choice, that they did the same thing in the past when 
they forced a constitution down our throat in 1982, just as they 
are trying now to put us in shackles with regard to the future 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will quote another commentator who reminds our 
friends opposite of what could happen. He said: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Mr. Chrétien has bludgeoned dissent within his party and 
cabinet”, bien que ça ne paraît plus. 
“He won't get away with it in Quebec.  People there may be tired 
of constitutional wrangling, and who could blame them? But they 
are proud and democratic.  In their own way and time, they will 
let Mr. Chrétien know”.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should impose minimum sentences for those involved in 
people smuggling, with the highest minimum sentences for those 
who profit the most, including organized crime bosses,

operations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased today to have a 
chance to present my private member's Motion No. 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my presentation today, I will first read my motion so that 
people listening and watching will know what this is about. 
Second, I will explain why the motion is very necessary when we 
consider what is happening in the country in terms of people 
smuggling.  Third, I will explain what I am calling for in the 
motion and what I see resulting from the motion.  Last, I will 
explain the current situation with regard to what happens right 
now in Canada with people smugglers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As people watch this story unfold tonight, they will recognize 
that the state of our current law and what the government has 
allowed to happen in the area of people smuggling is truly 
disgusting.  It is unacceptable, not good for Canadians and not 
good for the people being smuggled. 
It is only good for the people smugglers themselves who are most 
often involved in organized crime.  As I will explain later, the 
organized crime activity of people smuggling is encroaching on 
drug smuggling because it is very profitable and the penalties 
for getting caught, especially in countries like Canada, really 
are minimal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 20 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should impose 
minimum sentences for those involved in people smuggling, with 
the highest minimum sentences for those who profit the most, 
including organized crime bosses, “snakeheads” and those who 
carry out the actual smuggling operations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this motion about?  From reading the motion, we can tell 
that it is about imposing minimum sentences in the area of people 
smuggling and to apply them to those involved in people 
smuggling.  I am talking about those key organized crime figures 
who organize and spearhead these operations, those people who 
actually organize the people smuggling operations and those 
people who physically carry it out.  For example, the crew on a 
ship or on an airplane might be involved or those who drive a 
vehicle across a border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying all this partly because of the current law but more 
importantly because of the way our judges have been interpreting 
and applying the law to people involved in smuggling other humans 
into our country.  The sentences that have been given out have 
been weak.  It is necessary to put minimum sentences in place 
along with the maximum sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I go through the information on the current situation, we 
will see very clearly why this is the case.  Statistics from the 
Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics show that there have only 
been 14 charges made under the Immigration Act between 1995 and 
1998 that apply to people smuggling in any way.  All charges were 
made under subsection 94.1 of the Immigration Act, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person who knowingly organizes, induces, aids or abets or 
attempts to organize, induce, aid or abet the coming into Canada 
of a person who is not in possession of a valid and subsisting 
visa, passport or travel document where one is required by this 
Act or the regulations is guilty of an offence and liable 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding one 
hundred thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding five years, or to both; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding ten thousand 
dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or 
to both. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the current law that is in place.  Let us take a closer 
look at it.  In the last five years not one day has been served 
in jail by those convicted under subsection 94.1 of the Immigration 
Act for smuggling people.  This is unbelievable for a crime that 
has extremely serious consequences for the people being smuggled, 
for Canadian society and for the taxpayers of this country and 
other countries that may be involved in this crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 14 charges that have been laid, there were only 12 
convictions, 11 of which were in the fiscal year 1996-97. 
There have been no convictions under subsection 94.2 which deals 
with organizing the entry of groups of 10 or more, nor under 
subsection 94.4, disembarking people at sea in order to help them 
evade the requirements of the law.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, the 
toughest sentence handed down under subsection 94.1 of the 
Immigration Act for those convicted of a crime of this severity 
was a fine of $4,000 and one year's probation; no time in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently, foreign nationals who were convicted of this 
serious offence were allowed to remain in Canada to serve their 
sentence with the minimal supervision of our federal probation 
system.  This means that they were given a little slap-on-the-hand 
fine, which is peanuts in the scheme of things.  Let us 
consider the example of the almost 500 people who came illegally 
by boat this summer.  They paid about $50,000 American per person 
to the smugglers who helped them come to our country.  That is 
only the tip of the iceberg.  Those who came by boat are roughly 
2% of all those who came illegally to our country in this past 
year.  The rest came through our airports, by airplane, or across 
our border from the United States.  That is how the other 95% 
came here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk a bit more about that layer, but as we can see 
clearly, our judicial system and the government are not taking 
this situation seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this situation, where people have only received 
fines and probation when they have been convicted of people 
smuggling, does it sound like those signs are appropriate?  I 
have clearly stated that I do not think so.  What I have heard 
from Canadians across the country over the summer and through the 
fall is that they do not think so.  To be fair, I have heard from 
the minister and from others that they do not think these 
sentences are in line.  I guess my question is:  Why has the 
government not done anything about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today with my private member's motion because the 
government will not do anything about people smuggling.  However, 
we are getting used to that, especially on justice issues and on 
defending the sovereignty of our country.  I and the Reform Party 
feel that we have to fill in and take the responsibility for the 
government.  It is okay by us because we are fully planning on 
taking over government after the next election.  We are the ones 
who will act responsibly on issues like this.  I believe that is 
what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the situation now in terms of sentencing.  We can see that 
there is a great lack of seriousness attached to this issue.  We 
may have government members standing, as they take part in the 
debate, saying “But the solicitor general came up with a 
document last January to deal with organized crime.  We believe 
in protecting Canadians and we are going to get tough on 
organized crime”, generally on organized crime, not just people 
smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous solicitor general last January came up with a 
10-page document generally laying out the problem with organized 
crime.  He even mentioned people smuggling and how serious it 
was. What action have we seen over this past year?  We know the 
answer to that.  We have seen no action on that whatsoever.  It 
is discouraging, disgusting and it has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am focusing on one aspect of organized crime, people 
smuggling, which is an area of crime that is growing.  People 
smuggling now, according to some estimates, involves $10 billion 
a year.  It is so serious that it is adding to the current 
organized crime activity in the drug trade.  They are moving 
their efforts to organized crime because very little happens to 
them if they get caught.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other countries the sentences involved are a lot more 
serious.  For example, the United States has a minimum sentence 
and, depending on the level of involvement, those who are found 
guilty of people smuggling can be sentenced to three to five 
years.  The maximum sentences in Australia, New Zealand and the 
United States are much higher than in Canada.  This points out 
the relative seriousness that those governments place on the 
issue of people smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Australia the maximum penalty for people smuggling is 25 
years.  In Canada it is 10 years.  But what is the use of having 
a 10 year sentence?  It sounds like a pretty serious sentence, 
and it would be if it were applied, but in Canada there is no 
jail time.  We do not want to get tough with anybody who is 
caught smuggling people, even if they are involved in organized 
crime.  We just give them a little slap on the wrist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has made the government, in effect, a partner in organized 
crime.  We send that kind of signal to people involved in 
smuggling human beings, causing the pain and the sorrow that goes 
along with people smuggling.  The people who are being smuggled 
find themselves working in sweat shops, often in prostitution and 
drug trafficking.  If that is as serious as the government takes 
these types of activities and this type of enslavement, then it 
should be ashamed of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look for quick action on this issue.  Today, again, I am 
offering this private member's motion.  It should go to 
committee.  It should be fleshed out and it should provide a 
minimum sentence for those involved in people smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion does not provide a means by which to seize the 
proceeds of crime achieved by those involved in people smuggling. 
That is certainly something which must be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion does not deal with any other area of organized crime. 
It does not deal with some other very serious issues involved in 
people smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People smuggling does not only cause pain to those being 
smuggled, it encourages and accommodates those who would like to 
come to our country illegally.  When we have large numbers of 
people coming to our country, often undetected, then I would 
suggest that is a threat to the very sovereignty of our nation. 
That speaks to the importance of this issue, which the government 
must deal with, and I would encourage it to do that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not even touched on the cost to taxpayers.  I will talk 
about that later, as well as the many other serious issues which 
are involved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start, let me tell the hon. member, in all fairness, 
that the minister has been very active in this area.  It is 
important for members opposite to know that we have a policy. 
When boats come to our shores, we detect them, we apprehend and 
detain the people and then they are put through the process of 
adjudication to determine if they should be charged with criminal 
activity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about a growing international trade in 
human smuggling and trafficking.  This motion helps to focus our 
attention on that, but it also focuses attention on our strategy 
of penalizing those who profit from human suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become evident that a global movement of people has been 
accelerating.  In spite of international efforts to eradicate 
poverty, the gap between have and have not countries is fostering 
a new wave of people who are desperately seeking the means to 
establish themselves in North America.  The United Nations 
estimates that 125 million people are currently outside their 
home countries in search of an improved economic situation or a 
more stable political environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conjunction with this international reality there is a 
growing effort by organized crime to exploit these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not the only country that is facing this problem.  The 
United Nations estimates that annually four million people are 
smuggled across borders by a global business valued at $9 billion 
a year.  Australia alone has seen 2,500 hopeful migrants arrive 
on 70 boats this year.  Over 1,000 of these people were on 12 
boats that arrived on Australia's coast in November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The boats that arrived on our west coast during the summer are 
the most recent and visible manifestations in Canada of a larger 
international problem.  Moreover, there is every reason to 
believe that people smuggling and trafficking will increase 
unless Canada, in concert with other nations, adopts effective 
measures to discourage it.  The question is:  Which measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we not react in alarm or haste.  We must 
avoid simplistic responses which may compromise Canada's 
humanitarian traditions and its obligations under the Geneva 
convention.  Such was the case with a senator's private bill 
introduced last month in the House.  The bill proposed the use of 
legislation to direct away from Canadian waters a ship carrying 
suspected migrants.  A measure to turn boats back, which recalls 
some of the darker moments in Canada's past, would run the risk 
of denying protection to people who could be determined, through 
our hearings, to be genuine refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 60 years ago Canada, among other countries, turned back a 
ship full of Jewish refugees seeking to escape Nazi Germany. 
That these people were forced to return on the <I>St. Louis</I> to 
Germany and the horrors that awaited them remains a shameful 
episode in our past.  In 1914, 376 East Indian immigrants were 
forcefully confined for two months aboard the liner <I>Komagata 
Maru</I> as it lay off Vancouver harbour.  The B.C. supreme court 
eventually upheld a federal exclusion order and the boat, 
escorted by a Canadian warship, was forced to sail back to 
Calcutta.  On arrival 29 people were shot and 20 eventually died. 
We must learn from these and similar mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such measures would not deal with the root of the problem, which 
is the international trade in people smuggling.  However, in my 
view, the motion currently before the House is closer to the mark 
because it focuses more directly on the real culprits, those who 
profit from this hateful crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, the motion anticipates but one aspect of a broader 
range of measures that the government is currently considering. 
What is needed to deal with this international problem is a 
multifaceted approach adopted by Canada and other nations in the 
context of an international solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Canada is taking an active role in the development 
of two UN protocols concerning the smuggling of migrants and 
trafficking in women and children.  A G-8 senior expert group on 
transnational organized crime is also addressing these issues. In 
this regard the Department of Citizenship and Immigration chairs 
a G-8 subgroup on alien smuggling and trafficking in human 
beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, efforts are being made by Canada to deal with 
people smuggling and trafficking at the source by co-operating 
with other countries, including China, to combat crimes relating 
to the violation of border controls and illegal immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is committed to strengthening its worldwide intelligence 
and tracking systems to see that smugglers and traffickers are 
intercepted.  These actions are proving effective.  Chinese 
authorities intercepted six migrant ships this year, four of 
which are believed to have been destined for Canada, and over 
6,000 people lacking proper documentation were prevented from 
getting into Canada last year alone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government is fully conscious that additional 
measures are necessary.  In January of this year the government 
proposed several legislative directions to improve the integrity 
and effectiveness of our refugee determination system.  These 
proposals are being reviewed to determine what additional 
measures should be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have among the severest penalties in the world for 
people trafficking, up to 10 years of imprisonment and fines of 
up to $500,000.  We are using these tools to prosecute the crew 
of the second boat to arrive in British Columbia last summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has already 
signalled, we are reviewing a number of options to deal with 
migrant smuggling and trafficking in consultation with other 
governments and other departments and agencies of our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has outlined a series of proposals which could 
include penalties for human trafficking at least as tough as our 
penalties for drug trafficking.  We are also looking at taking 
more aggressive steps to seize property used in the course of 
such operations.  The minister has also offered safety to anyone 
who will testify against smugglers as a way to keep smugglers 
from abusing our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another proposal being considered is the imposition of a 
screening mechanism for criminality and security considerations 
at the very beginning of the refugee determination process to 
identify criminals earlier and prevent them from using the system 
for reasons other than protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking at clarifying our three existing grounds for 
detention to better deal with people smuggling and trafficking in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Immigration Act currently permits three grounds for 
detention:  inability to establish identity, reasonable concern 
for public safety, and warranted fear of flight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has proposed consolidating the refugee 
determination process to make it faster but fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship and immigration officials are currently consulting 
with their colleagues in the Department of Justice to determine, 
along with other anti-smuggling initiatives, if minimum sentences 
will be an effective deterrent against traffickers and whether 
such sentences will be in accord with the charter of rights and 
freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we have a commitment from the Immigration and 
Refugee Board to accelerate refugee hearings for those who 
arrived on our west coast this summer, providing a fair but 
accelerated process to determine who are genuine refugees and who 
are not.  Legitimate refugees among them will be allowed to stay 
in Canada.  The rest will be removed as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can now be proud of our international record of 
tolerance and compassion toward genuine refugees from all parts 
of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the decades since the 1950s we have honoured our commitment 
to the Geneva convention by welcoming and protecting Eastern 
Europeans, Asians from Uganda, Indochinese refugees and South 
Americans fleeing persecution, among many thousands of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attitude of compassion continues, as shown by Canadians 
opening their hearts and their homes to the Kosovar refugee 
families earlier this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who arrive in Canada seeking protection are now entitled 
to fair hearings to determine refugee status under our laws.  Our 
sense of compassion and fairness is enshrined in our 
constitution, our charter of rights and freedoms, our immigration 
and refugee laws and our own judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will not be taken advantage of by those who would 
traffic in human misery.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to rise today to speak to the motion put forward by my Reform 
colleague with whom I am fortunate to sit on the standing 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My speech will be divided into four parts. First I will 
elaborate on the text of my colleague's motion. Then I will state 
a number of facts, including those concerning the arrival of 
illegal immigrants. If the Reform Party is introducing this 
motion today it is due mainly to the fact that we recently saw a 
number of immigrants arriving in Vancouver by boat. I will state 
a number of facts. Second, I will elaborate on immigration in 
Canada, with regard not only to immigration per se, but also to 
refugees.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will draw attention to one analysis. A couple of months 
ago I asked the standing committee, on the occasion of the 
renewal of the Immigration Act, to conduct a real comparative 
analysis of what is done in other countries so that I could 
properly criticize or improve the bill that is supposed to be 
introduced very shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the whole aspect of organized crime and people 
smuggling, as compared to what is done in Belgium and Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I will state our position on minimum sentences, as we have 
criticisms in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleague's motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should impose 
minimum sentences for those involved in people smuggling, with 
the highest minimum sentences for those who profit the most, 
including organized crime bosses, “snakeheads” and those who 
carry out the actual smuggling operations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important to remember that the motion before us 
today is mainly the result of events that occurred last summer, 
namely the arrival in Vancouver of boats carrying illegal 
immigrants from China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that 123 immigrants arrived at the port of 
Vancouver on June 19, followed by 131 more on August 12 and 190 
on August 31, for a total of 444 illegal immigrants who landed 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the minister of immigration had a goal for Canada 
to welcome between 176,000 and 193,000 immigrants. That was the 
goal officially announced by the minister. The minister was 
unable to reach her goal, and only 151,300 immigrants chose to 
settle in Canada. That is the example I have for 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as refugees are concerned, the estimated number of 
refugees for 1998 was between 24,000 and 32,300. Unfortunately, 
according to the most recent data we have for 1998, only 22,644 
refugees came to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these two areas the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
was unable to reach the goal she set for herself, and that is 
truly unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, what we need to remember about those three 
dilapidated ships that showed up at the port of Vancouver 
crowded with illegal immigrants is that these 444 refugees who 
landed in Canada only account for 1% of the annual estimated 
number of refugees who come to Canada. It was a spectacular 
event, but that does not reflect the day-to-day reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider what is being done elsewhere. First of all, I 
want to point out to the House what is going on in Germany. 
Germany has taken a series of initiatives to fight illegal 
immigration. 
The crime fighting act passed in October 1994 brought changes to 
the foreigners act. These changes made it possible to punish not 
only those who enter the country illegally, but also those who 
help them do it. Illegal entry carries a maximum penalty of two 
years in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new offence, facilitating the illegal entry of foreigners, 
carries a penalty of five years in jail if the smuggling 
operation is carried out in exchange for financial benefits, or 
if it is done repeatedly, or if it involves more than five 
people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1820

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even attempting to facilitate the illegal entry of foreigners is 
punishable. The harsher penalty is when the illegal entry is 
orchestrated by a criminal organization or by someone who does 
it on a regular basis and for compensation. In these cases the 
maximum penalty is 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment to the foreigners act and to the asylum procedures 
act, adopted in 1997, made it possible to punish those who 
attempt to enter the country illegally. Moreover, facilitating 
the illegal entry of more than one person now carries a penalty 
of five years in jail, whereas the previous legislation provided 
for such a penalty only in cases involving more than five 
people. 
This encouraged the development of organized networks. They 
made sure to smuggle no more than five people at a time, using 
private cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out, however, that maximum penalties are provided 
for in the legislation but that German authorities are rather 
lenient. For example, minors under 16 years of age and nationals 
from certain countries were exempted under article 2.2 of the 
1990 order. For example, young people from various states of the 
former Yugoslavia, from Morocco, from Tunisia and from Turkey 
were not required to have a visa to enter Germany when one of 
their parents stayed in Germany regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision resulted in a significant increase in the number 
of entries of unaccompanied minors from those countries. I will 
provide some figures: in 1994, 198 minors; in 1995, 881 minors; 
in 1996, 2,068 minors, 1,800 of whom were from Turkey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fearing that this exemption would encourage illegal child labour 
and prostitution, the government amended the order at the 
beginning of 1997. From now on all minors, wherever they come 
from, need a visa. For children living in Germany, the visa 
would, exceptionally and until June 13, 1998, be granted 
automatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1998 there has been a fine for illegal child labour. Businesses 
are forbidden to bid on public tenders for two years if they 
illegally employ foreign workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out one thing about the concept and the 
rationale stated by my colleague from the Reform Party. Minimum 
sentences should be used carefully. 
The process of imposing minimum sentences bypasses the courts' 
discretion in assessing the circumstances surrounding each 
offence. These circumstances are particularly important in 
matters of people smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it is written, the motion is designed for those involved in 
people smuggling. However, no one is more involved in this than 
the people themselves. They are the victims of an intolerable 
situation that should never escape 
examination by the courts. More generally, minimum sentences are 
reserved for the most serious offences.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to take part in this debate on an issue which I 
feel very strongly about. I want to thank the hon. member for 
Lakeland for putting forward Motion No. 20. He has hit the nail 
on the head.  It is something which many Canadians are very 
interested in and concerned with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My only regret is that the motion was not deemed votable.  I 
wish we had the opportunity to debate this for three hours, not 
one hour, and ultimately to vote on the motion because I feel it 
is that strong an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel strongly as well, though, that one of the reasons this 
motion was not deemed to be votable was that it is so incredibly 
flawed and poorly crafted.  Without being rude, it honestly seems 
as if the hon. member wrote it on the back of a napkin in a 
doughnut shop because it is clearly one of the shoddiest pieces 
of work I have seen introduced in the House of Commons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT83"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT83"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1825

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise to me that the committee would not allow this 
motion to be votable because it is so fundamentally flawed at 
almost every level.  It is simply so casual that no wonder the 
committee would not deal with it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we all can agree on is that there is nothing more 
reprehensible in the world than the trade or traffic in human 
beings, the buying, selling, trading, transporting or smuggling 
of them as a marketable commodity.  We all agree that it is 
fundamentally wrong. Although many governments are, this 
government and all governments around the world should be 
cracking down on the trafficking of human beings and driving a 
stake through the heart of that horrible occupation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians shudder when they think of how awful the 
conditions must have been in the most recent example of the four 
desperate ships which drifted up on the west coast of British 
Columbia.  I venture to say that we would not be having this 
debate had those four sorry looking vessels not drifted up on the 
west coast of British Columbia. It raised this whole issue in the 
minds of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some chose to overstate the issue and made far more of it than 
it really was.  Let us bring it down to perspective right now. 
There were 599 people in four boats over the course of six or 
seven weeks. Canada allows 23,000 to 25,000 refugees into the 
country every year.  Almost 100 refugees a day come to Canada. 
The fact that 500 or 600 drifted up on the west coast over the 
course of five or six weeks is not a matter of national security 
or an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our borders are not a sieve.  The Reform Party and all the 
fearmongers on the west coast can calm down.  We are not being 
invaded.  The yellow peril is not upon us.  They should chill out 
a bit.  This is not an emergency.  I hope that the rest of 
this debate can take on a tone that is a little more realistic 
about what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were so concerned about the overstating of this case that we 
started to do a little more research into what motivated this 
group of migrants and what motivates migrants all over the world. 
Let me back up a little by saying that over 100 million people 
the world over are moving usually for economic reasons to places 
of better opportunity.  That has happened throughout history. 
People have followed capital and opportunity to build better 
lives for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time we are seeing an escalation of that 
movement.  Transportation is more readily available than it might 
have been hundreds of years ago.  Also, the third world, the 
underdeveloped nations, know how we live.  How do they know? 
They watch TV.  They watch <I>Dallas</I> reruns and stuff like 
that on television.  They know how the west works, lives, 
operates and the wonderful opportunities we have here, and guess 
what?  They want a piece of it because they love their children 
too.  They are willing to do anything to provide a better 
opportunity for their families and drag them out of the despair 
they live in to the wonderful opportunities that we enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no mystery to me, but it is a fact of life.  I predict 
that we will be facing a day of reckoning very soon as many more 
hundreds of millions of people make that realization, decide to 
pull up roots and do anything to get to the first world where 
they and their families might have an opportunity.  Frankly, that 
is why the world is seized of this issue.  That is why the member 
for Lakeland should be complimented for raising it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came back from Washington, D.C.  On Saturday we were at 
an international conference on this very issue, the mass movement 
of people around the world and what to do about it as developed 
nations.  Norway, Germany, the United States, everyone was 
represented.  Canada was very proudly represented by our minister 
who spoke very eloquently to the group.  These are some of the 
things that come to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the research we did was to try to understand the current 
boatloads of people who drifted up on the coast of B.C.  We 
started to scratch the surface of where these people came from. 
They were from the Fujian province in China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fujian province is the first place in China that had free 
economic trade zones, something that anybody who deals with 
international trade is very familiar with.  They are fenced 
compounds where western corporations can go and act free of any 
of the labour laws in that country.  Manufacturers can find cheap 
labour and manufacture the products for the west in these free 
economic trade zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fujian province was the first.  Now there are 200 of those 
free economic trade zones making The Gap jeans, Wal-Mart 
products, Liz Claiborne and J. Crew clothes.  Maybe the clothes I 
am wearing right now were made in a free economic trade zone 
sweatshop in the Fujian province.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research that we did indicated that the International Labour 
Organization said it cost 85 cents an hour.  A living wage in 
that part of China would be 85 cents an hour.  These free 
economic trade zones pay their people 18 cents an hour to build 
the western products that we enjoy here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have made the natural connection.  They are earning 
18 cents an hour, or one-fifth of what it costs to be a Chinese 
peasant, making Gap blue jeans that will sell for $50 or $75 to 
the western world, and they want a piece of that.  People are not 
stupid.  Those are some of the things that came to light as we 
researched this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend that we should not dwell on the crime and punishment 
side of trying to build higher and higher walls around our 
country to keep these people out.  That is the same thing we were 
accused of with free trade.  If we have the globalization of 
trade and the globalization of capital we should also have the 
globalization of human rights, the globalization of improving 
wages, labour standards and standards of living.  All those 
things should be part and parcel of globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to build walls around the country like the hon. 
member for Lakeland is suggesting.  He says that we should build 
higher walls to keep these people out because it is our stuff and 
they are not going to get any of it.  His recommendation is 
bigger and better penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the inverse is true.  We should be working to elevate 
the standards of wages and working conditions of the Chinese 
peasant who lives in a free economic trade zone in the Fujian 
province and makes 18 cents an hour.  That is what the real shame 
is and that is where we should be putting our energies.  In other 
words, we should stop criminalizing the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party was screaming, when these people drifted on to 
the coast of B.C., to lock them up.  There were photographs in 
the paper of children in shackles, 12 year old children who just 
came off a harrowing six week journey on the open seas, because 
members of the Reform Party demanded it.  They did not feel safe 
if these people were in their midst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not criminalize the victims; we should go after the 
criminals.  We should go after the snakeheads, the smugglers and 
the people who exploit the human condition and the human misery 
that the free economic trade zone, our western world, has created in 
the Fujian province in China.  It is about time we started taking 
some responsibility for what our standard of living costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to take the route of elevating their standard of 
living to something that is a little more decent, let us look at 
the practicality of that.  David Suzuki says that for all of us 
on the planet to enjoy the same standard of living Canadians 
enjoy we would need six more planets.  There are not enough 
resources to go around so we cannot simply hope that every person 
in China has two cars and all our western consumer products. That 
will not happen either.  There is an environmental factor as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that some reason, sensitivity, research and intelligence would 
prevail in the whole debate about the mass migration of people. 
Maybe even some quality bills and quality motions could be put 
before the House so we could have a proper debate and a proper 
vote instead of something that was clearly written on a paper 
napkin in a doughnut shop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution is not to build higher walls.  The solution is not 
to criminalize the victims.  The solution is to bust the 
criminals and get them out of our country like we have been 
doing.  We have been busting the smugglers and sending them back 
where they came from.  Let us look at the larger global picture 
of why there is mass migration.  It has to do with our western 
standard of living and we have to get sensitive to it or it will 
be at our peril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Before recognizing 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, I must warn him 
that he will only have seven minutes so that the member for 
Lakeland will have five minutes in which to reply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to take part in the 
debate.  It is certainly an issue that is becoming one of great 
national concern, more and more so with each passing day, to the 
alarm of many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smuggling has been going on in Canada for over a century.  In my 
home province of Nova Scotia, which was very famous for rum 
running during the days of prohibition, there is a strange aspect 
of human nature.  There has been a bit of romanticism about that 
aspect of smuggling. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a problem of law enforcement.  Stepped up efforts 
have managed to bring this problem under control in some parts of 
the country.  Nowadays smuggling is becoming more and more a high 
tech and dangerous issue of drugs, guns and pornography.  Some 
days we hear time and time again on the news that Canadian 
coastlines are being besieged with these kinds of contraband 
material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Romanticism is certainly lost in this debate, particularly when 
we hear stories of human smuggling and the slavery of Chinese 
migrants trying to gain access to Canada.  Thousands are 
brought in, as people are being constantly reminded through the 
daily media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One specific problem gaining media attention involves Asian 
criminal gangs known as snakeheads, which are referenced in this 
motion.  It seems more reminiscent of a James Bond film when we 
hear the facts of this case.  There have been claims of an RCMP 
cover-up after files were deleted from the immigration computer 
at the Canadian commission, now the consulate general in Hong 
Kong.  There are intriguing words like triads, Chinese Mafia, 
snakeheads, people smugglers and project Sidewinder.  There are 
local staff with high level security clearance using their posts 
to accept bribes in return for distributing approximately 2,000 
blank visa forms.  The allegations are being made against the 
RCMP by one of its own, which has made this case all the more 
chilling and disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP Corporal Robert Read has made the allegations that the RCMP 
is covering up aspects of a visa scam at the Canadian diplomatic 
mission in Hong Kong.  Read has been suspended for talking to the 
media in the Vancouver province about this Hong Kong 
investigation and is now subject to investigation.  It has all 
the makings of an espionage thriller that would make a John Le 
Carré novel seem unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly it is not the case that we are able to look at a movie and 
hopefully come to some sort of happy ending.  In the real world 
the RCMP corporal is being discredited while his legitimate hard 
earned evidence is being ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poor Chinese migrants are being treated as human cargo as they 
spend their life savings trying to get to Canada, only to find 
themselves in slave labour in return for this passage to Canada. 
Snakeheads and triads are making a fortune smuggling bodies and 
providing slave labour to their triad connected businesses in 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unthinkable to most Canadians that this could be 
happening, and meanwhile the federal government has failed to 
take decisive action.  This past summer snakehead boats with 
their human cargo continued to besiege the B.C. coast, and the 
government had no plan of action other than waiting for the 
weather to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With no budget for the coast guard, deep cuts to the RCMP and 
sparse navy patrol on the water to intercept these vessels, 
Canadian coastlines are vulnerable.  Refugee status to migrants 
being granted while still onboard is one way to approach the 
problem but with sparse resources we are unable to do it.  No 
moneys from the government can be spent in this area.  Yet it 
appears that the government will continue with funding for gun 
registration and funding for other programs that pale by 
comparison when viewed in terms of the seriousness of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a human tragedy, and yet the government has not taken 
meaningful action on this specific problem.  It was a Bloc motion 
that forced the government into accepting the idea of putting the 
matter before the justice committee as a start.  Sadly we know it 
will take the committee a long time to address the matter, given 
the agenda it is currently faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen with other RCMP officers like Corporal Read, 
when they find themselves in conflict with their political 
masters or the high ranking brass in the RCMP, they are 
castigated, singled out and then abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An initial investigation into this possible cover-up of project 
Sidewinder was surprisingly stopped shortly after it began in 1992 
due to lack of evidence.  As we have seen in other investigations 
like Bre-X or Air India, when they are cut short the public is 
left to wonder what is the true outcome and what is really at 
work.  Yet we know in other investigations that are politically 
motivated, like the creation of the Airbus scandal, that the money seems 
to be there and the investigation seems to go on endlessly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When RCMP officers like Corporal Read are assigned to a file 
they are not given the support they need.  Read made some very 
significant discoveries and found gaping holes in the original 
investigation.  He was completing a report into why 788 files 
containing sensitive background information on businessmen and 
criminals had been deleted from the computer assisted immigration 
processing system, CAIPS, but was yanked off the case at the last 
minute just as he was beginning to get close to the truth. 
He protested and continued to repeat his allegations in an 
attempt to have the RCMP reopen and continue the case, yet they 
fell upon deaf ears.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Read was suspended for speaking to the media.  Out of 
frustration he turned to the media.  The RCMP is not actively 
investigating the triads.  Instead it has begun to investigate 
him.  It is the irony of ironies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as late as the end of November the solicitor general was 
oblivious to the issue.  As he stated in the House, it is up to 
the RCMP to decide what measures to take.  He suggested that 
Corporal Read should take this issue to the Public Complaints 
Commission.  Little did he know that Corporal Read had already 
done this and was told by the commission that his case was beyond 
its purview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this is a clear indication that the solicitor general is 
sadly lacking in some of the fundamentals of his own department. 
If this is a case of RCMP misconduct then the solicitor general 
should look into Corporal Read's request to have his complaints 
addressed by an independent commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Read said that he had already brought his complaint of the 
alleged RCMP cover-up to the Public Complaints Commission, the 
auditor general and CSIS, and yet there is still no 
investigation.  It is a shocking revelation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I commend the hon. member for Lakehead for 
bringing this issue before the House of Commons.  It is hoped 
that in listening to this debate perhaps the Liberal government 
will realize that its inaction has aided the proliferation of 
snakehead-triad organized crime in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all important messages that are being transmitted.  We 
have yet to see the government react.  Will it receive this 
message?  Time will tell. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to have the last five minutes to wrap up.  I thank all 
members who spoke to my motion.  I could have been blown over 
with a kiss when the member for Kitchener—Waterloo, from the 
governing party, admitted that there was a problem and 
acknowledged that something must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did say that I had anticipated something the government was 
already doing.  I look forward to that.  I have been waiting six 
years for legislation to deal with it.  I have been calling for 
action on this matter not just since this summer but for six 
years.  I encourage him to carry on beyond what he said into 
taking some action and bringing it about very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc MP for Rosemont generally supported the concept.  He 
expressed some concern about minimum sentences, but a motion is 
just meant to indicate what issue is being dealt with so that a 
committee can work on the details.  I would be glad to work with 
members from all parties at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre, the NDP representative in this 
debate, quite shocked me.  I will be sending out a press release 
to his constituents tomorrow.  I just cannot believe what he 
said.  He said that only 500 people came in over the summer and 
that was no problem.  We are not only talking about those 500. 
They amount to only 2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the debate is not focused on the people coming in as 
much as on the people smugglers.  We have all focused on that. We 
all support accepting refugees into our country.  That is not the 
issue.  Why is the hon. member trying to make that the issue? He 
is the kind of member who makes me ashamed because he attaches 
labels to political parties and to individual politicians for 
strictly partisan reasons instead of dealing with the issue.  It 
is very disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He basically said that we should open up our borders for anyone who 
wants to come.  There are 1.2 billion Chinese alone and I am sure 
a couple of hundred million would love to come to our country.  I 
wonder if Canadians support his stand in that regard.  I doubt it 
very much.  He ought to listen to the NDP government in British 
Columbia and what his own colleagues say about it. They say 
something entirely different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough talked about the human tragedy, 
the seriousness of the problem, and said that he supports the 
motion.  I appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge up front that imposing minimum sentences is only a 
small part of the solution to the problem. A large part of the 
problem is that those who are smuggled into our country by human 
smugglers end up going through our refugee determination system, 
and that is a disaster.  I will just throw out a few statistics 
to demonstrate that, because I think Canadians ought to know 
them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has become a favourite destination of people smugglers 
because in fact our acceptance rate for refugees is in effect 
80%.  I will explain that in a minute.  In the United States it 
is 17%, Germany 7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course Canada is going to be a prime destination if they are 
planning to have people go through our refugee system, which is 
what they do.  Many may be smuggled in unknown to us. That is a 
distinct possibility. We found out this summer and in the past 
that it happens on a regular basis. Certainly immigration 
officials told me that they may catch 3% of those who come in 
illegally through our airports, most with the help of people 
smugglers.  They are smaller numbers at a time but far more 
overall.  It is the same across the borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our refugee determination system the acceptance rate is high. 
That is not the formal acceptance rate.  If we ask the 
government, it will say 44%.  Last year there were 23,838 people 
who claimed for refugee status inside Canada and 6,200 withdrew. 
Only 5,000 are known to have left the country and 13,000 were 
actually accepted as refugees.  That is the 44% the government 
talks about.  That means that 5,000 out of the 24,000 have 
actually left the country as far as anyone in the immigration 
system knows.  That means we have an effective acceptance rate 
for refugees of about 79%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to look at solving the problem of people smuggling, 
we have to put in place the minimum sentences I am proposing in 
the motion.  We should go far beyond that and fix the refugee 
determination system which has failed Canadians so dramatically. 
It has failed refugees because we are not getting people who are 
clearly refugees from camps overseas in the numbers that we 
should.  Our system is failing us because of those who apply 
inside the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start by fixing that.  Then let us put these minimum 
sentences in place as soon as we can.  Let us work at both of 
these things together.  If we do that, we have made progress.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I had the opportunity to raise the question some time 
ago with the Minister of Canadian Heritage about what measures 
the government is taking to protect culture in the country, in 
particular against the influence of its erosion in connection 
with what we loosely call globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter which was raised by our committee and by the 
heritage committee and is of great concern to all Canadians. 
People in my own riding are very concerned about what measures we 
are taking in Ottawa to ensure that the cultural diversity and 
strength of the country remains in the face of what is going on 
outside our borders and throughout the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that in the province of Quebec people have 
succeeded in preserving a vibrant cultural life that is unique 
in North America, that enriches our country and that encourages 
us to also preserve and promote the use of French in the other 
provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cultural diversity when seen in the context of the integrated 
world in which we live is a very complex issue.  When we look at 
the Internet, when we look at new means of telecommunications, we 
see on the one hand tremendous opportunities.  We see 
opportunities for Canadians to participate in exporting our 
cultural products and with them our values and our sense of what 
we are about ourselves.  On the other hand they serve also as a 
vehicle by which other cultural products and other visions of how 
the world is seen come into our society and come into our homes 
and influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our neighbour to the south is the most important producer and 
largest exporter of cultural products in the world.  It is 
naturally to the Americanization of the world of culture that we 
look with some concern and ask ourselves what our government is 
doing and what we as legislators can do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage is to be particularly 
congratulated on having held last year a very interesting 
meeting of cultural ministers.  It brought ministers from 
countries as diverse as France and Mexico, as well as others, 
to discuss how to work together to preserve the nature of 
cultural diversity in this world.  This was in the interests of 
all citizens of the world, not just some. The minister followed 
the meeting with an interesting meeting with the UNESCO 
culture ministers.  I know she has been pursuing this with some 
aggressive action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the ability to protect culture today is linked 
to trade rules.  There was the famous magazine case.  We have had 
to look at the effectiveness of the articles in NAFTA and the 
free trade agreement which raise a form of cultural exemption 
which some people today are telling us does not work in the new 
environment in which we operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, we must recognize that the Americans are the 
most aggressive at pursuing the export of their cultural products 
and at resisting any suggestion that trade rules would reflect an 
opportunity for those of us who feel vulnerable in this area to 
protect ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have allies in France and other countries but we still wonder 
what is taking place.  That is why I am rising again today and 
taking this opportunity to ask the government what took place 
after the Seattle meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We called for new measures in our committee report on the WTO. 
We called for the government to look at creating a new 
international cultural instrument.  We recognize that this issue 
raises complex matters, differences between goods and services, 
but we believe that this must be accomplished in the WTO context 
and we look forward to knowing that the government continues to 
pursue this agenda aggressively and in the interests of all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank you for this 
opportunity to follow up on the question raised on October 10 by 
the member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from a speech the Prime Minister gave a 
couple of months ago on the current government's commitment to 
preserve Canadian culture. He said, and I quote “We must work 
together to protect this diversity. We must recognize that 
cultural goods and services are much more than mere goods. They 
deal with a fundamental and indefinable thing, our identity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody can doubt the commitment of the current government to 
preserve and promote cultural diversity both in Canada and 
abroad. Since the government stresses the importance of this 
issue, as witnessed in the last throne speech, we will work to 
develop, at the international level, a new approach to support 
the diversity of cultural expression throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated in the government's answer to two standing 
committees, the heritage committee and the foreign affairs and 
international trade committee, the federal government is 
considering a new international instrument to promote cultural 
diversity. 
The purpose of such an instrument would be to set clear rules 
that would allow Canada and other countries to retain policies 
promoting culture, while respecting the rule governing the 
international trade system, and give cultural products access to 
export markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the initial stage of the discussions, both here and 
abroad, on this new international instrument, Canada will keep 
on insisting, in every relevant international agreement, on 
maximum flexibility in order to reach its objectives with regard 
to cultural policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now this government has been defending the 
importance of cultural diversity as an international policy 
issue, and we have tried to strike the right balance between 
participating in the “global culture” and leaving enough room 
for Canadian culture.

Speaker, I rise as a follow-up to a question I asked on October 
21, a long time ago.  A lot of things have happened in the 
aviation industry since then but my question is still valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question on October 21 referred to a report written in 1993 
and that report is still valid.  It was based on the concept that 
if Canada had one major airline, we would have very little 
competition and no protection for consumers. 
That was valid in 1993 when the Competition Tribunal wrote it. 
It was valid on October 21 when I brought it up, and amazingly 
enough, we are right back where we started.  The government is 
now considering what conditions it will apply in the event of a 
dominant carrier and one airline in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that everything is the same as it was in 1993 and 
back in October, I would like the very distinguished 
parliamentary secretary to address my question about what is 
happening right now.  What assurances are being demanded by the 
federal government and the federal minister in his negotiations 
with the successful dominant carrier in respect to divestiture of 
regionals, for example, to allow for competition throughout the 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What protection is being given to discount airlines against this 
giant monopoly that we will have?  What conditions is the 
minister demanding of the dominant carrier insofar as slot 
availability, ticket counter availability and all the other 
things necessary at airports across the country?  What is he 
demanding from Air Canada in the interests of consumers?  What 
demands is he making of Air Canada about price gouging? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently noticed that Air Canada increased the prices by 3% 
to address the increased fuel costs in Canada where there is no 
competition, but it did not apply the increases to international 
flights where there is competition.  This is a very serious issue 
that is already coming to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, as we speak, is negotiating behind closed doors 
with Air Canada to determine what concessions will be made to 
protect consumers and what regulations will be devised to assist 
Air Canada to become the national airline that it wants to be, 
and that is a monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just exactly what conditions is the minister demanding of Air 
Canada with respect to divestiture of regional airlines, price 
protection for consumers, protection for regional airports, 
protection for discount airlines and all the things that we need 
in the country to protect consumers and make sure that we have a 
good, viable format for airline passengers to travel in the 
country at competitive prices?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the government has been 
entirely clear and transparent in its approach of using the 
Competition Tribunal, not only while the section 47 order is in 
place, but in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 30 the government sought the advice of the 
commissioner of competition on how to address competition 
concerns under the most likely scenarios.  The report was made 
public on October 26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government policy framework, which the Minister of Transport 
announced on October 26, proposes a permanent process for dealing 
with mergers and acquisitions involving Air Canada and Canadian 
Airlines in which the Competition Tribunal will play a major 
role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new review process foresees a proposal being tabled 
simultaneously with the Competition Tribunal, the Canadian 
Transportation Agency and the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Tribunal will make its findings known to the 
Minister of Transport.  Armed with this information from the 
tribunal, the Minister of Transport will determine what 
additional conditions would be required to address transportation 
public policy objectives and the general public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this information as a guide, the Competition Tribunal and 
the Minister of Transport will proceed to negotiate remedies 
directly with the parties.  The applicants will then revise their 
proposals to include undertakings to meet remedies negotiated 
with the tribunal and the conditions negotiated on behalf of the 
minister.  This process will only be completed if the applicant 
has successfully demonstrated to the Canadian Transportation 
Agency that it was owned and controlled by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will complete the process by preparing a 
recommendation to the governor in council for approval.  It is 
clear that it is not the Minister of Transport who will have the 
final say on major airline restructuring.  It is the government 
itself.

uranium and illnesses including cancer are in fact related.

</I></B></P><P align=left>DU is highly toxic to humans, both chemically as a heavy metal 
and radiologically as an alpha particle emitter which is very 
dangerous when taken internally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon impact, the DU bursts into flames.  It produces a toxic and 
radioactive ceramic aerosol that is much lighter than uranium 
dust.  It can travel in the air tens of kilometres from the point 
of release, or settle as dust suspended in the air waiting to be 
stirred up by human or animal movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very small and can be breathed by anyone from babies and 
pregnant women to the elderly and the sick.  This radioactive and

rates of stillbirths, children born with defects, childhood 
leukemia and other cancers, in particular near the Basara region 
where these shells were fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Bertell states the following about DU:

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most likely a major contributor to the Gulf War Syndrome 
experienced by the veterans and the people of Iraq. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO launched a potentially devastating environmental offensive 
in Kosovo.  It bombed the largest medical factory in Yugoslavia 
when it bombed the Galenika pharmaceutical complex, releasing 
highly toxic fumes.  NATO bombed the petrochemical complex in 
Pancevo, releasing huge amounts of chlorine, ethylene dichloride 
and vinyl chloride monomer.  The same day it hit an ammonia 
supply company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his response to my question on this issue at an earlier date, 
the government representative even admitted “Some of our NATO 
allies are using this type of ammunition”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That says it all.  We are a part of NATO and thus we are 
responsible for NATO's actions.  It is up to the government to do 
the right thing and say no to the use of this deadly toxin in any

</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Minister of National Defence should commit to 
Canadians that he will do everything in his power to ensure that 
NATO fully complies with the UN Balkan environmental task force 
investigation into depleted uranium use in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the essence of my question to the minister.  What were 
we doing to ensure that NATO complies with that investigation? 
Anything less than the minister doing this is simply deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this crisis is not relegated only to foreign soil.  It is 
despicable that our government some years back had been silently 
disposing of toxic and lethal nuclear waste by firing it into our 
coastal waters off Halifax and therefore into our food system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that this government produce a complete and public 
accounting of all DU stocks, including every instance that DU 
shells have been fired in Canadian territory or by Canadians 
abroad.  I further call upon the government to follow up on any 
public health risks or concerns with respect to those Canadians 
who may have been exposed to depleted uranium while serving our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the parliamentary secretary, in response,
