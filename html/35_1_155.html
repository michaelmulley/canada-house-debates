	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-59, an act to amend the Income Tax Act and 
the Income Tax Application Rules, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to begin the third reading debate on 
Bill C-59, an act to amend the Income Tax Act. Hon. members 
will recall that C-59 will put into law several measures 
announced in the 1994 budget.
<P>
	That budget was a first step in a historic two stage process to 
bring government finances under control. This is essential if we 
are to sustain the conditions for continued economic growth, 
especially easing an important source of pressure on interest 
rates. The budget set out a concrete interim budget to cut the 
deficit to 3 per cent of our GNP in three years. It made clear our 
ultimate goal to eliminate the deficit completely.
<P>
	But last February's budget did more than establish a target. 
The previous government had deficit targets galore. Instead, this 
budget took hard fiscal action to set a real deficit cutting process 
in motion by reducing spending more than any other budget in a 
decade.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	However, given the dimensions of our deficit and debt 
dilemma, spending cuts alone would not have been enough to 
meet our target and restore confidence in the fiscal commitment 
of government. That is why revenue increases were also 
necessary.
<P>
	I should also remind my hon. colleagues that for every $1 in 
revenue gains, we took $5 in action to reduce government 
spending. We did not take the decision to increase revenues 
lightly. There is no member of this government who does not 
recognize the tax fatigue and resentment felt by so many 
Canadians. That is why our government refused to hike tax 
rates.
<P>
	Instead, we felt the better way to raise the necessary revenue 
was to broaden the tax base and increase fairness within the tax 
system. This is what Bill C-59 does. In particular, it also makes 
the corporate tax system fairer and better targets the tax 
assistance available to certain businesses.
<P>
	Because C-59 increases the fairness of Canada's tax system in 
a number of areas, I believe the bill deserves the non-partisan 
support of all sides of the House. Let me deal briefly with some 
of the measures in this bill.
<P>
	Bill C-59 eliminates the $100,000 lifetime capital gains 
exemption. This action addresses a growing body of criticism 
concerning the exemption that it distorts the tax system by 
totally exempting certain gains while taxing others, that it is 
essentially of benefit to high income Canadians, and that it 
makes the tax system more complex.
<P>
	In 1992 thanks to a wide range of allowable tax deductions 
and credits, some 12,000 Canadians who earned $50,000 or 
more paid no income tax. Of this group, over 4,700 people used 
their lifetime capital gains deduction to help eliminate their tax 
payable. These people did nothing wrong, but at a time when 
most Canadians feel overtaxed there is little tolerance for 
measures that help well off individuals avoid taxes completely.
<P>
	Eliminating the exemption will mean a system of taxing 
capital gains which will be fairer, simpler and more sustainable. 
I should point out that the exemptions will be withdrawn only 
for a gains occurring after February 22, 1994, the last budget 
day.
<P>
	Another fairer measure in C-59 is the provision to tax the full 
value of employer paid life insurance premiums. This will 
improve tax equity. There is simply no justification why 
employees with employer paid life insurance should receive a 
tax benefit while self-employed Canadians who have to buy 
their own life insurance must pay with after tax dollars.
<P>
	Currently only the portion of coverage over $25,000 is a 
taxable benefit. By basing the benefit on the full amount the tax 
system will be fairer, treating all Canadians equitably. The 
impact on group plan members will not be harsh. On average, 
employees under such plans receive about $125 of benefits a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9766"> 9766 </A></B>
<P>
year as a result of employers paying insurance premiums for the 
first $25,000 of coverage. Under this proposal the combined 
federal and provincial taxes will increase by some $30 to  $50 a 
year and the increase for 1994 will be half of this amount.
<P>
	In another personal income tax measure, Bill C-59 will 
subject the age credit to an income test. Canada's debt and the 
burden of high taxes and interest rates it imposes on all 
Canadians, including seniors, demands that government 
spending be both fair and effective. This measure meets that test 
by ensuring that assistance goes to seniors who need it, but not 
to those who have annual incomes hitting $50,000.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Under the current tax system all Canadians 65 and over are 
eligible for the age credit. It delivers a combined 
federal-provincial tax credit of about $950 per year. Under this 
proposed legislation, individuals with net incomes below 
$25,921 will retain their full credit. For people with net incomes 
above the threshold, the credit will be reduced at a rate of 15 per 
cent of their net incomes exceeding $25,921 and the threshold 
will be indexed.
<P>
	Let me make clear that fully 75 per cent of seniors, which is 
2.6 million individuals, will not be affected. Moreover, most of 
those who will be affected will continue to receive partial 
benefits. Only 6 per cent of seniors will no longer receive 
benefits because their income exceeds $49,134, the threshold at 
which benefits are exhausted.
<P>
	I should also point out that the reduction will be phased in 
over two years. For 1994 the reduction will be one-half of the 
amount otherwise determined. As well, the age credit will 
remain transferable to a spouse.
<P>
	A further measure in C-59 extends on an ongoing basis a 
program that has become an important part of our social 
infrastructure, the RRSP based homebuyers plan. First time 
homebuyers can withdraw up to $20,000 tax free from their own 
RRSPs and repay the money over 15 years. By last February 
about 234,000 people had already participated in the plan with 
an additional 30,000 participants expected each year.
<P>
	Moving on, Canadians will be encouraged to give more to 
charities because Bill C-59 enhances the charitable tax credit. It 
used to be that taxpayers gained 17 per cent on the first $250 of 
their total charitable donations and 29 per cent on the remaining 
donations. Now the threshold for the higher credit rate will be 
$200, not $250. The fact that individuals will now receive a 
greater benefit when they give more than $200 in a year will 
further encourage charitable giving.
<P>
	I would now like to remind the House of the measures in C-59 
relating to the corporate sector. There is a perception among 
many Canadians that businesses receive preferential tax 
treatment compared to individual taxpayers.
<P>
	The fact is often overlooked that businesses, while paying 
corporate income tax, must also pay many other taxes such as 
provincial corporate income taxes, capital and insurance 
premium taxes, payroll levies and municipal property taxes. In 
fact, the total corporate tax bill last year was about $44 billion. 
However, Bill C-59 does take steps to reduce deductions and 
eliminate some existing loopholes.
<P>
	For example, the tax deduction for eligible business meals 
and entertainment expenses is reduced from 80 per cent to 50 per 
cent. All businesses large and small will now pay an appropriate 
share of tax, making the tax system fair.
<P>
	The element of personal consumption will also be better 
reflected in these expenses. This measure is consistent with 
business meals and entertainment expense deductions in 
Ontario, Quebec and the United States. It will apply to expenses 
incurred after February 21, 1994.
<P>
	Another measure in C-59 restricts the use of certain tax 
shelters where investors in partnership could claim tax 
deductible losses and/or receive cash contributions which 
actually exceed the cost of their investment. The amount of 
losses that may be flowed out to an investor will now be 
restricted. This will help to limit the erosion of the tax base, 
ensuring that business pays a fair share in the national deficit 
battle. As well, to prevent further erosion of the tax base, the use 
of the purchase butterfly tax avoidance technique will be 
curtailed.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	The Income Tax Act allows for corporate property to be 
divided pro rata among its shareholders on a tax deferred basis. 
This helps in dividing up a corporation so that shareholders can 
carry on separately the corporation's business.
<P>
	Unfortunately the rules have been used to avoid or defer tax 
on the sale of corporate assets. As a result the government 
introduced rules in May 1993 restricting cross-border purchase 
butterfly transactions. Bill C-59 extends these rules to all 
purchase butterflies. The tax advantage of structuring a 
corporate asset sale for this purchase will no longer exist.
<P>
	The next measure I want to discuss is the elimination or 
reduction of the regional investment tax credit, known as ITC. It 
has become evident that regional ITCs are not a cost effective 
means of attracting incremental investments, nor do they help to 
reduce economic disparity. Bill C-59 eliminates a special 
investment tax credit and the regional component of the 
scientific research and experimental development tax credit. 
The Atlantic investment tax credit rate will be reduced from 15 
per cent to 10 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9767"> 9767 </A></B>
<P>
	While these changes will come into effect after 1994 they 
will not apply to property acquired after 1994 that relates to 
a project which was under construction before the last budget 
date, nor will they apply to property acquired at any time under 
a written agreement entered into before the budget date.
<P>
	Another fair tax measure in Bill C-59 makes large private 
corporations ineligible for the small business deduction. Relief 
will be targeted where it is intended, just to small business. The 
small business deduction lowers the tax rate, thereby providing 
small corporations with more after tax income for reinvestment 
and expansion.
<P>
	However, under the current rules some very large 
corporations are obtaining this benefit. Large corporations with 
taxable capital of $15 million or more will no longer be eligible 
for the small business deduction. As well, the rule changes will 
reduce the deduction for corporations having taxable capital of 
between $10 million and $15 million.
<P>
	The last measure in Bill C-59 that I want to discuss allows for 
a deduction for contributions into government mandated mine 
reclamation trust funds in the year in which they are made. 
Under the current income tax rules mine reclamation expenses 
are deductible only in the year in which they are incurred. This 
addresses the concerns of Canada's mining industry.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-59 takes progressive measures to 
broaden the tax base for fiscal renewal and to improve the 
fairness and efficiency of the tax system. Those are goals that we 
can all accept and this legislation deserves the full support of the 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to the 
income tax bill before the House today. This legislation 
implements measures announced by the minister in his budget 
on February 22, 1994, almost a year ago.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was opposed to the bill on second reading 
and in committee, and its position has not changed. Granted, we 
did find a number of positive measures in the bill. These 
include, for instance, the decision to extend provisions allowing 
first-time homebuyers to use their RRSP funds; measures to 
increase the value of the charitable donations tax credit; and 
incentives for mining companies to engage in mine reclamation, 
although at this level, the government is not exactly applying the 
principle ``the polluter pays''.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc also welcomed the proposal to reduce the percentage 
of meal expenses recognized for tax purposes from 80 per cent 
to 50 per cent. As you know, companies may deduct meals as 
part of the cost of doing business, and reducing the percentage of 
such expenses from 80 per cent to 50 per cent is at least a first 
step. These are  some of the positive aspects we see in the bill, 
but there are negative aspects the Bloc cannot accept.
<P>
	This morning, I will focus on three specific points. The first 
one is the reduction in value of the age tax credit; the second 
concerns the reduction or elimination of tax credits for regional 
investment; and the third concerns the inadequacy of measures 
aimed at curtailing certain tax avoidance techniques.
<P>
	As far as the age tax credit is concerned, the Bloc Quebecois 
presented an amendment that was defeated in the House, an 
amendment rejecting a provision in the bill that reduces the 
value of the age tax credit for persons 65 and over. The reduction 
concerns people with net incomes between $25,000 and 
$50,000. The age tax credit for these people will be reduced. For 
some people these amounts mean a lot, since it works out to a 
federal tax reduction of $610, while at the provincial level, it 
adds up to $950. That is a substantial reduction.
<P>
	Of course, our friends across the way told us this would not 
affect seniors in need, those with an income of $25,000 or less. 
In fact, this hits the middle class. Once again, the government is 
hitting the middle class, and that is why the Bloc Quebecois 
objects to this provision.
<P>
	So who is affected? People who worked all their lives and 
accumulated a pension fund and did everything they could to 
provide for decent incomes for their retirement. These people 
had a deduction. It was a form of recognition. It was like saying: 
You are people who helped to build Canada or Quebec, people 
who worked all their lives to enjoy decent incomes for their 
retirement. They were entitled to a tax credit of $3,482, and 17 
per cent of that worked out to the amounts I mentioned earlier. 
As a result of the bill before the House today, this tax credit will 
be eliminated.
<P>
	Certainly, in the case of people with incomes of perhaps 
$60,000, $70,000 or $80,000, we could understand abolishing 
the tax credit. However, in the case of people earning $28,000, 
$30,000, or $35,000, we do not believe it is right to reduce the 
benefits they enjoyed under the old legislation. Certainly the 
government is saving money with this measure. It is expected to 
save $170 million in 1995-96, but this is $170 million once 
again saved on the backs of the middle class. At some point, the 
Canadian middle class will have had enough of always paying 
taxes and not always getting the necessary benefit or the 
necessary recognition from society.
<P>
	As we have already spoken at length on this matter, I am going 
now to deal primarily, in the second part of my remarks, with the 
disappearance of the regional investment tax credit. You know 
that Canada used to offer benefits in the form of tax credits to 
people who invested in certain parts of the country, primarily the 
Atlantic provinces, the Gaspé Peninsula, and certain northern 
regions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9768"> 9768 </A></B>
<P>
	There was a special investment tax credit. It was a 30 per 
cent tax credit for eligible investments in machinery, buildings, 
and new equipment for manufacturing and production purposes. 
This tax credit has been eliminated. Another tax credit is also 
affected. It is the Atlantic/Gaspé tax credit. It was a tax credit 
of 15 per cent, again for buildings, machinery, and equipment 
to be used in resource development. This tax credit has been 
reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. The third tax credit 
affected is the scientific research and experimental 
development investment tax credit. It is a 30 per cent tax credit, 
again in the Atlantic region and the Gaspé, and has been 
reduced to 20 per cent, the level for all the other regions. This 
means that the Atlantic region and the Gaspé have lost the 
benefits they enjoyed under the last budget.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	These measures affecting tax credits will mean a saving of 
$90 million for the government in 1995-96 and of $95 million in 
1996-97. The most ironic part of all of this is the reason given 
by the finance minister in his budget plan of last February and in 
the budget document entitled ``Tax measures: Supplementary 
Information''. His budget plan indicates, and I quote, ``These 
credits have not been effective in attracting new investments to 
designated regions or reducing economic disparity''. The 
document entitled ``Supplementary Information'' states in 
regard to the budget: ``Regional investment tax credits have not 
generally been considered to be cost effective''.
<P>
	Basically, it says that these tax credits did not have a very high 
level of effectiveness and are not an effective means of 
attracting investments. So we would have expected the minister 
to completely eliminate these tax credits because they are not 
effective, but this has not happened. One tax credit has been 
eliminated, the tax credit for investment in the Atlantic region, 
and the tax credit for investment in scientific research has 
simply been reduced. In other words, the minister admits that he 
will still offer tax credits in certain regions of Canada. The 
minister is aware of their lack of effectiveness, but goes ahead 
all the same.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has denounced this measure and has 
asked that moneys earmarked for regional investment be 
redistributed to the provinces instead as a tax percentage. Why? 
It is because in Quebec, we think that decision making and 
regional investments should be decentralized so that local 
decision makers and people in the regions can identify their 
needs and take measures suited to their regions.
<P>
	The Canadian government does not do this. It refused to 
redistribute these amounts among the provinces and maintained 
national standards, giving the credit to everyone while 
admitting that all this is inefficient. This is yet another 
illustration of the Canadian problem, that is, putting everyone, 
every citizen and every province on the same footing and 
ensuring uniform distribution  everywhere before realizing that 
this is very costly and inefficient but continuing to do so 
anyway. One does not have to look very far to see that this is the 
reason why Canada does not work.
<P>
	The third reason why we oppose this bill is the measures 
designed to counteract some tax avoidance strategies. This bill 
proposes measures to ensure that some individuals and 
corporations can no longer avoid taxes. These measures are 
quite timid. There are measures intended to eliminate 
preferential tax rates for large corporations, to make corporate 
taxes more equitable, to provide special rules for taxing foreign 
corporation shareholders.
<P>
	Looking at all this, we ask ourselves are they trying to catch 
those who do not pay taxes in Canada, who establish phoney 
companies abroad and who, through various tax schemes, 
manage to avoid taxes. Reading this, we might think that such is 
the case, but we would be mistaken. These measures do not 
affect family trusts or the use of tax havens and are not designed 
in any way to institute a minimum corporate tax.
<P>
	A lot has been said about family trusts. What are they exactly? 
A family trust is a tax measure allowing great wealthy families 
to avoid paying taxes on capital gains on assets.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	It is money on which no taxes are collected because it was put 
in a trust. And this remains the case for a long time. An 
amendment to that provision was proposed in 1992 by the 
Conservative government. Under that legislation, the money in 
a trust was exempt from taxes until the death of the last 
beneficiary of that trust. In some cases, that could take up to 80 
years.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois pledged to fight for the elimination of 
that provision, which allows tax avoidance. We discussed the 
issue at length in this House. We do not see, in the current 
budget, any step to abolish that tax loophole.
<P>
	We are talking about hundreds of millions every year. We do 
not know exactly how much money is involved. To find that out, 
we would need a special bill to allow Revenue Canada officials 
to tell us exactly how much money is involved. What is the 
government waiting for to pass such legislation and to abolish 
that provision in the Income Tax Act?
<P>
	Let us now look at tax havens. We have an idea of what goes 
on. The auditor general raised that issue in 1992. This is not a 
figment of the imagination of a demagogic opposition party. The 
auditor general himself told us that several major Canadian 
corporations somehow manage to avoid paying taxes in Canada. 
The losses in tax revenues are said to be in the hundreds of 
millions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9769"> 9769 </A></B>
<P>
	We know the process. Some companies establish or use 
subsidiaries in countries where tax rates are much lower than 
in Canada. They can do so because Canada signed tax 
conventions to avoid double taxation for corporations and 
individuals conducting business in those countries.
<P>
	The auditor general is strongly opposed to such tax treaties. 
Currently, 16 such conventions are said to be in effect. There is 
nothing wrong with these countries, but we wonder why Canada 
signed such treaties, if not to promote the self-interests of 
people who want to avoid the payment of taxes. These countries 
include Cyprus, Malta and Papua New Guinea. It is not a 
foregone conclusion that Canada's trade with these countries 
justifies the signing of such conventions, but these treaties were 
concluded.
<P>
	The auditor general also denounced another more subtle 
process. Some companies can deduct, from their payable taxes, 
the interest on loans contracted in Canada for foreign 
investment purposes. In other words, Revenue Canada is 
financing investments abroad. This is unbelievable.
<P>
	Another provision regarding tax havens that must be revisited 
is tax avoidance. In 1992 the auditor general again asked the 
government to amend the act to prevent Canadian companies 
with subsidiaries abroad from using these subsidiaries' annual 
losses to reduce their taxable income in Canada. They lose 
money outside of Canada and can deduct these losses in Canada.
<P>
	How could a Canadian company or a multinational that is in 
the slightest way on the ball not be tempted to create bogus 
companies outside of the country? How can these companies 
resist the temptation to reduce their Canadian taxes, to make 
foreign investments and to claim a deduction for the interest on 
those investments? It is an open invitation that the Bloc 
Quebecois decries. The Bloc denounces such things and would 
like to see all countries treated equally.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois calls for an end to flags of convenience, 
to freebies for big business that allow them to avoid paying tax. 
Many large businesses pay no taxes. Indeed, a Liberal member, 
the member for Gander-Grand Falls, told us last October that 
according to his research, 77 companies with over $25 million in 
profits did not pay any tax in Canada.
<P>
	They do not pay any tax because they can make deductions, 
they can make money out of the country, they can search for 
deductions. What do you think people over 65 years of age who 
earn $30,000 and are seeing their age credit taken from them 
have to say when they see big multinationals and prosperous 
companies that turn a profit get away without paying any tax?
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	They say that honest taxpayers are being picked on again, and 
that those with means, who are rich, who can make 
representations and can lobby have access to provisions in 
income tax laws which allow them to avoid paying their fair 
share. The Bloc will not stand for this.
<P>
	I would like to add, before closing, not to take advantage of 
your kindness, that the budget and perhaps this bill should have 
contained other measures regarding the whole issue of business 
subsidies.
<P>
	Everybody tells us that their economic effectiveness is 
debateable. The Bloc Quebecois has demanded that a good part 
of these business subsidies, which amount to approximately 
$3.3 billion in Canada, be cut. We asked for a reduction in 
defence spending totalling $3.2 billion over two years. We asked 
the government to stop investing in the Hibernia group in 
Newfoundland. We asked for a real minimum tax on the profits 
of large corporations, because the strategy of these corporations 
is to reduce their profits for the current fiscal year by subtracting 
any losses they may have incurred in previous years, so they do 
not have to pay taxes on those profits.
<P>
	In fact, we asked Revenue Canada to do what it has to do to get 
the $6.6 billion owed to the federal treasury. The auditor general 
said in his report that a large percentage of this money could be 
recovered. In other words, before reducing the incomes of senior 
citizens and cutting social programs, the government should go 
out and get the money owed to the treasury. To put it bluntly, that 
is part of the mandate of the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will vote against 
Bill C-59, because it contains measures that are inadequate and 
do not deal with the real problems of tax collection in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for this opportunity to speak on Bill C-59.
<P>
	Bill C-59 is sort of a remnant, a leftover or a bad memory 
about the last budget that was brought into this House, the 
1994-95 budget, a most disgusting type of document that was 
ever presented to Canadians. It was a document that was not 
prepared, not thought through and had nothing to do with the 
real economy of this country. That is one of the disgusting things 
that I think about this morning.
<P>
	The other disgusting thing that I think about is the fact that the 
Liberal members, many of them who sit in the front row today, 
sat for eight years on this side of the House and never prepared 
themselves for government. The reason that a party is in the 
official opposition is that it prepares itself to be the government. 
They did not do that. For eight years the Liberals played politics, 
surface politics. They tried to think about how they could go on a 
power trip or manipulate the government to get back into power 
and sit on the front benches on that side.
<P>
	By accident the Liberals did. By accident they became the 
government. When they became government they did not have 
any plans. They did not know why they were government. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9770"> 9770 </A></B>
<P>
were like a dog that caught a car and did not know what to do 
with it, that traditional, proverbial story.
<P>
	The Liberals talk about the fact that they put out a red book. 
The fact of the matter is that red book has so many generalities 
and political statements that are out of date and meaningless 
today that it is like the ostrich that has his head in the sand and 
does not look around at the true reality of life at a point in time. 
They stand up over and over again and say to us as Canadians 
that the red book states they are going to do this. They cannot 
bring themselves beyond the red book to try to create another 
idea or to recognize that the economy of Canada is something 
different than it was four or five years ago when the red book 
was written.
<P>
	The minister of defence should certainly think about some of 
these things and take his responsibility when these kinds of 
things are before the House.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	Here before us we have Bill C-59 which talks about tax 
increases. Most likely these were designed in the red book as 
well. Three or four years before they were introduced nobody 
looked at whether they were contemporary in nature or not or fit 
the circumstances. They do not.
<P>
	Today in the 1994-95 budget there should not have been any 
increases in taxes or a greater imposition on the business 
community of this country which Bill C-59 does. It is the most 
disgusting thing that I have ever seen.
<P>
	Here today we hear this ghost of the 1994-95 budget being 
brought into this House, the ghost that is going to haunt us as 
Canadians.
<P>
	What has been the result of that kind of planning and that kind 
of responsibility that this Liberal Party has taken? What is the 
response? Yesterday we had the response to Canadians by 
Moody's from New York. It made a political interception into 
the economy of Canada and said very clearly to Canadians, said 
very clearly to the Minister of Finance, said very clearly to the 
Prime Minister they are going to bring forward a budget in 
1995-96 that is absolutely inadequate and that Moody's is going 
to lower the credit rating of this country from an AAA to an AA.
<P>
	This government is thinking five years ago about things it did 
five years ago. This government does not recognize that you 
cannot tax people more in this country. This government does 
not recognize that this target of 3 per cent that was set out in the 
red book is not a realistic figure in terms of the economy today. 
It is a political target that was set up by this government three or 
four years ago to move into an election. It cannot understand the 
stupidity of that projection at that time is only more stupid 
today. It is unrealistic in terms of this economy and the needs of 
this economy.
<P>
	The government does not understand. The Liberal Party does 
not understand. The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, 
who are key to where we go in Canada, key to our economic 
stability, key to job growth, key to economic growth, are blind to 
the facts of the current circumstances. They do not realize that 
they have to sit down with their colleagues in caucus and say that 
this liberal approach to government, this kind of soft, fuzzy 
decision making has to stop. They have to recognize that they 
have to eliminate the deficit in the next three or four years. They 
must do it within the term of this Parliament. They must say it in 
the 1995-96 budget that is going to come before us in about a 
month.
<P>
	They have to say that to Canadians. They have to say that to 
the investment community. If they do not, what is going to 
happen? Yesterday was the best signal this government could 
ever have. The government has time to revise its plans. It was 
given a signal loud and clear. It has to come up with a plan to 
balance its budget, to bring the deficit to zero within the term of 
this Parliament. The dollar lowered yesterday some 47 points. 
We saw it lower again this morning. We saw the bonds affected 
significantly. We are going to see interest rates going up. They 
have already. We know what interests rates do to the cost of 
government.
<P>
	Many of us have said this in this House and I feel it is a very 
reliable figure. Every 1 per cent increase in interest rates over a 
period of a year costs $7 billion to this government and to us as 
Canadians. If we compound the interest into the second year it is 
something like $2.3 billion with that 1 per cent interest rate. In 
the third year that 1 per cent interest rate means something like 
$3.5 billion. Government members do not understand that. They 
were given a shock treatment yesterday that should have 
provided them with the best advice or the best favour ever. 
However what did they do? They do not listen.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister stand in 
question period today they will say they are going to hit their 
target in two years. Who cares? The target is stupid. The target is 
out of gear. The target is not even realistic. It is the most 
unrealistic thing I have ever heard in terms of today's

	Moody's is telling the government that its target is out of gear 
and inadequate. It is reported in the press. If all these people who 
read the paper in the morning to get their political advice read 
the <I>Financial Post</I> or the <I>Globe and Mail</I> this morning, they 
would have received some good advice on the implications of 
what the Liberals are doing or how they are acting.
<P>
	I hope the government takes some time to listen. I hope it will 
revise some of these fuzzy liberal expenditure reductions that 
we will hear about at the end of the month. I hope it will 
reconsider some of the taxes to be imposed.

<P>
	As I listen to members, not only in the House but in 
interviews through the various media, I hear that the Liberals 
are going to put a tax on lotteries. They are going to tax greater 
the corporate sector. I am sure they will put a surtax on all 
Canadians to pay for their bad management and the fact that 
they cannot reduce expenditures in the country quickly.
<P>
	They are setting up Canadians in the sense that they are 
misinforming Canadians. They are telling Canadians that if they 
reduce the size of government, lay off employees, pay them 
severances and so on, they will not be able to bring the budget 
down quickly. They are creating this image. They are saying that 
they cannot bring it down quickly in the first two years so they 
will put a surtax on us. It just does not work that way.
<P>
	If expenditure reduction is done in the right way and some 
grant programs and the overhead in some departments are cut 
and employees are released as quickly as possible, there will be 
an expenditure reduction.
<P>
	All we have to do is look at what happened in Alberta. There 
was a direct relationship between the reduction in the size of 
government and the reduction in expenditures. The fallacy that 
is being created that we will need a surtax on an interim basis is a 
bunch of hogwash and I hope Canadians do not accept it. They 
will react to that kind of thing.
<P>
	The Liberals talk about other taxes such as an inheritance tax. 
There are a few people in Canada who worked hard and saved 
money, and they want to take from their pockets as well. They 
also talk about the RRSPs. People know that the Canada pension 
plan will not be sustainable under current circumstances. What 
are they going to do there? I am sure it is part of the upcoming 
budget. They will reduce the level and the amount of RRSPs 
middle income people can put away for their future retirement.
<P>
	The Liberal government is still living with its head in the 
sand. It is living a the period of time about five years ago when 
the red book was written. It has not adjusted to today. It is still 
living this old traditional approach to politics, that is to tax the 
people and not cut the money spent on inefficient and ineffective 
social programs that have failed.
<P>
	I have had the fortunate opportunity to have been in politics 
for about 30 years. I observed in my early days that people were 
more self-reliant. I recognize that this liberal attitude has 
caused us to spend billions of dollars on what we thought were 
social problems. Everybody in Canada were to be perfect 
individuals. It has failed. Unemployment is greater. There are 
more people on social programs, unemployment insurance and 
public assistance today. There are three million Canadians on 
public assistance. If that is a success story then we should spend 
more money and improve it some way or another. However that 
is not the way it is done. Those social programs have failed but 
members of the government  want to carry on because they think 
that is the approach to making Canadians perfect.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	It is like their support for the CBC. I hear from some of them 
that the CBC has to continue its rate of expenditure because it 
creates the culture of Canada. That is the dumbest thing I have 
ever heard.
<P>
	Bill C-59 is a glimpse of the inadequacy of the government. It 
is a glimpse of what is to come: more taxation in the 1995-96 
budget because they want to take from the rich and supposedly 
give to the poor. That is the philosophy but I do not know who is 
on either end today.
<P>
	It also indicates a soft fuzzy approach to expenditure 
reduction to eliminate the deficit. Many of my colleagues have 
asked over and over again in the House what will happen after 
two years when we still have a $25 billion deficit. There most 
likely will be a downturn in the economy that could immediately 
put pressure on government borrowing and push our deficit 
again up to $40 billion or $50 billion. It will be out of control. 
We have a window at this time and the government does not 
recognize that it is there.
<P>
	Government members blame the debt on the Conservatives. 
They say that the Conservatives did it. They have to remember 
that Mr. Chrétien, Mr. Trudeau and others left $170 billion of 
debt. Certainly the Conservatives boosted that up to $500 
billion. Now it is at $550 billion. In two years it will be $600 
billion with a $50 billion interest payment being made. Where 
are social programs then?
<P>
	We do not support Bill C-59 and the government has to wake 
up and be realistic about its responsibility. It is unfortunate that 
we have to sit here for another three years with a majority 
government. It is going to be an unfortunate circumstance for 
Canadians.
<P>
	I urge everybody in the House to vote against Bill C-59.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair would ask the hon. member 
for Lethbridge not to refer to sitting members of the House or 
ministers by their proper names. As he knows we are expected to 
refer to their ministries and so on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
my hon. friend, the member who spoke on behalf of the Reform 
Party on Bill C-59. I must say I always appreciate his 
comments. I agree with hardly any of them but I nevertheless 
appreciate them. He always presents them in a thoughtful and 
articulate way.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9772"> 9772 </A></B>
<P>
	One point perplexed me about his comments. Canada is one 
of the very few countries of the OECD that does not have an 
inheritance tax; people inheriting $10 million or $20 million 
are not required to pay any tax.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> I hear my friend in the Reform Party saying that is 
good. They say that it is good, that people should inherit vast 
amounts of money and pay no tax.
<P>
	They support the notion that on income received from capital 
gains tax is paid on only 75 per cent. They say that is good. They 
say that certain people, particularly the wealthy people of the 
country, should get as much as possible. They say that is good 
because they work hard for it. That implies that other people do 
not work hard for their money.
<P>
	Why is it that Reformers feel average working people produce 
the most if their are wages are low and they are hungry? Why do 
they feel if we pay them very poorly they will be out there 
working hard? Why do they feel the way to get working people 
to work is to pay them as little as possible? However, they feel 
that the way to get wealthy people working is to pay them the 
most possible.
<P>
	Is there not some inconsistency in the logic of rewarding the 
wealthy so they will work but keep the wages of the poor and 
average working person as low as possible to encourage them to 
work? To me there is a bit of inconsistency in the argument of 
my friends in the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	Today we are talking about Bill C-59. The speaker for the 
government went on at some length about how it was an effort to 
make the tax system fairer. It might be a slight baby step in that 
direction.
<P>
	Let us take the whole issue of escort services. No one here 
knows anything about escort services, but if we look in the 
telephone book there are a number of pages listing escort 
services. It is interesting that our tax system says that escort 
services are tax deductible. I guess with some people it is a cost 
of doing business. I am not sure what escorts cost, but whatever 
the bill is it can be submitted as part of a tax return. It is called a 
cost of conducting business.
<P>
	When the question was recently put to national revenue 
officials, they said they have to change it, it is getting a little 
questionable in terms of a legitimate tax deduction. However if 
the escort service is called a bodyguard or a tour guide it is 
acceptable. We have some interesting concepts here in terms of 
what a bodyguard or a tour guide might imply.
<P>
	Nevertheless the reality is that simply by using a little 
creative commenting on an income tax return, escort services 
and entertainment of that type will be tax deductions. Is this 
reasonable? Is this acceptable to the people of Canada? My 
suspicion is that it is not.
<P>
	My hon. friend talked about the business tax deduction 
moving from 80 per cent to 50 per cent. Should we not 
distinguish between various kinds of business costs? I do not 
think anybody here would argue that business people getting 
together over a dinner, lunch or breakfast to discuss a 
transaction or a business arrangement is a legitimate cost of 
doing business.
<P>
	However, as I said earlier, is an escort service deduction a 
legitimate cost? Is the annual fee for a box in a sports stadium a 
legitimate cost of doing business? Is purchasing a yacht to 
entertain clients a legitimate cost of doing business? Is choosing 
the Bali Hilton or the Waikiki Hilton as the place for an annual 
meeting a legitimate cost of conducting a business?
<P>
	I know a number of people who own large boats, sailboats, 
launches and racing boats. They are business tax deductions and 
are used for entertaining clients.
<P>
	Is a hunting lodge or a fishing camp a legitimate business 
deduction? I suppose we could say in some cases it is, but 
enough is enough. My hon. friend stands and tries to say that 
part of the changes to the Income Tax Act will be to bring 
fairness back into the system by removing the deduction-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 11 a.m., pursuant 
to Standing Order 30 (5), the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Monday's three by-elections confirmed Canadians' 
continued faith in our federal system of government and in its 
ability to adjust to new problems in Canadian society, problems 
hardly dreamed of or imagined by those who established 
Canada's constitution.
<P>
	Canadian federalism has never been an abstract and inflexible 
charter carved in stone in 1867. It is a dynamic process of 
constitutional creation. It involves balancing differing social 
interests in a spirit of pragmatism and cooperation. It is a new 
federalism, a living, highly efficient and cooperative one.

	The people of Canada had no say in this process, because a 
simple vote in the House was deemed sufficient to legitimize the

<P>
	Unlike the act establishing Canada, the draft bill declaring 
Quebec's sovereignty will not come into effect without the 
support of the people of Quebec expressed in a referendum.
<P>
	To all those Canadians with lofty democratic ideals, who 
consider a vote of 50 per cent plus one insufficient to legitimize 
the choice of Quebecers, I would suggest another look at their

letters and 60 petitions from my constituents in 
Cariboo-Chilcotin rightly protesting the government's 
intention to introduce new firearms legislation. I would like to 
quote from one letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ignorance is the cause of fear and the fear of firearms now is caused by a 
general lack of understanding of what a gun is, how it functions and how 
extensive our existing gun laws currently are. If the public understood what an 
honest citizen must currently go through to legally acquire a firearm, they 
would realize that the new gun control legislation is nothing more than an 
expensive publicity campaign designed to appear as if the government is 
fighting crime. We, the people, need education about firearms, not gun laws that 
attack honest gun owners and leave the criminals at the status quo.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Tuesday the hon. member for Longueuil asserted in the House 
that it is ridiculous to think that Canada ranks among the best 
countries in the world in respect of standard of living because, 
according to him, Canada is considered to be like a Third World 
country because of the size of its debt. He even claimed that we 
were trying to deceive people.
<P>
	The comparison made by the Bloc Quebecois member is crude 
and his reasoning very unsound. Here are the facts. The UN 
world report on human development for 1992 and 1994 ranks 
Canada as the best country in which to live.
<P>
	The only ones trying to deceive people, and in particular the 
population of Quebec, are the Bloc Quebecois members. It is 
very easy to be a separatist if the effect of the worst scenario 
they can imagine, that is losing the referendum, would be for 
them to continue living in the best country in the world.

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 2 the United States formally notified the federal 
government that it considers our move toward tariffication of 
supply managed commodities to be a violation of the NAFTA.
<P>
	Let me state clearly that our tariffication is what was agreed to 
at the GATT, including by the Americans. In reality our good 
neighbour to the south is playing big bully games against the 
very principles agreed to at the GATT.
<P>
	On February 14 the Minister of International Trade made it 
clear he will not make any concessions to the Americans on this 
issue. I support that position. This government cannot make any 
concessions on the supply managed commodities. Our legal 
position is sound and the GATT takes precedence over the 
NAFTA.
<P>
	I would expect, therefore, that consultations with the 
Americans will be short and the message will be clear: no 
concessions on the tariff issue.

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it

1990 as the international year of literacy. It is the UN's goal to 
liberate nearly a quarter of the world's population from the 
bonds of illiteracy by the year 2000 and much of this work starts 
at home.
<P>
	It is estimated that 1.2 million adults in Ontario are 
functionally illiterate. In my own riding of Parkdale-High 
Park, librarian Rita Cox and the Parkdale Project Read are 
beating the odds. Just ask two of Project Read's recent 
graduates, Jerry Lee Miller and Ed Anable. They are individual 
success stories and are shining examples that together we can 
break the cycle of illiteracy.

an excellent job in this field.

made public yesterday, the Commissioner of Official Languages 
said that francophone and Acadian communities in Canada have 
good cause to complain.
<P>
	Bilingualism in federal institutions has been a dismal failure, 
in spite of the Official Languages Act which was passed 25 years 
ago.
<P>
	How can one explain that, in spite of the already very limited 
number of federal offices outside of Quebec which are 
designated bilingual, 28 per cent of them still do not provide 
services in French? In all other offices, even though they are 
designated bilingual, francophones have to kick up a fuss to be 
served in their language.
<P>
	In view of the worrisome rate of assimilation of francophones 
outside Quebec, what precisely is the government waiting for to 
assume its responsibilities and to respect the most fundamental 
rights of the francophone minority?

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
received a card from the Canada Council last week, as did all 
MPs. It asked me to imagine Canada without musicians, 
painters, writers and other artists. The card implies that without 
the council Canada will lack culture and imagination.
<P>
	Well I have news for the Canada Council. Canadians have 
culture and imagination in spite of the Canada Council. Works 
like those of the Group of Seven that are now hanging in our 
National Gallery were examples of Canadian culture and 
imagination long before the Canada Council was ever 
conceived. No grants were needed to create these masterpieces 
and many of today's artists work grant free.

economy, a workplace free from government interference?

week?
<P>
	Ten years ago author Anne Herbert scribbled a phrase on her 
paper placemat: ``Practise random kindness and acts of 
senseless beauty''. Since then her message has become the 
slogan for people who believe in their ability to make the world 
a better place.
<P>
	This week then is an opportunity for Canadians to surprise 
their fellow citizens with unselfish resplendent acts.
<P>
	In these times of economic disparity it is important to bring to 
the attention of this House and to all Canadians that a kindness 
movement is sweeping through North America. As the 
movement's organizers state, this week provides a common 
focus for all Canadians who believe that a little kindness goes a 
long way and that the greatest gift we can share with one another 
is our spirit of hope and optimism.

Speaker, in January the Canadian Centre for Global Security 
announced that it would be shutting down as a result of the 
federal government's decision to terminate its funding.
<P>
	For 12 years this centre provided independent and 
non-partisan policy advice on a wide range of strategic issues. 
Among them was the centre's work on the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty and peacekeeping reform.
<P>
	By terminating its funding, the government has closed one of 
the last independent centres of this type in Canada. This is of 
further concern given that we are now celebrating the 50th 
anniversary of the United Nations and the world is still plagued 
by war, instability and injustice.
<P>
	In opposition we were outraged when the previous 
government shut down the Canadian Centre for International 
Peace and Security in 1992.

yesterday in the House that Quebecers liked Mr. Trudeau's 
speech so much that they voted no in the 1980 referendum.
<P>
	How could the Prime Minister say such a thing and really 
believe it? Between you and me, the Prime Minister certainly 
could not have been serious. He has undoubtedly forgotten the 
famous promise: ``We are putting our seats on the line to bring 
about change; a no in the referendum will mean a yes to renewed 
federalism''.
<P>
	Quebecers remember that this promise was broken, and, for 
this reason, have elected few Liberal members of Parliament 
since 1984. The Prime Minister has once again demonstrated in

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADA'SCREDITRATING">CANADA'S CREDIT RATING</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after the dollar's wild ride last month and the recent 
rise in interest rates, yesterday, the renowned rating agency 
Moody's put Canada's credit rating under review.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Since Moody's 
explained that its warning was due to the unacceptable levels of 
the federal and provincial deficits, does the Minister of Finance 
admit that his strategy to shovel his deficit into the provinces' 
backyards is making financial markets even more nervous?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>On the contrary, Mr. Speaker. 
We indicated very clearly to the provinces that our intention was 
not to shovel anything into their backyards but to work in close 
co-operation with them to really solve our common problems by 
putting our fiscal house in order at the federal and provincial 
levels. I must say that, at our meeting with the provincial 
finance ministers, they understood that very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, around this time last year, the Minister of Finance 
announced that he would show his true colours in his 1995 
budget. We learned this week that the real Martin budget will be 
the 1996 budget.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that Moody's warning is based on the 
financial markets' fear of having to defer the real decisions for 
another year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in our last budget, 
we took more measures to solve Canada's financial problem 
than in any other budget in the last decade.
<P>
	We said that last year's budget was the first phase and that the 
second phase would be this year's budget. And that is still our 
strategy.
<P>
	Now, am I to understand from the hon. member's comments 
that he is against our intention to notify the provinces in order 
not to cause any surprises and that he is trying to promote the 
Conservative policy of causing surprises and offloading 
responsibilities onto the provinces? Well, that is not our 
intention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as you know, the road to hell is paved with good 
intentions.
<P>
	Since the finance minister's performance aimed at shaping 
public opinion has gone on for too long and cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars because of the rise in interest rates, can the 
minister finally act responsibly and announce today the date of 
his next budget in order to end speculations hurting the 
Canadian economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again, I indicated 
very clearly that we were following a timetable that was set a 
long time ago. There is a budget every year and we intend to 
table our budget in due course. At that time, I will be pleased to 
respond to the hon. member's question regarding the date.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In putting Canada's credit rating under review, the New York 
firm Moody's based its decision partly on concerns that the next 
budget will increase taxes.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that his inability to target tax 
iniquities as well as his refusal to pledge not to increase taxes in 
the next budget are additional sources of concern for financial 
markets?
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry to 
contradict the hon. member, but if you heard Moody's 
announcement, you know that the decision has absolutely 
nothing to do with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9777"> 9777 </A></B>
<P>
budget, nor with any assumptions regarding taxes. That decision 
was prompted by a review of federal and provincial finances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary. When the minister says that he 
wants to target the tax shelters available to the rich, something 
which we heard before in this House, is he thinking of people 
who earn $26,000 a year, as was the case in the 1994 budget, 
when he went after the tax credit for the elderly? Are these 
people the rich Canadians to whom the minister is referring?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the last budget, 
we eliminated many tax loopholes, including butterfly 
transactions, the $100,000 exemption on capital gains and the 
benefits enjoyed by corporations with subsidiaries and affiliates 
abroad.
<P>
	I do not know how the hon. member defines the rich, but let 
me tell you one thing: We, Liberal members, do not consider that 
a person with an annual income of $26,000 is wealthy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	He will know that despite his assurances, which are widely 
believed, that the government will meet its short term targets, a 
downgrade of Canada's credit rating now appears to be 
inevitable. This will lead to higher interest rates, higher 
borrowing rates and higher mortgage rates for all Canadians, 
rates that have risen considerably since the government took 
office.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that his targets, whether or not they 
are met, are totally inadequate? That is what the markets are 
saying.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that on reflection, the 
member would want to think about what he has just said.
<P>
	I am sure that he does not want to stand in the House and 
express to the world that the credit rating of this country will be 
downgraded. I hope that in his supplementary question he will 
pick up on that point.
<P>
	A reading of the Moody's press release does not lead to the 
conclusion that the member has just drawn. Let me reaffirm that 
the 3 per cent target is an interim target. We are going to hit it 
and that is a very substantial accomplishment. Our ultimate goal 
is to eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	Let me assure the member that we are going to hit our interim 
target and we are also going to hit our ultimate target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
money markets are judging the performance of the government 
and they are not judging that performance favourably.
<P>
	The minister must admit the 3 per cent target will add at least 
$100 billion in debt over the short term. At best with current 
growth rates and interest rates, the markets are discovering that 
this means a likely continued deterioration in the debt-GDP 
ratio.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the 3 per cent target is inadequate 
and must be revised on more fundamentally sound economic 
grounds?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
will admit that the reason for the increase in the debt is not the 
target we have set but is the accumulation of the debt that we 
have inherited.
<P>
	Whether it is this target or whether it is a target set by the 
Reform Party, a tail would exist. We have said very clearly that 
the 3 per cent target is an interim target.
<P>
	Interim means interim. We have set a series of short term 
goals to make sure that we do not make the mistake of the 
previous government, which was to have longer term goals and 
allow people to postpone the day of decision.
<P>
	We have set short term mileposts and we are going to hit them. 
We are going to continue to hit them until the finances of the 
country are put in a healthy state.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was the government's decision to ignore that advice and to lose 
the valuable first year in office. It is irrelevant to the money 
market whether the government hits a target of nearly $40 
billion.
<P>
	To help restore credibility to his fiscal policy in the budget, 
will the minister set definite targets beyond 1996-97 and 
specify the tough actions necessary to reach them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made it 
very clear that we are going to operate on a set of rolling 
two-year targets, that we are going to deal with the profound 
structural changes of this economy and the government 
spending needs.
<P>
	As a result of the actions taken in this budget, and the actions 
taken in the last budget, which was the most substantive in the 
last 10 years, we are going to do what we have always said we 
would do, put the country's finances in a sound state.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9778"> 9778 </A></B>
<P>
	I understand his advice. It is well taken. I have great respect 
for the question. The only question I ask is: Why did he not 
give the same advice when he was working for the Conservative 
government and it allowed this debt?

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CUSTOMSTARIFFS">CUSTOMS TARIFFS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada is now defending its tariff on agricultural 
products. The agriculture and international trade ministers have 
repeatedly suggested that Canada's legal position would not be 
strong enough to save its tariffs on yogurt and ice cream, most of 
which is produced in Quebec, where producers stand to lose 
more than $100 million if the government does not support 
them.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of International Trade. Since 
the GATT agreement provides that tariffs will replace all other 
measures at the border to protect agricultural products, how can 
the minister be so dubious about the strength of the Canadian 
position on yogurt and ice cream?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that I fully understood the 
question. The Canadian government intends to defend the dairy 
and poultry industries vigorously, as I said the other day. That of 
course includes yogurt and ice cream.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is all very well, but the fact remains that Canada's 
legal position is more or less supported by GATT and NAFTA. 
So why is the minister negotiating another agreement, outside 
GATT and NAFTA, with respect to ice cream and yogurt?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no question of negotiating another 
agreement, if I understood the question. Our position is 
fundamentally, and has continued to be, that the protection 
afforded the dairy and poultry industry under the new World 
Trade Organization is the policy we are pursuing.
<P>
	The United States has taken another view, that there is a 
commitment under the NAFTA to go to zero tariffs on those 
products. That is not our position. It may be the American 
position. Our position is clear. It is entirely defensible. We 
intend to pursue it vigorously, in the consultations which the 
United States has requested.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPOLICY">SOCIAL POLICY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my questions are for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Everyone knows that social spending, broadly defined, takes 
up about 70 per cent of all program spending. Therefore, budget 
balancing requires social spending cuts, not as a matter of 
Ideology but of simple arithmetic, to use the words of the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance agree that yesterday's 
announcement by Moody's was caused by the absence of a clear 
commitment to substantial social spending cuts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	If you read Moody's press release, it did not assign a cause for 
blame in terms of social spending. It looked at the overall 
financial condition of the federal government and the provinces.
<P>
	There is no doubt as we approach the budget that it is going to 
be important that we cut government spending. It is going to be 
important that we cut government spending in each part of its 
operation.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member that most studies in this area 
have also indicated that short term cutting of social spending 
hurts people's health, their ability to be trained and their ability 
to get work in the long run. As a leading economist I am sure the 
hon. member would agree that would add to the deficit. That is 
the balance that we have to bring to this particular exercise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very sorry to have that answer because I think the 
capital markets will not like it.
<P>
	A revenue increase in tax measures announced for the next 
budget will drive more Canadian investment abroad. The way he 
talks, the Minister of Finance will have a good shot at becoming 
the man of the year for job creation in the United States.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that it is time to stop the tired 
Liberal rhetoric about tax fairness, do what is right for Canada 
and rule out tax increases in the next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are in the next 
budget going to deal with all levels of government spending in 
all areas. There should be no doubt about this government's 
determination to break the back of the deficit. We are going to do 
that. We are going to do it fairly because fairness is the essence 
of  Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9779"> 9779 </A></B>
<P>
supporting a government's action in facing up to this burden. We 
are going to do it that way. Taxation may or may not be part of it.
<P>
	The debate that I continue to have with hon. members 
opposite is the supposition that the current system is perfect, 
that there is no need for further fairness to be built in, that there 
is no need for further efficiency. That is wrong. The tax system 
must evolve. The tax system must be improved. We intend to 
make it happen.
<P>
	In terms of job creation, 460,000-odd jobs have been created 
in this country. It is the best job creation record of any country in 
the G-7. I am damned proud of what we are doing.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the agriculture minister. Milk producers in 
Canada should be able to count on the government standing up 
for their interests in respect of the Canadian customs tariffs 
disputed by the United States. If its past record is any indication 
of what is to come, one might fear that the government may give 
in to pressure once again.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the remarks of his colleague for 
international trade that Canada is preparing to drop yogurt and 
ice cream, thereby creating a significant gap in the supply 
management system?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. The answer given by the 
Minister for International Trade was very clear. The Canadian 
position through the last 16 months that we have been in office 
has been absolute and unequivocal. We support the Canadian 
supply management system. We are determined to defend that 
system against all comers. If the United States has a different 
point of view and wants to take a run at us, we obviously cannot 
stop it from taking a run at us, but if it does we will defend 
ourselves with everything we have.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question. Since the legal position in this 
dispute is straightforward and clearly established by the 
Uruguay Round and there is nothing to negotiate, are we to 
understand that the government's weakness in this matter, which 
affects Quebec in particular, is the price to be paid to Americans 
for having resolved the conflict over western wheat last 
summer?
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, absolutely not. The position of 
the Canadian government through all of these very difficult 
trade issues with the United States has been first and foremost 
that we will defend Canadian interest and every aspect of it and 
that we will not in any way engage in any form of trade-off 
between regions of  the country or different groups of farmers or 
different commodity groups.
<P>
	Each one of these issues is separate and distinct and must be 
dealt with individually on its own merits. We will not engage in 
any form of trade-off.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened very carefully to the responses of the Minister of 
Finance to my colleagues from Calgary West and 
Capilano-Howe Sound.
<P>
	The minister has confirmed in this House that the government 
only has an interim target or goal and nothing beyond that. 
Moody's has given a message and the business community has 
given a message that there needs to be more.
<P>
	Would he confirm that the government's target is a political 
target but not a real target in terms of economic needs today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government's 
target, 3 per cent of GDP, is approximately at the level at which 
the growth of the economy becomes greater than the growth of 
the debt. The debt to GDP ratio will begin to stabilize and then 
decline.
<P>
	That is a very important target for a country. It is not a 
political target. It is an economic target. I am sure the member 
understands that. I am also sure the member understands when I 
say that it is an interim target that our ultimate target is to 
eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	I am also sure the member will understand that a country does 
not only live by targets, that it lives by success. If I might, as of 
today the fact is Canada had its most impressive year ever for 
trade. I want to congratulate my colleagues. Merchandise 
exports, imports and the trade surplus over the year are at record 
levels. I congratulate the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
minister can laud those accomplishments all he wants. Was it 
because of the government or despite the government that those 
things happened?
<P>
	Moody's and the business community are saying very clearly 
to the government that it should work toward a balanced budget 
and we could maintain our triple-A rating. That is not 
happening.
<P>
	Under the current circumstances would the minister consider 
stopping the presses, revising his budget, increasing the 
expenditure reduction and bringing in a more credible budget at 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9780"> 9780 </A></B>
<P>
end of this month, better than the one he has announced to the 
business community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last spring when 
the House was sitting the members opposite kept standing up 
and saying we are not going to hit our target, will we bring in a 
new budget, that they are panic stricken and we have to do 
something. About every second day there was a new cry of 
gloom and doom from the other side.
<P>
	At that time we said there was no necessity to bring in a new 
budget for this year because we were going to hit our targets. 
Now we are going to beat those targets by a great deal.
<P>
	The hon. member is bringing in his budget next Tuesday. We 
all look forward to it. I find it a little difficult that he stands in 
this House and says that we must revise our budget, we must 
bring in a more credible budget when he has not even seen it.
<P>
	I can understand the necessity of practising and rehearsing his 
lines for after we bring in the budget but I do not think he should 
do it publicly.

the future of those particular lands.

	As she will know, we decided to close Camp Ipperwash in last

our obligations at other facilities in Ontario and also because we 
wanted to facilitate the land being returned to the native 
population.

Hope has

	We are presently reviewing it. It is going forward for 
translation. I expect to be able to table that report sometime next 
week at which time I hope it will provide the basis for a good 
negotiated settlement between the parties. I would not engage, 
as the hon. member seems to do, in prophesying a strike. I think 
the report can provide the basis for an agreement.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we certainly hope that Mr. Hope's report does bring 
hope to the situation.
<P>
	In 1950, 1966, 1973 and 1987 the federal government

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at no time did we welcome 
the need to use back to work legislation. The Canadian labour 
code was built upon the basic principle of collective bargaining, 
which means that parties to a dispute can arrive at a settlement 
that meets their mutual interests. That is on what the labour 
relations of the country have been built and have in fact served 
us.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Over the last year or so we have had a remarkable period of 
labour peace in Canada which I think we would like to see 
maintained. I would expect, once we table the report, that hope 
will spring eternal for a settlement.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the public works minister.
<P>
	For a few weeks now, the people of Quebec and Canada have 
been living under the threat of the next budget. People in need 
fear that it might be worse than the last one in the area of new 
social and co-op housing.
<P>
	Given that since 1991, Quebec received only 19 per cent of the 
total amount earmarked for social housing, when it has a quarter 
of the population, which translates into a potential loss of $100 
million per year, would the Minister of Public works commit 
himself to correcting this unfair situation for the neediest part of 
the Quebec population?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
hon. member's question. I am sure he is well aware that all 
ministers of the crown have to participate in cutbacks in terms of 
various expenditures in each of our departments.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has been extremely vigilant with 
cabinet colleagues to make sure that every expenditure is given 
due consideration.
<P>
	I wish I could stand in the House today, and indeed in 
subsequent weeks, and give all sorts of assurances that there will 
be largess from the Government of Canada as it relates to 
housing. Quite frankly I think that would be misleading the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> That answer, 
Mr. Speaker, comes from the mouth of a minister who is well 
known for his patronage in the maritimes and who shells out 
almost $400 million a year-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I ask the hon. 
member to put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> The $100 million Quebec has lost over the 
past few years could be even higher if it were based on a 
Canadian standard-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. A question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> That is my question. Is he aware that the 
$100 million is based on population and that if it were based on a 
Canadian standard of need it would be much higher than $100 
million a year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can well 
appreciate the concerns the hon. member is expressing, but he 
should know that we are in a very difficult fiscal situation as the 
Minister of Finance has told Canadians repeatedly.
<P>
	I do not think it is accurate for the hon. member to suggest in 
the House or to imply by his questioning that somehow we are 
doing inappropriate things when it comes to the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that the government, in view of its 
limited fiscal capacity, has provided $5 million over four years 
in support of low income housing through the CREESOM 
initiative. We have provided another $5 million in terms of the 
RéparAction program and another $5 million in terms of 
landlords to upgrade rental and rooming housing. We have 
provided 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9782"> 9782 </A></B>
<P>
further assistance as it relates to assisting homeowners with 
cracked foundations.
<P>
	Given the fact that the Minister of Finance and other members 
of cabinet have a limited capacity within which to operate, I 
think we have done reasonably well under the guise of fairness 
to provide that kind of assistance to the province of Quebec.

<P>

<P>
	In his speech on Wednesday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs

concentrate on areas of federal jurisdiction, recognizing that 
overlap and duplication had become serious problems.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of

the hon. member and my colleagues opposite that overlap and 
duplication seriously impair the efficiency of our federation. 
Fortunately we are making some real progress.
<P>
	We have concluded agreements with the provincial 
government in 60 cases where we have made commitments. In 
these 60 cases, we have eliminated the overlap and duplication 
that raise costs for government in such areas as food inspection, 
drug prosecution, environmental management and, the member

question is for the Minister of Finance who in his pursuit for tax 
fairness may or may not be aware that the business 
entertainment tax deduction includes escort services as long as 
the escort services are called being a bodyguard or a tour guide.
<P>
	Again in an effort to bring sanity to our tax system, would the 
minister indicate to the House and to the Canadian public 
generally whether he feels it is an appropriate entertainment tax 
deduction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I assure the hon. member that the escort 
services to which he has referred are not permitted.
<P>
	However, if there is a situation where a bodyguard is required 
or a tour guide is required, it might be considered a legitimate 
business expense when entertaining a foreign client or someone 
like that. An interpreter would be in the same position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, this may 
put a new twist on the term bodyguard or tour around the world

<P>
	Again in the pursuit of tax fairness, the Minister of Finance 
will know full well that a number of years ago as a result of the 
Carter commission, a study into Canada's taxation system, he 
indicated that a buck should be considered a buck, a buck, a 
buck, referring to the fact that a buck as capital gains is not equal

everything should be on the table. Obviously everything should 
be looked at, but I would say that one can make the distinction 
especially at a time when one is looking to small and medium

recognize that income derived from a certain degree of risk may 
well be treated differently if we are going to create the capital in 
the country to create more jobs.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of the Environment. After 
making important commitments during the election campaign to 
reduce greenhouse gases, the government has been at a standstill 
on the issue for 15 months. Worse yet, the federal Cabinet is 
divided on the issue of whether punitive measures or only 
incentives should be used.
<P>
	Is the Minister of the Environment of the same opinion as her 
counterpart from natural resources and the Prime Minister that 
the only way to meet the red book's commitment of reducing 
greenhouse gases is to implement voluntary measures and 
incentives in the industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that 
the hon. member has not yet had the chance to read the Liberal 
government's commitment in the red book, because in the red 
book, we promised a national action program that we will 
present in Berlin, and we are continuing to work towards that 
goal with all those concerned.
<P>
	I am disappointed that, unfortunately, one government will 
not be present at the meeting in Toronto, next Monday. All of the 
action plans will be tabled at that meeting. And, unfortunately, 
the one government which will not be present at the meeting on 
the very important issue of the effect of greenhouse gases on all 
Canadians is the government of Quebec. We want to work with 
the government of Quebec and I hope that the member opposite 
will do his best to bring Quebec to the negotiating table in 
Toronto on Monday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given the bad track record the oil industry has regarding 
environmental protection, will the minister not concede that the 
government is dreaming in technicolour if it believes that it can 
reduce greenhouse gases by virtue of incentives only?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that we 
need stronger measures in addition to mere incentives. This was 
the policy we adopted in Bathurst with all of ministers of the 
environment and energy.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I must reiterate that the Parti Quebecois and 
the Bloc Quebecois will be the first to accuse us of stepping on 
the provinces' toes if we were to regulate emissions that fall 
under provincial jurisdiction. What we promised in the red book 
was to get our house in order first and also to encourage all of the 
provinces to put in place more than incentives. We expect the 
government of Quebec to take part in discussions on this issue, 
which transcends all politics. It concerns the health of 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal.
<P>
	Yesterday the government released part of its program review, 
a review that took almost a year to complete. While a number of 
patronage positions were reduced it was a drop in the bucket and 
the old system of patronage is still intact.
<P>
	Canadians are looking for a change in the process of 
appointments and until the process is changed nothing is really 
different.
<P>
	Why did the minister not announce a change in the patronage 
process during yesterday's announcement?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his question.
<P>
	The agency review announced yesterday that the number of 
governor in council appointments were reduced greatly. To 
clarify the situation, between November 1993 and the beginning 
of February the Government of Canada appointed 
approximately 700 persons to governor in council positions. It 
was actually 100 less than that because 600 were new 
appointments. The 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9784"> 9784 </A></B>
<P>
previous government had appointed 1,819 in the same period. In 
effect we have reduced the appointments by two-thirds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the patronage process has been in place in Canada for 100 years. 
Yesterday's announcement did not change the process at all.
<P>
	We need a more orderly, a more objective and a fairer process 
so Canadians have faith in the appointments the government is 
involved in.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>

	Why did the minister not change the patronage appointment

the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and </B><B>Minister of

reiterate that it is a change of process where the numbers are 
one-third of what they were before.
<P>

owner, sporting enthusiast, farmer, game hunter and collector. 
Can the minister tell the House what benefits there are in

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

privilege of leading off debate on second reading of Bill C-68. I 
commend to the hon. member <I>Hansard</I>, particularly pages 9707 
to 9710 on this subject where I develop the reasons why 
registration will enhance community safety.
<P>
	Let me briefly mention three now. By the way, I met with 
firearms' owners and groups in New Brunswick. I am well aware 
of their concerns.
<P>
	First, where someone has firearms which are in collections or 
are of value to the owner, if they are lost or stolen, registration 
will enable the police to return those firearms to the owners. 
That is very helpful.
<P>
	Second, the police want to have registration so when they are 
responding to calls of domestic violence, for example, they 
know what firearms are there before they arrive.
<P>
	Third, police say that when courts make orders prohibiting 
people from having firearms, they cannot enforce them unless 
they have registration to make sure they have collected all the 
firearms which the person in question might own.
<P>
	I commend to the hon. member the views of the Catholic 
Women's League of Canada, which has an important provincial 
chapter in Oromocto, New Brunswick, which just wrote 
endorsing universal registration and the balance of our firearms 
package.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a point of order concerning questions that are placed on 
the Order Paper.
<P>
	This is the third time I have risen in the House to ask the status 
of the answer to question 93 which I posed last October 19. 
Normally these questions must be responded to by the 
government within 45 days. It is now 122 days.
<P>
	This is a flagrant show of disrespect for the rules of the House. 
I have stood in the House three times to ask for an answer to my 
question. ``Maybe next week some time'' I am going to get an 
answer to Question 93.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9787"> 9787 </A></B>
<P>
	Is there a way to ask the Speaker of the House to force or 
to at least demand that the government respect the rules and 
give me the answer to Question 93, which is way overdue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary 
might deal with the hon. member's representations when he 
makes his statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I intend to do exactly that. This is the third time the 
hon. member has got up in the last seven or eight days on this 
particular question.
<P>
	I pointed out to him on the first occasion that when he looks at 
the question, and he knows this perfectly well because he wrote 
it, he has asked for a list that must be quite substantial.
<P>
	The question asked what contracts for services, supplies and 
leasing have been awarded by Public Works and Government 
Services since October 25, 1993 in all federal constituencies in 
Quebec and what federal government properties are located in 
those same constituencies? It will be an extremely substantial 
list.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In providing an answer to the hon. member, the government 
wants to make sure it is accurate. I have no doubt great pains are 
being taken to ensure a full, accurate response will be given to 
the member.
<P>
	The hon. member has asked for an answer within 45 days. It is 
impossible to prepare such a lengthy reply in that time and he 
knows that. We are doing our best to get the answer. I assure him 
I am working on getting an answer for his question. I will 
continue to work to get an answer for his question. I hope to be in 
a position to table that answer soon.
<P>
	In the meantime, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Shall all the questions be allowed to 
stand? The hon. member for Québec-Est will probably not 
agree.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I do not agree. The 
parliamentary secretary spoke of 45 adays, but it has now been 
122 days, not 45.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Shall the remaining questions be 
allowed to stand?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Agreed.
<P>

Kamloops has a petition. I do not think anyone will object if we 
revert to petitions.

draw to the attention of the House the importance of Canada's 
mining industry.
<P>
	They make a number of very forceful points which I will not 
repeat here. They are simply calling upon Parliament to take 
action that will increase employment in the mining sector, 
promote exploration for the mining sector, rebuild Canada's 
mineral reserves, sustain our mining communities, and 
essentially keep mining in Canada.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-59, an act to amend the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax 
Application Rules, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate having an opportunity to speak on the tax legislation 
at third reading. Essentially it is tax reform.
<P>
	As my hon. friend from Vancouver South indicated in his 
presentation, there is an effort here at tax simplification as well, 
but we have a long way to go. This multi-volume treatise is an 
effort at simplifying the tax system. Imagine the size of the Tax 
Act of Canada and the appropriate regulations and 
interpretations that would go with it. It would stand two or three 
feet on the desk.
<P>
	I am going to simply read a small portion to raise the question: 
Does this actually simplify our tax system or not? I am reading 
from page 46, number 7:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsections (1), (3) and (4) apply to dividends received after February 21, 
1994 other than dividends received before 1995 in the course of a 
reorganization that was required on February 22, 1994 to be carried out 
pursuant to a written agreement entered into before February 22, 1994, except 
that, in applying the act to dividends received before June 23, 1994 to which 
subsections (1), (3) and (4) apply,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) Paragraph 55(3.1)(b) of the act, as enacted by subsection (4), shall be read as

	It goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) The act shall be read without reference to paragraphs 55(3.1)(c) and (d) and 
(3.2)(c) and (e) as enacted by subsection 4.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Page 48, number 8:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9788"> 9788 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsections (2), (5) and (6) apply to dividends received after February 21, 1994, 
other than dividends received as part of a transaction or event or a series of transactions 
or events that was required on before February 22, 1994 to be carried out pursuant to a 
written agreement entered into before February 22, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>17.(1) Subsection 67.1(1) of the act is amended by replacing the reference to 
80 per cent with a reference to 50 per cent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Subsection 1 applies to expenses incurred after February 21, 1994 in 
respect of food and beverages consumed and entertainment enjoyed after 
February 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>18.(1) Subparagraph 70(5.1)(d)(ii) 2 of the act is replaced-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I could go on. And this is an effort at simplification. I cannot 
imagine anybody without some superhuman mind, with 
multiple degrees in logic being able to even pretend that they 
follow this.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Is it any wonder our tax system is so abused? By abused I refer 
to the many people who have lost complete faith in the tax 
system as being any kind of a fair system, a just system, an 
equitable system. They simply interpret every one of these 
sections to their advantage in the hopes there will not be an 
audit. Because of the cutbacks in Revenue Canada obviously 
there are very few auditors auditing out there, and if you are 
audited, you can challenge the interpretation.
<P>
	When my friend from Vancouver South says the government 
has taken major steps in clarifying and simplifying the tax 
system, I am not certain what section he is reading because it is 
certainly nothing I have ever read in this area.
<P>
	The hon. member goes on today as a result of this legislation 
to comment on the reduction of the business entertainment 
deduction from 80 to 50 per cent. The Minister of National 
Revenue confirmed today that escort services have traditionally 
been included as a legitimate business expense under the act, 
which raises a few questions just on its own terms. However, 
that deductibility will be reduced from 80 per cent of the escort 
service cost down to 50 per cent.
<P>
	Because of the public furore the tax department has said it is 
going to redefine that. The escort services that you see listed in a 
telephone book will be disallowed. However if the escort service 
is considered to be a bodyguard, a tour guide, or an interpreter as 
the Minister of National Revenue confirmed today, of course 
they would be legitimate deductions.
<P>
	I can see accountants becoming quite creative in the use of 
those terms to allow that business expense to continue. I could 
go on and on with all sorts of illegitimate uses. They would not 
be illegal because again, as long as an escort service is 
considered to be an interpreter or a bodyguard, it is a legitimate 
expense.
<P>
	In the spirit of fairness, surely there must be some distinction 
when it comes to business entertainment deductions. There is a 
difference between a number of individuals getting together 
over lunch or dinner to discuss a business transaction or some 
aspect of carrying  out their business, and some lavish 
entertainment where folks are visiting a number of posh clubs 
and wining and dining at extravagant prices. Again a certain 
amount of that tab is being picked up by the general taxpayers of 
the country. I simply point that out as one of the problems with a 
section of this bill.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver South gives us the impression that 
major steps have been taken to bring fairness back into the 
system. However, I do not think any step at all has been taken but 
to put some difficulty on those individuals who are carrying out 
a legitimate business transaction over a business lunch.
<P>
	Other than that in Bill C-59, I want to also mention the 
reference made by a number of speakers about the tax revolt 
which is taking place and the fact that people are calling for, 
predicting or suggesting there is bound to be a tax revolt if the 
minister raises taxes. There already is a tax revolt under way.
<P>
	That tax revolt has been in place for many years. It is called 
the underground economy. People have simply said that they 
have have lost faith in the tax system. They are going to conduct 
as much business as possible underground, under the table 
where it is then obviously unreported and by definition, 
untaxed.
<P>
	To what extent does this underground economy exist? 
Obviously there is no accurate figure, but from my study of this 
issue, the lowest amount I have ever come across is about $40 
billion in annual business transactions and the highest has been 
$120 billion. I am not here to say that either one of these 
extremes is accurate. Regardless, it is a substantial amount of 
money and my guess is that it is probably even higher than these 
estimates would suggest.
<P>
	Is there anyone in the country these days who in some form is 
not participating in the underground economy? I say that not 
suggesting anybody here or anywhere is willfully breaking the 
law. I refer to our neighbours to the south. Whenever President 
Clinton is trying to appoint someone to some official capacity 
under the scrutiny of Congress eventually or inevitably it is 
pointed out that they have participated in the underground 
economy by paying a nanny cash or buying wood for cash from 
somebody for their fireplace or participating in some barter 
aspect. It has become almost a Canadian way of life.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I notice that now when you walk into almost any book store in 
Canada right, front and centre some of the best sellers are on 
how to avoid tax. I noticed one the other day in which the person 
said forget it, leave Canada and live in the Cayman Islands and 
transfer everything right offshore. He has given up totally on 
even trying to come to any realistic approach to the tax system.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9789"> 9789 </A></B>
<P>
	In the press today I thought were some very interesting 
comments. Neville Nankivell, writing under the title of nation's 
business for the <I>Financial Post</I>, reports that presently there are 
about $6.6 billion owed in unpaid taxes. These are simply 
individuals or companies that have agreed that they owe these 
taxes and will pay them in due time and are presently paying 
a penalty. There is another $2.7 billion tied up in tax appeals 
before the courts.
<P>
	There we have $9.3 billion sort of sitting there that probably 
will end up one day in the treasury but this does not include all 
those who are simply tax evaders. Unfortunately there are 
increasing numbers of those folks.
<P>
	For the under reporters, that is the underground economy, we 
might be talking here if this were to be taxed at some nominal 
rate at between $10 billion and $30 billion.
<P>
	In other words, what this tells me, and perhaps I am naive in 
this interpretation, is that if we had a decent, fair and just tax 
system, and the economy were brought from underneath the 
table on to the top of the table and taxed at some realistic level, 
that would be the entire deficit paid down just from the 
additional revenues from a fair and honest system of doing 
business in the country.
<P>
	That is a bit of a wish list but it does point out the incredible 
extent of the underground economy and what that is doing in 
terms of the future of the country regarding our debt and deficit 
pay down.
<P>
	In the last moment or two remaining I do want to mention one 
aspect that I think is causing a great deal of concern to the public 
generally and that is the possibility of taxing dental and health 
plans that employers contribute to and so on.
<P>
	I know this would generate a lot of money in terms of the 
government. So many people now have access to decent health 
care, I am thinking particularly of the preventative kind, 
certainly decent dental care and the only way that is available to 
them is as a result of these company plans. To tax those plans, as 
so many people have indicated, would obviously mean that a 
number of people, and unfortunately large numbers of people, 
would simply have inappropriate dental and health care.
<P>
	I cannot imagine any member standing up and suggesting that 
a tax be levied on these kinds of health care plans and dental 
plans.
<P>
	I also want to draw the attention of the House to an article in 
the paper the other day mentioning the whole matter of those 
folks who are selling property in the United States and are going 
to have a tax credit here in Canada. I raised this in the House 
with the Minister of Finance. I said that if a person is selling 
property in the United States over $600,000 in U.S. assets, 
should we be providing tax credits for that here in Canada? In 
other words, should we be encouraging people to buy and sell 
property in the United States?
<P>
	I know the Minister of Finance had an explanation for this. I 
suppose he could have an explanation for even deducting escort 
services on our tax and so on. The point is as we struggle to come 
up with a reasonable tax system I notice in the press yesterday a 
whole number of what I would call tax experts are saying that 
this provision is simply wrong.
<P>
	I am not referring to members of Parliament from most 
political parties who have been critical of this. People who are 
knowledgeable about the tax system are now saying that this 
whole aspect of a tax arrangement between Canada and the 
United States that allows Canadians selling their assets in the 
United States over $600,000 to receive tax credits here in 
Canada is simply wrong.
<P>
	I would support that notion and raise this today to flag the 
incident for the Minister of Finance as something to consider 
when he introduces his budget in a few days.
<P>
	While these changes in the bill before us do make the tax 
system somewhat more equitable, we have a long way to go. In 
terms of making it more simple so people have some hope of 
understanding it, I would ask any member to sit down for five 
minutes and pick any page out of this attempted simplification 
to see if they can understand that page. If they can, I would have 
to admit they are a better person than I when it comes to 
understanding detailed tax matters.
<P>
	In closing, a lot of work has yet to be done. I appreciate that 
this is a small step toward improving the tax system but I would 
emphasize that it is only a very small step. For that reason my 
party will be voting against the bill at third reading.
