</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved the 
second reading of, and concurrence in, amendments made by the 
Senate to Bill C-37, an act to amend the Judges Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-37, an act to amend the Judges Act, has come back to this 
House with amendments from the other House.  The Senate and the 
Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
gave serious consideration to all aspects of this important bill 
and heard from a number of witnesses who contributed a range of 
perspectives on certain issues of concern to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government and the Minister of Justice I want 
to commend the senators for their diligent review of the issues. 
Here is an example of the necessity of having a Senate to review 
House legislation.  According to this government the Senate did 
an excellent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key elements of Bill C-37 were passed by the Senate, 
including important improvements to the judicial compensation and 
benefits commission process, necessary increases to current 
judicial salaries after years of salary freezes and a major 
expansion of unified family courts in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Senate proposed and passed two substantive changes 
to Bill C-37 that relate to the definition of surviving spouse 
and the mandate of the new judicial compensation and benefits 
commission.  The government is prepared to support these 
amendments for the following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to survivor benefits, the Senate did not pass the 
provision in the bill relating to the change in definition of 
surviving spouse to include common law spouses.  The Scott 
commission recommended that survivors' annuities be extended to 
common law spouses “where legally appropriate”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the commission did not systematically review all of the 
ramifications of extending the entitlement to survivors' 
annuities.  It was these ramifications that gave rise to concern 
and debate at Senate committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that no one disagrees with extending the 
benefit to common law spouses.  Rather, the issue that caused 
some public debate and a lot of debate in the Senate is the 
method by which this recognition is implemented. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accepting the recommendation made by the Scott commission, 
the government had to consider its impact on specific cases, 
including the formula to be used when there are two surviving 
spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the public service sector, the solution chosen is to divide 
the pension between the two surviving spouses. This is the 
approach taken in the public service pension plan and in the 
pension plan for members of Parliament and senators. We felt 
this was a reasonable solution which ensured consistency with 
other federal pension plans. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before the Senate committee there was much discussion 
and disagreement on what was the best approach to be used in this 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After due consideration the Senate committee did not feel that 
all of the issues had been sufficiently resolved and recommended 
that the new judicial compensation and benefits commission take a 
fresh look at the issue of judicial pensions and their treatment 
after marriage breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate also heard arguments which suggested that the federal 
government has no constitutional authority to legislate over 
survivors' annuities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to indicate that the government's concurrence in 
this amendment is not to be taken as agreement with such a 
suggestion.  The federal government does have the clear authority 
to deal with pension matters, including matters ancillary to the 
creation and administration of those pensions.  We do not accept 
the argument that the government is acting outside of its 
jurisdiction on this matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in light of the concerns expressed, we accept that it 
would be useful to have the new judicial compensation and 
benefits commission look at possible solutions for the specific 
case where there are two surviving spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this commission is to remove the political 
element in determining the benefits and compensation to be paid 
to judges. The commission will hear the opinions of a number of 
experts in pension plans and family law, and those of other 
concerned parties, before making recommendations on a formula 
for surviving spouses that is fair and consistent with the 
general practices in the area of pensions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate also gave very careful consideration to and 
ultimately approved the new commission process in Bill C-37. 
However, the Senate was of the view that the process would be 
further strengthened by the inclusion of certain express 
statutory criteria that would help define and clarify the scope 
of the mandate of the new judicial compensation and benefits 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amendment will provide, in the statute, for objective 
criteria that the commission must consider in reaching its 
recommendations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective criteria cited were the following: the state of 
Canada's economy, including the cost of living, as well as the 
government's overall economic and financial situation; the role 
played by the financial security of judges in maintaining 
judicial independence; the need to recruit the best candidates 
for the bench; and any other objective factor it deems 
pertinent.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of practice, the mandate letters of prior triennial 
commissions have always specified express objective criteria that 
should be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government and the minister there was never any doubt 
that this practice would continue.  However, putting these 
criteria into the statute will make it clear to everyone that 
objective criteria will continue to be used in coming to 
recommendations on judicial compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment will, therefore, reinforce the objective nature 
of the mandate of the new judicial compensation and benefits 
commission. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate also proposed a number of technical amendments 
regarding the wording of provisions in the bill, which do not 
change its content but which clarify the original intention of 
the bill.  The government also supports these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government is in favour of these amendments 
to Bill C-37. 
Eliminating the definition of surviving spouse will allow the 
new commission to examine all the options for recognizing 
common-law spouses and to make recommendations for a fair and 
logical approach in cases where there are two surviving spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion of obligatory criteria will help to clarify the 
mandate of the new judicial compensation and benefits commission 
and, as a result, will enhance the credibility and independence 
of this commission. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 will strengthen what is already one of the best 
judicial systems in the world.  The improvements to the judicial 
compensation process will ensure continued public confidence in 
the independence of our judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides reasonable and fair compensation for our 
judges consistent with the important role they play in protecting 
the key values in our democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased judicial resources for unified family courts combined 
with provincial commitment of support services will improve the 
way our courts respond to families and children in crisis.  The 
increase in the number of court of appeal judges will improve 
access to justice generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will both enhance the independence of our courts and 
improve access to justice.  These are goals which I am sure all 
Canadians support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to debate the government's concurrence motion on 
Senate amendments to Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, this is the second occasion I have had the 
opportunity to state Reform's opposition to this bill.  This is a 
bill which grants judges an unprecedented salary increase of 8.3% 
and establishes a judicial compensation and benefits commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is grateful for the amendment put 
forward by our colleague from Crowfoot.  We are grateful that it 
was supported and passed in this House during report stage of 
Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform amendment ensures that every four years the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights has the opportunity to 
review the report of the commission on judges' salaries and 
benefits.  This task will not be left solely to the Minister of 
Justice as originally contemplated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this amendment has not swayed our opposition to the 
bill.  It has simply made it more palatable.  The Reform Party 
still stands firmly opposed to Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated repeatedly in this House during all stages of the 
bill, other public servants and Canadians in general have not 
been afforded the same wage increase as that granted to the 
judges by Bill C-37.  At a time when Canadian incomes continue to 
decline we cannot support such an unprecedented hike in salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a June 10 Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> article, family 
incomes are still dropping and as a result Canadians need to 
stretch the family budget to keep a roof over their heads.  While 
housing costs eased during the first half of the decade, family 
income declined even more.  That nudged a proportion of Canadians 
who spend at least 30% of their income on shelter to one in four 
households, or almost 2.8 million households.  These findings, 
released by Statistics Canada, were derived from the 1996 census. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another <I>Citizen</I> article, published on the same date, 
revealed that more and more two-parent families had both parents 
in the workforce in 1996, while at the same time the number of 
children left at home was increasing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada reported that the overall lower income among 
Canadians in 1996 was the reason both parents were being forced 
into the labour market.  Stats Canada has also reported that the 
majority of Canadian children, 4.8 million under the age of 15, 
lived in two parent families in 1996.  Of those children 60% had 
both parents in the workforce, up from 43% in 1981. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this information regarding the income of Canadians, 
in good conscience the Reform Party cannot support the bill.  In 
the same vein we cannot support the government's concurrence in 
the Senate amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the thorough job the Senate did in reviewing the 
bill and the substantive amendments put forward by the upper 
house.  In particular I single out Liberal Senator Anne Cools for 
her diligent efforts in revealing the inadequacies of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Cools rightfully exposed the fact that Bill C-37 
effectively allows judges to set their own salaries and perks. In 
doing so it sets up the possibility of there being a showdown 
between parliament and the judiciary because it allows judges to 
appeal parliament's decision regarding a recommended salary 
increase in the courts.  Essentially judges could have the final 
say over whether parliamentarians are giving them a sufficient 
raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although former judicial pay commissioner David Scott has said 
that it is unlikely judges would be setting their own salaries, 
he has not ruled out the possibility of the judiciary challenging 
parliament's response to the commission's recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judiciary would have to prove, however, in a court that the 
refusal to increase salaries or a decision to lower them was 
motivated by a wish to diminish the independence of judges.  Mr. 
Scott said that even if the judges won in such a case the court 
could only declare parliament's motion on the issue void, which 
may result in a stalemate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As pointed out by the Liberal senator this will: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—deprive Canadians of their undoubted constitutional right to 
the representative assembly's control over the public purse in 
respect of judicial salaries. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly control of the public purse rests with parliament and 
not with the judiciary.  Section 100 of the 1867 Constitution Act 
states in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The salaries, allowances and pensions of the judges...shall be 
fixed and provided by the Parliament of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6 of Bill C-37 potentially abolishes the true 
parliamentary role in the fixing of judges salaries.  We must 
obviously question why the Minister of Justice has bestowed such 
potentially wielding powers on the judiciary in Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can only surmise, and again I use the thoughts and words of 
Senator Cools when she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real intent (of Bill C-37) is to remove parliament from the 
process.... There is a problem in that certain particular judges 
seem to crave a closeness to certain individuals in the 
Department of Justice and are trying to cling, closer and closer, 
to the executive rather than to parliament.  In other words, 
honourable senators, what is happening here is that 200 years of 
history are being turned on their head, and we are being told in 
this judgment that, quite frankly, judges prefer their fate to be 
in the hands of the executive rather than in the hands of 
parliament.  It is a most curious and interesting subject matter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn specifically to the amendments put forward by the 
Senate. Amendments 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8 delete all the clauses 
referring to two spouses.  Bill C-37, as originally drafted by 
the Department of Justice, created a legal right for a judge to 
have two spouses.  The two spouses clause was meant to deal with 
a circumstance in which a married judge separates from his or her 
partner, moves into a common law relationship with another person 
and then dies.  Once law, it would allow a judge to have both 
spouses, married and common law, eligible for the lucrative 
pension payouts and divide the money between them when the judge 
dies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally the common law spouse would collect the one time 
payout of one-sixth of the judge's annual salary at the time of 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Supreme Court Justice Willard Estey has said that these 
particular Bill C-37 amendments would give his former colleagues 
on the bench the right to a kind of home-made harem. It would, 
Estey said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—effectively create two separate sets of family law—one for 
judges and one for everyone else. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been well established that situations such as the one 
contemplated in Bill C-37 are rare.  One therefore must question 
why such a clause was put in Bill C-37.  Critics have suggested 
that this clause was tailor made for Chief Justice LeSage who is 
separated from his wife and has resided for about one year with 
Judge Lang.  If Chief Justice LeSage were to die, the new 
amendment would allow both Judge Lang and Mrs. LeSage to qualify 
as his surviving spouses and share his pension.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As pointed out earlier, Senator Cools, as well as many others, 
have surmised that Bill C-37 appears tailored to fit particular 
individuals.  Senator Cools said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation in the country where certain individuals have 
access to the legislative writing machine.  That is bothersome. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This certainly is not the first time the government has tailor 
made legislation.  Previous amendments to the Judges Act 
introduced during the last parliament under Bill C-42 set out 
terms in which Canadian judges could participate in international 
activities, although it was never explicitly admitted by the 
government—it was no secret—that those amendments to the Judges 
Act arose due to the appointment of Madam Justice Louise Arbour 
to the United Nations as prosecutor for the War Crimes 
Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Senate and support those amendments eliminating 
this tailor made clause of Bill C-37, clauses which, as stated by 
Senator Cools, “script their sins into the laws of the nation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not support, however, Amendment No. 3 which adds 
subclauses to clause 6 of Bill C-37.  Clause 6 establishes the 
judicial compensation and benefits commission.  These subclauses 
effectively expand the powers of the commission, powers which 
were not contemplated or countenanced in the original bill. 
Specifically we take issue with section (1.1)(a) which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conducting its inquiry, the commission shall consider (a) the 
prevailing economic conditions in Canada, including the cost of 
living, and the overall economic and current financial position 
of the federal government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly does this mean?  How expansive are the powers of 
the commission?  Does the reference to the current financial 
position of the federal government mean the commission will have 
the power to call the Minister of Finance before it to question 
him on our financial status?  If such powers are vested with the 
commission, it is setting a dangerous precedent, a precedent the 
official opposition cannot support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his appearance before the Senate committee reviewing Bill 
C-37 former commission chairman David Scott clearly questioned 
statutorily defining criteria as proposed by the Senate.  In fact 
Mr. Scott went so far as to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure what the relevant criteria would be.... I am not 
saying that there should not be any criteria, but once you start 
down the road of developing criteria, you may create a monster. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Senate's amendment goes against the advice of the 
former commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated earlier, the official opposition does not support the 
government's concurrence motion.  Nor do we support any expansion 
of the commission's powers, powers which were not originally 
contemplated by the government and the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A decision of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island forced 
the federal government to establish a judicial compensation 
commission.  Bill C-37, as originally introduced, meets that 
legal obligation.  Senate Amendment No. 3 is therefore 
unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution the government's wisdom in accepting all the Senate 
amendments, particularly given the expanded powers of the 
commission which may involve additional time and travel for their 
inquiries, time and travel which may cost additional expenditure 
of funds that were not originally contemplated by the royal 
recommendation of Bill C-37.  I am not emphatically stating that 
there is a violation.  I am simply raising a flag for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I reiterate the Reform Party's position.  We stand 
opposed to Senate Amendment No. 3.  We stand opposed to the 
outrageous salary increase for judges at a time when financial 
pressures on Canadian families continue to increase as their 
quality of life decreases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that we sit in this place in consideration of a 
windfall increase in pay for judges while in my home province of 
British Columbia public safety is being put at risk through 
reduced law enforcement due to the gutting of RCMP budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency a police car which sustains more than $4,000 
damage is parked because there is no money to get it repaired. 
There is not enough money to replace worn tires on patrol cars, 
putting both police and public at risk.  Store owners fear loss 
of business as customers run a gauntlet of crack cocaine dealers 
because police lack the money and resources to deal effectively 
with them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-37, as amended by the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that what is clearly understood can be clearly 
expressed. With this in mind, let me outline the Bloc Quebecois' 
position. We oppose Bill C-37. However, while the amendments put 
forward by our brave colleagues in the Senate are a step in the 
right direction, we think many more amendments would be required 
and much more work would have to be done on this bill before the 
Bloc Quebecois could consider supporting it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 22, the Senate made eight amendments to the bill. We 
are opposed to the principle of raising federal judges' salaries 
by approximately 13%, which is unacceptable to us in the Bloc 
Quebecois, and that is why we oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we are in favour of establishing the Judicial 
Benefits and Compensation Commission. We are also in favour of 
the Senate amendments for the following reasons: a number of 
these amendments would bring the French and English versions of 
the bill more in line with one another, while one other 
amendment clarifies the mandate of the commission being 
established by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment explicitly sets out what we believe was the 
implicit mandate of the Judicial Benefits and Compensation 
Commission. In our view, these explicit criteria are positive 
and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc Quebecois, the most crucial of these amendments is 
the one deleting clause 1 of Bill C-37. Clause 1 defines the 
term “surviving spouse” and, for constitutional reasons, we are 
opposed to the inclusion of surviving spouses in Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, we support the explanation given to the 
committee by Professor Jamie Cameron of Osgoode Hall. According 
to Professor Cameron, while it is the responsibility of the 
federal government to set benefits for federally appointed 
judges, the provinces have a similar responsibility with respect 
to matrimonial property and the division of assets in an estate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pensions are included in matrimonial property under family and 
estate distribution law.  This raises the question of whether 
the federal government has jurisdiction to legislate the 
division of estate assets by defining the expression “surviving 
spouse” and with all the rights accorded subsequently in the 
bill according to the definition of “surviving spouse”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Ms. Cameron, and the Bloc Quebecois completely 
supports this position, the federal government is encroaching on 
provincial jurisdiction over matrimonial and estate property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, we support the amendments eliminating clause 1, 
which defines “surviving spouse” and the clauses pertaining to 
the rights of surviving spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to amend the Judges Act in order to 
increase judges' salaries and to change the criteria governing 
pension plan eligibility.  The bill also establishes the 
Judicial Benefits and Compensation Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill provides for more judges in appeal and unified 
family courts.  The bill is the Liberal government's response to 
the 1995 triennial commission on judges' salaries and benefits, 
also known as the Scott commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981, Parliament provided for the creation of independent 
commissions with a mandate to confirm that the pay and benefits 
of judges were sufficient in view of the importance of judicial 
independence and the unique role given judges by the Canadian 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, 1997, in a reference regarding the remuneration 
of provincial court justices in Prince Edward Island, which 
pertained to the independence and impartiality of these 
justices, the Supreme Court stressed the importance of these 
independent commissions, which establish a vital link between 
two government powers: the executive and the judicial. 
The court also pointed out the constitutional obligation to set 
magistrates' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's recommendations are not binding on the 
government, but the court judgment requires a reasonable and 
public justification to be provided if the recommendations are 
rejected, before a court of law if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 Scott Commission I have already referred to recommended 
a progressive 8.3% increase, and the Liberal government accepted 
that recommendation in its bill by proposing 4.1% yearly for two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in determining what was reasonable, the Scott 
Commission acknowledged that a complex and broad range of 
factors needed to be taken into consideration in determining the 
appropriate pay level, including the need of pay levels capable 
of attracting and retaining the most qualified candidates for 
the office of judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is based on the relationship between judges' salaries 
and those of lawyers in private practice, since this is the 
source of most candidates for the office of judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 25 of the Judges Act calls for annual adjustments to 
judges' salaries based on the increase in the industrial 
aggregate, up to a maximum of seven per cent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges' salaries were frozen between December 1992 and March 31, 
1997, under the Public Service Compensation Restraint Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objection to the Scott report is that it is based solely on 
federal economic activity indicators, and not on the economic 
sectors most heavily affected since the 1993 cuts.  In our 
opinion, the most fundamental question is whether we should be 
putting books back into the schools and beds back into the 
hospitals, or raising the salaries of high court judges already 
earning $155,800.  These are hardly starvation wages, after all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up the Bloc Quebecois' position on Bill C-37, we think 
that the Liberal government has already achieved its zero 
deficit, but we all know it did so on the backs of the 
provinces, unemployed workers and the most disadvantaged members 
of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice may well want to reward judges by 
increasing their salaries, but she would do better to persuade 
her colleague, the Minister of Finance, to compensate the 
provinces for the cuts to health, welfare and post-secondary 
education transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois puts other priorities ahead of raising 
judges' salaries.  None of us is in any doubt that judges work 
hard, but they are far from the only ones doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to 
the principle of increasing judges' salaries. 
We are in favour of creating an independent commission, but we 
cannot go along with this lapse in solidarity and vision in an 
economic context where the provinces have borne the brunt of the 
federal government's fight to eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, we have heard the government's arguments that the 
most competent lawyers must be attracted to the bench, and we 
fully agree.  But judges too are members of society, and as such 
must take part in the collective effort.  Even though the 
federal deficit has been eliminated, the $500 billion debt is 
still hanging over our heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of increasing judges' salaries, the government could 
have given the money to the provinces to buy hospital beds and 
to help the most disadvantaged members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supplementary estimates tabled last Wednesday also indicate 
that the Canadian unity group at Justice, one of whose 
responsibilities is the reference to the Supreme Court, is 
costing Canadian and Quebec taxpayers $700,000.  Again, this 
money could have paid for many hospital beds and many meals on 
the tables of the most disadvantaged members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, therefore, I am calling on the Minister of Justice to 
withdraw her bill and to use the money instead to compensate the 
provinces for the unjust cuts they have suffered since this 
Liberal government took office.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to address the Senate amendments to Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reviewed some of the comments that I made on behalf of my 
party some time ago when this bill was first introduced.  I 
compared this piece of legislation to a recipe that my 
grandfather brought to this country from Italy some time ago. I 
said that as much as my grandfather would try to pass that recipe 
onto his children, when he would taste the sauce he would say 
“You got a little bit of it right and whole lot of it wrong”. 
I said that this bill was very similar to that sauce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has added a dash a salt but nothing particularly to 
improve the flavour of this legislation. What remains tragic is 
that with this legislation there was an opportunity for the 
government to address some fundamental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pick up on the comments of my colleague from 
Charlesbourg.  He talked about cutbacks in the provinces.  He 
talked about hospital beds.  He talked about the kinds of things 
that matter to Canadians at a time when this government is 
determined that we should give judges a substantial increase in 
their salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to talk so much about hospital beds.  I am going 
to talk about the justice system and where those funds might be 
better funnelled at a time of increasing demands on the courts, 
at a time when we are looking at a role for victims to play in 
the courts, at a time when crown prosecutors who have to enforce 
the laws are finding their hands tied because of lack of 
resources, and at a time when the RCMP and law enforcement 
agencies are finding their budgets slashed.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are determining how the very sparse funds have to be 
divided up, increasing the judges' salary at this point in time 
when this country has other problems is perhaps not the wisest 
and most judicial, if you will, use of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sit on the custody and access committee.  One complaint we 
have heard continually is that when there is a dispute in family 
law it cannot be resolved for months because of the backlog in 
cases.  There is a lack of legal aid availability for parties who 
are seeking to bring their matters before the court.  There is a 
lack of court clerks.  There is a lack of all kinds of necessary 
instruments to bring matters to court and to have them resolved 
quickly. When matters are not resolved quickly before the courts, 
it results in increased tension between the parties. The parties 
take matters into their own hands and there is increased concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These funds might have been better spent in improving the 
justice system in the provinces. That is in the family law 
courts. Let us look at the criminal courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more powers are being delegated to provincial court 
judges with fewer and fewer resources.  Again this means longer 
waiting times for court hearings.  It does no good for the 
accused, who lives under a cloud of suspicion while waiting for 
his or her day in court.  It does no good for the victim, who 
waits for months and months in a system he or she never asked to 
end up in in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts to the provinces have resulted in increased waiting 
times in both the criminal and family courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as has been raised by this side of the House, the RCMP 
training centre out west is being closed down. I am meeting with 
a group of people in my own riding next Monday when the House is 
down.  Seniors in my riding have been told that when they press 
an alarm, it will only be responded to if the person pressing the 
alarm can guarantee that there is a break and enter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I practised criminal law for some time. It was a rare occasion 
when one could say to the criminal breaking into the home “Hold 
on for a minute while I call the police to confirm that you are 
here.  Would you take the phone and let the RCMP know that there 
is a reason for them to come”.  I do not blame the RCMP officers 
for this.  The reality is that they do not have the resources to 
respond unless they can be sure there is a crime taking place. At 
the same time that this is happening, we are increasing the wages 
for some of the wealthiest people in this country.  I again 
question whether that is the best use of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a golden opportunity, which I have spoken to the 
Minister of Justice about, to review the method of appointment of 
judges. The parliamentary secretary has said in support of some 
of the Senate amendments that the criteria in terms of 
determining judicial compensation ought to be accepted and it is 
something the government looks favourably on. I would suggest we 
ought to revamp the criteria for the appointment of judges before 
we revamp the criteria for increasing their salaries and 
determining whether they ought to get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country has some very good judges.  I do not want to 
diminish that for a moment.  The late Justice Dickson was an 
example of a fine judge.  He moved this country forward in his 
position as a supreme court justice.  There are hundreds of good 
judges in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every now and then we hear about an appointment to the court 
that is simply a patronage appointment.  It is well known 
certainly on the east coast and in the province I come from that 
part of how one gets to the judiciary is to make the right 
contributions to the parties in power.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this summer there was an appointment of a judge to the 
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.  Prior to her being a judge, she 
started her career as a lawyer and a keen organizer for the 
Liberal Party.  The reward for that was an appointment to the 
public utility board in Nova Scotia which paid some $75,000 a 
year up until the age of 75.  This was a pretty nice plum and 
everybody thought she was satisfied with that. As it turned out, 
she was a classmate of the Minister of Justice, I think the year 
behind. She was not too happy on the utility board and found 
herself appointed to the supreme court. That appointment met with 
considerable criticism in the province.  It was not the only one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unfair to the judges who legitimately serve this country 
well, who achieve their appointment on merit. We need to have a 
discussion about this. I have indicated to the Minister of 
Justice that there ought to be a subcommittee of the justice 
committee that can explore and ensure a fair method of the 
appointment of the judiciary. Citizens look to the judiciary in 
some ways to set the moral standards of the country.  They look 
to parliamentarians.  They look to people in authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a time when we are talking about youth crime and young 
offenders who appear before judges.  It is very difficult to 
present to them the argument that the society we want them to 
participate in is one that is fair and just if some of the very 
people they appear before received their positions on the bench 
not because of their understanding of criminal, family or 
contract law, but because of their connections to particular 
parties.  This was a missed opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the amendments that were put forward by members of the 
justice committee from the Reform Party and the Bloc party were 
good.  It is too bad that the government could not have supported 
them.  It did support one of those amendments. The amendment put 
forward by the Bloc which had to do with the actual pay increase 
would have been well received. It is too bad that the government 
did not choose to accept that in the same way it accepted the 
amendments from the Senate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the House today to speak on the Senate amendments to 
Bill C-37, an act to amend the Judges Act and other consequential 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to see the upper chamber bringing forth amendments 
that we believe will only benefit this bill.  This is further 
proof that the other place continues to play a vital role in 
Canadian politics. It is also proof that although the Liberal 
government likes to ram bills through with little consultation, 
it does not always work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, our party is encouraged by the provisions 
contained in Bill C-37.  These amendments will improve the 
independence, the objectivity and the effectiveness of the salary 
and benefits commission process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6 of the proposed amendments will for the most part 
strengthen the judiciary.  For example, the need to attract 
outstanding candidates to the judiciary will not only enhance the 
credibility of the judiciary but it will also enhance the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is encouraged by the 
provisions which make the appointments less bureaucratic and more 
democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commission will consist of three people, of which one will 
be appointed by the Minister of Justice.  The other would be 
appointed or nominated if you will, by the judiciary, while the 
chair would be named by the two previously mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand by my remarks from last March when I first spoke on this 
bill.  I believed then as I do now that a better, more 
accountable way of appointing people to this committee would be 
to enable the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to 
nominate a member to sit on the commission   Such a process would 
not only improve the transparency, but it would also eliminate 
some of the patronage that goes on during these appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the deletion of section 45 of the act, the joint and 
survivor provisions, it will rightfully entitle the respective 
provincial governments to handle the salary and benefits 
situation as it relates to spouses according to the province in 
which the judge respectfully works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of this is in Quebec where common law marriages are 
not recognized. 
Should Quebec judges be penalized for working in Quebec?  No, 
they certainly should not be.  This amendment will ensure 
equality for all judges right across the country as it relates to 
their place of work and residency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By keeping central control in the confines of the provincial 
government, we believe it is more practical to apply a case by 
case process as it pertains to individual judges.  Narrowing the 
scope eliminates the possibility for difficulty and confusion 
down the road.  This legislation has invoked a great deal of 
passion and provocative commentary within the House, and to some 
extend a great deal of righteous indignation on the part of some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to focus on the role of judges and the important 
tasks they are charged to perform.  We have previously debated 
the important question of the separation of power in society.  My 
party strongly believes judicial independence is the cornerstone 
of our democracy.  There is no question that we as 
parliamentarians may not always agree with a court's decision, 
but it is our job to respect and uphold the system in place for 
the good of the country and the citizens we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it cannot be stated strongly enough or with enough 
emotion the importance of having our judges remain independent of 
the elected body.  We as parliamentarians are elected as opposed 
to appointed judges.  A balance needs to be struck to eliminate 
the practice of governments, in particular majority governments, 
using heavy handed measures the judiciary is called to 
investigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party is comfortable supporting the amendments brought forth 
today because they give guidelines to the commission that will 
ultimately strengthen the judiciary and present guidelines for 
the way salaries are set.  Furthermore, we believe in an 
independent commission setting the judges' salaries.  The 
provisions regarding spousal pension benefits are nothing but 
beneficial to the law and the process.  Therefore I would ask 
that the other parties here today agree to the amendments brought 
forth.

agreement in Saskatchewan and how it continues to fail daily in 
terms of the obligation of this government.  It drives the wedge, 
a feeling of inequality, between rural Saskatchewan and this

</I></B></P><P align=left>A promise was made to the rural governments of Saskatchewan that 
when the natives would acquire Indian land, the RMs would be paid 
22.5 times the assessment for the land taken out of the 
assessment role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the deal was that they would get 22.5 years of 
taxes in lieu of services they provided.  When this government 
came into power, it changed this so that the rural municipalities 
of Saskatchewan get a mere 5 years taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an injustice.  The debt owed to the RMs is owed by the 
government and the people of Canada.  It is a national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the government think that 200 or 300 people left in a 
rural municipality can pick up the entire debt of losing 20% of 
the assessment of their land forever?  It has gone into reserve. 
The RMs are not quarrelling about the acquisition of land.  The 
quarrel is with this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens to the remaining farmers in that area?  They have 
to have their taxes raised considerably in order to provide the 
same services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous minister of Indian affairs flatly refused to meet 
with the delegation from Saskatchewan.  I throw this question out 
to the minister of Indian affairs now. Would that hon. member 
now, in her new position, not meet a delegation from Saskatchewan

That is key to the survival of rural Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I want to have an understanding how my rural municipality 
is doing, I have the right to go down to the office, ask for a 
financial statement and it would provide that for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since King John was forced to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede, 
we have progressed in the democratic way so that we have a type 
of government, both at the municipal level right to the federal 
level, in which Canadians are demanding they have accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we deal with the bill, why are we denying the right of fellow 
Canadians, grassroots people who live on our native reserves, the 
same type of accountability we have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would any one of us here want to turn back the hands of time to 
an autocratic way of government?  Would we want to go back to 
even before this century where we did not have the necessities 
laid out and spelled out of how we have to handle people's money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was 20 years on local government.  What did we have to do?  We 
had to prepare a financial budget.  When that was completed and 
sent to a superior government, which is the province, we then 
every year had to have an annual financial statement done by a 
registered auditor.  That had to be returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we trying to operate any differently in all of Canada 
from the privileges that members of this House enjoy as citizens? 
That is the big question.  That is the question the bill does 
not address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a group of us want to go into business, there are guidelines 
in legislation, both federal and provincial, which require 
certain things to take place.  There are certain checks and 
balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not, as the senior government, the Government of 
Canada, ask for the same procedures in business and 
accountability no matter where people live in Canada?  That is 
the question. 
We would not want to turn back the hands of time.  I would not 
want to live in a town where I could not get information as to 
how my tax dollars are being spent.  I would not want to live in 
a municipality where the reeve and the councillors made sure they 
did not have to report to the people.  Why are we accepting this? 
That is the big question facing Canadians.

we define municipal government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be honest with Canadians.  That is not true.  With any 
group of people given sovereign powers within a province, if that 
is the intent of this legislation, we are creating something

sovereign areas in an area where sovereignty does not belong. 
How will we handle this?  What are we doing with the series of 
legislation bills which will be forthcoming?

go a long way back.  We note that there are positive and negative 
votes coming in the referendum today.  I got back to some of the 
people I still know there.  They are saying they will vote 
against the treaty because they want the same right as I have as 
a Canadian citizen to know exactly the amount of money coming in, 
how it is being spent and how the distribution is taking place.

Saxon in Shelburne County will lose 25 jobs in December this year

the 25 jobs in Port Saxon, Shelburne County, is a serious blow to 
the economy of Shelburne County as the economy is already reeling

</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians come before the finance committee in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask for a more complete answer.  Why is there a delay in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that, with respect to the Canada social transfer, 
the principal transfer payment to the provinces, the province

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> We are very glad to have a fair federation

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's answer is far from reassuring.  He talks about 
partnership.  He says he will respect provincial jurisdiction, 
but we know what the government is up to.  It wants the 
provinces to do what it says, and no questions asked.  A look at 
Quebec's unemployment rates today will show that Quebec is far 
from being badly governed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What right does the federal government have to impose its

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

is 9% higher per capita than that received by the average 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this can be turned around and that, one day, we will 
receive less than the average.  That will prove that we have 
left behind a situation that is a huge drain on our economy, a

most of us in Quebec want to remain in Canada.

in 1994 the federal government's transfer payments were the

only $386.  When it comes to being the great protector of health 
care, we have seen better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Health.  What credibility can 
there be when a minister wants to impose conditions on any 
additional funding for health care, when all that anyone wants 
is for transfer payments to be restored to the level they were 
at before he started slashing them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

to provide the current figures.  In both cash and tax points, 
each Quebecker receives $925.40 through the Canada social 
transfer.  The average per capita across Canada is $848.70, so 
each Quebecker in fact is getting 9% more than the average.

federal government to re-invest in health.  I find that far from 
reassuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this area, as in many others, this government's main concern 
is not what is best for patients, but what gives it the most

If she looks at other federations, she will see how much the 
other federal governments intervene in the health field, 
compared to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to ensure that Canadians have quality health care in 
every part of Canada.  I would also like to say that, since the 
hon. member is speaking of situations that worry her, what we 
find worrisome is the situation in Quebec, where the PQ 
government has cut health expenditures by 1% between 1994-95 and 
1998-99, while the other provinces have raised them by 8.6%.

recognize we have some tools there for assistance and farm income

<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the reason GRIP is gone is that this Liberal government did away

could have modified the program to have it become trade friendly 
but they did not.  Once again they gave agriculture short shrift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Agriculture has a proposal. In my

all the world.  It is protecting our forest industry and it is 
making sure we have credible good markets to rely on.  Canadian

Liberal government caved in to the U.S. when it negotiated the 
softwood lumber agreement.  Will the government fix the quota 
system or will it continue watching the British Columbia lumber 
industry being hit with two by fours?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

agreements with several countries with regard to trade practices, 
in particular the softwood lumber agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening in the B.C. forest industry, especially the 
coastal industry is that exporters that rely on Asian markets in 
particular and who in many instances do not rely on American 
markets are now feeling the pinch of the Asian flu.  That is 
severely restricting their export capability but they are 
expanding and moving forward with new markets.  The Canadian 
industry is probably the most buoyant and the most competent in 
developing those types of markets.

part will be the last five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some fundamental questions in relation to this bill, 
and the bills that no doubt will be coming down the line, that 
Canadians, all Canadians, wherever they live, deserve answers for 
from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us, delivered to us about two years ago, the 
largest, most costly royal commission report ever presented to 
the House.  It totalled some $58 million.  It deals specifically 
with what we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know if we have changed the meaning of rule of 
law.  Canadians need to have a debate on that issue.  That debate 
should take place in the House by their elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time we hear the term self-government.  If we ask a 
municipal official, he will tell us what self-government means. 
If we ask a town, a village or a city official, they will tell 
us. However, there are 30 million or more Canadians out there who 
simply do not have an explanation of what the term 
self-government means as we are using it in the context of this 
House.  It is incumbent upon members of parliament, it is 
incumbent upon government members, to say that we need to have a 
debate in the House so that all Canadians, not just our native 
friends, but all Canadians understand what we mean by 
self-government.  I have asked at least seven different sources 
and I have never received a definitive answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if any members opposite could provide this House with a 
definitive answer today as to what is meant by self-government as 
it relates to the royal commission report which we have before 
us.  I owe that to my constituents.  Members from Manitoba owe it 
to their constituents.  Everybody needs to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have introduced a bill.  There is a vote being held today in 
northern B.C.  Obviously there are going to be more.  I am facing 
five or six land claims in Saskatchewan and nobody can tell us 
what the government means by self-government.  We have to know 
before we can intelligently pass more legislation, or even this 
legislation.

bottom up.  It does not give them the right to control.  It is 
not a democratic process.  For that reason, and for the reasons 
of people across Canada, I cannot vote for the bill.  Nor can I 
continue to have the term self-government being used in all of 
its various contexts in the House without having a clear cut 
definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon the government to be honest with the House 
and with people across Canada and tell us what is meant by 
self-government as it applies to the treaties or any other 
legislation that comes before the House.  If that cannot be done, 
the government should not expect Canadians to support its 
actions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my colleague's remarks with great interest 
because we are all very concerned about what exactly these 
self-government treaties involve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a topic at the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development for some time.  While there 
appears to be nothing that will be a constitutional problem in 
the treaties we are talking about, nevertheless it would be a 
reassurance for all Canadians to hear the interpretation of the 
term self-government from expert witnesses from the Department of 
Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform the member opposite that the committee 
has discussed just that strategy for a witness program when this 
bill goes to committee.  I suggest to him that perhaps he should 
agree with the bill in principle and reserve his final judgment 
on his concern about what is actually meant by self-government 
and whether it is indeed in the interests of all Canadians, as I 
believe it is, and wait to see what the expert witnesses from the 
Department of Justice say at the committee.  He could then make 
his decision when the bill comes back for third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his comments.  That is exactly what I am talking about.  It is 
not just to inform the House, it is to inform the entire nation 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we should not rely only on constitutional 
interpretation.  We have to be in touch with all Canadians 
because it will indeed affect not just those people to whom some 
type of government is granted, it will also affect the rest 
of the people living in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are six Indian groups, six reserves, in my constituency. I 
want to be as honest and fair with them as I possibly can.  But 
at the same time I have to be honest and fair with the rest of my 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to committee stage, but I can tell the hon. 
member that I have great fears about the constitutionality of 
this if what I read in the royal commission report will in fact 
establish sovereign states.  Approximately 150 to 300 little 
islands would be created within Canada, which simply could not 
survive under the totality of rule of law in Canada.

appreciate my colleague's intervention on this subject.  I am

natives in his area on this issue and whether they are in favour 
of what is happening in the federal government or whether they 
are opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking specifically of the grassroots people as opposed 
to the people who are presumably in charge in the different 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is what I hear from my 
friends in Saskatchewan, and not just within my constituency. If 
we are to get to the bottom line I will repeat what they are 
saying. 
They want the same rights as members of parliament.  They want to 
know where their tax dollar is going, how their government is 
spending their money.  They want audited financial statements. 
They want budgets.  They want everything we have always enjoyed.

principles so all people in Canada can enjoy the benefits of open 
and transparent democracy.  That is what we must have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I share with my colleague a concern about the 
terminology with respect to self-government and sovereignty.  We 
do not want small nations within a nation.  This is a debate that 
constantly appears in the committee of which I am a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill gets to committee and is debated, does the member 
find there is nothing to the term sovereignty, that it is really 
not sovereignty we are talking about in these treaties but a form 
of municipal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we find that kind of reassurance from justice department 
officials and other witnesses who come before the committee, 
would the member be willing to take that message back to his 
community to reassure the people who are genuinely concerned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly will take the 
message back.  If self-government means a form of municipal 
government such as my town's government or the governments of the 
smaller cities in my constituency that are subject to provincial 
and federal legislation, I am all for it.  I can speak on behalf 
of all of my constituents who are also for that.  If any other 
meaning were to be applied to the term to create sovereignty, I 
would be opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go out with that message.  I will make a press release 
tomorrow if he can assure me that is the case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member mentioned that all of his constituents felt it would be 
acceptable for self-government to be defined in terms of a 
municipal government being responsible to the provincial 
government.  I am under the impression that he has some first 
nations people within his riding.  I would seriously question 
that all of them feel that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that virtually every first nation in Canada 
desires to move toward self-government so they will not have to 
respond totally in the context of a provincial government.  First 
nations people want control over their own lands.  They want to 
make their own laws.  There are some limitations with regard to 
criminal offences, but as a developing governing nation the first 
nations deserve the same opportunities Canadians have had since 
the beginning of recognized government.  I would like to see it 
move ahead in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious to know whether the member has any first nations 
people in his riding and if he can truly attest to the fact that 
all his constituents would like to see self-government as a 
municipal government doing what the provincial government says it 
should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a good question.  I 
assure the hon. member for Churchill that the people I have 
talked to, not only those within my constituency, want control 
over their lands.  No one disputes that.  They want control over 
the development of business.  No one disputes that.  Even with 
the RMs that are losing portions of their land to the Indians to 
enlarge their reserves there is no quarrel.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the people who form the Indian nations do not want to use the 
term municipality, that is fine, but they will still have to be 
subject to some other form of government in the rule of law 
scenario.  We can give them provisions to pass bylaws to certain 
laws that apply to their own people.  We are not arguing that, 
but there are some fundamental Canadian laws that have to be 
applied whether people are living in Nanaimo or Halifax.  They 
have to be the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respond to the hon. member's question by saying that we 
accept that form of government, but we do not accept their having 
powers that are above those of the federal government or equal to 
those of the federal government in jurisprudence.  That is not 
rule of law and Canadians would not accept that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating Bill C-49 which is important to 
all Canadians including aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On reflection and on examination of the bill I find I am unable 
to support the bill in its present form.  As it goes through 
parliament I hope amendments will be brought in that make it more 
acceptable to both aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly support the right of aboriginals to manage their own 
lands, but we must think about Canada as a country.  We must 
remember that aboriginals are Canadians.  We occupy the same 
lands as defined by our national boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good of all Canadians is paramount.  The people of Canada 
need one government that is supreme, one government that is in 
charge and responsible for the country and for all the people 
residing in its boundaries.  All other levels of government have 
to be at lower levels to the federal government.  All governments 
and all laws have to be subject to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard and examined the report of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples, “Gathering Strength—Canada's Aboriginal 
Action Plan”.  It had a lot of good features to it.  It 
certainly helped move the debate down the road and helped to make 
Canadians more aware of what was going on. I question how many 
Canadians have actually read the report and understand it.  Many 
aboriginal people have read it and a pretty significant number of 
them have some very deep concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with some of their concerns in my speech today.  I 
think I could sum them up by saying that they deal mostly with 
accountability and the place poorer children and women in 
particular will have in a future self-government.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission report should have stated unequivocally 
that accountability of elected representatives on our first 
nations lands had to be in place as self-government moved along. 
It should have included built-in democratic guarantees to all 
aboriginal people.  A cornerstone of democracy would not be 
restricted to such things as election laws being equivalent to or 
better than the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would seem to be pretty basic to any self-governing 
democracy.  However we find on first nations reserves which come 
under the Canada Elections Act contained in the Indian Act that 
elections are not always fair to the people who are 
participating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long will Canada and the aboriginal people in particular go 
along with the idea of hereditary chiefs?  This was brought to my 
attention many times, over and over again.  When there are 
hereditary chiefs we do not have a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cultural aspects of hereditary chiefs are certainly 
important.  They were a fact of life of aboriginal people.  I 
believe that it can be accommodated through some form of governor 
general, a figurehead for the reserve and its people.  True 
democratic institutions are what are required by aboriginal 
people.  In order for them to have that they need full democracy 
as we know it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to election laws that have to be clearer and fairer 
for everyone, there should be an independent auditor general.  An 
independent auditor general would be free to criticize the 
government and government departments he is reporting on.  That 
could have been built into all agreements with our aboriginal 
people. Without it there is no accountability of elected 
officials who manage agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third matter that would be a good cornerstone would be an 
access to information component.  How can people be governed and 
assess— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It is Friday and I hate to delay the time of the House, 
but you are aware that it is incumbent upon the government to 
keep a quorum in the House.  I do not see a quorum.  It is a very 
important piece of legislation and we should have a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member knows that it 
is incumbent upon all members to maintain a quorum, but I will 
count the members present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the last cornerstone I 
would speak about would be an ombudsman to assist people who are 
unable to deal with their elected officials due to a possible 
lack of education, a disability, or mental lack of capacity to 
understand exactly what is governing their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition to self-government within the native community is a 
fact of life.  There is also widespread concern within the 
non-native community as it sees child poverty and the terrible 
living conditions that have resulted in the last 70 to 80 years. 
They see a gigantic gap between rich and poor.  Many aboriginal 
people say that the rich among them got that way by getting a 
much larger share of financial resources intended for a much more 
equitable distribution among the people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This opposition to self-government includes women's rights.  How 
can it be that aboriginal people do not have the same democratic 
rights and protections available to the majority of Canadians? 
The royal commission could have made a big step in clarifying 
this and making sure all future discussions between the federal 
government, aboriginal peoples and elected officials include the 
bottom line that without democratic rights for everyone nothing 
goes forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and the aboriginal leaders who prepared 
these documents could have eliminated this opposition to 
self-government by simply stating and ensuring through action 
that Canadian aboriginals have all the democratic rights enjoyed 
by the non-native Canadian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 will ratify and bring into force the framework 
agreement on first nations land management.  The framework 
agreement, it is my understanding, was signed by a group of 14 
first nations and the federal government.  It enables first 
nations people to opt out of land and property sections of the 
Indian Act individually and to establish their own land codes to 
manage reserve land and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that I support aboriginals' managing their land.  As 
a land owner in Manitoba I have certain responsibilities and 
rights to manage the land I own.  I accept, though, that the 
federal government has the final say with regard to how I use 
that land under some circumstances.  For instance, if I am to use 
my land in a way that harms my neighbours or destroys the 
environment of my area, obviously we need the government, 
parliament, to be the final arbiter of what goes on in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 deals with land management.  Yet in purpose and 
function it amounts to the creation of a partial yet substantial 
form of self-government for the first nations that are 
signatories to this framework agreement.  The framework agreement 
grants these powers of self-government in two primary ways. 
Individual first nations will establish a land code which will 
give them authority to pass laws for the development, 
conservation, protection, management, use and possession of first 
nations lands.  It will allow them to control the issue of 
leases, licences and other interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, there is no constitutional basis for the creation of 
this kind of third level of government because under this 
framework agreement where there is a contradiction, a conflict 
between whether aboriginal law applies or Canadian law 
applies, under certain conditions aboriginal law can 
take precedence.  That is one of the big concerns I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 37 is particularly questionable.  It says in effect that 
in the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this act 
and any other federal law this act prevails to the extent of the 
inconsistency.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, Bill C-49 would not only give first nations 
authority to create laws in areas that fall within the 
jurisdiction of their land codes but it would give them powers 
which could and probably will supersede federal laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I get back to the discussion that were those laws and 
uses of these lands to be detrimental to their neighbours there 
has to be one final authority and that final authority has to be 
the elected officials who represent all Canadians, members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another significant dimension within Bill C-49 is that major 
sections of the Indian Act will no longer apply.  In the absence 
of these sections and with first nations no longer being subject 
to either federal or provincial laws in the areas where they have 
or would have authority to create their own, this bill has the 
potential to create a serious legal and legislative vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this was not a clever plan by the legal profession of 
Canada to create a lot more cases in court.  However, it 
certainly seems it will have that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My greatest concern deals with women and children on reserves. 
They seem to have the greatest concern over this whole issue of 
self-government and the laws being passed and the agreements 
being made.  It is a legitimate concern, one that we as 
parliamentarians must address before this bill is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has to ensure that those people who are less able to 
help themselves are fully protected and are able to lead good 
lives, lives that the majority of Canadians accept as being 
normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of divorce laws, property rights and what a spouse 
who is divorced ends up with is also of paramount importance.  At 
present it is my understanding that provincial and federal laws 
dealing with divorce on aboriginal reserves have no effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not seem right that the fundamental democratic 
principles I was talking about, which would include property 
rights, the right of a woman or a man to share the opposite 
spouse's property in the case of divorce, be in place and part of 
any agreement that moves forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see an all encompassing application of Canadian 
law to aboriginal peoples.  That is what they are basically 
demanding and asking for.  Some in the community do not 
particularly want to see those democratic rights proceed with the 
equivalent rights we have in the rest of Canada.  I suspect that 
close examination would reveal it has more to do with the 
possibility of self-enrichment than with what is good for 
aboriginal people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a letter sent to an MP from the B.C. Native Women's 
Society. As members of parliament we often reflect what 
constituents say from across the country.  We interpret and 
deliver to this House what we believe to be our constituents' 
concerns. We lay them out in our own words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I bring these aboriginal women's words to the House as 
part of the official record in a more direct way. I would like to 
read some portions of this letter because their explanation, this 
group of aboriginal women, expresses it in ways that no member of 
parliament can.  That is because it comes from the heart.  It 
comes from living under the conditions and laws they find so 
objectionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first paragraph the women say: “You must defeat this 
bill, the first nations land management act”. These women are 
not speaking for every aboriginal person in the country.  But 
they are speaking for a significant number.  I had a meeting in 
Winnipeg on October 31. I heard the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I reflect on Bill C-49 and the whole movement toward 
self-government, we have to make sure democratic principles are 
in place and that every Canadian, rich or poor, aboriginal or 
non-aboriginal, has the rights enjoyed by all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the comments of my colleague from the 
Reform Party.  I have been trying to understand what their 
position is having listened now to the debate for several hours 
and hearing various members of the Reform Party debate Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand members of the Reform Party purport to support 
aboriginal self-government and management of their lands and yet 
it seems that every single member has risen to nitpick this bill 
apart, tear it apart and say that because it is not a perfect 
situation this will go down in flames. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has talked about the need for democratic elections 
and has questioned that this bill has no constitutional basis for 
aboriginal government.  I would like to question the member on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, today we know that in the vote taking place on the 
Nisga'a referendum there will be provision for a democratically 
elected government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to query the member on his basis for claiming that 
there is no constitutional basis for the establishment of 
aboriginal government. It seems all members of the House and all 
governments have a responsibility to recognize the inherent 
self-right to government by aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member talks about his concerns for women and children 
in first nation communities I advise the member to look to his 
own party in terms of its representation of women as being among 
the lowest of any political party in Canada.  I find it curious 
that he would be raising this issue when within his own 
organization the issues of women and the representation of women 
are very low, something that should be of concern to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member to really be clear as to whether 
his party stands for aboriginal self-government.  What is the 
Reform Party position?  It seems to me Reformers are trying to 
talk out of both sides of their mouths on this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day this framework is before us that has been 
negotiated in a fair and open process. The first nations involved 
have endorsed this process. I find it very difficult to 
understand the Reform Party's position that while it says it 
supports self-government there is really nothing in this bill it 
finds worthy of support.  It seems to be a contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could comment for the 
next half hour on the things the hon. member for the NDP brought 
up.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, democratic rights for every Canadian is not 
nitpicking.  That is a fundamental each of us living in this 
country deserves.  Without democratic rights, who is not liable 
to be locked up arbitrarily or have laws applied to them that are 
inconsistent even with human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to women, children and the poor, approximately 
18,000 aboriginal people live in my constituency.  Looking back 
over the past five to 10 years, I have seen no member of 
parliament stand up and do anything for the aboriginal women and 
children in our community.  They tried through the official 
methods, but no one listened to them.  They tried the RCMP. They 
tried Indian affairs. They tried individual members of 
parliament.  They tried all these official methods of addressing 
their problems and got nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am so proud to have held the accountability coalition meetings 
in Manitoba.  The last one was on October 31.  I announced in the 
House beforehand that it was open to everyone. Who did I see at 
my meeting?  I saw a member from the Manitoba legislature.  One 
of the Progressive Conservative members saw fit to come and 
contribute to the meeting.  I saw no other elected members of 
parliament or members of the provincial legislature, other than a 
couple of Reform members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will let the House and the Canadian people judge who stands up 
for women and children in our communities.  By ensuring 
democratic rights and bringing to the fore the complaints of 
these people, it is the Reform Party that is standing up the most 
for the disadvantaged people and natives in particular. That is 
my answer very simply to nitpicking and women's rights and 
problems in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many countries do we have in Canada?  Do we have one 
country?  Do we have two?  I believe that there are in the 
neighbourhood of 600 aboriginal reserves with land rights in 
Canada.  Are members on both sides of the House, and NDP members 
in particular suggesting that we should have 601 countries?  Are 
we headed to 601 countries making agreements with each other or 
making agreements with foreign nations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These basic principles have to be clarified to the Canadian 
public.  We are being left in a big mishmash as we move forward 
toward self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term self-government could be applied to the provincial 
government in Manitoba in that it has rights and 
responsibilities.  In this process of self-government for 
aboriginals we have to do two things.  We certainly have to 
clarify that basic democratic cornerstones apply to absolutely 
every aboriginal person. We also have to clarify just where the 
process is going to end up.  If it is to negotiate out 601 
countries, why not divide it up even more until we are not a 
country at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent a lot of my lifetime working in the public service 
and working for Canada.  I have done that because I believe this 
is a great country. 
It can stand improvement in areas, certainly in the financial and 
spending areas.  But those areas do not touch on the very basic 
right of every Canadian to have the democratic principles 
available to them in dealing with their elected officials.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the letter from the B.C. native women. I am sure 
that certainly applies across the prairies, Ontario, Quebec and 
the maritimes. Their complaints reflect exactly what I am saying. 
They are saying they do not feel secure.  They do not feel that 
self-government is going to protect them.  They have stated in 
the letter exactly why that is the case.  I will pass the letter 
to another member in my party who will be able to bring that out 
and show the exact words of these people and what their concern 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be clear to this House that the Reform Party is not 
saying that Bill C-49 is a total disaster.  We are saying it is 
not addressing the basic concerns these people have in regard to 
democracy.  Until we have that in place, we should not proceed in 
making it tougher and causing more litigation between the parties 
that we are trying to get to live together in a unified Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find myself in the odd position of having to spring to 
the defence of a Reform Party member, the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake because I feel strongly that it is the role of 
the opposition to nitpick legislation at second reading.  That is 
why we are here, to debate and try to find flaws in the existing 
legislation so when it goes to committee it will have some 
guidelines on what to look for in order to correct the bill and 
make it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not quite sure where the member for the NDP was coming 
from.  Possibly she had not read the legislation or perhaps she 
misunderstands her role as a member of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my part, I have never hesitated as a government member to 
examine legislation at second reading debate very carefully and 
to point out where I feel there may be shortcomings.  I do not 
share the same concerns as the Reform Party members that there is 
a problem in the bill with respect to the allocation of 
sovereignty.  I actually believe the bill provides for this. When 
it is debated in committee the members opposite will get the 
reassurances they need with respect to not giving away the store 
and creating mini states within Canada.  I do not believe the bill 
does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one concern with respect to the bill and I hope a member 
opposite will address it.  I cannot find anywhere in the bill a 
provision for transparency.  There are some clauses that talk 
about accountability but there is no clause that I can find that 
would require the management groups or whoever administers this 
act on the reserves or on the self-government entities provide 
for open debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that there cannot be accountability without 
transparency.  There has been a trend over the years to create 
legislation that does not firmly provide for committees and 
councils in self-government regimes to have their debates in an 
open forum.  That is key to an amendment or change I would like 
to see in the bill.  I would ask the member opposite or a member 
of the Reform Party if they might share the same concerns I have, 
that we should be looking for an amendment that clarifies a need 
for transparency in deliberations when the bill goes through.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what we are 
doing here is reversing the roles.  The member had 20 minutes to 
make a speech and he used just a little over two. Really what he 
was doing was questioning our position on this. I appreciate that 
he recognizes those of us on this side, and I will be gracious 
and include everyone in the House, have an obligation to look at 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that happens to be in place right now is our 
motion to suspend the bill for six months.  The reason for this 
is to provide the opportunity to get it right.  I have often said 
to my children and to my students over the years that it is much 
better to get it right than to get it fast.  Perhaps that is why 
I am so slow all the time.  It is very, very important to get it 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance, this legislation has a lot of flaws.  A lot of 
things in it just are not right.  They fundamentally are not 
right.  They are not right philosophically. They are not right 
socially.  They tie us together as humans living on the same 
continent within the same boundaries with a political 
organization that will not work well in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have to do is read a little history and look at the 
history of different countries, countries where there is a clear 
delineation of the powers, responsibilities and privileges of the 
different levels of government.  We are getting a hodgepodge. We 
are getting a total mess where based on race, based on factors 
such as personal characteristics, one set of laws applies and 
another set applies to different people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different laws for pensions for MPs and senators as 
opposed to what other people have.  There are different laws with 
respect to just about everything that can be named.  We split up 
people and start pitting them against each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appeal to the government, to those eager backbenchers 
over there to finally say to the government and better yet, to 
stand up when the vote is taken and say “We support this six 
month hoist.  We support that we need to work on this more.  We 
support that we have to get it right.  Let us make those 
fundamental changes”. I would urge the member who has just given 
this extremely short but I would say concentrated and valuable 
speech to get his colleagues together and say “Here are some 
things in this legislation that are fundamentally not right.  Let 
us delay it so that we can get it right”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you just tuck your head down and dive off the 
diving board without first checking to make sure there is water 
in the pool, would be an act of sheer stupidity.  It is absolute 
folly for the government to ram this legislation through without 
giving it very serious thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implications of what we are doing here are immense for the 
future of our country, our children and our grandchildren.  I 
would like the member to elaborate a little more on what he said 
in his speech and to respond to what I have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reason my speech was so 
short was that I did not find much of great concern in the 
legislation.  I believe an economy of words in this House is 
something everyone should seek.  That is what I was trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the member has responded and raised some issues, I will 
say the reason I think the bill should go forward basically as it 
stands and go to committee for further deliberation is that I do 
not think it contains elements that cause the concerns raised by 
the members opposite. I do not feel that it creates mini states 
within Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution provides special treatment for Canada's 
aboriginal peoples.  That is in our Constitution.  It is like 
official bilingualism.  It is part of our national makeup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have to be very careful—and this is where members 
opposite strike an appropriate chord—we do not create states 
along the model of apartheid in South Africa where sovereign 
states were created on race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation creates—and it is the theme of the 
government—aboriginal self-government that is more based on the 
municipal model.  It so happens because aboriginal affairs is a 
federal responsibility rather than a provincial responsibility 
that we will not have a provincial government between the federal 
government and the municipality.  In essence we would have the 
federal government and the municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there has been a great misuse of language in the 
debate.  For instance, we are always talking about first nations. 
Sometimes I find it quite deplorable when witnesses appear before 
the aboriginal affairs committee and talk about their first 
nations versus Canada.  That is the kind of rhetoric I would 
expect from the Parti Quebecois in Quebec which actually talks 
about separating from Canada.  I find that unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a misuse of words because the vast majority of aboriginal 
peoples I know who appear before our committee are very much 
Canadian.  They want a sense of management of their own affairs 
just in the same way as the people in my communities of Dundas, 
Ancaster and Hamilton, or in the province for that matter if we 
take another step up in the communities of communities that make 
up Canada, want a sense of personal identity in the immediate 
territory around them.  We want to have some say in our lives in 
that context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what the government is trying to achieve by 
its aboriginal self-government programs.  It is not trying to 
create sovereign states.  It is trying to create communities that 
manage their own affairs in the same way as municipalities do and 
in another way as provinces do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are embarking on uncharted territory.  We still do not know 
for certain how the experiments we have already done are working. 
We cannot leave it for decades and centuries to attempt to 
address the very legitimate need of the various communities of 
Canada to feel they are in control of their own destinies as 
individuals.  We have to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation may have flaws.  What legislation that comes 
before the House does not have flaws?  If legislation did not 
have flaws the opposition would not need to exist.  There would 
be no need for debate.  Legislation has problems and we have to 
discuss them as mature representatives of the various parts of 
Canada that have sent us to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found one area of concern.  While members opposite have 
expressed themselves sometimes eloquently, I am sure they have 
found other areas of concern.  I read in what they say that they 
are not ambiguous at all with respect to the legislation. Members 
across the floor are saying that they believe in Bill C-49 in 
principle, but they do not agree with the detail and need 
reassurance.  I urge them to support the bill, get it to 
committee, get those witnesses before the committee, hear those 
witnesses and then decide on the future of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to give people who need a sense of self-identity a 
chance to have that self-identity as soon as possible we should 
move forward with this and other legislation like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid that the time for 
questions and comments is so close to over that by the time the 
hon. member got half a question out it would be over, so I will 
resume debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Economy of words is something that is in 
my repetoire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will get a chance 
later this afternoon, I have no doubt. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
please to speak to Bill C-49. People have explained what the 
legislation says.  Reform MPs have expressed their concerns about 
it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My debate on the legislation will focus on the aspect that the 
legislation will give more power to chiefs and councils without 
first ensuring an increased level of accountability.  When I 
speak about improved accountability I am talking about the area 
of fiscal accountability.  In other words, the people on the 
reserves should know where the money comes from, how it is being 
spent and get the chance to have some input into how it should be 
spent.  I am also talking about democratic accountability, 
starting with having fair elections and having some way of 
ensuring that elections are fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason alone I cannot support the legislation and I 
will not support it.  In fact I will do everything I can to 
prevent the bill from passing, including supporting the amendment 
to postpone the bill for six months so we can debate it, improve 
it and make it something we can support.  I support the amendment 
to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about something that happened over the past year 
which led me to know that my party and I and the government 
should not support legislation like the legislation before us. 
About a year ago I started representing the new Lakeland 
constituency.  About two-thirds of the Vegreville and Beaver 
River constituencies were put together into one constituency.  I 
had no reserves in the Vegreville constituency but eight reserves 
become a part of my Beaver River constituency.  As soon as that 
happened I started getting phone calls from aboriginal people 
both on and off reserve expressing their concerns.  Some of the 
calls were very disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first ones I remember was from a man who said he was 
a grandfather of several grandchildren.  He lived in a 
two-bedroom house in which were living 27 members of his family. 
He said they could not live like that.  It was so crowded that 
the house was falling apart.  They could not go on like that. The 
chief and council on the reserve would do nothing to try to 
improve the house or to provide housing that better suited their 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In pursuing this matter I found that the chief, council and 
families in the inner group were living in wonderful houses. Many 
drove new cars.  They seemed to have money.  Then people started 
telling me exactly what was happening, that the money was not 
getting to the people on that reserve who needed it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After receiving literally dozens of these calls, after about a 
year I decided that as the member of parliament I would try to do 
something about it.  I did not really know what to do.  I started 
by going to the local native friendship centres and speaking with 
the people.  I asked what we could do.  They expressed the 
desperate need for something to be done.  They said that things 
were getting worse.  They had been getting worse over the last 30 
years.  They were in a crisis situation.  The things I heard were 
not uncommon to us.  We hear them all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got a group of about 20 aboriginal people together at a native 
friendship centre in one of our towns and asked them what we 
could do.  We decided to set up a small task force that would not 
study for years but would listen to the concerns of the 
aboriginal people in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We started with four aboriginal members and me on the task 
force.  One member left shortly after so we had three aboriginal 
people and me.  We went through a three step process.  We started 
by meeting confidentially with people who would come to the 
friendship centres in the various communities around the 
constituency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT39"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT39"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to 55 people in this confidential way.  Many said 
that even by coming to the centres they risked some action being 
taken against them by the chiefs and councils of their reserves. 
They were at a point where they were willing to accept that risk 
because somebody had to do something to try to change the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget in my lifetime what I heard from these 
people.  I heard articulate people express their concerns about 
what was happening.  They gave the task force recommendations as 
to what they thought should happen.  It was am experience I will 
truly never forget.  I am thankful to those people, some of whom 
I believe are my friends now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second phase was to put out a questionnaire in the area, on 
the reserves and in the towns near the reserves.  I did that and 
received over 50 responses.  The third phase was to hold public 
meetings.  I held three public meetings in the constituency.  The 
largest meeting was in St. Paul with about 70 aboriginals in 
attendance.  It is the town nearest to two of the reserves. That 
was the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the task force members to acknowledge the time 
and the money they contributed on their own.  None of them have 
much money but I had no way of covering their expenses.  They had 
to cover the costs themselves and they were willing to do that. 
They gladly did that because they believed that finally somebody 
would listen to their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were three aboriginal people on the task force and me. 
There was Agnes Gendron who works at the Grand Centre Canadian 
Native Friendship Centre as the children's first family outreach 
worker.  She has worked as a social worker for at least 20 years. 
In fact she worked for the department of Indian affairs for 
several years so she knows what goes on there.  She understood 
very well some of the problems within the department and some of 
the problems with the Indian Act that were preventing change from 
happening, change which must happen to improve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second member was Gina Russell from the Cold Lake First 
Nation.  She also works at the friendship centre in Cold Lake. 
She has contributed her time to the youth justice committee, to 
victims services and to the Lakeland Native Parents Education 
Committee.  Gina is presently the director of the Grand Centre 
Canadian Native Friendship Centre which is one of the few 
non-funded native friendship centres in Canada.  It gets no 
government money and it is doing good work.  I commend both these 
women for the work they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third member was Ralph Whitford from Lac La Biche, a town 
council member who understands well how municipal politics works. 
He had great input in our discussions of what type of government 
would work on reserves.  He has an incredible background.  I will 
just mention a few things.  Ralph has held several senior 
community positions including director of Beaver Lake Wah-Pow 
Detoxification and Treatment Centre.  He was a member and 
supervisor of the Lac La Biche-St. Paul District Native 
Counselling Services of Alberta and he is now actively working as 
a member of Awasisak and Family Development Circle Association. 
His background is absolutely noteworthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to mention all these people who agreed to give their 
time to become members of the task force.  They wanted to try to 
do something valuable for the people they care so much about, 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about why I initiated the task force. 
I have talked about the three stages that were involved in this 
process that we went through and I have talked about the members 
of the task force.  We heard many concerns and complaints.  Many 
were aimed at chiefs and councils.  Some were aimed at the 
community outside of the reserve and many were aimed at the 
department of Indian affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people got beyond that.  They gave us recommendations for 
change that would improve the system. That is what I want to 
focus on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were nine recommendations the task force accepted and put 
in the report which we presented to the minister of Indian 
affairs in September.  The task force met with the minister and I 
will talk about that at the end of my presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to first talk about five of the nine 
recommendations.  They are the five that deal with 
accountability, really the lack of accountability on reserves 
now.  In category one we talked about financial accountability. 
The first recommendation is the government must enforce more 
comprehensive and transparent financial reporting by band and 
settlement administrators.  This information must be freely 
available to all members and to the general public.  This 
recommendation, as did all of the others, came from the 
aboriginal grassroots people we heard from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These recommendations are not all supported by Reform policy.  I 
do not support completely all the recommendations. But I was not 
there to put a Reform platform into this process. What I was 
there for was to hear from the people, what they thought could be 
done to improve things for themselves and for the people they 
care about, aboriginal people in the constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the first recommendation.  There are some notable 
quotes we have in this report from people who spoke to this 
issue.  I will read one from Charles Favel from Saddle Lake 
reserve: “Nobody on the reserve is told how much funding is 
received from Indian affairs.  As a result, administrators on 
some reserves and settlements are able to show favouritism in 
distribution of funds”.  That was heard from several 
participants.  Mr. Favel went on to say: “All the money benefits 
are certain family groups.  Some living conditions on the reserve 
are so bad they are not even fit for an animal.  Yet some 
families that benefit from the funding drive new cars, have new 
homes and have new clothes”.  Mr. Favel in his presentation 
spelled it out about as clearly as one can. The way the money is 
spent on his reserve is not right at all.  The money is not 
getting to the people most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second recommendation, again in the area of fiscal 
accountability, is that to ensure sound financial management on 
reserves and settlements the government must provide better 
financial management support for aboriginal councillors and 
administrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many chiefs, councillors and administrators really do not have 
the knowledge they need and the understanding they need to 
properly account for the money they handle and which is being 
spent.  They made no excuse for this.  They said that does not 
mean they should not be held accountable for improper spending, 
because they understand when the spending is improper.  But they 
need help to properly account for funding.  They ask for that 
help to come from the department of Indian affairs, which makes 
sense.  They said it is not coming now. Part of the help they 
need is very clear guidelines that really put in place 
responsible accounting for the money being spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote one of the participants on this recommendation: 
“Problems on reserves are the outgrowth of a system that at one 
time prevented people from leaving reserves and at one time 
starved them”.  This is from George Forsyth from the Onion Lake 
Band.  “You can't go from a system where people are watched over 
every minute to one where they are totally on their own and 
expect perfect accountability”.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an individual who was mad as heck at his chief and 
council, but he acknowledged that it was hard to move from the 
one system to the other quickly.  He said it was insanity to move 
to more self-government before the proper fiscal accountability 
is in place.  This is exactly what this piece of legislation is 
doing. He made it very clear that he wanted no part of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation, again in the area of fiscal 
accountability, is the government, together with councillors and 
administrators, must ensure there are effective, regular and 
ongoing consultations with band and settlement members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One participant on this issue said the solution may be to 
require band meetings where the people approve a forecast budget. 
This person, who previously worked in an administrative role 
with a band outside of Lakeland, said the crucial process was not 
yet in place on that reserve.  This is how people reacted to that 
concept being presented to them.  He said: “You should have seen 
the administrators' faces the first time I brought up the idea. 
They said `it is not normal that you should have people 
discussing how the money might be spent”'.  That is how out of 
touch the people on his reserve were with this concept of 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget a meeting held in St. Paul attended by 65 to 
70 participants. All but about five were aboriginal people. I was 
clearly getting the message they were concerned about the 
movement toward self-government.  I heard it so much that I 
finally had to ask a question.  This was a meeting recorded by 
two television cameras.  I asked how many of the people at this 
meeting would support moving toward self-government on their 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As no hands went up on the question I wondered if they 
understood the question.  I then put the question another way: 
“How many of you here are against any further movement toward 
self-government until the problems of fiscal accountability and 
electoral accountability are dealt with?” Only one person was in 
favour of any further movement to self-government before the 
accountability was in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That person then said that the reason she put her hand up was 
because she did not know what I meant by self-government.  My 
response to her was good point.  The definition really has not 
been put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that came up at this meeting was when someone 
said: “Ron Irwin sent a memo out to reserves saying that no one 
would be forced to take self-government until everyone was 
ready”.  They are concerned that is not what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just gone through the three recommendations having to do 
with fiscal accountability.  I will have another chance at third 
reading to talk about the electoral accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the task force members met with the minister of Indian 
affairs she said “we have heard all this stuff before, it has 
been in the various commissions we have heard from before, this 
is not new”.  I said “so why haven't you done something about 
it?” The other task force members reinforced that.  I said let 
us take one bite sized chunk.  Let us take one of the 
recommendations that came under the democratic accountability 
thing, let us have Elections Canada monitor elections on 
reserves.  This was very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response to this was “There are some chiefs and 
councils who do not support that concept.  We have been talking 
about it.  Until I have the support of all chiefs and councils I 
cannot move forward with that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this government will not move forward with anything if 
it is waiting for the support of every last chief and council 
because many of these things will make it so that it will have to 
act in a responsible and accountable way in governing on the 
reserves.

Speaker, I compliment my colleague on such an excellent speech. 
I know it is a bit of an oxymoron but I hope there was a 
thoughtful Liberal listening to what my colleague had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wentworth—Burlington posed some questions with 
regard to lack of transparency being a concern. That certainly is 
a concern with this legislation and it is a concern in terms of 
all kinds of current Indian Act legislation and policy from the 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially many of the things that are done now are tantamount 
to giving a blank cheque not only in terms of money but in terms 
of issues.  Bill C-49 gives essentially a blank cheque to these 
14 band councils in terms of marital assets and marital splits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement creates no protocol.  It leaves an absolute void 
in terms of how these local governments are to deal with 
municipal governments on servicing agreements and all those 
things. There needs to be protocol.  That has been pointed out 
for the last two years.  There is no change to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is thought about rushing this legislation to committee 
because somehow at committee it can be fixed.  There has been 
about $10 million invested in this piece of legislation through 
government initiatives since the Tory years and it is still not 
right because of a philosophical problem.  It has nothing to do 
with what should be here.  It is philosophical. Committees will 
not fix it as long as they are Liberal dominated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also no protocol for what happens when third party 
interests are affected as a consequence of this legislation, and 
there needs to be.   Those are three obvious ones.  The sixth 
month hoist is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for his questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the issue of transparency, I have eight reserves 
in my constituency.  We also had people participating from four 
Métis settlements. In every single case there were many concerns 
expressed about a lack of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One person who participated said that the concept of actually 
fully disclosing and then having discussion among the band 
members as to how money should be spent was foreign to him. He 
said they had never heard anything like that before.  Clearly 
transparency is not there now.  There is no insurance that it 
will be there under the current rules, and the rules that are 
there are not enforced.  That is something that was made very 
clear again and again.  That is something that has to start 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to make meaningful change and if the government 
really wants to move in the direction of more self-government, 
giving more control over their own destiny to aboriginal people, 
then we have to ensure through tough guidelines that are 
enforced that there is transparency.  That has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is complete folly moving toward giving any more power to 
chiefs and councils before that happens.  What we have to do 
first is have the accountability, the transparency, then move 
toward giving aboriginal people more control over their own 
destiny in a way that they really want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-208, an act to amend the 
Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the hon. member for Brampton 
West—Mississauga for bringing this legislation forward.  It is a 
tribute to her efforts that we are debating a private member's 
bill at this advanced stage of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the Liberals will be more co-operative with opposition 
parties in the House to ensure that private member's business is 
treated in a better manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that the Access to Information Act does not 
have enough teeth.  Even the former information commissioner has 
said so in his most recent report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note, I would also like to take this opportunity to 
belatedly congratulate the hon. John Reid, a former member of 
this House, on his appointment as the new information 
commissioner.  I am pleased that my colleague, the House Leader 
for the Progressive Conservative Party, was able to facilitate 
the appointment of a qualified, hard working person such as Mr. 
Reid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 would create an offence for a person who denies the 
right of access under the Access to Information Act, who 
destroys, mutilates or alters a record, who falsifies a record, 
who makes a false entry in a record or who does not keep required 
records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As amended by the justice committee, Bill C-208 would also 
create an offence for anyone who directs, proposes or counsels 
someone to alter or destroy official records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important amendment because it extends 
responsibility to senior managers who may order someone to break 
the Access to Information Act. 
A person found guilty of this indictable offence would be liable 
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine 
not exceeding $10,000, or both.  We would have liked to see the 
maximum punishment of five years as originally proposed under 
Bill C-208 kept, but we in the House should focus on passing this 
bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, Bill C-208 remains a very simple amendment to the 
Access to Information Act that will nonetheless strengthen the 
provisions of the overall act.  For some time now Canadians have 
been losing confidence in their public institutions and 
especially in government.  Canadians need to know their federal 
government is truly working on their behalf and truly working 
well, otherwise people feel that both their votes and their taxes 
are wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act is one of the tools for the public 
to achieve that objective and this amendment proposed in Bill 
C-208 is simply helping to make the law more complete.  The 
amendment would give more visibility, more access and more teeth 
to the Access to Information Act by including strong penalties 
for those who do their utmost to prevent its application.  This 
is not to say that more could have been done to improve the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, amendments could have been proposed to allow the 
public access to documents of the privy council which are 
currently confidential.  In fact, many other amendments 
reflecting the concerns and expectations of information 
commissioners, past and present, could have been tabled in the 
same manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a reflection of this bill or the bill's sponsor, the 
hon. member for Brampton West—Mississauga, but it is a 
reflection on the Liberal government that is obsessed with 
keeping secrets and covering up instead of being open and 
straightforward with Canadians.  On the other hand, it was the 
Right Hon. Joe Clark during his tenure as prime minister who 
first acted on a longstanding call for an Access to Information 
Act.  His Progressive Conservative government introduced such 
legislation in 1979. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Liberals and the NDP, out of their partisan 
interests, defeated that government and the bill died on the 
order paper.  Several more years would pass until the legislation 
was reintroduced and took effect.  Thankfully, Mr. Clark is 
returning to the scene and will no doubt bring the same fresh and 
innovative ideas to change government for the betterment of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, I am 
pleased to support Bill C-208.  I encourage all members to do so. 
We believe it is a step forward in opening up the government to 
more public scrutiny and in giving Canadians a stronger sense of 
public control and identity with their public institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government follows the example of the member for 
Brampton West—Mississauga and introduces more comprehensive 
amendments to the Access to Information Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is really an honour and a pleasure today to rise and first of 
all congratulate my colleague, the member for Brampton 
West—Mississauga, on Bill C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House will know, it takes a combination of 
initiative and perseverance to get a private member's bill to 
third reading, and I congratulate her for that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before providing details on the bill, I want to make it clear 
that the Minister of Justice supports Bill C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee recently reviewed the bill and, after 
making some necessary amendments, it unanimously supported its 
passage. I take this opportunity to thank all the members of the 
justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members of the House will follow the example set by 
the justice committee and will vote in favour of Bill C-208, 
regardless of their political affiliation. 
I say this because, in my opinion, this bill is crucial for 
Canada and for Canadians, and should therefore get the unanimous 
support of this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without doubt, Bill C-208 is short but its importance greatly 
exceeds its length.  The bill would add an offence to the Access 
to Information Act.  The offence proposed in the bill would apply 
to anyone who, with the intent to deny a right of access under 
the Access to Information Act, destroys, mutilates, alters, 
falsifies or conceals a record or makes a false record.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offence would also apply to someone who directs, counsels or 
causes anyone to do so.  This last aspect is important because it 
means that a person will not be able to escape the offence by 
telling someone else, a subordinate, for example, to do the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was first discussed in the House, I on behalf of 
the Minister of Justice expressed reservations regarding the 
penalty that the hon. member for Brampton West—Mississauga had 
put in the original version of her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one of the main issues discussed by the committee.  I 
am pleased to report, as I said earlier in the other official 
language, that the committee unanimously adopted the amendment of 
the hon. member for Brampton West—Mississauga.  It was agreed 
that the offence should be made a hybrid offence rather than a 
straight indictable offence.  This means that the crown has the 
flexibility to proceed against an accused person, either by way 
of indictment or by way of a summary proceeding. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flexibility I am referring to is required because the 
indictment procedure is more complicated and, therefore, summary 
conviction is simpler and more direct. This flexibility also 
applies to the possible maximum penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee decided that, if a person is prosecuted by way of 
indictment, the maximum penalty should be five years 
imprisonment or a $10,000 fine, or both. If a person is 
prosecuted by way of summary conviction, then the maximum 
penalty should be six months imprisonment or a $5,000 fine, or 
both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into the purpose of Bill C-208 and generally what 
it provides for, I would like to take a moment to share some 
general information with the hon. members of this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been the beneficiaries of a federal Access to 
Information Act since 1983.  It is not to say that this act could 
not be improved upon and brought more up to date.  In fact we 
have an example of it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be confident that the government will not ignore 
the issue.  For a decade and a half Canadians have enjoyed a high 
level of access to government information.  It is worth pointing 
out that Canada is only one of a handful of countries that has 
such legislation.  For example, England does not yet have access 
to information legislation although Mr. Blair's government has 
issued a position paper in favour of creating it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this legislation, only specific and limited exceptions may 
be invoked by the government for refusing to allow access to 
information.  In such cases, the legislation gives individuals 
the right to file a complaint with the information commissioner 
and to have the government's decision reviewed by the federal 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Access to Information Act is to help citizens 
play their rightful role in a free and democratic society. 
Unfortunately, in some societies, citizens do not have such 
rights and therefore have no means by which they can call their 
government to account. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the justice committee first considered Bill C-208 in May of 
this year it asked the hon. member for Brampton West—Mississauga 
to state the purpose of her bill.  She declared that her bill was 
about accountability.  It is important to note that on the 
relationship between the Access to Information Act and 
accountability the Supreme Court of Canada is in agreement with 
the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has so far decided only one case involving the 
Access to Information Act and therein the court wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overarching purpose of access to information legislation is 
to facilitate democracy by helping to ensure that citizens have 
the information required to participate meaningfully in the 
democratic process and that politicians and bureaucrats remain 
accountable to the citizenry. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that Canadians are lucky to have the Access to 
Information Act but, on closer examination, this legislation is 
not as flawless as it seems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important omission has been identified with respect to the 
protection it affords: as things now stand, there is no penalty 
for deliberately altering or destroying a file.  The former 
information commissioner had already pointed this out.  In fact, 
he recommended that an offence relating to the destruction of 
documents be added to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law makes obstruction of the information commissioner an 
offence, and if there is any information relating to the 
commission of any offence against any law of Canada or a 
province on the part of any officer or employee of a government 
institution, the information commissioner may disclose this to 
the Attorney General of Canada.  The bill before us today 
remedies that shortcoming.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply cannot have a situation in Canada in which people can 
with impunity completely block accountability by destroying 
documents to thwart access.  Bill C-208 would prevent this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I wish to say that the Minister of Justice fully supports 
Bill C-208. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this afternoon at report stage of Bill C-208, an 
act to amend the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to begin by commending the bill.  I would also like to 
commend my colleague from Brampton West—Mississauga for working 
hard in introducing this bill and all parties for supporting Bill 
C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has arrived for parliament to ensure that actions with 
the intent to deny access to information through destruction, 
falsification or concealment of records are penalized.  Clearly, 
manipulation of documents in this manner is not an acceptable 
operating principle.  The issue of increasing the accountability 
of those denying access to information through the behaviour 
outlined in Bill C-208 is essential.  Accountability is the 
essence of Bill C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-208, this parliament has before it an important 
private member's bill.  The fact that Bill C-208, a private 
member's bill, has come this far is a testament to the worthiness 
of its content and intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe most Canadians want record abusers stopped and 
penalties enacted for abusers that include fines and jail terms. 
Bill C-208 ensures this outcome.  As a consequence of ensuring 
accountability, this bill will forge better public trust and 
assurance.  I urge this House not to let the opportunity provided 
for in Bill C-208 to pass by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Canada is one of only a dozen countries throughout 
the world with access to information legislation.  Bill C-208 
demonstrates the Canadian resolve to offer access to information 
in an accountable and open manner.  Strengthening the Access to 
Information Act through Bill C-208 illustrates Canada's approach 
that is unique to most of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 provides for prosecution of an individual by way of 
indictment or summary conviction.  This legal flexibility permits 
greater possibilities for prosecution thereby making the Access 
to Information Act more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In strengthening the Access to Information Act, Bill C-208 
strengthens democracy in Canada.  Individuals scheming to 
manipulate records from public access need to be called to 
account for their actions.  This is the basis of Bill C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of this legislation will be to this parliament's credit. 
It will be remembered as yet another instance when parliament 
endeavoured to protect and benefit Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support this bill. I urge all colleagues in the House 
to do the same.
